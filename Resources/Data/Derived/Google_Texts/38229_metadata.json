Co3 Systems' Bruce Schneier explains on the News Hub with Geoff Rogow. Photo: Getty\n\nEarlier this month, a mysterious group that calls itself Guardians of Peace hacked into Sony Pictures Entertainment\u2019s computer systems and began revealing many of the Hollywood studio\u2019s best-kept secrets, from details about unreleased movies to embarrassing emails (notably some racist notes from Sony SNE 0.22 % bigwigs about President Barack Obama\u2019s presumed movie-watching preferences) to the personnel data of employees, including salaries and performance reviews. The Federal Bureau of Investigation now says it has evidence that North Korea was behind the attack, and Sony Pictures pulled its planned release of \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a satire targeting that country\u2019s dictator, after the hackers made some ridiculous threats about terrorist violence.\n\nYour reaction to the massive hacking of such a prominent company will depend on whether you\u2019re fluent in information-technology security. If you\u2019re not, you\u2019re probably wondering how in the world this could happen. If you are, you\u2019re aware that this could happen to any company (though it is still amazing that Sony made it so easy).\n\nTo understand any given episode of hacking, you need to understand who your adversary is. I\u2019ve spent decades dealing with Internet hackers (as I do now at my current firm), and I\u2019ve learned to separate opportunistic attacks from targeted ones.\n\nYou can characterize attackers along two axes: skill and focus. Most attacks are low-skill and low-focus\u2014people using common hacking tools against thousands of networks world-wide. These low-end attacks include sending spam out to millions of email addresses, hoping that someone will fall for it and click on a poisoned link. I think of them as the background radiation of the Internet.\n\nHigh-skill, low-focus attacks are more serious. These include the more sophisticated attacks using newly discovered \u201czero-day\u201d vulnerabilities in software, systems and networks. This is the sort of attack that affected Target, J.P. Morgan Chase and most of the other commercial networks that you\u2019ve heard about in the past year or so.\n\nBut even scarier are the high-skill, high-focus attacks\u2014the type that hit Sony. This includes sophisticated attacks seemingly run by national intelligence agencies, using such spying tools as Regin and Flame, which many in the IT world suspect were created by the U.S.; Turla, a piece of malware that many blame on the Russian government; and a huge snooping effort called GhostNet, which spied on the Dalai Lama and Asian governments, leading many of my colleagues to blame China. (We\u2019re mostly guessing about the origins of these attacks; governments refuse to comment on such issues.) China has also been accused of trying to hack into the New York Times NYT -0.50 % in 2010, and in May, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the indictment of five Chinese military officials for cyberattacks against U.S. corporations.\n\nThis category also includes private actors, including the hacker group known as Anonymous, which mounted a Sony-style attack against the Internet-security firm HBGary Federal, and the unknown hackers who stole racy celebrity photos from Apple\u2019s iCloud and posted them. If you\u2019ve heard the IT-security buzz phrase \u201cadvanced persistent threat,\u201d this is it.\n\nThere is a key difference among these kinds of hacking. In the first two categories, the attacker is an opportunist. The hackers who penetrated Home Depot\u2019s networks didn\u2019t seem to care much about Home Depot; they just wanted a large database of credit-card numbers. Any large retailer would do.\n\nBut a skilled, determined attacker wants to attack a specific victim. The reasons may be political: to hurt a government or leader enmeshed in a geopolitical battle. Or ethical: to punish an industry that the hacker abhors, like big oil or big pharma. Or maybe the victim is just a company that hackers love to hate. (Sony falls into this category: It has been infuriating hackers since 2005, when the company put malicious software on its CDs in a failed attempt to prevent copying.)\n\nLow-focus attacks are easier to defend against: If Home Depot\u2019s systems had been better protected, the hackers would have just moved on to an easier target. With attackers who are highly skilled and highly focused, however, what matters is whether a targeted company\u2019s security is superior to the attacker\u2019s skills, not just to the security measures of other companies. Often, it isn\u2019t. We\u2019re much better at such relative security than we are at absolute security.\n\nThat is why security experts aren\u2019t surprised by the Sony story. We know people who do penetration testing for a living\u2014real, no-holds-barred attacks that mimic a full-on assault by a dogged, expert attacker\u2014and we know that the expert always gets in. Against a sufficiently skilled, funded and motivated attacker, all networks are vulnerable. But good security makes many kinds of attack harder, costlier and riskier. Against attackers who aren\u2019t sufficiently skilled, good security may protect you completely.\n\nIt is hard to put a dollar value on security that is strong enough to assure you that your embarrassing emails and personnel information won\u2019t end up posted online somewhere, but Sony clearly failed here. Its security turned out to be subpar. They didn\u2019t have to leave so much information exposed. And they didn\u2019t have to be so slow detecting the breach, giving the attackers free rein to wander about and take so much stuff.\n\nFor those worried that what happened to Sony could happen to you, I have two pieces of advice. The first is for organizations: take this stuff seriously. Security is a combination of protection, detection and response. You need prevention to defend against low-focus attacks and to make targeted attacks harder. You need detection to spot the attackers who inevitably get through. And you need response to minimize the damage, restore security and manage the fallout.\n\nThe time to start is before the attack hits: Sony would have fared much better if its executives simply hadn\u2019t made racist jokes about Mr. Obama or insulted its stars\u2014or if their response systems had been agile enough to kick the hackers out before they grabbed everything.\n\nMy second piece of advice is for individuals. The worst invasion of privacy from the Sony hack didn\u2019t happen to the executives or the stars; it happened to the blameless random employees who were just using their company\u2019s email system. Because of that, they\u2019ve had their most personal conversations\u2014gossip, medical conditions, love lives\u2014exposed. The press may not have divulged this information, but their friends and relatives peeked at it. Hundreds of personal tragedies must be unfolding right now.\n\nThis could be any of us. We have no choice but to entrust companies with our intimate conversations: on email, on Facebook, FB 0.16 % by text and so on. We have no choice but to entrust the retailers that we use with our financial details. And we have little choice but to use cloud services such as iCloud and Google GOOGL 0.69 % Docs.\n\nSo be smart: Understand the risks. Know that your data are vulnerable. Opt out when you can. And agitate for government intervention to ensure that organizations protect your data as well as you would. Like many areas of our hyper-technical world, this isn\u2019t something markets can fix.\n\n\u2014Mr. Schneier, a security technologist, is a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School and the chief technology officer of Co3 Systems, Inc., an IT-security firm.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2014-12-19T15:25:00.000Z", "article.section": "Life and Style", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "The information-technology security lessons of the broad cyberattack on Sony.", "title": "Sony Made It Easy, but Any of Us Could Get Hacked", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GC014_hackin_G_20141218142737.jpg", "alt": "Sony made it easy, but any of us could get hacked", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GC014_hackin_D_20141218142737.jpg"}, "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB10972589309364634370204580343050532969046&headline=Sony%20made%20it%20easy%2C%20but%20any%20of%20us%20could%20get%20hacked&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10972589309364634370204580343050532969046"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "computer security,guardians of peace,hacking,information-technology security,internet hackers,sony hack,sony pictures entertainment,Sony Pictures Entertainment,6758.TO,Sony,Google,GOOGL,New York Times,NYT,Facebook,FB,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,workers pay,political,general news,national security,crime,courts,computer crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,military action,essay (discontinued from 13th january 2015),computers,consumer electronics,electronic consumer goods,motion pictures,sound recording,cinema film production,media,entertainment,motion pictures recording,publishing,technology", "news_keywords": "computer security,guardians of peace,hacking,information-technology security,internet hackers,sony hack,sony pictures entertainment,Sony Pictures Entertainment,6758.TO,Sony", "article.headline": "Sony made it easy, but any of us could get hacked", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GC014_hackin_E_20141218142737.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GC014_hackin_D_20141218142737.jpg"}}, "description": "The information-technology security lessons of the broad cyberattack on Sony.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB10972589309364634370204580343050532969046&headline=Sony%20made%20it%20easy%2C%20but%20any%20of%20us%20could%20get%20hacked&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10972589309364634370204580343050532969046", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "article.page": "Life and Style", "article.emb": "video_emb", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.summary": "The information-technology security lessons of the broad cyberattack on Sony.", "page.site": "wsj", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-12-19T15:25:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-f264", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"internal_link_count": 10, "video_count": 1, "embed_count": 1, "word_count": 1195, "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The information-technology security lessons of the broad cyberattack on Sony.", "title": "Sony Made It Easy, but Any of Us Could Get Hacked", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/sony-made-it-easy-but-any-of-us-could-get-hacked-1419002701", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GC014_hackin_G_20141218142737.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Bruce Schneier", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "Sony Made It Easy, but Any of Us Could Get Hacked", "article.type": "Essay", "article.id": "SB10972589309364634370204580343050532969046", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-12-19T15:25:00.000Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad06\"", "article_summary": "If you are, you\u2019re aware that this could happen to any company (though it is still amazing that Sony made it so easy).\nFor those worried that what happened to Sony could happen to you, I have two pieces of advice.\nThe security hack that happened to Sony could happen to anyone.\nBut even scarier are the high-skill, high-focus attacks\u2014the type that hit Sony.\nYour reaction to the massive hacking of such a prominent company will depend on whether you\u2019re fluent in information-technology security."}
