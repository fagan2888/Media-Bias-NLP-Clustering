Ted Cruz is tied for fourth with Marco Rubio. While we will learn more about the strength and weaknesses of these candidates as the campaign progresses, one of them has a formidable asset in conservative circles all others lack.\n\nPastor Rafael Cruz, father of Ted Cruz, is a conservative, evangelical force to be reckoned with. At least that\u2019s how it looks from my seat in the front row of the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa.\n\nI sat at a corner table when the senior Cruz spoke recently to a standing room only crowd of about 60 people at a coffee shop in Knoxville, Iowa, population 7,200 (more or less). My guess is that all were Republicans, and most, if not all, are Christians in a world where they see Christian influence waning, if not under attack. Historic and current global persecution of Christians is part of their intellectual DNA, and they take this persecution personally, despite the fact that Christians in the United States are arguably the most privileged religious group in the history of the planet.\n\nAll were white, and middle- and lower-middle-class economically. Perhaps a quarter of adults in the audience \u2014 both men and women \u2014 are veterans. Most would tell you they want less government, less meddling in their lives from Washington, D.C., and from the statehouse in Des Moines. They believe Washington has created a dependent class that is taking money from their pockets, and bleeding Americans of the will to work. They see economic reality in stereotypes; e.g., Democrats as spendthrifts and Republicans as fiscally responsible, despite lots of historical evidence to the contrary.\n\nWhile most will admit privately the presidency of George W. Bush was a failure, the ideology of being conservative is bone deep. Obama is weak on terrorism and defense, Obamacare is socialism, and the world is going to hell because of liberals. Many of the folks in the audience come from humble beginnings, pulled themselves up by their clich\u00e9d bootstraps, and see themselves as successes because of the opportunities our country offered for their determination, their hard work, their family, and their faith. Their news filter is Fox News, although they might tune to MSNBC once in a while for laughs.\n\nCruz has instant credibility in this world, and during his speech he made them part of a compelling story where he, the audience, and his son Ted were partners on a shared journey where together they could save America from the abyss.\n\nBorn in Cuba in 1939, the 79-year-old Cruz has a story that reaffirms their own world view. He suffered beatings, torture, and imprisonment for his participation in the revolt against Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. He fought for Fidel Castro, and became disillusioned when he learned Castro was a communist. In 1957, at age 18, he fled Cuba with $100 sewed into his underwear to enroll as a student at the University of Texas. He received his degree in math and became a U.S. citizen in 2005.\n\nHis origin story and personal epiphany about Castro was the starting point of his speech to the crowd. And what a speech. It began quietly, and slowly raised the audience\u2019s passion until he received a standing ovation at the end. Like some of the more effective church services I have attended, it was punctuated by \u201camens,\u201d \u201cyeahs,\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s right,\u201d and other exultations by the audience. The main themes? There were two. To borrow a phrase from Hunter Thompson \u2014 Fear and loathing.\n\nTo Cruz, there are many things to fear, and many people to loathe. And he was masterful at getting us to make the connection, and used thoughtful and well-researched historical anecdotes punctuated with Bible verses, hyperbole, and passionate exaggeration sprinkled with the truth to make his points.\n\nHe began with a reference to a charismatic leader from his youth, who spoke of hope and change and who appealed to the younger Cuban generation, only to eventually betray them and their country. He repeated the phrase \u201chope and change\u201d so often I could see the iconic 2008 Obama \u201cHope\u201d poster transformed in my mind\u2019s eye to an image where Obama\u2019s portrait was replaced with one of a cigar smoking Castro.\n\nEquating Obama and Castro drew applause from the audience\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter that Castro\u2019s actual slogan and motto of the Cuban Revolution was Patria o Muerte (Homeland or Death), as it set the stage for not only fearing Obama but also loathing him as much as one might a communist dictator.\n\nAnd why not, as Cruz believes that Obama is a communist who wants to turn our nation into a communist one? There is plenty of fear and loathing for Hillary Clinton as well, and here I\u2019m going to quote Cruz directly.\n\n\u201cOur country\u2019s on the edge of a precipice. If Hillary Clinton becomes president in 2016 you can kiss this country goodbye. This country cannot survive another four years, let alone eight of these failed economic policies of this failed Obama administration. We have had the most lawless administration in the history of this country. We have an administration that tramples on the Constitution, tramples on the Declaration, tramples on the separation of powers, tramples on the rule of law, and basically is destroying this country at an accelerated pace. And I will tell you what, Hillary is no better than Obama. Hillary is a Saul Alinsky follower just like Obama. Read Alinsky\u2019s rules for radicals and the Communist Manifesto, they look identical. Alinsky was a communist and his teachings are marxist\u2026They are trying to take this country down the same road.\u201d\n\nCruz regularly reminded his audience that he and they are victims. To Cruz, and to many in his audience, Christianity is under attack from a variety of fronts.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of religious persecution in America. More specifically, we have a lot of Christian persecution in America.\u201d\n\nEven when Obama talks about his support for the freedom of worship, Cruz sees it as a repudiation of Christianity.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration has been talking about freedom of worship. Most of us don\u2019t see anything wrong with that. [But] freedom of worship and freedom of religion are two entirely different things. Freedom of worship is what you do in a house of worship. In all communist countries you have freedom of worship\u2026Obama is trying to restrict our freedom of expression in the marketplace. That is not America. America is the only country on the face of the earth that was founded on the word of God. Don\u2019t believe this garbage from Obama that this is not a Christian nation, this country was founded by Christians; was founded as a Christian nation.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s reference to Obama saying this is not a Christian nation probably refers to a 2006 speech Obama gave regarding the plurality of religions in America. Many other Christians have also interpreted Obama\u2019s remarks in a manner similar to Cruz.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The wingnut didn't fall far from the tree.
