Not just because its main character, the narcissist with moxie named Roxie Hart, is acquitted for a killing she clearly committed.\n\nIt\u2019s because the play manages to succeed wildly without all the trappings touring Broadway shows rely on to impress audiences. No sets to speak of, the smallest of costumes and hardly a prop, save the occasional pompom or reporter\u2019s notebook.\n\nWhat this show sells is its songs, and it sells them hard starting right from the top with \u201cAll That Jazz.\u201d The music and lyrics by John Kander and Fred Ebb, written in 1975, are clever and catchy, and everybody knows them by now.\n\nOf course, it sells dancing, too, with impossibly difficult, tightly constructed choreography originally created by Bob Fosse and enhanced by Ann Reinking for the current revival, which has been running in New York since 1996.\n\nAnd, finally, it sells sex. The musical\u2019s own lyrics point out the \u201cshimmy shake,\u201d but there\u2019s also the rump roll, the crotch launch and the thigh fly, and plenty of them.\n\nThose three commodities come together just right in the production now on stage at Denver\u2019s Buell Theatre. After so many days on the road, this incarnation of the play knows exactly what make a hit and lives up to the promise.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a good Roxie, you\u2019ve got a good Chicago. After all, if you\u2019re gonna root for a gal you know is guilty of murder, she\u2019s got to earn your love.\n\nThis tour has Bianca Marroquin, a tiny powerhouse of a performer who sings, taps and tells a joke with charm. She keeps the material fresh and sets a tone the cast follows.\n\nEveryone gets it and goes for it: Terra C. MacLeod as Velma, Carol Woods as the jailhouse Mama, John O\u2019Hurley as slimy lawyer Billy Flynn. Some of these people you have heard of, some not.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter: The dancers wearing next to nothing. The band set up center stage, and wailing. Chicago in the \u201920s. The music, the lyrics, the sex. This version delivers on all of that.\n\nRay Mark Rinaldi: 303-954-1540, rrinaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/rayrinaldi\n\nmusical: 3 stars. Presented by Denver Center Attractions. Music and lyrics by Johnn Kander and Fred Ebb. Book by Ebb and choreographer Bob Fosse. Broadway revival directed by Walter Bobbie.
