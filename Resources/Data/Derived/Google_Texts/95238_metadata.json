Boise began volunteering at the clinic nearly 19 years ago. By that time it had moved to a doublewide trailer at 4035 Thys Road, just north of State Road 54.\n\nIn September 2005, a $900,000 federal grant the clinic received via Pasco County helped Good Samaritan officials move to the Aspen Street building, vacant after Florida Cancer Institute built in the River Crossing area, near the then-Community Hospital.\n\nThe clinic now has five paid staff members, four grant-funded staffers and 80 volunteers, //according to CEO Melissa Fahy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way in 25 years,\u201d said Fahy, who came on board nearly nine years ago.\n\nEven with the health insurance exhanges the ACA has created, \u201cthere\u2019s still a huge need for free health care, Fahy said.\n\nEven with the ACA\u2019s federal subsidy, health insurance still remains out of reach for many people, Tina Shelton, development director for Good Samaritan, said. A woman who works as a nail technician told her health care coverage through the ACA would still cost more than she owns, Sheltobn said.\n\nSome people are taking the tax penalty when they go without health insurance, Shelton said. Good Samaritan uses 200 percent of poverty level as the cutoff threshold for eligibility for health care at the clinic. Patients must be Pasco residents and U.S. citizens.\n\nA Good Samaritan patient, Vernon Patten, said he has been retired since he lost his job at 61 and couldn\u2019t find another. \u201cI kind of got stuck in a rut between a rock and a hard place,\u201d he said.\n\nPatten and wife Karla, who also lost her job, had health insurance all their working careers. When they applied for insurance via the federal exchange, the cost was nearly $1,200 a month.\n\n\u201cGive me a break,\u201d Patten said. \u201cIdon\u2019t even make $10,000 a year. All I\u2019ve got is Social Security.\u201d\n\nPatten turned to Good Samaritan for help the past few years. He was consulting last week with Thais R. Forbes, a board certified family nurse practitioner at the clinic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re keeping an eye on my sugar level, and the neuropathy and my gout,\u201d Patten explained. \u201cKeep an eye on the blood pressure.\u201d\n\nHe has had tended to procrastinate getting health care, so Good Samaritan is keeping him on track, Patten said.\n\nPatients can sense the upbeat mood of volunteers, Fahy said. Volunteers are \u201chere because they want to be. Their hearts are in the right place. I think this place is very blessed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love the place,\u201d said Franci Lewandowski, who began volunteering about a year and a half ago. \u201cI love working with people. I love bringing health care to the underserved community. There\u2019s always work to be done. There\u2019s always patients.\u201d\n\nClifford Colin, a cardiologist at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point who volunteers at Good Samaritan, presented a gift to Fahy. The framed painting shows a monkey on the back of a smoker. Fahy pledged to hang it up on a clinic wall. \u201cWe are always trying to get our patients to quit smoking,\u201d Fahy remarked.\n\nR.N. Boise, who has been volunteering since 1996. no longer sees patients at Good Samaritan but concentrates on getting help to people referred to the clinic. Besides Good Samaritan, Boise also helps at a cold night shelter and a faith-based food pantry program in Tarpon Springs.\n\n\u201cIf you were to add up all the hours he has given us, it would be an astronomical number,\u201d Fahy said about Boise.\n\nBut it takes a lot to keep the clinic running, Fahy emphasizes.\n\nGood Samaritan uses a $470,000 operating budget. Cardiologist Stephen Goldman, founder and chairman of the Good Samaritan board, and pulmonologist Bharat Desai, the clinic\u2019s medical director, are among leaders who appreciate the mission of the clinic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really connecting all those health-care dots,\u201d Fahy said about working with specialists, offering dental care and partnering with other nonprofit agencies.\n\nA new grant in December enabled Good Samaritan to hire Shelton as the development director to raise awareness, boost an office manager to full time and bring on a board a scribe who helps doctors with health-care paperwork.\n\nThe $57,000 grant came through Florida Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, which in turn gets $4.5 million from the state.\n\nThis is the first year that Fahy presented a \u201cnon-deficit\u201d budget to the Good Samaritan board, in large part to Shelton\u2019s efforts. Lobbyists are working to renew the Good Samaritan grant from the state association each year.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s cross our fingers,\u201d Fahy said about renewal of the grant that expires at the end of June.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any federal or state funding\u201d directly to Good Samaritan, Shelton underscored.\n\nMorton Plant North Bay Foundation is Good Samaritan\u2019s largest corporate donor, at $100,000. Medical Center of Trinity also provides a lot of in-kind help.\n\nNurses Gala in May raises $65,000 to $80,000 in net proceeds. Festival of Trees at Christmas time provides about $20,000 more to the budget.\n\nPasco County last week earmarked $48,000 from federal block grant funds to Good Samaritan to help buy medicines for the pharmacy and pay for laboratory work. New pharmacy director Raj Mehta will be able to restock shelves of medicines that look relatively \u201cbarren\u201d right now, Fahy said.\n\nShelton has spoken at a Holiday Rotary in an effort to get other business grants.\n\nCommunity groups also lend a hand. A Knights of Columbus council here raised about $500 from a fish fry for the clinic. Hacienda Village Mobile Home Park staged a senior talent show to donate $1,000 to Good Samaritan.\n\nGood Samaritan in recent years has logged a marginal decrease in the number of patients visits, but an increase in people applying for help, Fahy said. \u201cLower numbers, but they\u2019re coming to us sicker.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are still miles to go,\u201d Fahy wrote in the clinic\u2019s newsletter. \u201cWe have left a footprint in the sand in Pasco County. Please join us in making a difference to these folks that just need a helping hand.\u201d\n\ncorth@suncoastnews.com\n\n(727) 815-1068", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Fri, 03 Apr 2015 15:37:42 -0400", "Description": "NEW PORT RICHEY \u2014 When the federal Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010,  the people who run the at Good Samaritan Health Clinic of Pasco  wondered if there would even be a need for the fre", "og": {"description": "NEW PORT RICHEY \u2014 When the federal Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010,  the people who run the at Good Samaritan Health Clinic of Pasco  wondered if there would even be a need for the fre", "title": "Good Samaritan clinic to celebrate 25th anniversary", "url": "http://www.suncoastnews.com/su/list/news-pasco/good-samaritan-clinic-to-celebrate-25th-anniversary-20150403/", "image": {"width": 1800, "identifier": "http://www.suncoastnews.com/storyimage/SU/20150403/ARTICLE/150409968/EP/1/6/EP-150409968.jpg", "height": 1350}, "updated_time": "2015-04-03T15:54:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "suncoastnews.com", "title": "Good Samaritan clinic to celebrate 25th anniversary", "image": "http://www.suncoastnews.com/storyimage/SU/20150403/ARTICLE/150409968/AR/0/AR-150409968.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "NEW PORT RICHEY \u2014 When the federal Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010,  the people who run the at Good Samaritan Health Clinic of Pasco  wondered if there would even be a need for the f"}, "fb": {"app_id": 437550169655494}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-04-03T15:37:42Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-04-03T15:54:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f7e\"", "article_summary": "As next week\u2019s 25th anniversary event attests, Good Samaritan Clinic still fills the needs of many low-income residents who can\u2019t afford health insurance but don\u2019t qualify for government health coverage such as Medicaid.\nGood Samaritan uses 200 percent of poverty level as the cutoff threshold for eligibility for health care at the clinic.\nBesides Good Samaritan, Boise also helps at a cold night shelter and a faith-based food pantry program in Tarpon Springs.\nLobbyists are working to renew the Good Samaritan grant from the state association each year.\nA Good Samaritan patient, Vernon Patten, said he has been retired since he lost his job at 61 and couldn\u2019t find another."}
