Facebook\n\nFifth grader Bella Burton, 11, doesn't go anywhere without her 131-pound Great Dane service dog named George.\n\nThe New York Daily News reports the two have been together since Bella's Morquio syndrome (MS) forced her to use crutches or a wheelchair to get around last year. MS \"is a rare inherited birth defect that is estimated to occur in one of every 200,000 births,\" The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia finds, with the condition generally marked by a lack of enzymes to break down materials in the body's cells.\n\nThe disease impairs bone development the most, and most children with Morquio syndrome have trouble walking by the time they're Bella\u2019s age.The Daily News added George's \"size makes him a perfect friend to lean on.\"\n\n\"I love him,\" Bella said. \"He likes to play. He helps me walk.\"\n\nBella and George have amassed over 10,000 fans on their Facebook page, which was set up after the dog moved in with the family 10 months ago. George is from the Ipswich-based Service Dog Project, where Great Danes are provided to those with mobility impairments.\n\n\"They were looking to see if a smaller dog came along, but he kind of picked her,\" Bella's mom said. \"For us, keeping her up and keeping her active has been one of the big things, because the more she's active the better it is for her condition.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "great, dane, helps, 11, year, old, girl, rare, genetic, mobility, disorder, walk, again", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An 11-year-old girl from Massachusetts is battling a rare disease, but she's\u00a0getting by with a little help from George.", "title": "Watch This Great Dane Help A Little Girl Walk Again", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/great-dane-helps-11-year-old-girl-rare-genetic-mobility-disorder-walk-again-361642", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/11/14/bella-and-george.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An 11-year-old girl from Massachusetts is battling a rare disease, but she's\u00a0getting by with a little help from George.", "title": "Watch This Great Dane Help A Little Girl Walk Again", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/great-dane-helps-11-year-old-girl-rare-genetic-mobility-disorder-walk-again-361642", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/11/14/bella-and-george.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/14/bella-and-george.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-11-14T16:26:25-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-14T16:26:25-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An 11-year-old girl from Massachusetts is battling a rare disease, but she's\u00a0getting by with a little help from George."}, "article_summary": "An 11-year-old girl from Massachusetts is battling a rare disease, but she's getting by with a little help from her service dog George.\nFacebookFifth grader Bella Burton, 11, doesn't go anywhere without her 131-pound Great Dane service dog named George.\nGeorge is from the Ipswich-based Service Dog Project, where Great Danes are provided to those with mobility impairments.\nThe New York Daily News reports the two have been together since Bella's Morquio syndrome (MS) forced her to use crutches or a wheelchair to get around last year.\n\"They were looking to see if a smaller dog came along, but he kind of picked her,\" Bella's mom said."}
