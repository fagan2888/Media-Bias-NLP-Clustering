Between 1992 and 2013, white families headed by college grads increased their wealth by 86.4 percent. College-educated Asian families grew their net worth by 89.6 percent. During the same years, the net worth of college-educated Hispanic families decreased 27.4 percent and decreased 55.6 percent among black families.\n\n\u201cHigher education alone cannot level the playing field,\u201d authors William R. Emmons and Bryan J. Noeth write.\n\nRelated: The Best Investment the U.S. Could Make \u2013 Affordable Higher Education\n\nWhile they say that further research is needed to clarify the complex reasons for the stark differences, their report highlights some possible causes. One is that black and Hispanic graduates have taken on far more in debt than their white and Asian counterparts \u2014 including student loans and, in particular, mortgages. As they accumulated that debt, the incomes of black and Hispanic grads failed to keep pace with the gains made by other groups, including blacks and Hispanics without degrees. White and Asian college graduates are also more likely than blacks and Hispanics to pursue a graduate or professional degree, which usually equates to higher earnings in the long-term and greater wealth overall.\n\nThose debt-laden black and Hispanic families then got pummeled by the bursting of the housing bubble. The average value of homes they owned fell by around 50 percent, while the average value of white college graduates\u2019 homes fell by only half as much and homes owned by college-educated Asian families gained 6 percent in value.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Although a college diploma is touted as a key factor to landing a better job and highe", "title": "College Isn\u2019t the Great Equalizer for Blacks and Hispanics, Study Shows", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/17/College-Isn-t-Great-Equalizer-Blacks-and-Hispanics-Study-Shows", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10242011_Income_Inequality_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/17/College-Isn-t-Great-Equalizer-Blacks-and-Hispanics-Study-Shows", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10242011_Income_Inequality_article.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Although a college diploma is touted as a key factor to landing a better job and highe", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "During the same years, the net worth of college-educated Hispanic families decreased 27.4 percent and decreased 55.6 percent among black families.\nCollege-educated Asian families grew their net worth by 89.6 percent.\nThose debt-laden black and Hispanic families then got pummeled by the bursting of the housing bubble.\nBetween 1992 and 2013, white families headed by college grads increased their wealth by 86.4 percent.\n\u201cWhite and Asian college-headed families generally fared much better than their less-educated counterparts,\u201d the study found."}
