When she ignored him, and went to board the bus, he yanked her by the back of the shirt causing her to drop the baby, who later died. International Business Times pointed out the whole thing was a hoax, published on The National Report, a satire news website. However, the whole hoax of a policeman \u201ckilling\u201d an infant highlights the issue of breastfeeding in public.\n\nIn the past, women have been harassed in Target, Applebee\u2019s, Wal-Mart, McDonald\u2019s, Hollister, even in church, for feeding their babies. In 2006, Emily Gillete was kicked off a flight by Freedom Airlines, attempting to nurse her baby. In Oahu, a woman was threatened to be put out of a homeless shelter for nursing her child. Even Facebook says breastfeeding photos are \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\nMoms stood up for their rights and now in all 50 states it is legal to nurse in public. The hoax of the police killing the breastfeeding infant highlights how the whole issue of breastfeeding in public is far from solved. Mothers have been put out of courtrooms and government buildings, even when completely covered. In April of this year, Andrea Zeledon-Mussio was contemplating suing the police for harassment. She was in her own vehicle nursing her baby, when she felt she was about to be arrested for breastfeeding.\n\nOn June 24, a mother attempting to take her two-week old and three-year old on a city bus was repeatedly harassed by the driver as well as the dispatcher and police boarding the bus. She knew her rights and stood up for herself. She said, \u201cAs a mother, I have the right to feed my child without being harassed.\u201d\n\nOn July 1 of this year, police escorted the family of a UN employee, Tom Neijens, out of a country club in White Plains, NY. His wife, Rosaline Remans, had begun to nurse her daughter at the table, and was asked by a staff member to \u201ccontinue in the bathroom.\u201d When the police made them leave, they said it was because they feared they could be terrorists, because of Neijen\u2019s black backpack and explained \u201cIn Sri Lanka, babies are used by terrorists.\u201d\n\nOn July 11 of this year in California, a breastfeeding mom was kicked out of a Brad Paisley concert. Officials claim they were concerned that the child could be crushed or the noise could hurt the baby\u2019s hearing. The mother argued the four-month-old was asleep and had been to concerts before. Other concert-goers told everything was fine, until complaints of breastfeeding surfaced.\n\nIn Utah, on August 10, the organizers of the Heber Valley Farmer\u2019s Market complained about a booth by the Utah Breastfeeding Coalition which allowed moms to take a break and nurse. They called the police on them. Meghan Reed, the president of the coalition, pointed out \u201cIt is World Breastfeeding Week. To be harassed while providing breastfeeding support during that week is just kind of ironic.\u201d\n\nPart of the Healthy People 2020 initiative states that the national goal is to increase breastfeeding moms to 81.9 percent by 2020. The Affordable Care Act requires employers to provide a reasonable break time for employees to express milk for their child for one year, whenever they need to express. If the company has at least 50 employees, they are required to also provide a place for breastfeeding mothers and that is not the bathroom.\n\nBreastfeeding is natural. It is easier, cheaper, and provides a host of benefits to mother, child and society are well documented. Breastfeeding operates on a supply and demand basis. The hoax of police \u201ckilling\u201d the infant of a mom breastfeeding merely highlights the broader issue of the skewed public views on breastfeeding. As one mom stated, \u201cWhy have we made the act of feeding a child something obscene instead of something necessary?\u201d Theresa Landau, of the New York City Leadership Council, says, \u201cSociety should applaud mothers who are nursing their babies, any place, any time.\u201d\n\nBy Laurie Stilwell\n\nSources:\n\nInternational Business Times UK\n\nNational Report\n\nCBS\n\nHuffington Post\n\nNY Daily News\n\nMy Daily News\n\nLivingston Daily\n\nNational Conference of State Legislatures\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "Recently an article went viral detailing how a New York policeman argued with a woman breastfeeding her baby on a city bus bench.
