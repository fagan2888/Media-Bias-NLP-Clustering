She spoke with Health News Florida Editor Mary Shedden about the year-long investigation.\n\nBARBARA PETERS SMITH: The series is called \u201cThe Kindness of Strangers\u201d -- and that\u2019s a big fear that anybody would have that instead of living with their loved ones or somebody they trust, that they would end up at the end of their lives being not just cared for by strangers but having all their decisions made by somebody who essentially doesn\u2019t know them.\n\nMARY SHEDDEN: These were individuals who were living independently, maybe, went to the hospital for an operation and then things spiraled out of control. They\u2019ve lost apartments, in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars to legal fees.\n\nSMITH: Yes, and I should say that some wards are able to live in their own homes. The (court-appointed) guardian decides what that ward can afford. When a guardian is appointed, he or she comes in and the first thing they do is have all of the mail come to them instead of the ward. Then they take over all the bank accounts. They they do an inventory and they liquidate all the assets. They sell the house, the car, everything. Then they decide how nice a place this ward can afford. Can there be home care? In some cases, there is home care, but it is not home care of the person\u2019s choosing.\n\nSHEDDEN: It truly is someone they\u2019ve never known, that they don\u2019t have relationship with, making decisions because of a family feud or because there is no one.\n\nSMITH: The Florida statutes gives preference to families as guardians. But in 2003, there were I believe there were 23 professional guardians in the state. And now there are 440. It\u2019s definitely a growth industry.\n\n--Health News Florida Editor Mary Shedden is part of WUSF Public Media in Tampa.
