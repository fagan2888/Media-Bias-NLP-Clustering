Chuck Grassley raised questions about the lack of transparency and financial mismanagement behind the original decision to remove the other white meat from prison cafeterias.\n\nIn a letter sent Thursday to the Bureau Director Charles Samuels Jr., Mr. Grassley, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, expressed concern over the \u201cham-handed\u201d decision to remove economical pork products from prison menus after tax dollars were used to conduct a survey of inmates\u2019 food preferences.\n\n\u201cPork is largely a product of the United States that provides tremendous economic benefit to the country along with being an economical food,\u201d Mr. Grassley, Iowa Republican, said in a statement. \u201cFor that reason alone, it doesn\u2019t make sense to eliminate it from prison meals, but to spend taxpayer dollars surveying prisoners about what they did or didn\u2019t like about the meals they were being served seems completely backwards.\u201d\n\nThe decision to remove pork from prison menus was made several months ago, but it only became publicly known at the beginning of the fiscal year, Mr. Grassley wrote in his letter.\n\nA spokesman for the Bureau told Mr. Grassley that the decision was made based on a survey of prisoners\u2019 food preferences that reflected pork has been the \u201clowest-rated food\u201d by inmates for several years and because pork products were too expensive to provide.\n\nIn his letter, Mr. Grassley argued that by feeding inmates pork, the bureau is benefiting the American economy because most pork products are produced in the U.S., while other proteins are more likely to be imported.\n\n\u201cThe pork industry is responsible for 547,800 jobs, which creates $22.3 billion in personal incomes and contributes $39 billion to the gross domestic product. The United States is the world\u2019s largest exporter of pork, and the third largest producer of pork. This unprecedented decision to remove pork from all federal prisons will have consequences on the livelihoods of American citizens who work in the pork industry,\u201d Mr. Grassley wrote.\n\nAlthough the decision was ultimately reversed, Mr. Grassley said there are still questions that need to be answered to clear up transparency concerns.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the quick decision after my letter to the bureau to keep pork products on prison menus. That\u2019s good news for the American economy. But, there are still questions about how the original determination was made and the cost of conducting the surveys. None of that\u2019s been answered, and it ought to be,\u201d Mr. Grassley said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Bureau of Prisons on Friday moved to put pork back on the menu at federal prisons nationwide after Sen.
