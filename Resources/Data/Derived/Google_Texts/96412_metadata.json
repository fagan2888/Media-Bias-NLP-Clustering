Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have agreed to \u201cseriously consider\u201d the ideas and possibly incorporate them into new legislation.\n\nThe campaign comes after many progressives called out President Obama and other party leaders and claimed they failed to articulate a clear agenda before the 2014 elections, which resulted in devastating defeats for Democrats, including the loss of the Senate.\n\n\u201cDemocrats lost in 2014 because they failed to inspire Americans with bold ideas that would tangibly improve people\u2019s lives. Since the election, we\u2019ve been calling on Democratic leadership to remold their party as the party of big ideas \u2014 especially bold, economic populist ideas like those Elizabeth Warren champions,\u201d said Stephanie Taylor, PCCC co-founder.\n\nThe organization will accept ideas through the end of December. After that, the PCCC says it will conduct polling and identify the 20 most popular policy suggestions and those will be submitted to Mr. Reid, Ms. Warren and other lawmakers for review.\n\nThus far, the submitted ideas include: automatic voter registration; demilitarizing police forces nationwide; ending secret grand juries for police prosecutions; national broadband; discharging student loan debt; single-payer healthcare; a financial transaction tax on Wall Street; and others.\n\nIn addition to Mr. Reid and Ms. Warren, other Democrats who have signed on to the initiative include: Sen. Jon Tester of Montana; Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York; Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota; Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota; Rep. Alan Grayson of Florida; Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas; and others.\n\nIndependent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont also has signed on.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After disastrous midterm elections for Democrats, some progressives are looking to reboot the party by injecting it with fresh \"big ideas\" and already have secured the backing of powerful party leaders in their effort.", "Author": "Ben Wolfgang", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "After disastrous midterm elections for Democrats, some progressives are looking to reboot the party by injecting it with fresh \u201cbig ideas\u201d and already have secured the backing of powerful party leaders in their effort.", "title": "Liberals seek to reboot Democratic party with \u2018Big Ideas Project\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/10/liberals-seek-reboot-democratic-party-big-ideas/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/09/senate-democratsjpeg-05f12.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/09/senate-democratsjpeg-05f12.jpg", "title": "Liberals seek to reboot Democratic party with \u2018Big Ideas Project", "description": "After disastrous midterm elections for Democrats, some progressives are looking to reboot the party by injecting it with fresh \"big ideas\" and already have secured the backing of powerful party leader", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Elizabeth Warren, Harry Reid"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd113a\"", "article_summary": "Since the election, we\u2019ve been calling on Democratic leadership to remold their party as the party of big ideas \u2014 especially bold, economic populist ideas like those Elizabeth Warren champions,\u201d said Stephanie Taylor, PCCC co-founder.\nAfter disastrous midterm elections for Democrats, some progressives are looking to reboot the party by injecting it with fresh \u201cbig ideas\u201d and already have secured the backing of powerful party leaders in their effort.\n\u201cDemocrats lost in 2014 because they failed to inspire Americans with bold ideas that would tangibly improve people\u2019s lives.\nTwenty-nine lawmakers, including outgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and progressive darling Sen.
