A handful of lucky people won't even have to get out of bed to enjoy Cedarburg's Winter Festival.

The rest of us just get to enjoy the costumed bed races cruising Washington Ave. on Saturday afternoon.

The 40th annual festival celebrates the "Snolympics" this year starting with two chili contests at 11 a.m. at the Community Center, the grand parade at 1 p.m. and a host of outdoor activities and contests Saturday and Sunday.

The Shops of Cedar Creek Settlement plan to throw open their doors to warm participants and shoppers during the event. Derek Byrne will play Irish music and songs from 1 to 4 p.m. both days. But if you can't leave the great outdoors, the Anvil Pub & Grille will host an outdoor Chili Bar and Snow Bar. As always, Cedar Creek Winery will have complimentary wine samples.
