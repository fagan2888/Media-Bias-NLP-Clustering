This would in turn throw the individual insurance market into disarray as many of these people dropped their coverage\u2014except, presumably, the sickest of people with the most incentive to keep it.\n\nThe challenge has lost twice at the federal trial court level, before a Reagan-appointed judge in Virginia and before Clinton-appointed Judge Paul Friedman in Washington, who ruled that the intent of the law was plain. \u201cPlaintiffs' proposed construction in this case\u2014that tax credits are available only for those purchasing insurance from state-run Exchanges\u2014runs counter to this central purpose of the ACA: to provide affordable health care to virtually all Americans,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuch an interpretation would violate the basic rule of statutory construction that a court must interpret a statute in light of its history and purpose.\u201d Under the challengers\u2019 logic, he added, the exchanges administered by the federal government \u201cwould have no customers, and no purpose.\u201d\n\nBut the two Republican-appointed judges hearing the appeal of Friedman\u2019s ruling today were far more sympathetic to the challengers\u2019 case. Especially receptive was Judge Raymond Randolph, a George H.W. Bush appointee who was harshly dismissive of administration lawyer Stuart Delery\u2019s arguments, to the point of being openly derisive. Countering the administration\u2019s argument that the challengers\u2019 logic would lead to absurd conclusions within the law, Randolph shrugged and said, \u201cThere is an absurdity principle, but not a stupidity principle. If the legislation is just stupid, it\u2019s not up to the court to save it.\u201d He saw no way for the government to get around the line stating that the subsidies are to be available on state-established exchanges: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got here is language that doesn\u2019t seem to be malleable in any way, shape or form.\u201d He rejected the administration\u2019s point about the IRS reporting requirements for the exchanges buttressing its case by casting those requirements as being a lesser part of the law because they were in the supplementary package that was added to the law before its final passage under the budget reconciliation process, which he dismissed as a mere \u201camendment\u201d to the law.\n\nWith the panel\u2019s lone Democratic appointee clearly sympathetic to the administration\u2019s case, the ruling will come down to Judge Thomas Griffith, a George W. Bush appointee who, while less mocking than Randolph, was also skeptical of the administration\u2019s defense. He called the legislative history around the law a \u201cwash\u201d between the two sides, undermining the administration\u2019s claim that the intent of Congress was abundantly clear. At the same time, he said the administration had a \u201cspecial burden\u201d to show that Congress intended federally-run exchanges to offer subsidies, given the \u201cplain language\u201d to the contrary in the line under dispute. \u201cIf [Congress doesn\u2019t] legislate clearly enough, is it our job to fix the problem?\u201d Griffith asked.\n\nThe ruling may not come for several months, and if the administration loses, it could seek a ruling by a full bench of the appeals court. Meanwhile, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia will soon hear an appeal of the Reagan appointee\u2019s ruling against the challenge, and there are still two trial-court level challenges pending in Oklahoma and Indiana. If the challengers start winning in one or more jurisdiction, it is not inconceivable that this case, too, could be headed up to the Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, though, the challengers were clearly feeling buoyed in Washington by their encouragement from Randolph and Griffith. And it was left to the law\u2019s supporters to note how destructive and radical it would be for judges to upend a law that is now on the verge of getting six million people covered on the new exchanges, solely on the basis of sloppy wording in a single line of the legislation. \u201cThis [argument against the subsidies] was conjured up many months after [the law] was passed,\u201d said Ron Pollack, head of Families USA, a pro-Obamacare advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty awesome thing for a court now to say that millions should lose their subsidies. It\u2019s a pretty heavy burden for a court to say we\u2019re going to take away subsidies we\u2019ve already provided, subsidies without which coverage is clearly unaffordable.\u201d\n\nRobert Weiner, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter who helped craft Pollack\u2019s amicus brief to the court, held out hope that the tough questioning from Griffith was not a fatal sign. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to ask questions at arguments. He is a judge that is known for being sensible and I think when he reflects on it, he will come to a conclusion that is sensible,\u201d he said. And common sense, he added, leaves no question that the law\u2019s authors intended the subsidies to be available on all the exchanges,since that's the only way the law would actually expand coverage. \"Congress,\" he said, \"did not have a death wish for this legislation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The Supreme Court oral arguments on the challenge by two businesses of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandates on contraception coverage have gotten the most attention today, understandably so given the import of that case for future disputes pitting claims of religious freedom against duly legislated laws.
