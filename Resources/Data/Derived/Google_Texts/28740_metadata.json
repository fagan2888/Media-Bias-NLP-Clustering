Players peeked up between bites of lunch and text messages. For Chris Harris, the videos are reruns.\n\nWhen looking for reasons Harris has gone from undrafted to being one of the NFL\u2019s best cornerbacks, the film never lies. Harris studies his opponent on his iPad during meetings, between meals and for two hours after he leaves Broncos headquarters.\n\nVideo makes him a gamer as he melds mental snapshots with underappreciated athleticism.\n\n\u201cI look at a lot of film. That\u2019s what really puts me over the edge,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhen I get to the game, the offense might try to hide a play, but I can see it. Having four years experience now, the game has slowed down.\u201d\n\nFootball becomes easier when it makes sense. Hope is not a strategy when playing cornerback. Harris wastes no energy, no movement, a shark in his pursuit of perfection. Slightly undersized at a generously listed 5-foot-10, Harris trusts his speed but believes the quickest way to best an opponent remains with his brain. He\u2019s the guy you would want on \u201cJeopardy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s wired in; it\u2019s very important to him. He\u2019s ultra-competitive in everything he does, and part of that is preparation,\u201d said Denver defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio. \u201cHe really understands what\u2019s coming, formations and splits, receiver locations, what they do with different guys \u2014 he\u2019s all over it.\u201d\n\nJust eight months removed from ACL surgery on his left knee, Harris has graded out as the NFL\u2019s second-best cornerback this season, according to Pro Football Focus. He ranks behind San Diego\u2019s Brandon Flowers and well ahead of shutdown aces Richard Sherman of Seattle and Darrelle Revis of New England.\n\n\u201cChris feels like they should be talking about him. He sees all these guys getting new contracts, and he\u2019s going to get his soon, and their numbers aren\u2019t even close to his,\u201d said Denver linebacker Von Miller. \u201cHe wears that like a sleeve. He\u2019s in attack mode. It doesn\u2019t matter who he\u2019s facing, he will man up and never back down.\u201d\n\nBut Harris doesn\u2019t star in commercials, doesn\u2019t scream in microphones and doesn\u2019t have an island named for him. He remains a secret star, the mom-and-pop restaurant the rest of the country doesn\u2019t know about.\n\n\u201cPeople might not notice, but you all here watching the last four years can tell I have been doing my job,\u201d Harris said.\n\nNo wonder he\u2019s looking forward to playing against the New York Jets on Sunday. It\u2019s a big stage made more delicious by the opportunity to go against former teammate Eric Decker after missing the Super Bowl at MetLife Stadium because of a knee injury.\n\n\u201cI know the team might have some flashbacks, but I love playing in New York,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI know (Decker) is going to be more amped. They might try to feed him the ball more. There are going to be some plays out there to be made.\u201d\n\nHarris approached his knee rehab with ferocity, procuring advice from Miller at each step. Miller realized early in Harris\u2019 recovery that he would be fine. He was early to sessions and late leaving.\n\nHarris dropped 8 pounds, down to 191, during the offseason. That left him faster. He plans to remain lighter. He played his best game last week against Arizona when he shadowed all-pro wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald \u2014 \u201cHe has that swag about him, that confidence, man,\u201d said Denver cornerback Aqib Talib \u2014 but insists it won\u2019t be his best game this season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still early from surgery. I am not playing free yet,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe knee is something that I still think about. It\u2019s still in the back of my head. It fuels me. I want to prove I am the best. Since I have been here, nobody has given me anything. I have had to work for everything. Now, people don\u2019t think that I am the same coming off my ACL (injury). So I have to show them every week.\u201d\n\nStatistics provide a compelling argument of Harris\u2019 talent. After easing into the season against the Colts, Harris has been dominant the past two games. Groomed as a slot corner, he recognizes routes quickly and reads the quarterback\u2019s slightest nuance. His teammates\u2019 testimonials are more convincing than his numbers. Ask the new Broncos whose talent surprises them, and they mention Harris.\n\nOver and over.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s amazing. He\u2019s mentally strong,\u201d said wideout Emmanuel Sanders. \u201cHe has that dog in him.\u201d\n\nSafety T.J. Ward identifies with Harris\u2019 story. Ward was a walk-on in college ball and was forced to silence doubters at every step of his career.\n\n\u201cChris is tough, physical, athletic, all the things you look for,\u201d Ward said. \u201cSometimes you stay under the radar no matter what you do. We know how good he is.\u201d\n\nA snapshot early in Harris\u2019 pro career, a 2012 game at Cincinnati, foreshadowed his stardom. Warm-ups over, Harris and Rahim Moore stood in the locker room in full uniform watching video a few minutes before kickoff.\n\nThe first 15 plays matched those on their iPads. They could barely hide their grins.\n\n\u201cChris likes to study just like me. He likes to find an advantage,\u201d Moore said. \u201cOf course it pays off. And the best film to watch is the one you star in on Sunday and they show on Monday before practice.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
