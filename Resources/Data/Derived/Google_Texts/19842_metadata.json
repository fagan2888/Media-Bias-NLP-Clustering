We binge-watched \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s still funny,\u201d my wife said afterwards.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely brilliant,\u201d I replied.\n\nI feel the need to make this point, because as Stewart prepares to hang up his spurs (and barbs), the consensus that has formed around him is that he\u2019s a national hero, an intrepid truth teller, a kind of secular prophet in an age of folly, and the first Jew perhaps worthy of canonization.\n\nAnd thus anyone who argues that Stewart might represent more troubling aspects of our age is written off as a self-righteous hater who doesn\u2019t get that he\u2019s just a comedian.\n\nSo one more time, for the trolls in back: I get that Jon Stewart is just a comedian, even if The New York Times hailed him as \u201cthe most trusted man in America\u201d and a pundit on CNN just suggested he run for president.\n\nIn fact, he\u2019s a sensational comedian with impeccable timing, a nose for hypocrisy, the courage to call out bullshit artists and the capacity to impart vast stores of data and wisdom to his audience without ever coming off as pedantic. By nearly all indications, he is also a deeply thoughtful and decent guy.\n\nWhat else can you say about someone whose next career move is to open an animal sanctuary in New Jersey?\n\nThe question haunting me is what Jon Stewart meant in the larger weave of American history.\n\nI have written elsewhere about the moral vagaries of Stewart\u2019s particular approach to satire. But how did Stewart function as a symptom of our historical moment?\n\nToday, a clear majority of our citizens\u2014of every ideological persuasion\u2014share the same disquieting suspicion: that we are somehow powerless to fix our broken civic systems.\n\nFor some, religion remains the fount of salvation. Others place their trust in the bluster of conservative demagogues, or simply lose themselves in a fog of frantic material and athletic distraction.\n\nAs for the rest of us\u2014the Troubled But Tame Majority, let\u2019s say\u2014we chose to embrace Stewart (and his various cohorts) as our moral authority. Why? Because he was the one capable of articulating the depth of our dysfunction without totally bumming us out.\n\nOn the contrary, his job was to convert this dysfunction into disposable laughs, expertly choreographed farces in which Stewart channeled our own helpless bemusement. Over a decade of watching him, we viewers came to see our political system and Fourth Estate as entertainment products rather than sacred institutions with clear moral purposes (to govern, to inform).\n\nThere were notable exceptions to this pattern, as Stewart\u2019s many defenders will cite. He was able to help push through a health care measure for first responders to 9/11. He made mincemeat out of various charlatans, most of them fellow television stars.\n\nAnd he dropped the joker\u2019s mask when confronted by horrors such as the racist murder of nine African-Americans last month in Charleston, South Carolina, though it\u2019s notable that he often stopped short of directly addressing the political roots of such horrors, in this case the power of America\u2019s gun lobby.\n\nStewart himself recognized his role as essentially therapeutic. When he was given a chance to confront figures of immense power, such as Condoleezza Rice, he tended to flatter and quip.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He needed dysfunction for laughs.
