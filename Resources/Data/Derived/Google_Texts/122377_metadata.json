Bialek, chief medical officer of iVantage Health Analytics, faced off on that question at a conference in Boston this week. Share\n\nPosted in Medical Device Business by MDDI Staff on September 19, 2014\n\nBy Tom Salemi\n\nIt has been three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and no one is quite ready to declare it a failure.\n\nWell, except AthenaHealth CEO Jonathan Bush.\n\nIn an Oxford-style debate at the Economist Health Care Forum in Boston on September 17, Bush went toe-to-toe with Donald S. Bialek, MD, chief medical officer of iVantage Health Analytics, to argue the question \u201cHas Obamacare failed?\u201d\n\nBialek endorsed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), acknowledging its warts and all. The ACA, he said, helps transform healthcare from a system of \u201csupply and command,\u201d in which physicians have the authority to order a service, provide the service, and get paid for the service.\n\nBy shifting away from fee-for-service, the ACA makes hospitals and physicians more accountable for the health of their patients, Bialek said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the population, though not necessarily for the healthcare system,\u201d he offered.\n\nBush, a cousin of former President George W. Bush, suggested Bialek was only half right. Mandating that every American pay for insurance \u201cseems like a really bad dream,\u201d he said. In the 1990s, health maintenance organizations did an effective job curbing costs by using market forces instead of mandates, \u201cwhich will be another chink in our humanity,\u201d he added.\n\nThe entertaining back-and-forth captured the essential arguments over the Affordable Care Act. Both sides agreed it has expanded healthcare coverage, but they held contrary opinions on the propriety of the mandate that broadened that coverage.\n\nBialek argued that while the personal mandate might be at odds with personal freedom, it\u2019s a necessary counterbalance to the accepted\u2014and mandated\u2014practice that hospitals can\u2019t turn away people who require emergency care.\n\n\u201cIf you make a choice to not [wear] a helmet and you have an accident and you\u2019re taken to the emergency room, you\u2019re in my ICU for three months on a ventilator under very expensive care. You\u2019ve made the choice to not wear a helmet, but I had to pay for that,\u201d Bialek said.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s important to understand what personal choice means,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you want to opt out of the system or opt out of getting care, that does not mean it\u2019s up to me to provide that care for you. But, as a society, we certainly wouldn\u2019t let a trauma patient not get care. In fact, there are mandates out there; if you are going to be a hospital, you are going to provide that kind of care.\u201d\n\nThe ACA\u2019s individual mandate, he said, is necessary to ensure insurers can continue to function.\n\n\u201cI do have some problems with the individual mandate for personal choice. But I have more of a problem when it becomes my problem.\u201d\n\nBush, always an engaging speaker, shot right back at Bialek, taking a stance for life, liberty, and the pursuit of high-end foods.\n\n\u201cFabulous. Choice. Right. I rode here, sorry, on a bike with no helmet,\u201d Bush said. \u201cHair flowing in the wind and it was fabulous, and I feel bad because if I go to the ICU, you will be paying. I guess not. Athena will be paying.\n\n\u201cBut also, I did not eat a lot of corn-fed steak, and I also try to exercise a fair amount,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd also, I don\u2019t watch a lot of TV. And I don\u2019t smoke a lot of drugs. And I don\u2019t drink a lot,\u201d Bush said, hinting that personal freedom comes with personal responsibility.\n\nBut Bush also suggested that we will never be able to preempt every injury, so perhaps a better place to focus efforts would be on cost.\n\n\u201cYou expressing something as native as riding a bike is now an offense to another person, that, to me, is a decay of social fabric and joy that is vastly more painful then the expense of the one poor bastard who ends up in the ICU,\u201d Bush said to Bialek. \u201cHow many have there been? Really? And, by the way, with the cost of the current system that has been locked in by law to be that outrageously expensive, we could run ICUs from here to Kingdom Come. There is no way we could generate enough motorcycle accidents to come anywhere close the overpayment we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s engaging monologue evoked the one point upon which most of the audience agreed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s more entertaining than I am that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Bialek said.\n\nTom Salemi is a freelance contributor to MD+DI.\n\n[image courtesy of GRAUR CODRIN/FREEDIGITALPHOTOS.NET]\n\nTags:\n\nSelect rating Poor Okay Good Great Awesome Your rating: None Average: 1 ( 1 vote)", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Medical Device and Diagnostics Industry, Medical Device Technology, Medical Device Manufacturing, Medical Device Suppliers, Testing and Inspection, MedTech Executive, Human Factors, Quality Assurance, Quality Control, Nano Technology, MDDI, Logistics, Design, Engineering, Microtechnology, Electronics, Materials, Molding, Outsourcing, Packaging, Pumps, Valves, Regulations, Legal, Reimbursement, Risk Management, Software, Sterilization, Surface Modification, Tubing, MX", "google-site-verification": "sisTltIMpvJYfeXmOzTpziFUq70pryXfUP1543OxtVQ", "description": "By Tom Salemi  It has been three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and no one is quite ready to declare it a failure.
