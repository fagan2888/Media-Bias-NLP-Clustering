I\u2019m happy I discovered them in my macrobiotic (grain-based diet) days. I used to bake with cornstarch like most people \u2014 which is not a healthy ingredient.\n\nDon\u2019t Use Cornstarch If You Can Help It\n\nMost commercial products and recipes use cornstarch because it is inexpensive and readily available. The problem with cornstarch is:\n\nIt is often difficult to digest and can irritate the digestive system.\n\nCorn is one of the most genetically modified foods.\n\nCornstarch is very highly processed carbohydrate with no protein, vitamins or minerals. It is made from the tiny white endosperm at the center of a corn kernel. The corn kernels are processed utilizing chemicals and high heat to remove outside shells to get it into a fine white powder.\n\nThink about the other white foods like white rice, white flour, and white sugar; they are often highly processed, with little nutrition or health benefits. They are wonderful food staples around the world, providing easy and tasty calories. But, if you\u2019re seeking a diet lower in calories and higher in nutrition, these ingredients are not your best bet.\n\nRead my article on The 9 Dangers of Common Gluten-Free Recipes And Products\n\nArrowroot and kudzu are produced in a simple, natural process unlike the way cornstarch and potato starch are highly processed.\n\nArrowroot \u2014 Even Better Than Kudzu\n\nArrowroot is a fine powder \u2014 an odorless, granular starch used in the food industry as thickener and as a stabilizing agent.\n\nI use arrowroot in everything from my puddings and gravies to cakes and cookies because:\n\nArrowroot is closer to a whole food because less processing is involved.\n\nArrowroot is easily digested and even helps settle an upset stomach.\n\nOnce cooked it is clear, shiny and translucent instead of cloudy.\n\nArrowroot Nutrition\n\nVery low in calories; less than that of potato or yam\n\nContains good levels of B-complex (niacin, thiamin, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid and riboflavin).\n\nContains moderate levels of some minerals (copper, iron, manganese, phosphorous, magnesium, and zinc).\n\nExcellent source of potassium (454 mg per 100g or 10% of RDA).\n\nArrowroot as Medicine\n\nArrowroot got its name because it was originally used by Caribbean Indians to treat the wounds from poison arrows.\n\nThey grew it for food and for its healing properties as far back as 1600. Later the Europeans learned of this and continued this practice.\n\nHistorically it was fed to children and people with fragile digestive systems.\n\nArrowroot is made from the roots of a tropical plant called arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea). The arrowroot plant is a close cousin of the kudzu plant. Both grow naturally in the Southern United States and Asia and are used in similar ways for cooking.\n\nKudzu Also Better\n\nKudzu, also known as kuzu, is made from the root of the kudzu plant that grows wild in the mountains of Japan and in the southern U.S. Kudzu strengthens the digestive tract.\n\nIt is native to Japan and China where it has been used for over 2,000 years medicinally and as a starchy food.\n\nKudzu Nutrition\n\nOnly 33 calories in 1 tablespoon (0.4 oz) of Kudzu Root Starch, dry.\n\nRich in organic iron, calcium and phosphorus.\n\nHas a significantly high flavonoid content.\n\nKudzu as Medicine\n\nAccording to research in Beijing, China:\n\nReduces high blood pressure and risk of blood clots.\n\nRelieves chronic migraine headaches\n\nEases tension in the shoulders, neck and head\n\nUsed for more than 1,000 years by Asian herbalists for alcoholism and to curb alcohol cravings.\n\nMacrobiotic founder, Michio Kushi recommends using kuzu in the following ways:\n\nTo treat digestive and intestinal issues such as indigestion and colitis, bacterial infection and abdominal pain.\n\nFor colds.\n\nTo relieve tiredness and restore vitality.\n\nCaution in Growing Kudzu\n\nIt grows very well; the vines grow as much as a foot per day during the summer. They climb trees, power poles, and anything they can grow up on. Kudzu vines can grow sixty feet in one year. The vines can also destroy valuable forests by preventing trees from getting sunlight. In 1972 USDA declared kudzu to be a weed!\n\nArrowroot and Kudzu are more expensive than cornstarch and other starches but the benefits are worth it.\n\nCooking Tips With Arrowroot and Kudzu\n\nBoth have a neutral flavor and will not give a starchy taste into your recipes like corn starch does. Also, they will create shine and translucence, which is great in fruit pie fillings and fruit sauces. I always have both in my kitchen, but tend to use more arrowroot because it is more affordable.\n\nCan be used for thickening sauces, gravies, puddings, etc.\n\nDissolve in cool water, usually 1 tablespoon per arrowroot/kudzu to 2 tablespoons liquid, and mix well, then stir slowly into whatever sauce or dish you are cooking. You will see the liquid start to thicken (thickens at lower temperatures than cornstarch). Continue to stir and let cook for at least five minutes.\n\nSubstitute 2 teaspoons of arrowroot or kudzu for 1 tablespoon of cornstarch.\n\nSubstitute 1 teaspoon of arrowroot for 1 tablespoon of flour in recipes.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mix the arrowroot well, it can have a chalky aftertaste. Stir it in slowly and thoroughly while cooking.\n\nGood to use in baking in small quantities in place of any other starches.\n\nCaution: DO NOT use 40 \u2013 50 percent in baking recipes as some of the gluten-free websites are suggesting! It is a starch, so I recommend using very little.\n\nArrowroot Recipes:\n\nBanana Pudding: This is a very easy pudding to make for a quick dessert.\n\nPear Upside Down Cake \u2013 Vegan and gluten-free\n\nApple Cake with Cinnamon \u2013 Gluten-free: This is a deeply satisfying cake filled with healthy ingredients.\n\nIf you REALLY want to learn to bake healthy gluten-free foods, I suggest my Healthy Baking Course.
