Ted Cruz and Rand Paul seemed destined for an alliance. They\u2019re both tea partiers and Washington outsiders, eager to shake up the established order. Cruz\u2019s first speech on the Senate floor was in support of Paul\u2019s filibuster of U.S. drone policy.\n\nRelated Texas has good chance to be player in presidential primaries\n\nBut with both angling for the White House, the bromance has turned into full-blown rivalry. A pro-Paul PAC has hit Cruz as a \u201ccapitulating Canadian.\u201d Cruz recently accused Paul of undermining his anti-Obamacare filibuster.\n\nOn Friday, Paul takes his campaign to Cruz\u2019s hometown, Houston, where he\u2019ll hold a \u201cStand with Rand\u201d rally.\n\n\u201cSen. Paul will discuss the importance of protecting the entire Bill of Rights, and being boldly for conservative ideals that limit the powers of the Washington Machine. These ideals include spending only what comes in, lowering taxes with the \u2018Fair and Flat Tax\u2019 plan, and unleashing the American Dream by leaving more money with those who earned it,\u201d his campaign said this morning.\n\n(Paul denounces the \u201cWashington Machine.\u201d Cruz rails at the \u201cWashington Cartel.\u201d)\n\nAs Gromer Jeffers noted the other day, the Texas primary on March 1 is likely to be a critical test. Given the number of candidates, plenty of them will likely remain standing after the four early-voting states start to winnow the field. So it\u2019s not unreasonable to plant seeds in Texas now. And Houston is, in some ways, home turf for Paul, too, even though he represents Kentucky.\n\nHe was born and raised in the Houston area, where his dad, Ron Paul, held a congressional seat on and off for years and delivered thousands of babies as an ob/gyn.\n\nStill, interesting timing.\n\nIn Cruz\u2019s new book, \u201cA Time for Truth,\u201d the Texas senator goes out of his way to thump Paul for his actions during Cruz\u2019s 21-hour anti-Obamacare talkathon.\n\n\u201cWhen you stand on your feet for twenty-one straight hours\u2026 you find out who your friends are,\u201d Cruz writes, and compared a number of fellow Republicans, \u201canother tea party senator was notably less helpful. My friend Rand Paul came to the Senate floor to ask questions that seemed deliberately designed to undermine our efforts. Question such as, \u2018Do you want to shut down the government? \u2026 Will you accept a compromise? Will you work with the President?\u2019 His questions echoed the skeptical attacks of Mitch McConnell, and I marveled that Rand had decided not to be with us in this fight.\u201d\n\nCruz went on: \u201cI marveled that Rand had decided not to be with us in this fight.\u201d\n\nPaul disputes the account.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s curious because he sent me a really nice, handwritten congratulatory note thanking me for my help,\u201d he told POLITICO last week. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNy9yYW5kLXBhdWwtc25pcGluZy13aXRoLXRlZC1jcnV6LWhlYWRzLXRvLWhvdXN0b24tZm9yLXN0YW5kLXdpdGgtcmFuZC1yYWxseS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Todd J.
