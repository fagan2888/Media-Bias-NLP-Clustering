(Do we sound like a broken record yet?)\n\nBut during a campaign stop in Kentucky on Tuesday, leading Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton announced a big plan to help America\u2019s youngest learners \u2014 continuing her commitment to early childhood education and to making sure the neediest children don\u2019t start school far behind their more-advantaged peers.\n\nAhead of Kentucky\u2019s May 17 Democratic primary, Clinton announced a plan to double down on a home visitation program for low-income families, the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Initiative. Under the widely praised program, interested pregnant women and new parents receive regular, planned home visits from nurses and social workers with a goal to improve maternal and child health, prevent child abuse, encourage positive parenting practices, and better prepare at-risk children for school.\n\nClinton said she hopes to extend the program to more than 2 million parents and children in the next decade.\n\nImplemented in 2010 through a provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the federal home visiting program has bipartisan support and is backed by decades of research showing home visits improve child and family outcomes. It was the first national push to expand home visiting, with the federal government investing $1.5 billion in the program\u2019s first five years.\n\nA report by Mathematica Policy Research, commissioned by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, showed home visits can reduce the need for remedial education and increase family self-sufficiency.\n\nThis is Clinton\u2019s latest effort to tie her education policy positions to those of President Obama. In February, as she worked to harness votes from the African-American community, Clinton proposed a plan to dismantle the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline,\u201d empower black entrepreneurs, and create jobs for black youth \u2014 all positions that mirror the sitting president.\n\nAlthough Clinton has largely been quiet about her plans for America\u2019s K-12 education system, she\u2019s long been an advocate for early childhood education \u2014 including promoting universal preschool . During her visit Tuesday to a Kentucky social services center that provides subsidized child care, Clinton went deeper by proposing a pay raise for child-care workers, and tax credits and other subsidies that would free families from having to pay more than 10 percent of their income on child care.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The74Million is an education focused website", "og": {"site_name": "The74", "description": "The74Million is an education focused website", "title": "Inside Hillary Clinton\u2019s Latest Push to Improve Early Childhood Education: Home Visits", "url": "https://www.the74million.org/article/inside-hillary-clintons-latest-push-to-improve-early-childhood-education-home-visits", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/the74million/media-gallery/images/1462999336_7188.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@The74", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/the74million/media-gallery/images/1462999336_7188.png", "description": "The74Million is an education focused website", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Inside Hillary Clinton\u2019s Latest Push to Improve Early Childhood Education: Home Visits"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b91d47", "fb": {"pages": 502302526590233}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Although Clinton has largely been quiet about her plans for America\u2019s K-12 education system, she\u2019s long been an advocate for early childhood education \u2014 including promoting universal preschool .\nThis is Clinton\u2019s latest effort to tie her education policy positions to those of President Obama.\nAhead of Kentucky\u2019s May 17 Democratic primary, Clinton announced a plan to double down on a home visitation program for low-income families, the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Initiative.\nClinton said she hopes to extend the program to more than 2 million parents and children in the next decade.\nIt was the first national push to expand home visiting, with the federal government investing $1.5 billion in the program\u2019s first five years."}
