Rand Paul (R-KY) ripped into President Obama over executive overreach and even vowed to repeal \u201call previous executive orders\u201d in one of his first acts as president, should he run.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nPaul\u2019s comments came to the New Hampshire chapter of Generation Opportunity, a national grassroots conservative group with a libertarian appeal with thousands of young liberty-minded activists nationwide engaged through it.\n\nPaul focused much of his remarks on executive overreach by President Barack Obama, saving some of his most interesting points for a question-and-answer session at the end.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a rumor going around you might run for president in a couple years,\u201d a young man shouted as Paul took questions from the audience for several minutes after a 15-plus-minute speech.\n\n\u201cI know, it\u2019s crazy,\u201d the young man followed up. \u201cYou spoke for a bit on the executive orders tonight. If you were to receive the presidency would you repeal previous executive orders and restrain the power of the presidency?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d the man shouted back at Paul. \u201cYou should run.\u201d\n\nWhile he\u2019s not officially running for president \u2013 yet \u2013 Paul recently told Breitbart News he will decide whether to make a bid for the Oval Office by next spring, and his trip to New Hampshire, the site of the nation\u2019s first presidential primary, is one of many trips he\u2019s taken to key states over the past two years.\n\nIn a brief interview with Breitbart News outside after the speech and question-and-answer session, Paul said he thinks the president\u2019s executive overreaches are massively unpopular nationwide and will have electoral consequences for candidates in races ranging from this year\u2019s Senate races to 2016\u2019s presidential contest.\n\nBefore Paul spoke at the event, his staff kicked out liberal operatives there to videotape him to use it to attack him\u2013called \u201ctrackers\u201d in professional politics\u2013from American Bridge.\n\nPaul\u2019s reason for being in New Hampshire is a series of events he\u2019ll attend with Scott Brown and other Republican candidates on Friday, including a post-primary \u201cunity breakfast,\u201d to unite the party here behind Brown heading into November\u2019s battle with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH). But it certainly didn\u2019t hurt a likely 2016 candidate like Paul to hit up the bar with conservative college-age or just-out-of-college kids from Manchester while in town.\n\n\u201cHow many people here have a cell phone?\u201d Paul asked to open up his speech, as many held theirs up to show him. \u201cHow many people think it\u2019s none of the government\u2019s damn business what you have on your cell phone?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone!\u201d everyone shouted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking that\u2019s true,\u201d Paul joked. \u201cBut I\u2019m really, really worried about Anthony Weiner. Because you know he likes to take his selfies, and he\u2019s had trouble finding a place to put them where the government can\u2019t find them. So I\u2019m thinking maybe Anthony Weiner should put his selfie in Lois Lerner\u2019s emails.\u201d\n\nThe crowd of 200 strong, mostly young people under 30, at tonight\u2019s event is a sign Paul\u2019s conservative libertarianism is catching fire in \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d New Hampshire. Paul criticized the left\u2019s immigration policies, Hillary Clinton\u2019s and President Obama\u2019s foreign policy, and big government Republicans like Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who he didn\u2019t name but specifically referenced at least once, mixing all that together with his libertarian messaging of demanding America \u201crethink the war on drugs\u201d and protect constitutional liberties of Americans\u2013a theme he hit in his Senate floor filibuster.\n\nOne questioner asked Paul to comment on \u201cBarack Obama\u2019s constitutional authority\u2013or lack thereof\u2013to legalize illegal aliens.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not been one thing, it\u2019s been many things,\u201d Paul responded. \u201cIt\u2019s been immigration, it\u2019s been healthcare reform as well as war powers. He thinks he can do anything. In frankly almost all of these areas he\u2019s usurped his authority. It\u2019s wrong from a constitutional perspective. I think with DACA [the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals executive amnesty], he has no authority to do DACA. Not only is it wrong from a constitutional perspective but then in doing so it becomes something that really messes up the border. It screws things up because if you provide sort of a beacon, or a grant of forgiveness to people and say \u2018this is okay\u2019 without securing the border, what does that tell everybody else in Central America? \u2018Hey guys, it\u2019s open season, let\u2019s move to the United States.\u2019 So 50,000 kids have come also because of this Wilberforce Act which says we\u2019re going to treat people differently if they come to the United States from a country other than Mexico. So, 50,000 kids are here.\u201d\n\nPaul argued too that it\u2019s not anti-immigrant to oppose amnesty and executive orders like the one President Obama has now delayed past the election. \u201cWe have to be a part\u2013and I am a person who is part of a party\u2013who I think does and should look at immigrants as assets,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI was in Guatemala a couple weeks ago, and my main conversation with the president there was we would like more adoption of Guatemalan children. There are thousands of Americans who would adopt Guatemalan children. I don\u2019t want to be the party that is against Guatemalan kids, but I do want to be the party that is for enforcing the rule of law and says we can\u2019t have just everybody come whenever they want to.\u201d\n\nEarlier, during his remarks, Paul hammered Obama on his use of executive authority. \u201c[Abraham] Lincoln wrote that any man can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man\u2019s character, give him power,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI think this president has failed that test at every turn because this president has said that \u2018oh, well, Democracy is messy and Congress won\u2019t give me what I want.\u2019 A direct quote from one of his people about two weeks they said, \u2018he has no choice but to act.\u2019 It sounds like we live in some kind of third world place where the president does whatever he wants. This is the idea that the presidency is run amok. I was talking to one of you earlier and you said it didn\u2019t start with him\u2013you\u2019re right. It\u2019s gone on for a hundred years, and progressively has gotten worse, Republicans and Democratic administrations, with more and more power accumulating in the presidency.\u201d\n\nPaul continued by noting that he thinks Obama\u2019s executive overreaches are worse than any individual policies he\u2019s pushed. \u201cThe worst thing this president has done is not Obamacare,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s not Dodd-Frank. And they\u2019re horrible. They\u2019re terrible. They\u2019re the worst pieces of legislation in a couple decades. But the worst thing this president has done is run roughshod over the separation of powers.\u201d\n\nPaul shifted into criticizing the president on ISIS, saying \u201cthere\u2019s a big deal going on in the Middle East right now called ISIS\u201d\u2013noting how he thinks they\u2019re a threat to America, and to America\u2019s embassies and consulates worldwide.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MANCHESTER, New Hampshire -- In front of a boisterous pub crowd of young voters here, Sen.
