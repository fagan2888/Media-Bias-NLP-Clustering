This determines risk and the type of allocations they make, she said.\n\nThe focus is then on developing a long-term strategic plan.\n\nA very attractive area for healthcare is the private credit market for peer-to-peer lending, according to Noonan. The loans have a high rate of return. But before allocating assets, due diligence is needed for assessing the risk.\n\n[Also: What CFOs think about revenue cycle]\n\nIf health systems issue debt at 4.5 percent and inflation is 2 percent, they are looking at a 7 percent return, she said.\n\nReal estate and hedge funds are in the investment mix, while increased merger activity and a revived interest in the way pension plans are funded are also a factor, said Noonan. In fact, pensions dominated the conversation at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January, she said.\n\n\u201cCFOs in healthcare really get involved in these efforts, coming up with a strategy for a defined benefit plan.\u201d\n\nThe same challenges that are causing pension plans to be underfunded in the corporate and public sector are affecting healthcare, Noonan said.\n\nNonprofit healthcare pensions are being replaced by 403b plans just like 401ks are replacing pensions in corporations. Healthcare has been slower to close pension plans, Noonan said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of conversations with CFOs around this,\u201d Noonan said. \u201cThey want clarity on what the contributions are going to be for the balance sheet.\u201d\n\nFor CFOs, it\u2019s important to diversify and have different pools for a defined benefit plan and a board designated plan, she said. There is also increased focused on health plans and how they\u2019re managed.\n\nNonprofit hospitals operating on 2.5 percent annual profit margin need investment income, but should not count on it for their operating budgets, according to Christopher Kerns, managing director of Research and Insights at The Advisory Board Co. in Washington, D.C.\n\nProper investments are \u201cnot only wise, but necessary,\u201d Kerns said. \u201cHospitals are a cash hungry business. It takes a lot of money to do what they do. They need to find ways to invest in high return businesses.\u201d\n\nInvestments must also be diversified and managed so that credit agencies remain comfortable.\n\nNo provider has an AAA rating for nonprofit healthcare, and perhaps only three to five have an AA plus rating, Noonan said. This is because when they need capital, nonprofits can\u2019t issue shares of stock. They only have access through the debt market.\n\nOrganizations that can\u2019t come up with significant cash may need liquidity to maintain a stable rating.\n\nThe nonprofit Mountain States Health Alliance has a credit rating of BBB plus that the board of directors has worked hard to achieve after taking on a debt of $1 billion and riding out the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nBoard members Clem Wilkes Jr. and Rick Storey said the debt was created in 1998 when the single organization expanded to a 14-hospital system in four states. Mountain States Health Alliance, based in Johnson City, Tenn., serves Northeast Tennessee, Southwest Virginia, Southeastern Kentucky and Western North Carolina.\n\nWhen the governance was set up, they made sure to set up an investment committee, Wilkes said.\n\n\u201cWe started working on formula and investment policy,\u201d said Wilkes, a former chairman and treasurer. \u201cIn the early 2000s, with the best of times, we didn\u2019t have to make a lot of adjustments.\u201d\n\n[Also: Fitch Ratings bullish on for-profit healthcare]\n\nBut when bottom fell out, they were forced become more conservative with their portfolio.\n\n\u201cAfter the crash in 2008, we learned what can happen to investments,\u201d Storey said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we took a hard look at what we did with investment and set a minimum of 250 days cash on hand.\u201d\n\nThey invested in 40 percent equity and 60 percent fixed income, using a financial advisor to set up separately managed accounts, he said. They bought and sold securities, stocks and bonds, and gravitated towards institutional mutual funds.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nThey planned a conservative return of 2.5 percent each year and \u201cpatiently waited for the market to come back,\u201d Storey said.\n\nThat benchmark rose to 3.3 percent.\n\n\u201cAnything over, we\u2019re using our funds to reduce the debt,\u201d Wilkes said.\n\nThat happened even after losing Medicare money in 2013, Storey said.\n\nMountain States\u2019 portfolio includes fixed income, real estate investments and liquid funds. And their high bond rating helps them secure cash on hand.\n\n\u201cIf you need to make payroll, you can\u2019t sell CT scanners,\u201d Wilkes said.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/hospitals-investing-wall-street-shore-finances", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Wall-Street-sign-feature_0.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Importance chief financial officers are placing on investments represents a major shift in the past 10 years, experts say.", "title": "Hospitals investing in Wall Street to shore up finances"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Wall-Street-sign-feature_0.gif"}, "title": "Hospitals investing in Wall Street to shore up finances", "description": "Importance chief financial officers are placing on investments represents a major shift in the past 10 years, experts say.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "With regulation and competition increasing pressure on hospitals, hospital finance execs are turning more than ever to Wall Street to add stability to their balance sheets.&#13; The importance chief financial officers are placing on investments represents a major shift in the past 10 years, said Sheila Noonan, managing director and a senior client advisor for JPMorgan Asset Management in Chicago.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde434\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAfter the crash in 2008, we learned what can happen to investments,\u201d Storey said.\n\u201cAnything over, we\u2019re using our funds to reduce the debt,\u201d Wilkes said.\nWith regulation and competition increasing pressure on hospitals, hospital finance execs are turning more than ever to Wall Street to add stability to their balance sheets.\nHealthcare has been slower to close pension plans, Noonan said.\nWhen the governance was set up, they made sure to set up an investment committee, Wilkes said."}
