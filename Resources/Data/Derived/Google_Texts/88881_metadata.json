She wanted to know if they had health insurance and, perhaps more importantly, if they\u2019d used it.\n\nOne was Darin Zollarcoffer, 48. He had coverage, but no primary care doctor.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Santiago asked.\n\n\u201cHonestly?\u201d Zollarcoffer replied. \u201cI have a fear of doctors and hospitals. When you go there, that\u2019s when you start getting sick, and things start falling apart.\u201d\n\nSo Santiago began the pitch to convince him to get care.\n\nA year ago, the conversation probably would have been different. Santiago \u2013 the community healthcare nurse navigator at the Curtis D. Robinson Center for Health Equity at St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford \u2013 helped scores of Hartford residents sign up for coverage as part of the federal health law.\n\nBut when she followed up with them, she found that having coverage hadn\u2019t necessarily translated into getting medical care.\n\n\u201cAccess became the biggest issue,\u201d Santiago said, \u201cPeople not being able to get primary care, not knowing what to do with an insurance card.\u201d\n\nSo Santiago has revised her outreach efforts to include lessons on how to use insurance and mock interviews to help people feel comfortable asking doctors questions. She works to get the newly insured to visit primary care doctors; in some cases, that means calling around to find one who will take a Medicaid patient, or cajoling those who, like Zollarcoffer, aren\u2019t eager to see a doctor. In some cases, she\u2019s walked patients into a clinic at St. Francis to get them seen.\n\nSince the federal health law\u2019s major provisions rolled out last year, much of the attention has been on getting people signed up for private insurance or Medicaid. But increasingly, the focus of those in health care, insurance and advocacy groups is turning to what comes next: making sure those who gained coverage use it to improve their health, and ensuring that the health care system is adapting to meet their needs \u2013 things that could be significantly more complicated than getting people signed up for coverage.\n\nAmong the big questions:\n\nWill the newly insured be able to find doctors to treat them?\n\nWill people know how to use their insurance?\n\nWill people begin using more preventive care, rather than waiting until they get sick and need costlier services?\n\nWill the health care system change in ways that accommodate those goals, evolving from a system that cares for the sick to one primarily focused on \u2013 and financially rewarding \u2013 keeping people healthy?\n\nAnd will doing so enable it to rein in costs that are increasingly eating into government, business and family budgets?\n\nArielle Levin Becker / CTMirror.org\n\nTo state Healthcare Advocate Victoria Veltri, ensuring that people get primary care is \u201cthe next frontier.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s trying to address this issue,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHaving [an insurance] card is nice, but what do we need to do to make sure that we\u2019re actually coalescing our efforts around getting people care when they need it?\u201d Veltri said. \u201cThat is something that really needs a lot of focus.\u201d\n\nOfficials at Access Health CT, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, are also trying to determine how to help people better understand how to use their coverage and navigate the health care system. A recent survey of customers with private insurance found that 28 percent did not have a primary care physician and 36 percent had not used their insurance plans. CEO Jim Wadleigh called the latter statistic startling.\n\nSantiago is among those trying to make sure those with coverage can actually use it.\n\nIn addition to her job at St. Francis, she is president of the Hartford Chapter of the National Association of Hispanic Nurses, which has a major initiative aimed at educating people about the health law and helping people get covered.\n\nShe gives presentations, often at churches and faith-based organizations, and hears people\u2019s stories. Taken together, they help to illustrate the varied and sometimes complex challenges in ensuring people get the care they need.\n\nSome people with Medicaid have struggled to find a doctor who will take them, Santiago said, while some people with private insurance worry about having to pay thousands of dollars toward their care before their high-deductible plans begin chipping in.\n\nOften, people are surprised to learn that some preventive services are covered at no charge, even if their plans have large deductibles. She\u2019s met some insured people who were planning to go to a health fair to get free screenings because they feared they would have to pay at a doctor's office.\n\nSome don\u2019t have any insurance \u2013 often because they couldn\u2019t afford their premiums and dropped out, or are not in the country legally and are ineligible for subsidized coverage or Medicaid. Santiago refers them for help \u2013 either to see if the qualify for financial assistance at St. Francis, free screenings and care at the Curtis D. Robinson Center, or the Malta House of Care, a free clinic that provides care aboard a Winnebago. She doesn\u2019t want people to get out of a conversation thinking they don\u2019t qualify for health care.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always an option for them,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are other, less tangible reasons people avoid seeking care \u2013 things Santiago tried to address during the health fair.\n\nA man with a family history of prostate cancer started walking away when Santiago mentioned getting screened for the disease.\n\nArielle Levin Becker / CTMirror.org\n\n\u201cThey stopped doing the digital rectal exams!\u201d she told him. \u201cThat\u2019s what I have to tell all the men; that is optional.\u201d\n\nSantiago spoke to another man in Spanish and learned that he has diabetes, hypertension and a mental health disorder \u2013 and that he couldn\u2019t find a primary care physician. To Santiago, it was a red flag: He\u2019s the sort of patient who, without a regular source of care, would likely show up in the emergency room.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a ticking time bomb,\u201d she said. She planned to talk to the medical director at one of the St. Francis clinics about him.\n\nTo make the pitch for health care, she often started with other topics, deftly turning the discussion back to care when she found an opening.\n\nMuch of Santiago\u2019s conversation with Zollarcoffer, the 48-year-old without a doctor, centered on baseball rivalries. He\u2019s from Boston. She\u2019s from the Bronx. They teased each other about championships.\n\nHe mentioned his fear of doctors and hospitals. But that wasn\u2019t the only thing keeping him from getting care.\n\nZollarcoffer had been living at a shelter for about two months. He has diabetes and needed a primary care doctor, but things got in the way, he explained in an interview. One was the restriction on when he could leave the shelter for the first month he was there, he said, which made it difficult to get to a community health center to see a doctor. And he struggled with depression at times, and knew he had to get things like doctors\u2019 appointments set up when he was feeling up to it. \u201cThere are some days when I just can\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nZollarcoffer\u2019s father died of prostate cancer. Santiago explained that he was at higher risk for the disease because he\u2019s African-American. Then she suggested he come visit her at the Curtis D. Robinson Center later that day.\n\n\u201cI will draw your blood today for free,\u201d she said.\n\nThen she upped the offer: I\u2019ll look at your test results and tell you if there\u2019s any reason for concern, she told him. I\u2019ll get you in touch with a urologist. All the decisions about what to do are up to you.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Zollarcoffer finally said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been hoodwinked by a New Yorker. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\n\nThey high-fived before he walked away.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/08/10/the-next-big-push-getting-people-health-care-not-just-insurance/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, Beyond Coverage, coverage to care, Medicaid, primary care", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/08/10/the-next-big-push-getting-people-health-care-not-just-insurance/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Since the federal health law\u2019s major provisions rolled out last year, much of the attention has been on getting people signed up for coverage.
