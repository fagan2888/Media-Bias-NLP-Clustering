Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he wants to see a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d single-payer healthcare system in America and defended gun manufacturers during a public policy forum in Arlington.\n\nA member of the audience asked Sanders about his stance on gun control, criticizing his vote to protect gun manufacturers from lawsuits.\n\nSanders refused to apologize for the vote.\n\n\u201cIf somebody has a gun and somebody steals that gun and shoots somebody, do you really think it makes sense to blame the manufacturer of that weapon?\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody assaults you with a baseball bat, you hit somebody over the head, you\u2019re not going to sue the baseball bat manufacturer.\u201d\n\nSanders said he voted in favor of instant background checks as well as a ban on assault weapons. He argued that the cultural war between urban and rural America over guns has prevented further progress on the issue.\n\n\u201cI understand that guns in my state are different than guns in Chicago and Los Angeles. I understand, and the people of my state understand, that there are people all over this country who have guns who should not have guns who are killing other people,\u201d Sanders said.\n\n\u201cPeople in urban America have got to appreciate, and I\u2019ve said this before but let me repeat it, that the overwhelming majority of people who hunt know about guns and respect guns and are law-abiding people. That\u2019s the truth. And people in rural America have to understand that in urban areas, guns mean something very difficult,\u201d he added.\n\nDespite the implementation of Obamacare, Sanders said 35 million people remain uninsured. The healthcare law\u2019s individual mandate requires every American to purchase health insurance or pay a fine to the IRS.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has done a lot of good things but we still have 35 million Americans with zero insurance and we have even more who are underinsured with large co-payments and large deductibles,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe Republican solution to that problem was to throw 27 million more Americans off of health insurance.\u201d\n\nSanders said businesses around the country are spending an enormous amount of money trying to figure out the most cost-effective way to offer health insurance to their employees.\n\n\u201cWell, you know what, I\u2019ll give you a radical thought here. Your employer should not be providing healthcare to you. It should be a right,\u201d he told an audience member.\n\nSanders also called for a $15 minimum wage and free tuition at public and private universities.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Bernie Sanders Stands By Pro-Gun Votes", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "\u201cIf somebody assaults you with a baseball bat, you\u2019re not going to sue the baseball bat manufacturer.\u201d", "title": "Sanders Stands by Second Amendment Votes: 'Overwhelming Majority' of Gun Owners Law-Abiding", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/sanders-stands-by-second-amendent-votes-overwhelming-majority-of-gun-owners-law-abiding/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/1/files/2015/04/sandersmug.jpg", "updated_time": 1464251661, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cIf somebody assaults you with a baseball bat, you\u2019re not going to sue the baseball bat manufacturer.\u201d", "title": "Sanders Stands by Second Amendment Votes: 'Overwhelming Majority' of Gun Owners Law-Abiding", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/sanders-stands-by-second-amendent-votes-overwhelming-majority-of-gun-owners-law-abiding/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/1/files/2015/04/sandersmug.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Bernie Sanders Stands By Pro-Gun Votes", "pinterestDescription": "Sanders Stands by Second Amendment Votes: 'Overwhelming Majority' of Gun Owners Law-Abiding", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda395\"", "article_summary": "Sanders Stands by Second Amendment Votes: 'Overwhelming Majority' of Gun Owners Law-AbidingDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.
