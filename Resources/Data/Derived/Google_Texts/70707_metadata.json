More than 2,800 organizations \u2014 including seven of the country's 10 biggest insurers \u2014 have signed on to the network so far, officials said.\n\nBut he also addressed the continuing disputes over the law that Republicans have focused on for years.\n\nHe reminded Republicans that some of the ideas behind the Affordable Care Act \u2014 most notably its individual mandate to buy coverage \u2014 were once supported by some conservatives, although its Medicaid expansion and some other big parts of the law stem more from liberal thought.\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act pretty much was their plan before I adopted it,\" he said.\n\nWhile the law has extended health coverage to millions of Americans \u2014 and no serious experts dispute that \u2014 Republicans charge that it's still causing more problems than it's solving.\n\nBut Obama sharply criticized the GOP for trying to undermine the law but failing to introduce their own comprehensive alternative. Republicans have introduced many separate bills aimed at reforming healthcare, but have been unable to unite behind one big plan.\n\nAnd the president condemned the proposed GOP budget the House is voting on this week, which would repeal the entire healthcare law and cost millions of Americans federally subsidized health plans they've purchased in the law's new insurance marketplaces.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama slammed Republicans Wednesday for continuing to war against his signature healthcare law five years in.\nIt's working, despite countless attempts to repeal, undermine, defund and defame this law, Obama said in a speech commemorating the Affordable Care Act's anniversary of passage.\nWe've made our share of mistakes since we passed this law, but we also know beyond a shred of doubt the law has worked, he said.
