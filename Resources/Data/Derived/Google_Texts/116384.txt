KEARNEY — A number of streets were closed and numerous vehicles were stalled as heavy rainfall and hail inundated Kearney late Friday night and early Saturday.

Rainfall fell so heavily that it caused roofs to leak in some businesses with flat roofs. The leakage may have been the cause of fire and burglar alarms being activated in several buildings.

Emergency dispatchers also were stretched thin as motorists reported trouble in the streets.

About 1 a.m., bar-goers were wading shoeless as they crossed flooded streets on their way home.

The rainfall that ended about 12:30 a.m. was one of the first waves of storms forecast for the Kearney region this weekend.

Emergency personnel were warning area residents to take precautions and to watch weather reports and local media as the weekend’s weather unfolds.

Forecasts called for on-and-off heavy rainfall and potential thunderstorms Saturday.
