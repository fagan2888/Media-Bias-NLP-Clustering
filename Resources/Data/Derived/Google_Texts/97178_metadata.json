He also looked for bigger dating sites.\n\nBeing, and persevering, in the online marketplace paid off for Mr. Oyer. After many dates, and brief relationships, he found his current partner through the Jewish dating site JDate. Cupid played a bit of a joke on the economist in this case, however; his love match turned out to work a hundred yards from his office.\n\n(Mr. Oyer responded to reader questions in a subsequent Economix post.)", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140203110039, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "per": "Oyer, Paul", "keywords": "Oyer Paul,Online Dating,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/Ask the Author: Economics and Online Dating ( 20140203 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "The New York Times", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "The New York Times", "byl": "The New York Times", "twitter": {"description": "Paul Oyer, a Stanford professor who has written a book about the economics of online dating, is taking readers\u2019 questions.", "title": "Ask the Author: Economics and Online Dating", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/ask-the-author-economics-and-online-dating/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002685680, "description": "Paul Oyer, a Stanford professor who has written a book about the economics of online dating, is taking readers\u2019 questions.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "February 3, 2014", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1391443239, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-02-11T19:22:45-05:00"}, "utime": 20140211192245, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140203, "pdate": 20140203, "des": "Online Dating", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "Paul Oyer, a Stanford professor who has written a book about the economics of online dating, is taking readers\u2019 questions.", "title": "Ask the Author: Economics and Online Dating", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/ask-the-author-economics-and-online-dating/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/ask-the-author-economics-and-online-dating/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Ask the Author: Economics and Online Dating", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "February 3, 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1278\"", "article_summary": "When Paul Oyer, an economist at Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business, plunged into the online dating world a few years ago, he was struck \u2014 by the economics involved in his search.\nBeing, and persevering, in the online marketplace paid off for Mr. Oyer.\n(Mr. Oyer responded to reader questions in a subsequent Economix post.)\nAfter many dates, and brief relationships, he found his current partner through the Jewish dating site JDate.\n\u201cAfter spending 20 years learning about and studying markets,\u201d Mr. Oyer writes in a new book, \u201cI had suddenly been thrust back into one of the most fascinating markets that exists \u2014 the market for life partners.\u201dMr. Oyer, the author of \u201cEverything I Ever Needed to Know About Economics I Learned From Online Dating,\u201d published this month by Harvard Business Review Press, is taking readers\u2019 questions on Economix about the economics of the online dating marketplace."}
