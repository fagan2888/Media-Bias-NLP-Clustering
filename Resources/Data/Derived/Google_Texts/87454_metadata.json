If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.\u201d\n\nMinimum wage and paid family leave are not only moral imperatives, says Obama, but good economics to boot. Employees, he tells us, are happier and therefore more productive. Minimum wage and paid medical leave, understand, actually benefit business. It\u2019s just that dumb businessmen and women don\u2019t realize it.\n\nBut what does it say that perhaps the two most high-profile leftwing economists once opposed the minimum wage and paid family and medical leave?\n\nWhen Obamacare architect/economist Jonathan Gruber and the New York Times economist Paul Krugman actually practiced economics, they both opposed the minimum wage. In Gruber\u2019s case, he also opposed government mandated for paid family and medical leave.\n\nIn 2011 \u2014 less than four years ago \u2014 Gruber gave an MIT lecture called \u201cApplying Supply and Demand.\u201d About the minimum wage, Gruber said: \u201cLet\u2019s say the government rolled in and set a minimum wage. \u2026 Workers want to supply more hours than firms want to hire. \u2026 You end up with excess supply. And we call that excess supply \u2018unemployment.'\u201d He also insisted that a higher minimum wage pressures an employer to turn to automation: \u201cWe have a downward sloping demand curve, and why is it downward sloping? Because the higher the wage, the fewer workers the firm wants to hire. It would rather use machines instead.\u201d\n\nAs to paid leave, Gruber also argued against it. In 1994 Gruber wrote: \u201cI study several state and federal mandates which stipulated that childbirth be covered comprehensively in health insurance plans, raising the relative cost of insuring women of childbearing age. I find substantial shifting of the costs of these mandates to the wages of the targeted group.\u201d In other words, Gruber said that an employer forced to pay for family leave will simply reduce the employee\u2019s wages to offset the cost \u2014 not net benefit to the employee.\n\nThis brings us to the New York Times columnist/economist Paul Krugman, who currently supports a $15 minimum wage. He, too, has done a 180 on the issue.\n\nIn 1998, Krugman reviewed a book that supported the living wage, titled \u201cThe Living Wage: Building a Fair Economy.\u201d But Krugman slammed the idea: \u201cThe living wage movement is simply a move to raise minimum wages through local action. So what are the effects of increasing minimum wages? Any Econ 101 student can tell you the answer: The higher wage reduces the quantity of labor demanded, and hence leads to unemployment.\u201d\n\nKrugman even dismissed Card-Krueger, the widely cited minimum-wage study that purports to show its positive effect. Krugman pretty much dismissed it. \u201cIndeed,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmuch-cited studies by two well-regarded labor economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, find that where there have been more or less controlled experiments, for example when New Jersey raised minimum wages but Pennsylvania did not, the effects of the increase on employment have been negligible or even positive. Exactly what to make of this result is a source of great dispute. Card and Krueger offered some complex theoretical rationales, but most of their colleagues are unconvinced; the centrist view is probably that minimum wages \u2018do,\u2019 in fact, reduce employment, but that the effects are small and swamped by other forces. \u2026\n\n\u201cIn short, what the living wage is really about is not living standards, or even economics, but morality. Its advocates are basically opposed to the idea that wages are a market price -? determined by supply and demand, the same as the price of apples or coal. And it is for that reason, rather than the practical details, that the broader political movement of which the demand for a living wage is the leading edge is ultimately doomed to failure: For the amorality of the market economy is part of its essence, and cannot be legislated away.\u201d\n\nIn sum, Gruber and Krugman once made Milton Friedman-like, Econ 101 arguments against minimum wage and its cousin, the livable wage. And in Gruber\u2019s case, he even argued against government-mandated paid family and medical leave.\n\nThe late Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan is attributed with the following quote: \u201cYou\u2019re entitled to your opinion, but you\u2019re not entitled to your own facts.\u201d In the case of Gruber and Krugman\u2019s current support for \u201cprogressive\u201d policies they once opposed, what changed? The facts \u2014 or the politics?\n\nLarry Elder is a best-selling author and radio talk-show host.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "What does it say that perhaps the two most high-profile leftwing economists once opposed the minimum wage and paid family and medical leave?", "title": "When leftwing economists Gruber and Krugman practiced economics | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/krugman-480x280.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2015/02/05/when-leftwing-economists-gruber-and-krugman-practiced-economics/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "What does it say that perhaps the two most high-profile leftwing economists once opposed the minimum wage and paid family and medical leave?", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/krugman-480x280.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "What does it say that perhaps the two most high-profile leftwing economists once opposed the minimum wage and paid family and medical leave?"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f52\"", "article_summary": "When Obamacare architect/economist Jonathan Gruber and the New York Times economist Paul Krugman actually practiced economics, they both opposed the minimum wage.\nBut what does it say that perhaps the two most high-profile leftwing economists once opposed the minimum wage and paid family and medical leave?\n\u2026\u201cIn short, what the living wage is really about is not living standards, or even economics, but morality.\nIt would rather use machines instead.\u201dAs to paid leave, Gruber also argued against it.\nIn 2011 \u2014 less than four years ago \u2014 Gruber gave an MIT lecture called \u201cApplying Supply and Demand.\u201d About the minimum wage, Gruber said: \u201cLet\u2019s say the government rolled in and set a minimum wage."}
