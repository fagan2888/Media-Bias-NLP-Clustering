But he brought the bluster, vowing that he could negotiate deals no one in government today can do, that he can be tough like no one else, and that he would protect Americans from immigrants like no one else.\n\nHe belittled and dismissed his top Republican opponents frequently, calling U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida \u201cLittle Marco\u201d and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d on every reference. Everyone else who has opposed him, including the GOP establishment, he called \u201ca disaster.\u201d\n\nAnd he called on Florida to be their Waterloo.\n\n\u201cIf we win Florida, believe me, it\u2019s over!\u201d Trump said more than once.\n\nFrom there he turned to Democratic front-runner, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for whom he showed no more respect.\n\n\u201cWe will beat Hillary Clinton. We will beat her. I guarantee you!\u201d he vowed.\n\nThe crowd loved it, except for two dozen or so protesters who one by one rose up in the audience to shout or wave signs that interrupted Trump\u2019s speech every couple of minutes. Time after time they were escorted out as Trump yelled \u201cGet him out of here!\u201d and, occasionally, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt him!\u201d\n\nThe crowd, capacity in the CFE Arena that normally tops out at 10,000, was as much a part of the event as Trump.\n\nThis is what Rubio, the other candidates, and Trump critics in both parties must understand and deal with: This crowd wants Trump as much as Trump wants their votes. People chanted \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d or \u201cWe want Trump!\u201d or \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump!\u201d with a thunder that UCF Knights cheerleaders would be proud to inspire. Occasionally, someone randomly shouted something from the cheap seats that sounded supportive; regardless of what it was or whether most people could hear the words, the rest of the audience always erupted in enthusiastic applause.\n\nThey knew. Whatever it was the shouter yelled, he was one of them. What he said, whatever it was, they felt it too.\n\nAnger. Frustration, the belief that the country is sinking into anarchy where nothing is fair anymore.\n\nTrump knew too. He frequently referred to \u201cthe movement\u201d he was fronting.\n\n\u201cThis is a movement. This isn\u2019t about me. This is about you. This is about you,\u201d he said.\n\nHis policy statements were touched on only briefly. \u201cWe will build the wall,\u201d he reminded everyone. The United States will cut back what it gives Saudi Arabia. It will build up a strong military and tough borders. He will repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and the Common Core education standards, and abandon the Iran treaty. He will impose a 35 percent tariff to stop American companies from manufacturing overseas. He will defend gun rights.\n\nMostly, though, his appeal to the crowd was to replace everything they hate about government with him. He promised to bring some other big businessmen such as Andrew Beal and Carl Icahn, whom he said would help him negotiate trade pacts, treaties and other deals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all gonna change folks. It\u2019s all gonna change. It\u2019s all gonna change,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s gonna go fast.\u201d\n\nHe continued to back off his statements last week that he would authorize water boarding and even tougher interrogation techniques, because he was advised that they are illegal under the Geneva Convention, which the United States signed. But he didn\u2019t back off his criticism of not being able to use them.\n\nHe told again the story of Gen. John J. Pershing allegedly dipping bullets in pigs blood before using them to execute 49 Muslims accused of terrorism in the Philippines, then offering the last bullet to the only surviving prisoner and telling him to tell everyone what happened. The story has been widely disputed, but Trump stuck with it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say he would do the same thing, just that he was convinced it was an effective approach and he admired it. \u201cNow we can\u2019t be babies. We can\u2019t be foolish,\u201d he said.\n\nHe warned of a Clinton victory, suggesting his greatest concern was that she might be able to appoint up to four Supreme Court justices, given the current justices\u2019 ages.\n\n\u201cRemember this when the Republicans want to play games,\u201d he said.\n\nThe warm-up speakers, except for Sarasota County GOP Chairman Joe Gruters, were unconventional picks with strategic purposes far beyond just praising Trump or demonstrating political support.\n\nThey were there to remind everyone in the audience what they already felt: that unchecked immigration and corporate greed were screwing or even killing regular Americans, and that the country needs a new president who\u2019s not afraid to say so.\n\nThree early speakers, including employment law attorney Sara Blackwell of Tampa, were there to tell the story of Walt Disney World\u2019s 2014 firing of scores of tech workers so that the company could replace them with cheap foreign labor brought in on HB-1 visas.\n\nThey were followed by Laura Wilkerson, whose 18-year-old-son Josh was brutally slain by an illegal immigrant.\n\nThe country she and the others described, and which Trump came to save, is a country in anarchy, where corporations do whatever they want to people, and immigrants steal jobs and perform unspeakable crimes.\n\nRelated\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "donald trump, florida\u2019s presidential primary, orlando, republicans, speech, university of central florida", "generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 5.1.6 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface.", "og": {"site_name": "SaintPetersBlog", "description": "Republican front-runner Donald Trump found his anti-establishment crowd in full throat in Orlando Saturday and assured them \u201cIf we win \u2026", "title": "Donald Trump assures Orlando throng \"If we win Florida, it's over\" - SaintPetersBlog", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3628, "identifier": "http://saintpetersblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Donald-Trump-at-UCF-e1457222524177.jpg", "height": 1520}, "updated_time": "2016-03-05T21:55:07-04:00", "url": "http://saintpetersblog.com/donald-trump-assures-orlando-throng-win-florida/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 2500, "app_id": 593344034036788}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SaintPetersblog", "section": 2016, "tag": "University of Central Florida", "published_time": "2016-03-05T19:02:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-05T21:55:07-04:00"}, "theme-color": "#081341"}, "article_summary": "People chanted \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d or \u201cWe want Trump!\u201d or \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump!\u201d with a thunder that UCF Knights cheerleaders would be proud to inspire.\nIt\u2019s all gonna change,\u201d Trump said.\nThis is what Rubio, the other candidates, and Trump critics in both parties must understand and deal with: This crowd wants Trump as much as Trump wants their votes.\n\u201cIf we win Florida, believe me, it\u2019s over!\u201d Trump said more than once.\nIt\u2019s all gonna change."}
