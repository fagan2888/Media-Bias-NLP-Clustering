The Commonwealth Fund, a health research group, finds that ObamaCare is making a dent but that the rate remains high.\n\nIt reports that the uninsured rate for Hispanics declined from 40 percent in 2012 to 34 percent in 2014, amid ObamaCare\u2019s expansion. But that is compared to a decline of 20 percent to 18 percent among blacks and 14 percent to 10 percent among whites.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund analysis points to ObamaCare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor, as a major factor.\n\nIn states that have accepted the expansion of eligibility, 26 percent of Hispanics are uninsured, compared to a much higher 46 percent in states that have rejected the expansion, the analysis finds.\n\nTexas and Florida, it notes, are home to the largest proportion of uninsured Hispanics. The Republican governors of the two states have rejected a Medicaid expansion and have backed a lawsuit against the Obama administration over what they call an effort to force their states to expand the program by linking separate federal funds to the decision.\n\nThe analysis also points to barriers that need to be overcome with outreach. It finds that 79 percent of uninsured Latinos speak English \u201cjust a little\u201d or \u201cnot at all.\u201d\n\nIt points to California as an example. The state does not have a five-year waiting period for legal immigrants to be eligible, and has invested in an outreach push. A Kaiser Family Foundation study found that half of all previously uninsured Hispanics in the state gained coverage during ObamaCare\u2019s first year of enrollment.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell acknowledged last month that for African-Americans and Hispanics, the statistics are \"not probably exactly where you want to be because the numbers are still high.\"\n\nShe noted efforts during ObamaCare\u2019s enrollment period to encourage sign-ups, including her stop at a largely African-American church in Texas, a Hispanic ad buy, and messages on receipts at 7-Elevens.\n\n\"We did a lot of things to highly target those communities,\" Burwell said. \"I believe we can do more.\"\n\n\"We tried a lot of things,\" she added. \"And now we have to analyze which ones work.\"\n\nOn Monday, Burwell marked the anniversary of a landmark 1985 report on minority health. She noted gains in minority coverage from the Affordable Care Act, but said there is more work to do.\n\n\"Although we\u2019ve bridged some of the coverage gap, minorities are still more likely to be uninsured than white Americans,\" she said. \"That\u2019s why we still have more work to do to make sure our health system is working for communities of color.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The uninsured rate among Hispanics has long been higher than for other groups.", "description": "The uninsured rate among Hispanics has long been higher than for other groups.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The uninsured rate among Hispanics has long been higher than for other groups.", "title": "Study: ObamaCare, outreach could boost Hispanic health coverage", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/240205-study-points-to-obamacare-outreach-to-boost-latino-coverage", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/240205-study-points-to-obamacare-outreach-to-boost-latino-coverage", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-27T16:11-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-27T16:11:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/240205-study-points-to-obamacare-outreach-to-boost-latino-coverage", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The uninsured rate among Hispanics has long been higher than for other groups.", "card": "summary", "title": "Study: ObamaCare, outreach could boost Hispanic health coverage"}, "dcterms.title": "Study: ObamaCare, outreach could boost Hispanic health coverage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe27b2\"", "article_summary": "A new analysis points to expanding Medicaid under ObamaCare and improving outreach efforts as ways to lower the stubbornly high uninsured rate among Hispanics.\nThe Commonwealth Fund analysis points to ObamaCare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor, as a major factor.\nA Kaiser Family Foundation study found that half of all previously uninsured Hispanics in the state gained coverage during ObamaCare\u2019s first year of enrollment.\nIt reports that the uninsured rate for Hispanics declined from 40 percent in 2012 to 34 percent in 2014, amid ObamaCare\u2019s expansion.\nTexas and Florida, it notes, are home to the largest proportion of uninsured Hispanics."}
