If he goes ahead with executive action on immigration reform, the gulf between the President and the GOP will be wider than ever, portending more government gridlock.\n\nObama, White House aides and environmentalists hailed the agreement as a major breakthrough that will create momentum for other world leaders heading into next year\u2019s major international climate change meeting in Paris, where representatives will take another big step towards a treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that scientists have closely linked to global warming.\n\nActually, the drumbeat began late last month when leaders of the 28 European Union nations agreed on what they called the world\u2019s most ambitious climate change targets for 2030 \u2013 managing to overcome divisions between poorer countries that are strongly dependent on fossil fuels for energy and wealthier countries that are more reliant on \u201cgreen power.\u201d\n\nIn another surprise Sept. 30, Obama and visiting India Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an important agreement that would greatly increase India\u2019s use of renewable fuels \u2013 including solar power \u2013 and gradually reduce global emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, industrial chemicals that emit heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. India is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. and China together account for more than a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, so together we have an especially important role to play in fighting climate change,\u201d White House counselor John Podesta wrote in an email yesterday.\n\nRelated: India\u2019s Resistance to Climate Change Gives Way to Deal\n\nOpponents of this new, more dramatic commitment \u2013 as it has been from almost the day Obama took office six years ago \u2013 are Republicans and some moderate Democrats who view any measure to rein in carbon emissions as a frontal assault on utility companies, major industrial plants and the struggling coal industry. McConnell premised much of his reelection campaign on fighting Environmental Protection Agency regulations that would hurt Kentucky coal miners and utility plants. McConnell predictably lashed out at the U.S-China agreement as a bad bargain that he would resist.\n\n\u201cThe president continues to send a signal that he has no intention of moving toward the middle,\u201d McConnell told reporters during a morning coffee with 10 newly elected Republican senators in his office. \u201cI was particularly distressed by the deal he\u2019s reached with the Chinese on his current trip, which, as I read the agreement, it requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years, while these carbon emission regulations are creating havoc in my state and other states across the country.\u201d\n\nMcConnell, who is expected to be the new Senate Majority Leader when Republicans take control of the Senate in January, made it clear that Obama is quickly squandering any prospects for bipartisan deal making in the 114th Congress.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), issued a statement of his own that Obama \u201cintends to double down on his job-crushing policies no matter how devastating the impact,\u201d and vowed that he and other Republican lawmakers would make it a high priority to continue to block the president\u2019s energy and environmental policies for the remainder of his term.\n\nRelated: Obama Fights Global Warming, One Hot Spot at a Time\n\nOther GOP critics agreed with the leadership that Obama struck a bad deal with the Chinese, one that puts the onus on U.S. industry to scale back, close power plants and lay off workers, while the Chinese must only move more quickly towards alternative energy sources.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good deal for us,\u201d Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND) told MSNBC yesterday. \u201cThere are no limitations on China\u2019s emissions, so I don\u2019t see how that accomplishes what the President was trying to do.\u201d\n\nSen. James Inhofe (R-OK), who is line to become the next chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, called the agreement \u201chollow and not believable.\u201d Inhofe has written and spoken widely to advance his theory that global warming is a hoax.\n\nJake Schmidt, Director of International Programs at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), disagreed, telling MSNBC, \u201cThese are two of the biggest emitters, so the kinds of signals they send in terms of how they\u2019re going to support more clean energy is both powerful in terms of reducing emissions.\u201d\n\nEPA administrator Gina McCarthy said Obama has emphasized the importance of curbing greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change for months, according to the The Washington Post. \u201cThe president has been very clear in the direction he is moving,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cHe is not changing at all.\u201d\n\nRelated: Climate Change Costs Could Soar to the Billions\n\nWhile technically there is little that GOP lawmakers can do to block the U.S.-China climate agreement, McConnell\u2019s aides \u201chave already started investigating ways they could block or delay implementation of the EPA\u2019s proposed rule to limit greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants, which is set to become final next June,\u201d according to The Post.\n\nThe EPA in June proposed a rule designed to reduce carbon emissions from existing coal-fired plants by as much as a third by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. The regulation has prompted aggressive lobbying from industry and environmental groups. Existing power plants \u2013 the largest source of the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, account for 38 percent of the total emissions.\n\nGOP strategies might include lawsuits and efforts by governors and state officials in red states to refuse to comply with the EPA mandate, not unlike the scores of states that refused to participate in the Affordable Care Act or expand their Medicaid programs with federal aid.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said last week that if President Obama goes ahead with his threat to impose immigration reform by executive fiat, that it would be tantamount to \u201cwaving a red flag in front of a bull.\u201d On Wednesday, Obama waved another red flag in front of the GOP bulls \u2013 this time a surprise climate-change agreement with China President Xi Jinping that commits the U.S. to emitting 26 percent to 28 percent less carbon in 2025 than it did in 2005.", "title": "GOP Leaders Fume over Obama\u2019s Climate Deal with China", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/13/GOP-Leaders-Fume-over-Obama-s-Climate-Deal-China", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11132014_Obama_China.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/13/GOP-Leaders-Fume-over-Obama-s-Climate-Deal-China", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11132014_Obama_China.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said last week that if President Obama goes ahead with his threat to impose immigration reform by executive fiat, that it would be tantamount to \u201cwaving a red flag in front of a bull.\u201d On Wednesday, Obama waved another red flag in front of the GOP bulls \u2013 this time a surprise climate-change agreement with China President Xi Jinping that commits the U.S. to emitting 26 percent to 28 percent less carbon in 2025 than it did in 2005.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe5d\"", "article_summary": "Existing power plants \u2013 the largest source of the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, account for 38 percent of the total emissions.\nIndia is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions.\nWHY THIS MATTERSPutting aside any disagreement over climate change, President Obama\u2019s unilateral action has once again blindsided Republicans and sent a signal that he will act on his own during the last two plus years of his term.\n\u201cThe U.S. and China together account for more than a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, so together we have an especially important role to play in fighting climate change,\u201d White House counselor John Podesta wrote in an email yesterday.\nIf he goes ahead with executive action on immigration reform, the gulf between the President and the GOP will be wider than ever, portending more government gridlock."}
