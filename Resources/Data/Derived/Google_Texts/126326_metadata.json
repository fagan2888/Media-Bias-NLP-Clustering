These recommended preventive services are designed to help people stay healthy and to catch illnesses earlier on, when treatments can be more successful and costs are often lower.\n\nThe new federal guidance states that non-grandfathered health plans and insurers cannot limit coverage of preventive services to those that are specific to the person\u2019s sex assigned at birth, gender identity, or recorded gender. Insurers should cover the preventive services that an individual\u2019s provider, not an insurance company, determines are medically appropriate. This means, for example, that a transgender man with an intact cervix can get coverage without cost sharing for a pap smear, if recommended by his provider. This guidance helps ensure that transgender individuals get the preventive services they need.\n\nThe guidance on sex-specific services was one of several clarifications on preventive services protections the Departments issued.
