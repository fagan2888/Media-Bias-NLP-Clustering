And his appearance could shed more light on his status with his team and the Broncos\u2019 push for a trade.\n\nA Kaepernick sighting Monday could be an indicator talks have stalled with the Broncos, or that the 49ers remain intent on keeping him. His absence could be a sign of two things: that the 49ers told him to stay away to avoid distraction as trade negotiations continue, or that he has no desire to return to the 49ers in 2016 and discussions on a revised contract with Denver will continue.\n\nKaepernick met with Broncos general manager John Elway in Denver on Thursday, the day his $11.9 million salary was guaranteed. The chance the 49ers would release him ended at 2 p.m. that day, but the possibility of a trade remains open.\n\nIt\u2019s likely the Broncos and 49ers could reach an agreement on draft pick compensation, but the sticking point is Kaepernick\u2019s contract, specifically his pay for 2016. The Broncos want him to restructure his deal or take a pay cut to clear up salary cap space. Denver has only $1.62 million in cap space, and Kaepernick carries a $15.9 million hit for 2016.\n\nBroncos outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware revised his contract by converting part of his guaranteed money into a signing bonus and adding incentives to lower his base salary. Kaepernick has been asked to do the same.\n\nTo clear up additional cap space, the Broncos could release offensive tackle Ryan Clady, who is due $9.5 million in salary this season.\n\nSince last November, Kaepernick has undergone three surgeries and has been rehabilitating in Vail for much of the offseason. It\u2019s not publicly known whether he has been cleared to participate in workouts. But his $400,000 return for rehab Monday could speak volumes.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala\n\nUpdated April 4, 2016 at 10:30 a.m. This story was updated to clarify that Colin Kaepernick must attend rehabilitation or 90 percent of the team\u2019s offseason workouts in order to receive the $400,000 bonus.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colin Kaepernick can collect $400k bonus with 49ers, if he shows up", "title": "Colin Kaepernick can collect $400k bonus with 49ers, if he shows up", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/03/colin-kaepernick-can-collect-400k-bonus-with-49ers-if-he-shows-up/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160403__Colin_Kaepernickp1.jpg", "height": 461}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160403__Colin_Kaepernickp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-03T16:26:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T23:09:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Kaepernick met with Broncos general manager John Elway in Denver on Thursday, the day his $11.9 million salary was guaranteed.\nThis story was updated to clarify that Colin Kaepernick must attend rehabilitation or 90 percent of the team\u2019s offseason workouts in order to receive the $400,000 bonus.\nDenver has only $1.62 million in cap space, and Kaepernick carries a $15.9 million hit for 2016.\nQuarterback Colin Kaepernick will collect a $400,000 workout bonus if he arrives at the 49ers\u2019 facility in Santa Clara, Calif., for rehabilitation or participates in 90 percent of the team\u2019s workouts.\nA Kaepernick sighting Monday could be an indicator talks have stalled with the Broncos, or that the 49ers remain intent on keeping him."}
