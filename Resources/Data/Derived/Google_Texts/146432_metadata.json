Huffman, M.D., of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and Padinhare P. Mohanan, M.D., of Kerala, India's Westford-HiTech Hospital.\n\nTo handle this imbalance, Indian doctors began limiting blood-pressure measurement to systolic blood pressure instead of measuring both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. That simple step saves physicians a half an hour each day, according to the post. While U.S. clinicians aren't likely to take this particular step, even though most doctors base care decisions on systolic blood pressure, it illustrates just how much of healthcare providers' routines involve collecting data that have no effect on treatment, Huffman and Mohanan write.\n\nIndia and other densely populated regions such as sub-Saharan Africa also have the problem of clinician shortages in common with the U.S. But they increasingly use more nonphysician and community health workers, according to the commentary. Comparatively, a minority of U.S. states have laws regulating community health workers and their scope of practice, despite their demonstrable value in improving care and outcomes.\n\nU.S. healthcare can also take inspiration from India's use of a \"hub-and-spoke\" healthcare model, in which major hospitals operate in the nation's large cities with smaller providers in nearby rural areas, as well as keeping costs under control through strategies such as using locally-manufactured devices and, safety permitting, reusing sterilized devices rather than discarding them after a single use, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the commentary\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n5 ways community health worker programs can improve post-ACA\n\n3 lessons U.S. hospitals can learn from India\n\n12 steps to the perfect health system\n\nCommonwealth Fund: U.S. healthcare is most expensive but last in quality\n\nCommunity health workers can help hospitals improve outcomes", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research has shown that U.S. healthcare\u00a0lags behind that of other developed Western nations, but America's healthcare system could also take cues from India in its efforts to make care more efficient,\u00a0argues\u00a0a blog post published on\u00a0NEJM Catalyst.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Research has shown that U.S. healthcare\u00a0lags behind that of other developed Western nations, but America's healthcare system could also take cues from India in its efforts to make care more efficient,\u00a0argues\u00a0a blog post published on\u00a0NEJM Catalyst.", "title": "Lessons in healthcare efficiency from India", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/lessons-healthcare-efficiency-india/2016-01-22", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,clinician shortage,community health workers,healthcare efficiency,India,international healthcare,non-clinician workers,Patient Care & Outcomes,scope of practice", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "But they increasingly use more nonphysician and community health workers, according to the commentary.\nComparatively, a minority of U.S. states have laws regulating community health workers and their scope of practice, despite their demonstrable value in improving care and outcomes.\nTo handle this imbalance, Indian doctors began limiting blood-pressure measurement to systolic blood pressure instead of measuring both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.\nResearch has shown that U.S. healthcare lags behind that of other developed Western nations, but America's healthcare system could also take cues from India in its efforts to make care more efficient, argues a blog post published on NEJM Catalyst.\nLike their counterparts in high-income nations, providers in middle-to-low-income nations such as India often face high patient volumes and large provider-to-patient ratios, write Mark D.
