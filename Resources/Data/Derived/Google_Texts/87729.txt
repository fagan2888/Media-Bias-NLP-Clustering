In remarks Monday to The Commercial Appeal’s editorial board, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said the social and economic progress ushered in by the “nameless, faceless marchers” of the Memphis sanitation workers strike in 1968 is under assault across the South by opponents of health care reform and similar programs for the poor.

King is in town for activities surrounding April 4, the date that King was killed at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis in 1968.

“The irony is there is an undercurrent of backlash, inexplicably, against the New South progress,” Jackson said.

The marchers and other activists, he said, “pulled the walls down,” bringing an end to legal segregation and unfair practices and making possible the industrial shift to the South and the economic expansion of the region in recent decades.

“You couldn’t have FedEx in Memphis, CNN in Atlanta” without that social progress, Jackson said.

“There was a low cloud over the South because of these historic relationships.”

But today, he said, Southern governors and legislators are following a “Confederate ideology” in rejecting billions of dollars from Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

Jackson also criticized campaign remarks by Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, who has called for both the curtailing of the immigration of Muslims into the U.S. and the construction of a massive wall along the Mexican border.

“Jesus was a refugee,” Jackson said. The apparent preference of many Christians, he added, is to “worship a refugee on Sunday and shut ‘em out on Monday.”
