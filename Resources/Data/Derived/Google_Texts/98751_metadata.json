The use of barrel bombs - oil drums or cylinders packed with explosives and shrapnel - has drawn international condemnation.\n\n\"We don't see any notable preparation for the temporary cessation of hostilities,\" Warren said.\n\nRussia says its air strikes are targeting Islamic State militants, while the United States has said it is strengthening Assad and targeting moderate rebel groups.\n\nMissile attacks in rebel-held areas of northern Syria on Monday killed scores of civilians and struck medical facilities and schools. Turkish officials blamed Russia for the strikes and accused it of carrying out war crimes. A Russian official said its air strikes were targeting Islamic State infrastructure and not civilian sites.\n\nWarren said on Wednesday that Russian and Syrian planes were conducting strikes in the areas where hospitals were hit, although he said the United States was not sure which country had carried out the strikes.\n\n\"Russian and (Syrian) regime aircraft conducted strikes in those areas, and those hospitals were hit,\" Warren said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said the United States could not \"definitively\" say who was responsible for strikes on hospitals in northern Syria. U.S.-led coalition planes were not responsible for the hospital strikes, Cook said.\n\n(Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati; Editing by Andrew Hay)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Major powers agreed last week to a limited cessation of hostilities in Syria, in a dea", "title": "Russian air strikes in Syria intensifying: U.S. military", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/17/Russian-air-strikes-Syria-intensifying-US-military", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-russia_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/17/Russian-air-strikes-Syria-intensifying-US-military", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-russia_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Major powers agreed last week to a limited cessation of hostilities in Syria, in a dea", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14d7\"", "article_summary": "Russia says the \"cessation\" does not apply to its air strikes, which have shifted the balance of power towards Assad.\nA Russian official said its air strikes were targeting Islamic State infrastructure and not civilian sites.\nRussia says its air strikes are targeting Islamic State militants, while the United States has said it is strengthening Assad and targeting moderate rebel groups.\nOn Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said the United States could not \"definitively\" say who was responsible for strikes on hospitals in northern Syria.\n\"Russian and (Syrian) regime aircraft conducted strikes in those areas, and those hospitals were hit,\" Warren said."}
