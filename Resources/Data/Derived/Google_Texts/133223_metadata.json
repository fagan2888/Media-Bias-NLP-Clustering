This year\u2019s Flag Day is extra special because it coincides with the 200th anniversary year of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d the flag-inspired song that later became our national anthem.\n\nAs familiar as the nation\u2019s colors are to most of us, five facts about the first Flag Day are quite surprising.\n\n1.) The U.S. flag wasn\u2019t Congress\u2018 top priority on the first Flag Day. Because companies today spend big bucks and countless hours on releasing the next must-have iPhone or must-see \u201cSpider-Man\u201d movie, it\u2019s hard to imagine a time when no one put much thought into marketing new things. When the Continental Congress met on Saturday, June 14, 1777, topping its agenda was paying bills, followed by worrying about an enemy invasion on the Delaware River. The U.S. flag was the fifth of numerous business items \u2014 including sending 2,000 bushels of salt to New York. According to its journal:\n\n\u201cResolved, that the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white: that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it. In just 31 words, Congress officially issued what is now the most recognizable symbol of the USA.\n\n2.) Congress didn\u2019t mention Betsy Ross or George Washington on the first Flag Day. Why not? Wasn\u2019t Betsy Ross the first to sew the flag? The long-held story is that Washington and two other men, including an uncle of Ross\u2019 deceased husband, came to her Philadelphia upholstery shop and asked her to create the first U.S. flag. Agreeing to try, she used an efficient technique for cutting five-sided stars.\n\nThe problem is a lack of evidence. No letter or drawing from Washington to Ross exists. Congress\u2018 journal entry on June 14, 1777 doesn\u2019t mention Ross or Washington. In May 1777, Pennsylvania\u2019s State Navy Board paid Ross for making flags, which could have included the nation\u2019s first. Though the lack of hard evidence makes it impossible to prove for sure that she stitched the first Stars and Stripes, her grandchildren were so confident that they signed sworn affidavits stating that she did. Hence, the legend of Betsy Ross was born as much from swearing as from sewing.\n\n3.) Congress unwittingly commissioned the Revolution\u2019s most notorious traitor on the first Flag Day. On June 14, 1777, Congress finally gave Gen. Benedict Arnold what he most wanted: a command. They ordered him to take control of all militia from Bristol, Pa., to Philadelphia. They also resolved \u201cthat he be authorized to dispose of himself and the troops under his command, in such a manner as he shall deem best adapted to promote the public service.\u201d\n\nThree years later, after a court-martial questioned his leadership tactics in Philadelphia, Arnold committed treason. By giving detailed plans about New York\u2019s West Point to the British, he became the Revolution\u2019s most notorious traitor and broke the trust that Congress gave him that first Flag Day.\n\n4.) Congress also commissioned the first U.S. Navy hero on the first Flag Day. After the flag, the next order of business was to suspend a ship captain of questionable character. They replaced him with John Paul Jones.\n\nLittle did they know that two years later, the flag would play a role in his most famous words. During a sea battle with a British ship, the U.S. flag disappeared from Jones\u2019 mast, either from cannon fire or from someone deliberately taking it down to signal that the Americans were ready to quit \u2014 but Jones wasn\u2019t. \u201cSurrender? I have not yet begun to fight!\u201d While his ship sank, Jones captured the British ship, making him the nation\u2019s first Navy hero.\n\n5.) Congress failed to explain the meaning of \u201cred, white and blue\u201d on the first Flag Day. The first flag\u2019s 13 stripes and stars obviously represented the 13 new states. Yet, that\u2019s the only symbolism that Congress described that day.\n\nFive years later on June 20, 1782, Congress finally defined the colors when they created the U.S. seal, which features an eagle with a shield. \u201cThe colors \u2026 are those used in the flag of the United States of America. White signifies purity and innocence. Red, hardiness and valor; and blue \u2026 signifies vigilance, perseverance and justice.\u201d\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they explain the colors earlier? Perhaps Congress couldn\u2019t define the colors on the first Flag Day because they didn\u2019t know what the colors truly meant.\n\nIn 1777, they were stitching a revolution out of a civil war fabric, but by 1782, with the war ending and people united, they understood Jones\u2019 red stripe of valor. They knew Washington had told his army that they weren\u2019t fighting for themselves, but for the pure motive of the \u201cunborn millions\u201d to come. They understood the need for true-blue justice after Arnold\u2019s treason.\n\nThanks to the first Flag Day and Congress\u2018 definitions, we know what our flag means. We also hoist flags today because we know and have heard \u201cthe broad stripes and bright stars.\u201d Seeing Fort McHenry\u2019s giant flag on the morning of Sept. 14, 1814, proved to Francis Scott Key, a Maryland lawyer, that the Americans in Baltimore had defied the British Navy. Forever inspired by the Stars and Stripes, Key wrote an anthem for the ages. His song became America\u2019s \u201cStar-Spangled Banner.\u201d\n\nWe also know what the colors mean because we have heard the stories of grandfathers who stormed Normandy\u2019s beaches and raised the flag at Iwo Jima during World War II. We know of those who placed a flag on the moon and those who fought in Vietnam. We know sons and daughters who made sacrifices in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nWhile several facts about the first Flag Day may surprise us today, we hoist our flags on Flag Day for one simple reason. We know our colors.\n\nJane Hampton Cook is a national media commentator and the author of eight books, including \u201cAmerica\u2019s Star-Spangled Story: Celebrating 200 Years of the National Anthem\u201d (Lighthouse Publishing of the Carolinas).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Each year, Flag Day takes place on June 14, the day in 1777 when the Continental Congress officially issued the U.S. flag.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Each year, Flag Day takes place on June 14, the day in 1777 when the Continental Congress officially issued the U.S. flag.", "title": "COOK: The first Flag Day", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/12/cook-the-first-flag-day/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/12/6_122014_b3-cook-betsy-flag-8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/12/6_122014_b3-cook-betsy-flag-8201.jpg", "description": "Each year, Flag Day takes place on June 14, the day in 1777 when the Continental Congress officially issued the U.S. flag.", "card": "summary", "title": "COOK: The first Flag Day"}, "Author": "Jane Hampton Cook", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Flag Day, Congress, The Star, Benedict Arnold, George Washington"}, "article_summary": "While several facts about the first Flag Day may surprise us today, we hoist our flags on Flag Day for one simple reason.\nANALYSIS/OPINION:Each year, Flag Day takes place on June 14, the day in 1777 when the Continental Congress officially issued the U.S. flag.\nThe U.S. flag wasn\u2019t Congress\u2018 top priority on the first Flag Day.\nThanks to the first Flag Day and Congress\u2018 definitions, we know what our flag means.\nAs familiar as the nation\u2019s colors are to most of us, five facts about the first Flag Day are quite surprising."}
