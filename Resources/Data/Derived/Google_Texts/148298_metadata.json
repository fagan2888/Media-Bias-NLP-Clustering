Ted Cruz called for returning the United States to the gold standard. The loud sound heard across the nation immediately afterward came as thousands of economists and monetary policy experts simultaneously slapped palms to faces in disbelief.\n\nThe gold standard requires U.S. dollars to be backed by a fixed amount of actual gold held by the government and redeemable on request by anyone in possession of paper currency. The U.S. abandoned the gold standard in practice in 1933 and by law in 1976, in favor of what is known as fiat money. The dollar bills in circulation today are worth something not because they can be redeemed for gold but by law which declares them \u201clegal tender.\u201d\n\nRelated: Fact Checkers Working Overtime \u2013 Top Whoppers from the GOP Debate\n\nEconomists are almost universal in the belief that a return to the gold standard would be absolutely disastrous for the United States economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically seen as nuts, and I think even most conservative economists would say that,\u201d said David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution. \u201cWe learned the hard way that the gold standard does not bring financial stability. We learned that it\u2019s really bad to have a money supply that\u2019s restricted to the amount of gold you can mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are two fundamental problems with a gold standard or any kind of commodity standard,\u201d said economist Bert Ely of Ely & Co. in Alexandria, VA. \u201cOne, the standard is a price-fixing mechanism that requires taxpayer-backing. Two, the supply of gold or whatever commodity is used as the standard, relative to demand for that commodity, will vary over time, which is why such standards eventually fail, after a bout of inflation or deflation.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe gold standard? Seriously?\n\nThere are some big name economists who have expressed support for the gold standard. Most prominent among them, former Federal Reserve Board Chair Alan Greenspan wrote a sympathetic paper in 1966 defending it and continued to defend it, a bit more cautiously, as Fed chair.\n\nRelated: Looks Like Congress Can\u2019t Stand the Idea of an Independent Federal Reserve\n\nBut at the Fed, the times have clearly changed. Former chairman Ben Bernanke, in multiple forums, has dismissed the idea of a return to the gold standard. In 2012, he explained that limiting the central bank\u2019s ability to adjust currency levels to arbitrary amounts of gold in the Treasury, \u201cmeans swearing that no matter how bad unemployment gets you are not going to do anything about it.\u201d\n\nHowever, Sen. Cruz is far from alone in his desire to take the country back to the gold standard. In the same debate last night, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul warned, despite all evidence to the contrary, that the Fed has in recent years \u201cdestroyed\u201d the value of the dollar.\n\n\u201cAs the Federal Reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you\u2019re finding is that, if you\u2019re poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you\u2019re trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t take it as far as Cruz, but the complaint he outlined are generally a prelude to a call for a return to the gold standard, which would deprive the Fed of the ability to increase the money supply when policymakers feel it is necessary.\n\nRelated: Trump Gets Thumped in Fourth GOP Debate\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, is a longtime advocate of returning to the gold standard and has sponsored the Sound Dollar Act, which would limit the ability of the Fed to exercise discretion in monetary policy and would remove the central bank\u2019s mandate to pursue policies that lead to full employment.\n\nHowever, if the overwhelming majority of economists believe that returning to the gold standard is a horrible idea \u2013 and they do \u2013 why would lawmakers like Cruz, Paul, and Brady continue to pursue it?\n\nWessel, of the Hutchins Center, has a theory.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s always been this strain in American politics that somehow we don\u2019t trust the government,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is true, if you have paper money and the supply of the money is controlled by an entity like the Fed, you have to trust the Fed to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nThe desire to put more limits on the Fed\u2019s authority, he suggests, is \u201ca manifestation of that distrust in government.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "During the Republican presidential primary debate Tuesday night, Texas Sen.", "title": "Here\u2019s Why the GOP Can\u2019t Stop Talking About the Gold Standard", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/11/Here-s-Why-GOP-Can-t-Stop-Talking-About-Gold-Standard", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-04-16T210442Z_1_CBRE93F1MKG00_RTROPTP_2_JAPAN-GOLD.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/11/Here-s-Why-GOP-Can-t-Stop-Talking-About-Gold-Standard", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-04-16T210442Z_1_CBRE93F1MKG00_RTROPTP_2_JAPAN-GOLD.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "During the Republican presidential primary debate Tuesday night, Texas Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Former chairman Ben Bernanke, in multiple forums, has dismissed the idea of a return to the gold standard.\nThe gold standard requires U.S. dollars to be backed by a fixed amount of actual gold held by the government and redeemable on request by anyone in possession of paper currency.\n\u201cWe learned the hard way that the gold standard does not bring financial stability.\nDuring the Republican presidential primary debate Tuesday night, Texas Sen.
