We\u2019d gone out for drinks the night before. After two glasses of wine, Gina admitted she wouldn\u2019t mind having one. We were in this little Brooklyn Heights, N.Y., bistro with red-checkered tablecloths.\n\n\u201cThat is, if the man was European, and he went back to his own country after a couple of lovely afternoons together. Maybe he could be French.\u201d Gina sipped her pinot.\n\nI agreed I\u2019d like to have an affair. \u201cI mean, in the vaguest possible sense with the most generalized of men,\u201d I said. \u201cNot with a real man who exists, mind you. I don\u2019t want to have an affair with someone who gains weight or doesn\u2019t pick up after himself. A European gentleman sounds nice to me, too.\u201d\n\nThe next day, I happened to be on the second floor of my building to sign up for Lunchtime Toning and Stretching. I had been spending too much time writing about the world\u2019s latest earthquake at the relief organization where I worked, and I was ready to get back on an exercise regimen. I also knew it was the floor that Dag worked on, so I poked my head into his office to say hello. (Dag is not his name, by the way. I changed his name, along with others, to protect his identity.) I\u2019d met Dag a few weeks before, when our sons had a play date at my house, and we discovered we worked in the same Upper West Side office building. Not long after, he\u2019d called me and we\u2019d lunched in the cafeteria together.\n\n\u201cOh, this is a pleasant and welcome surprise,\u201d he said when he saw me. He leaned on his R\u2019s, kind of like Sean Connery, although he wasn\u2019t Scottish or Welsh. He was some non-English speaking European, Swiss or Dutch. Not French, I thought.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair with his arms folded behind his head. A very inviting and open posture. He was clean-cut, boyishly good-looking in a Tim Robbins kind of way.\n\n\u201cI just had to sign up for exercise,\u201d I said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d stop in and say hi.\u201d I tried to look relaxed as I took a seat. I realized my hands were cold, so I sat on them. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d be in your office. You travel, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I go to Mystic one day a week. I told you that, right?\u201d\n\nAnd that was it. My mind was already off and running: Why does he keep telling me about Mystic? Is that where he wants to have our liaison? Mystic sounds very romantic. Did he mention it for some reason? Mystic, Mystic: Is it code for something? I could get away one day a week, couldn\u2019t I?\n\n\u201cDo you have to spend the night away?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo, I go back and forth by train,\u201d he said.\n\nI was deflated. How silly of me. There was no deeper meaning to Mystic. I wasn\u2019t going to have an affair on the commuter train. I wished Gina had never opened her mouth last night.\n\n\u201cYour office seems kinda empty,\u201d I said. His son\u2019s artwork hung up on the wall \u2014 a rainbow.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just moved in. And we\u2019re moving the rest of the staff here. From Mystic.\u201d He leaned forward and looked into my eyes when he said it.\n\nThere it was again. That same sly, flirty tone. Oh, all right already. Mystic, it is!\n\nI mean, Dag and I should be friends at least. We had a lot in common. We both had wild 7-year-old sons. We both worked for Christian relief organizations in the same building. We were both totally burned out and sick of our work.\n\nWe had bonded on that point for the whole 45 minutes at the cafeteria. That day, Dag was talking so close to me that my friends looked over quizzically from a nearby table, as if to ask, \u201cWho are you talking to? And why are you talking so close?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The attraction was all in my mind -- but it unleashed feelings of loneliness and desire I never knew I had", "title": "A fake affair destroyed me", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The attraction was all in my mind -- but it unleashed feelings of loneliness and desire I never knew I had", "title": "A fake affair destroyed me", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/29/a_fake_affair_destroyed_me/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/man_reclining.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The attraction was all in my mind -- but it unleashed feelings of loneliness and desire I never knew I had", "title": "A fake affair destroyed me", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/man_reclining.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "MB Coudal", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Infidelity, Life stories, Love and Sex", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2bf8\"", "article_summary": "Mystic, Mystic: Is it code for something?\nTopics: Infidelity, Life stories, Love and Sex, Life NewsIt was Gina who put the affair in my mind.\nI also knew it was the floor that Dag worked on, so I poked my head into his office to say hello.\nI don\u2019t want to have an affair with someone who gains weight or doesn\u2019t pick up after himself.\nThat day, Dag was talking so close to me that my friends looked over quizzically from a nearby table, as if to ask, \u201cWho are you talking to?"}
