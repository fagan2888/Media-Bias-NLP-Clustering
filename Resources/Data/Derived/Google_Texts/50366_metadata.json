Using epidemiological models \u2014 those used to study the spread of infectious diseases \u2014 and Google search data, researchers John Cannarella and Joshua D. Spechler looked at the rise of social networks like Facebook, where, they write, \u201cadoption is analogous to infection and abandonment is analogous to recovery.\u201d\n\nTheir conclusion (see the PDF here) paints a dire prognosis for Facebook: The social network, which turns 10 next month, has passed the peak of its popularity and is already in decline. That idea may not be new given all the reports about how younger users are abandoning the service, but the speed at which the study expects Facebook to collapse is surprising and dramatic: \u201cExtrapolating the best \ufb01t model into the future suggests that Facebook will undergo a rapid decline in the coming years, losing 80% of its peak user base between 2015 and 2017.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Your Favorite Social Network Will Probably Die\n\nSo is Facebook, with nearly 1.2 billion monthly active users as of September, really set to go the way of smallpox, and before the end of the decade at that? As Chris Gayomali at Fast Company and others point out, there are at least a couple of reasons to be skeptical.\n\nFirst, the researchers tested their model by looking at another social network that actually did have a meteoric rise and fall: MySpace. \u201cObviously, Facebook has the luxury of MySpace\u2019s past missteps to guide its future growth,\u201d Gayomali writes. Where MySpace struggled to adapt under News Corp. ownership in order to keep and expand its user base, Facebook has so far been better at updating and evolving its offerings.\n\nWhile plenty of competitors are looking to wipe out Facebook\u2019s business \u2013 and some, like WhatsApp, Snapchat or Twitter \u2013 have \u201cburied\u201d Facebook among teens, no single replacement has yet emerged to kill off Facebook the way Facebook itself did to MySpace. The kids may be moving on, but mom and dad and grandma and grandpa have settled in.\n\nRelated: How My Mom Killed Facebook\n\nSecond, the use of Google Trends search data may have had more relevance when MySpace was hot, but it might not be the best way to judge the life expectancy of Facebook or any other social network these days, when more and more people are logging in using apps on mobile devices. Facebook\u2019s global user base continued to climb even after its Google search interest started to slide.\n\nThe study in the journal arXiv also hasn\u2019t been peer-reviewed yet, so other experts may still find methodological or conceptual flaws. Investors, clearly, aren\u2019t too worried. Facebook\u2019s stock has soared nearly 90 percent over the past 12 months and remains near its 52-week peak. The company is set to report earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2013 on Jan. 29.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new study by researchers at Princeton University\u2019s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering gives a deeper meaning to the idea of \u201cgoing viral\u201d when it comes to social media.", "title": "Wild Prediction: Facebook Will Suffer a Quick, Viral Death", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/22/Wild-Prediction-Facebook-Will-Suffer-Quick-Viral-Death-0", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07032013_State_Dept_Facebook_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/22/Wild-Prediction-Facebook-Will-Suffer-Quick-Viral-Death-0", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07032013_State_Dept_Facebook_article.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A new study by researchers at Princeton University\u2019s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering gives a deeper meaning to the idea of \u201cgoing viral\u201d when it comes to social media.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf4e\"", "article_summary": "First, the researchers tested their model by looking at another social network that actually did have a meteoric rise and fall: MySpace.\nWhile plenty of competitors are looking to wipe out Facebook\u2019s business \u2013 and some, like WhatsApp, Snapchat or Twitter \u2013 have \u201cburied\u201d Facebook among teens, no single replacement has yet emerged to kill off Facebook the way Facebook itself did to MySpace.\n\u201cObviously, Facebook has the luxury of MySpace\u2019s past missteps to guide its future growth,\u201d Gayomali writes.\nA new study by researchers at Princeton University\u2019s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering gives a deeper meaning to the idea of \u201cgoing viral\u201d when it comes to social media.\nAs Chris Gayomali at Fast Company and others point out, there are at least a couple of reasons to be skeptical."}
