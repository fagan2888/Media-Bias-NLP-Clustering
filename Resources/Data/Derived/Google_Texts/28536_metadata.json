He\u2019s as straightforward as his position \u2014 and the Colorado catcher can see everything play out.\n\nMcKenry, who underwent season-ending knee surgery in August, knows the Rockies\u2019 depth chart is now jammed with catchers. And he knows the team is headed toward a second-consecutive last place finish.\n\nAnd he wants very much to return to the Rockies next year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be somewhere playing,\u201d McKenry said. \u201cBut I hope it\u2019s here. I want to see this through.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 backup catcher the past two seasons, McKenry hit .315 behind Wilin Rosario in 2014 and .205 this year behind Nick Hundley. But his numbers otherwise are remarkably consistent.\n\nThe Rockies signed McKenry to a minor-league contract before 2014 after he was cut by the Pittsburgh Pirates. He gave Colorado a defensive leader behind the plate. And young Rockies pitchers grew to enjoy working with his game-calling.\n\nMcKenry, though, isn\u2019t sentimental about wanting to play for the Rockies next season. He wants to win.\n\n\u201cThis team has a good, core group,\u201d McKenry said. \u201cWe can be good.\u201d\n\nMcKenry will enter his third-year of arbitration. He earned a below-scale raise last offseason to make just more than $1 million this year.\n\nBut McKenry doesn\u2019t have any more minor-league options. So if McKenry returns to the Rockies, it\u2019s big leagues or bust.\n\n\u201cI like the idea of going all in,\u201d he said.\n\nMcKenry is likely on the bubble for the Rockies next season. They may release him before arbitration \u2014 the deadline to non-tender a player is Dec. 2.\n\nBut it\u2019s possible the Rockies may bring McKenry, Hundley and rookies Tom Murphy and Dustin Garneau, into spring training and let them sort it out.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Michael McKenry in Rockies wait-and-see mode; catcher roster jammed for 2016", "title": "Michael McKenry in Rockies wait-and-see mode; catcher roster jammed for 2016", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/27/michael-mckenry-in-rockies-wait-and-see-mode-catcher-roster-jammed-for-2016/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150816__Michael-McKenryp1.jpg", "height": 456}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150816__Michael-McKenryp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-27T13:49:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T00:02:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9eae\"", "article_summary": "But it\u2019s possible the Rockies may bring McKenry, Hundley and rookies Tom Murphy and Dustin Garneau, into spring training and let them sort it out.\nMcKenry, who underwent season-ending knee surgery in August, knows the Rockies\u2019 depth chart is now jammed with catchers.\nThe Rockies signed McKenry to a minor-league contract before 2014 after he was cut by the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nMcKenry, though, isn\u2019t sentimental about wanting to play for the Rockies next season.\nMichael McKenry leads the Rockies in sincerity."}
