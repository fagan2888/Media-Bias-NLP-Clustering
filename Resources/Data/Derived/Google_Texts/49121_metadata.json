The result has been to wreak havoc on this immigrant-dominated industry and to close off employment opportunities for undocumented workers.\n\nAnd the New York Times story that inspired Cuomo's crackdown broadly mischaracterized the nail salon industry. Manicurists are skilled employees whose labor is in high demand, and they have a good deal of bargaining power.
