Every week Jennifer Borget introduces you to a different child in foster care awaiting their forever family. They’re some of the brightest, most inspiring children.

So what does it take to adopt them?

“You can be single, married, you can be a gay couple, it doesn’t matter. We are looking for anyone who is safe and appropriate, that can open a loving home to these children,” said CPS Adoption Preparation Specialist Casey Jordan.

Private and international adoptions can cost tens of thousands of dollars, where adoption through foster care can cost as little as nothing.

“The cost should never be an issue for people to adopt a child from foster care,” said Kori Gough of Partnership For Children.

Then there’s assistance available for daycare, medical expenses, even college tuition.

Many parents expect a baby when they adopt, but there are hundreds of teens, and siblings groups, who are in need of a loving home.

“I think it would be amazing for people to adopt teens. They’re looking for their home. They’re looking for their forever family, just like any other child,” added Jordan.

“There are amazingly beautiful children who have never had a real true family or the chance for a life with a forever family. And they’re here in Central Texas, available,” added Gough.

They are kids who are ready for consistency. The chance to live in one home and not have to move every year. The chance to fall in love with parents who will always be there for them.

“There are teens now that have been in care since they were toddlers and they’ve been waiting for year and years and years, and we have to keep telling them we’re looking for you. We’re looking and those families can look here in Texas because there are so many children that are waiting to be adopted,” Jordan stressed.

Waiting for someone like you, to become the forever family they’ve been dreaming of.
