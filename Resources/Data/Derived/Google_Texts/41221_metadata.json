New York City just provided proof of how devastating those fees can be.\n\nAn analysis conducted by the city\u2019s comptroller found that over the last 10 years, New York\u2019s five pension funds have paid $2.5 billion in management fees, almost completely canceling out any above-market gains the funds have earned. The pension funds\u2019 investments in stocks and bonds generated returns that topped expectations by more than $2 billion, according to The New York Times. But the analysis found that fees paid to money managers, combined with the weak performance of other investments, left just $40 million for the pension fund.\n\n\u201cWhen you do the math on what we pay Wall Street to actively manage our funds, it\u2019s shocking to realize that fees have not only wiped out any benefit to the funds, but have in fact cost taxpayers billions of dollars in lost returns,\u201d Comptroller Scott Stringer told the Times.\n\nRelated: How Wall Street Is Fighting to Rip Off Your Retirement Money\n\nThe comptroller\u2019s analysis comes as other state and municipal public pension funds have been questioning the fees they pay to Wall Street and pulling their investments out of pricey hedge funds. For example, in his first budget address, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat who took office in January, said his state \u201chas been wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars on Wall Street managers to handle state pension accounts.\u201d Wolf pledged to stop paying excessive fees.\n\nNew York City\u2019s pension system has nearly $160 billion in assets in funds invested for some 715,000 city employees, including police officers, firefighters and teachers, but the same principle applies on the scale of your more modest portfolio: Steep fees and expenses can wipe out solid gains.\n\nPaying even an extra 1 percent a year can really add up over time. Here\u2019s an example from the Securities and Exchange Commission: If you invested $10,000 in a fund that generated a 10 percent annual return and had annual operating expenses of 0.5 percent, after 20 years you\u2019d wind up with $60,858. If the fund carried a higher annual expense of 1.5 percent, you\u2019d end up with only $49,725 \u2014 a difference greater than the original sum you invested.\n\nRelated: Outrageous Public Pensions Could Bankrupt These States\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nThere\u2019s another lesson here for investors as well: It pays to read the fine print. In the case of New York\u2019s pension funds, Stringer told the Times that the pension funds had in many cases been reporting the investment returns of stock and bond holdings before accounting for those heavy fees. The real performance of those investments could only be gleaned after reading the footnotes in quarterly statements.\n\nSo when considering a new investment or looking at the performance of your existing holdings, it\u2019s important to know just what the figures you\u2019re looking at purport to show.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Savvy investors know that paying high fees to brokers or fund managers can really eat", "title": "New York City's $2.5 Billion Lesson for Investors", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/10/25-Billion-Lesson-Investors", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/08012012_agingcities_newyork_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/10/25-Billion-Lesson-Investors", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/08012012_agingcities_newyork_slideshow.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Savvy investors know that paying high fees to brokers or fund managers can really eat", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc85b\"", "article_summary": "The pension funds\u2019 investments in stocks and bonds generated returns that topped expectations by more than $2 billion, according to The New York Times.\nAn analysis conducted by the city\u2019s comptroller found that over the last 10 years, New York\u2019s five pension funds have paid $2.5 billion in management fees, almost completely canceling out any above-market gains the funds have earned.\nSavvy investors know that paying high fees to brokers or fund managers can really eat into their portfolio\u2019s returns.\nRelated: Outrageous Public Pensions Could Bankrupt These States\u200b\u200b\u200bThere\u2019s another lesson here for investors as well: It pays to read the fine print.\nNew York City just provided proof of how devastating those fees can be."}
