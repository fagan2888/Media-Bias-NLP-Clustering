In response to the Colorado Springs shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic that killed three people and injured nine more, Reid (D-Nev.) filed an amendment which would ban gun possession by anyone convicted of misdemeanor violations of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, Politico reported Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday after the San Bernardino shooting, Reid said there is no excuse for inaction on gun safety legislation, urging for \u201ccommon sense gun reforms\u201d to prevent criminals and people with mental illnesses from obtaining weapons. \u201cYet again our country is faced with another sickening act of gun violence perpetrated against innocent people,\u201d he said. \u201cGun violence has become a cancer on this nation. We are better than this. Too often we are turning on our televisions to scenes of horror like those we are witnessing today. This madness must stop.\u201d\n\nPhoto: REUTERS/Gary Cameron\n\nGun violence has become a cancer on this nation. We must make common sense gun reforms that keep weapons out of dangerous hands. \u2014 Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) December 2, 2015 Continue Reading Below\n\nReid\u2019s amendment comes during consideration of the Republicans\u2019 bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which aims to use the budget reconciliation process to restrict major components of the health law. Multiple Senate Democrats told Roll Call the caucus has been debating a push for gun safety legislation-related votes, but said Reid\u2019s move merely to file an amendment does not mean it will receive even a procedural vote.\n\nRepublican Sen. Cory Cardner, who represents Colorado, said after the Colorado Springs shooting that a discussion needs to take place about how to reduce violence in the U.S., but he said he preferred to do it through mental health legislation rather than gun control.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tragic and something that is an unacceptable action by clearly some very vile, evil actors. I hope that we can address this through mental health issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the direction we have to go.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "harry reid, senator, senate, amendment, gun safety legislation, mentally ill, criminals, background checks, gun amendment, senate minority leader, d-nev., common sense, harry reid, senator, senate, amendment, gun safety legislation, mentally ill, criminal", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Senate Democrats are expected to force a vote on a gun safety amendment after a shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs killed three people last week.", "title": "After San Bernardino Shooting, Harry Reid Wants Senate Vote On Gun Control", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/after-san-bernardino-shooting-harry-reid-wants-senate-vote-gun-control-2209089", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/12/02/harry-reid.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Senate Democrats are expected to force a vote on a gun safety amendment after a shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs killed three people last week.", "title": "After San Bernardino Shooting, Harry Reid Wants Senate Vote On Gun Control", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/after-san-bernardino-shooting-harry-reid-wants-senate-vote-gun-control-2209089", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/12/02/harry-reid.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/12/02/harry-reid.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2015-12-02T21:51:15-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-02T21:52:39-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Senate Democrats are expected to force a vote on a gun safety amendment after a shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs killed three people last week."}, "article_summary": "\u201cYet again our country is faced with another sickening act of gun violence perpetrated against innocent people,\u201d he said.\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid is planning to force a vote on a gun control amendment, in the wake of two recent mass shooting incidents in the U.S. \u2014 one on Wednesday in San Bernardino, California and the other last Friday in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\nI hope that we can address this through mental health issues,\u201d he said.\n\u201cGun violence has become a cancer on this nation.\nIn a statement on Wednesday after the San Bernardino shooting, Reid said there is no excuse for inaction on gun safety legislation, urging for \u201ccommon sense gun reforms\u201d to prevent criminals and people with mental illnesses from obtaining weapons."}
