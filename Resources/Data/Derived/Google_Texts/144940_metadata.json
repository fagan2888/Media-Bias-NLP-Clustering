Some go further. They provide their readership with advice about how to navigate political conversations around the Thanksgiving table.\n\nMany of those columns focus on maintaining a serene path into the holiday season, while others focus on the best pithy ways to evangelize. Or, failing that, to \u201cshame/destroy/eviscerate\u201d those at the table with whom they disagree.\n\nThis piece, unlike those, is simply a collection of gifs designed to do no more than capture the feelings of a libertarian-minded guest when various political topics arise.\n\nIn the name of the Thanksgiving spirit, I give you: \u201cR Street at the Thanksgiving table.\u201d\n\nThings will start off pleasant. Everybody can find a way to get along for at least 15 minutes while waiting for dinner:\n\nInvariably, at some point, the presidential election will come up;\n\nThe always important \u201cpolls\u201d will be discussed. At which point, your hitherto irrelevant knowledge of the RealClearPolitics average and fivethirtyeight.com tracking will be of some use:\n\nRegardless which candidate is discussed, the libertarian position will be well outside the table\u2019s mainstream and you\u2019ll end up disappointed:\n\nStill, in that process, someone might ask you what libertarianism is really about. You\u2019ll do your best to explain:\n\n\u2026and the table won\u2019t like it:\n\nYou may have a chance to discuss specifics, like cutting government funding for both \u201cObamacare\u201d and Medicare. Others will disagree:\n\nBut some of your ideas might catch on. Like, maybe we can have a free and open Internet and security at the same time?\n\nIf they don\u2019t, you can always change the topic to something everybody agrees upon:\n\nFrom everybody at the R Street Institute, we wish you and your friends and family a happy Thanksgiving.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://redesign.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/R-Street-Logo1.png", "title": "R Street at the Thanksgiving table | R Street"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In the name of the Thanksgiving spirit, I give you: \u201cR Street at the Thanksgiving table.\u201dThings will start off pleasant.\nThey provide their readership with advice about how to navigate political conversations around the Thanksgiving table.\nIf they don\u2019t, you can always change the topic to something everybody agrees upon:From everybody at the R Street Institute, we wish you and your friends and family a happy Thanksgiving.\nEvery year, various publications wish their readership a happy and healthy Thanksgiving.\nThis piece, unlike those, is simply a collection of gifs designed to do no more than capture the feelings of a libertarian-minded guest when various political topics arise."}
