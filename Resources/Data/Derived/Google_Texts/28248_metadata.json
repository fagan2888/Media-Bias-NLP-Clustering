The mayor\u2019s office stood by its numbers.\n\nWhen 1010 WINS\u2019 Stan Brooks asked if the mayor thought de Blasio was up to the challenge, Bloomberg responded, \u201cHe\u2019s got to learn. He\u2019s never run a big organization before and now he\u2019s got to get out and do it.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s spokeswoman said the mayor-elect is reviewing the budget. He is set to take office on Jan. 1.\n\nCheck Out These Other Stories From CBSNewYork.com:", "article_metadata": {"description": "After 12 years in office, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg says he is presenting mayor-elect Bill de Blasio with a balanced budget.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/11/21/mayor-bloomberg-mayor-elect-de-blasio-to-get-balanced-budget/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/169710738.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/169710738.jpg?w=1500", "height": 1000}, "type": "article", "description": "After 12 years in office, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg says he is presenting mayor-elect Bill de Blasio with a balanced budget.", "title": "Mayor Bloomberg: Mayor-Elect De Blasio To Get Balanced Budget"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/169710738.jpg?w=1500", "description": "After 12 years in office, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg says he is presenting mayor-elect Bill de Blasio with a balanced budget.", "site": "/CBSnewyork", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mayor Bloomberg: Mayor-Elect De Blasio To Get Balanced Budget"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic And The Best of NY", "fb": {"app_id": 148100721870411}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/50e3ae7b1a37ec6f5f022661f15b5473?s=16", "application-name": "CBS New York", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork"}, "keywords": "heard on 1010 wins, wcbs, wfan, news, ny news, politics, radio.com - news, seen on cbs2, syndicated local, watch + listen, affordable care act, balanced budget, bill de blasio, budget, marcia kramer, mayor michael bloomber, mayor-elect bill de blasio, new york city, rich lamb, stan brooks, taxes", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "bitly-verification": "98ab9c1eda26", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, balanced budget, bill de blasio, budget, marcia kramer, mayor michael bloomber, mayor-elect bill de blasio, new york city, rich lamb, stan brooks, taxes"}, "article_summary": "After 12 years in office, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg says he is presenting mayor-elect Bill de Blasio with a balanced budget.\nNEW YORK (CBSNewYork/AP) \u2014 For the first time in decades, an incoming New York City mayor will not face a budget deficit.\nMayor Bloomberg: Mayor-Elect De Blasio To Get Balanced Budget playpauseThe announcement may turn out to be bad news for de Blasio who was elected with heavy support form organized labor.\nBloomberg Praises Efforts To Leave NYC With Balanced Budget playpauseBloomberg says he was able to close a $2 billion gap in the $74.5 billion budget for fiscal year 2015, which begins July 1.\nWhen 1010 WINS\u2019 Stan Brooks asked if the mayor thought de Blasio was up to the challenge, Bloomberg responded, \u201cHe\u2019s got to learn."}
