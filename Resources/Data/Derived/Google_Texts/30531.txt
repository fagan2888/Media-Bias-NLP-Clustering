Construction crews discovered more historic chalkboards at Emerson Mid-High School in Oklahoma City.

According to officials, during the first week of 2016, construction crews uncovered additional chalkboards with historic drawings from the early 1900’s. The newly-discovered chalkboards are on the third floor of the school building, located at 715 N. Walker.

Back in June, 2015, while removing the “whiteboards” currently in classrooms at Emerson High School, contractors discovered several chalkboards with writings and student drawings from 1917. The work assignments of teachers from nearly 100 years ago are still intact, and the images can be found in three classrooms.
