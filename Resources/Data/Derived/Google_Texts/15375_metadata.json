The judgment, issued on February 5, states that Hannah has sufficient evidence to take his case to trial.\n\nIn response to the judgment, NSU filed an appeal with the 10th Circuit Court. According to Hannah, \u201cThe 10th Circuit sent the decision back to the Muskogee Court (Eastern District) for mediation, however NSU does not seem to be taking the situation seriously and has not negotiated in any of the three mediations in a meaningful way. I am not sure what is going to happen next,\u201d Hannah said.\n\nHannah, Cherokee, was hired as a professor in 2009 and rose quickly through the ranks to the position of Chair of the Language and Literature Department. Other professors reacted to his promotion by posting discriminatory and belittling comments about Hannah and his Native background, such as Brian Hammer Cowlishaw\u2019s Facebook posting, \u201cThere will be an \u2018election\u2019 the first week of February. They\u2019re making a f*cking indian chair.\u201d\n\nThe three professors, including Dr. Brian Cowlishaw, his wife Dr. Bridget Cowlishaw, and Dr. Shelton, were reprimanded by NSU for that and other similar Facebook comments. Dr. Bridget Cowlishaw entered a settlement agreement with NSU and resigned.\n\nAccording to the judge, the professors\u2019 comments \u201cwere interpretable as racist references.\u201d At the time of the postings, NSU reprimanded the professors for the posts. However, the judge wrote there was continued evidence of hostility, \u201cwhether it was motivated by race or other factors, (it) remained prevalent within the department\u2026 even after Hannah resigned as Chair. Then Cowlishaw and Shelton voted on Hannah\u2019s tenure application.\u201d\n\nWhile Judge White dismissed some of Hannah\u2019s claims, he allowed the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act ruling on discrimination. The judge based his ruling on the fact that the school had responded appropriately to the Facebook attacks, but thought it was unreasonable to assume the professors could vote without prejudice on Hannah\u2019s tenure and promotion.\n\nIn the summary judgment, the judge states, \u201cDr. Hannah is a member of a protected class. Dr. Hannah engaged in protected opposition to discrimination. Dr. Hannah suffered an adverse employment action\u2014denial of his tenure and promotion application followed by his termination\u2026 At the same time Dr. Hannah was denied tenure, Department Chair Shelburne, a white man, was granted tenure.\u201d\n\nFor NSU to allow Cowlishaw and Shelton, after being disciplined for discrimination, to vote on Hannah\u2019s tenure application was questionable enough to take the case to a jury, the judge wrote.\n\nNSU\u2019s response claimed Cowlishaw\u2019s and Shelton\u2019s vote did not have any effect on the outcome of Hannah\u2019s tenure application. The judge responded, \u201cThe court is not convinced. It is entirely plausible that Dr. Cowlishaw and Dr. Shelton influenced others\u2019 opinions of Dr. Hannah before and during the tenure application process\u2026 Whether the Dean held any animosity toward Dr. Hannah and whether it was racially motivated are questions for the jury.\u201d\n\nNSU claimed that the Facebook posts were two years before Hannah\u2019s tenure application and that it was unlikely to have affected the attitudes of those who voted against Hannah\u2019s tenure. The court said, \u201cTwo years is not a significant amount of time. It is more than plausible and rather likely that after two years, Dr. Cowlishaw and Dr. Shelton still held some animosity toward Dr. Hannah for his reporting their Facebook posts, which resulted in their reprimands and possibly in the resignation of Dr. Cowlishaw\u2019s wife.\u201d The court believes there was evidence of continued hostility and stated that if Cowlishaw and Shelton had been removed from the tenure application process, \u201cthis would be a different case.\u201d\n\nFurther, the court acknowledged that NSU took appropriate actions at the time of the Facebook postings, but that the university did not attempt to end \u201cany remaining hostility, whatever its origin thereafter.\u201d The court stated a jury will have to decide whether or not the remaining hostility was racially motivated. The court also stated that Hannah had provided enough evidence to establish that his constitutional rights had been violated.\n\nAnthony L. Allen, Hannah\u2019s attorney wrote in an email, \u201cWe get to go to trial against NSU\u2014only for Title VII\u2014but that is enough.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Allegations of Racism at NSU Recall Indian Education\u2019s Darker Days", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fired Northeastern State University professor Dr. Leslie Hannah, Cherokee, has sufficient evidence to take his discrimination case to trial.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/06/judge-okays-discrimination-trial-fired-nsu-professor-159882", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/northeastern-state-university-seminary-hall.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Judge Okays Discrimination Trial for Fired NSU Professor"}, "abstract": "Fired Northeastern State University professor Dr. Leslie Hannah, Cherokee, has sufficient evidence to take his discrimination case to trial.", "keywords": "Christina Rose, Northeastern State University, Discrimination, Native Education, Educators", "dc": {"title": "Judge Okays Discrimination Trial for Fired NSU Professor"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/06/judge-okays-discrimination-trial-fired-nsu-professor-159882", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.date": "2015-04-06T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Judge Okays Discrimination Trial for Fired NSU Professor"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a6e\"", "article_summary": "NSU\u2019s response claimed Cowlishaw\u2019s and Shelton\u2019s vote did not have any effect on the outcome of Hannah\u2019s tenure application.\nDr. Hannah engaged in protected opposition to discrimination.\nThen Cowlishaw and Shelton voted on Hannah\u2019s tenure application.\u201dWhile Judge White dismissed some of Hannah\u2019s claims, he allowed the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act ruling on discrimination.\nThey\u2019re making a f*cking indian chair.\u201dThe three professors, including Dr. Brian Cowlishaw, his wife Dr. Bridget Cowlishaw, and Dr. Shelton, were reprimanded by NSU for that and other similar Facebook comments.\nThe judgment, issued on February 5, states that Hannah has sufficient evidence to take his case to trial."}
