Amy Stephens, a Republican who fought her own party over how to implement \u201cObamacare,\u201d has joined the Colorado Health Institute as a policy adviser.\n\nIn her advisory role, Stephens will ensure that the nonpartisan research institute is researching and analyzing health policy proposals from across the political spectrum, according to a news release from CHI.\n\n\u201cHealth is often considered to be a liberal concern, but the mission of the Colorado Health Institute is to make sure that health and health policy is a universal concern,\u201d said Michele Lueck, president and CEO.\n\nStephens sponsored the legislation that created the Connect for Health Colorado insurance marketplace. She believed the measure protected Colorado from being held hostage from the federal government regarding implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but a number of Republicans accused her of working with the enemy, and they dubbed her bill \u201cAmycare.\u201d Stephens responded that, \u201cAmy cares.\u201d\n\nStephens also was one of four bipartisan sponsors of this year\u2019s Senate Bill 187, which created the Colorado Commission on Affordable Care.\n\n\u201cOne thing that is certain is that we have absolute uncertainty in health care today,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cAs a legislator, I\u2019ve appreciated the even-handed professionalism of CHI\u2019s research. Today, I\u2019m excited to be working with CHI to explore health care policy ideas being done nationally and in specific states so that we can evaluate their effectiveness and potential applicability for Colorado.\u201d\n\nThe Monument resident served two years as the House majority leader.
