Here’s one figure you may want to remember from today’s announced $17 billion combination of life-science company Sigma-Aldrich Corp. with German giant Merck KGaA — $130 million.

That’s what Sigma-Aldrich /quotes/zigman/77951/delayed /quotes/zigman/77951/lastsale SIAL paid in domestic income taxes last year on the $657 million it reported in pretax income for 2013. It amounts to just under 20% of the St. Louis-based company’s income, and presumably that figure will be dropping once the company’s headquarters is relocated to Germany.

OK, the deal doesn’t really count as a tax inversion since Merck /quotes/zigman/157099/delayed DE:MRK , a centuries-old pharmaceutical and chemical company that split from the more familiar Merck & Co. Inc. /quotes/zigman/574389/delayed /quotes/zigman/574389/lastsale MRK in the U.S. after World War I, is the one doing the acquiring. It’s not as if Sigma-Aldrich is buying Merck to get a tax break overseas.

Further, the tax bill for Sigma-Aldrich actually will end up being higher than it is now, reports say. It’s effective tax rate now is roughly 25% to 26% when money made on foreign sales is included. In Germany, that’s expected to jump to just under 30%, reports said.

But the U.S. won’t reap the rewards of roughly $130 million in taxes once the deal is complete. Merck said Monday it is paying $140 a share for Sigma-Aldrich, more than a third higher than the $102.37 closing price for Sigma-Aldrich on Friday.

Shares of Sigma-Aldrich jumped more than 33% to $136.40 on the deal, while Merck added more than 4% to 72.63 euros ($93.30). Merck’s life-science operations gets a boost from the deal, as revenue from that part of the business is expected to double. Sigma-Aldrich’s 2013 revenue was $2.7 billion.
