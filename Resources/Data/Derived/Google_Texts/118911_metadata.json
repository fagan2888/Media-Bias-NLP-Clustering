Yet it\u2019s been endorsements from those outside the political bubble that have been catching the attention of wonks.\n\nA couple of legal Nevada brothels are throwing their hats into the political arena for 2016. Take for instance, one right outside of Las Vegas \u2014 Sheri\u2019s Ranch. Workers there sent out an endorsement for Nevada\u2019s Democratic Senator Harry Reid, with an offer to host the Senator\u2019s retirement party.\n\nMeanwhile the women from Dennis Hof\u2019s HBO-famous Moonlite Bunny Ranch are taking a step further. Earlier this month the workers there launched a web site called \u201cHookers for Hillary,\u201d endorsing, obviously, the Democratic front-runner and presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to the women at the ranch, the main reason they\u2019re supporting Clinton is her stance on the Affordable Care Act, which has given legal prostitutes in Nevada the option to purchase health care.\n\n\u201cWith any Republican in office, they\u2019re likely to repeal [the ac] and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that we shouldn\u2019t be able to purchase health care, since we pay into taxes like everybody else,\u201d explains Krissy Summers, an employee at the Bunny Ranch and part of the campaign.\n\nSummers and other Bunny Ranch colleagues told Come Here And Say That that their group is so diverse, it felt as if they were part of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign launch video. We wanted to see it for ourselves, so, like in Clinton\u2019s video, we asked the women what they were looking forward to in 2016.
