They issued an updated warning about the risk of traveling to certain places in Mexico, including Sonora, which is just south of Tucson.\n\nBut some Nogales, AZ residents feel the warnings are painting a negative picture of Mexico, particularly the border cities.\n\n\n\n\"I think it's ridiculous,\" Nogales resident Tony Velasquez said. \"I think it's a scare tactic to retain most of the shoppers and residents on the U.S. side to affect the economy along the border and to affect the economy along the Mexican border.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to the State Department's news release, millions visit the country safely each year but American citizens have been the victims of violent crimes and robbery by organized criminal groups in various Mexican states.\n\n\n\nRodney Kaiser, owner of Sal's Bike Shop in Nogales, AZ, has been running his shop for about 5 years. He describes the atmosphere on the border as \"very controlled\" and said he's always felt safe living there.\n\n\n\nHe also said he hosts bike riders that pass through the city on their way to Mexico and said he's worried the warnings will make them change their mind.\n\n\n\n\"They might be reluctant to come down and do that,\" Kaiser said. \"We've hosted a whole bunch of people in the last year.\"\n\n\n\nKaiser, who was born and raised in Nogales, believes people who travel to Mexico \"should have common sense\" and simply be aware of where they're going.\n\n\n\n\"You have to know where you are and you have to just pay attention,\" Kaiser said.\n\n\n\nVelasquez said he acknowledges that violent crimes and robberies do take place in certain areas of Mexico, but not in Nogales, AZ, and he encourages people who have doubts to visit the city and see for themselves.\n\n\n\n\"You can walk, shop, look around, take a tour of both Nogaleses and you will, on your own, determine that it is an extremely safe community, both sides of the city,\" Velasquez said.\n\n\n\nFor more on the travel warnings, CLICK HERE.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2016 Tucson News Now.
