When Issa took over the committee in 2011, he essentially promised the right that he\u2019d take down the Obama administration. Between the FDA, WikiLeaks, Fannie Mae, Solyndra and Fast and Furious, he\u2019d surely find something impeachment-worthy. But none of those really panned out. Next came Benghazi, which will live on forever in conservative lore as the most scandalous scandal of all time, but which suffers from the fact that no one outside the conservative bubble can figure out what the \u201cpolitical scandal\u201d part of the attack is supposed to be.\n\nIssa got the outright gift, last year, of the political press deciding to package three largely unrelated news stories \u2014 the Justice Department gaining access to the phone logs of journalists, the IRS maybe-sorta applying excessive scrutiny to certain mostly conservative groups, and Benghazi \u2026 having happened, I guess \u2014 as a sort of trifecta of \u201cObama scandals.\u201d This was his opportunity! Issa pounced on the IRS scandal, as usual promising earth-shattering revelations. He chose \u2026 poorly.\n\nThis is where he\u2019s at, today: He called former IRS official Lois Lerner back before the committee so that she could plead the Fifth again and he could, I dunno, hold a press conference about how evil the IRS is. Lerner took the Fifth. Issa adjourned the committee. Then, Oversight Committee ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings attempted to speak, and Issa decided it would be a smart move to cut Cummings\u2019 mic. He did the little throat-cut move and everything.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Oversight Committee chairman has finally exposed something.
