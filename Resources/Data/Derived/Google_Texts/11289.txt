SANTA ANA -- Authorities say a newborn baby is doing "very well" after her mother left her with Orange County firefighters.

County Fire Authority Capt. Steve Concialdi says a local female rang a fire station doorbell Friday evening and told crews she wanted to give them the baby.

He says the 12- to- 18-hour-old infant was taken to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana and is doing "very well."

Under state law, a baby can be left with officials at any fire station or hospital within 72 hours of the child's birth with no consequences.

Concialdi says "the mother absolutely did the right thing by surrendering her baby to the firefighter paramedics."

He says that the hospital will coordinate with the county social services agency on the child's care.
