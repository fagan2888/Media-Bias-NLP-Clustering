It is titled, simply, \u201cEbola Scientist In Texas fighting the Disease\u201d:\n\nTexas By The Numbers\n\nNumber Problem \u2014 Average SAT math score of Texas teens this year: 495. Last year: 499. Last time average score has been so low: 1992. Score that year: 493. National average SAT math score: 513.\n\nDisease Expenses \u2014 Cost of \u201cphase one\u201d decontamination the Dallas Ebola patient\u2019s apartment: $65,000. Total estimated amount: $100,000. Amount the cleanup crew charges per hour: $182. Estimated cost of patient\u2019s care, per day: $18,000 to $24,000. Total amoung an online fundraising effort for the patient has raised: $50.\n\nDaily Roundup\n\nEbola Watch: Day 8 \u2014 With things looking up for the Ebola-plagued village of Dallas, the focus now seems to be how much extra money can be spent on prevention. \u201cOne week after the Ebola diagnosis in Dallas, federal and state officials said Tuesday the effort to prevent the virus\u2019s spread here appears to be succeeding,\u201d reports the Dallas Morning News, which also notes that the Reverend Jesse Jackson came to down to provide support and a prayer vigil for the family of Thomas Duncan, who\u2019s in critical but stable condition. The generally good news hasn\u2019t stopped tech-savvy prevention measures. Five Dallas schools have installed \u201cfever scanners,\u201d which sounds like a futuristic thing but is totally real. \u201cHere\u2019s how it works,\u201d writes KTBC. \u201cYou look at the screen. There\u2019s a sensor that reads temperature at a spot on the forehead. If the person has a temperature above 99.5 degrees, the device sends a notification with a picture, time and reading. That will then allow health officials to bring the person in for further assessment.\u201d That\u2019s pretty cool, but it doesn\u2019t look as impressive as the Ebola-killing robot an enterprising San Antonio company developed for hospitals. Known as \u201cLittle Moe,\u201d the robot\u2019s \u201cbulb emits powerful UV light, which fuses the DNA of a virus and kills it. This powerful technology is now being used in 250 hospitals across the U.S,\u201d according to WTSP. It also looks like a cross between the robot in Lost in Space and a trash can.\n\nPlan C \u2014 Well, this is surely going to cause a stir: doctors may be able to perform abortions. \u201cState statute does not require physicians\u2019 offices, such as gynecology and obstetrics practices, to obtain abortion licenses if they perform fewer than 50 such procedures a year,\u201d according to the Texas Tribune. \u201cThat exempts them from the most restrictive provisions of House Bill 2, the contentious 2013 measure that has now shuttered almost all of the state\u2019s remaining abortion clinics.\u201d But this is still an exceptional measure for most: uninsured women can\u2019t make a doctor\u2019s visit, and many doctors won\u2019t do it (there were only been a total of 43 in 2012, or 8 percent of the number of Texas abortions). However, those figures could increase now that HB2 is devastating proper abortion facilities, though \u201csome say doctors are performing the procedure \u2014 just not reporting them as abortions\u201d and one OBGYN said \u201cthe dramatic reduction in the number of abortion clinics in Texas could lead to an increase in physician misreporting on abortions, especially in the areas west of San Antonio and Fort Worth where abortion facilities are no longer in operation.\u201d For now, the pro-life crowd isn\u2019t concerned about violating doctor-patient relationships, but that doesn\u2019t mean a lobbyist for Texas Right to Life \u201cdid not rule out pursuing legislation on it.\u201d Because remember: it\u2019s Obamacare that violates personal liberty and privacy.\n\nA Vegas Wedding (Case) \u2014 The same-sex marriage train has left the station and is only gaining speed, even in Texas. \u201cThe 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans agreed [Tuesday] to expedite oral arguments in the case [of Texas\u2019s gay marriage ban],\u201d according to the San Antonio Express-News. \u201cThe request came on Monday from former San Antonians Cleopatra De Leon and Nicole Dimetman, one of two gay couples challenging the state ban. Former San Antonians Victor Holmes and Mark Phariss are the other couple involved in the case.\u201d The speed of the case is due, in part, to De Leon and Dimetman, who are expecting their second child in March and want to ensure Dimetman has automatic parental rights. Under current Texas law, Dimetman has to go through a jerry-rigged, time-consuming and expensive adoption process. Will the Fifth Circuit just get on board with all the other appeals courts? Given the court\u2019s past judgments, it\u2019s unlikely.\n\nUnder The Microscope \u2014 It\u2019s like arguing over your insurance premium bill, just millions of times worse. \u201cThe federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is withholding $75 million that the state used to reimburse private hospitals for care they provided to poor patients without a means to pay,\u201d reports the Texas Tribune. \u201cAs part of an arrangement with the federal government to give Texas greater flexibility in running Medicaid \u2026 the Obama administration agreed in 2011 to match local tax dollars to incentivize public health and hospital systems to experiment with ways to deliver care more efficiently. In some cases, private and nonprofit hospitals also agreed to contribute money for the projects, but the federal government said it would not match those dollars.\u201d The problem, it seems, is that some of those private hospitals may or may not have done the exact opposite of the agreements, i.e. \u201cinstances of direct payments from private hospitals to governmental entities \u2014 money that the federal government was being asked to match.\u201d Until the feds can figure out if the deals were legit, they\u2019re withholding the $75 million. Hospitals are understandably eager to get the issue resolved since they tend to foot the bill for the uninsured.\n\nClickity Bits\n\nAbbott Says He\u2019s Been Upfront About Both TEF and How He Feels About Democrats\n\nLawsuits Filed Over Bus Crash That Killed College Softball Players\n\nAnother Day, Another Lawsuit For Former Champion Lance Armstrong\n\n\u2018Texas Man Impersonates Cop to Real Police Officer\u2018\n\nOh No, Bro: Texas Tech Frat Loses Its Charter Following Rape-Sign Incident\n\nDid we miss something?
