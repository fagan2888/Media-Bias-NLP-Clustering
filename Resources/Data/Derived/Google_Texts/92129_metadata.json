Barack Obama not only made campaign appearances but released his second book, \"The Audacity of Hope,\" shortly before the November vote).\n\nOr, is 2014 is destined to be a repeat of 2010 and a second negative verdict on ObamaCare (in 2010, it cost the Democrats the House; in 2014, it may be the Senate\u2019s turn), does Mrs. Clinton, who 20 years ago tried and failed to sell the nation on the virtues of HillaryCare, lay low and let someone else take the slings and arrows of the Obama administration\u2019s misfortunes?\n\nIt\u2019s a fair question to ask, for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s approach to the 2014 vote may serve as tip-off for how she\u2019ll run for president should she decide to seek the prize that eluded her in 2008.\n\nThen, Hillary Clinton was a cautious campaigner \u2013 so much so that she left an opening for a more progressive Democrat to wrest the nomination from her. And that, of course, was Barack Obama.\n\nThe 2013 election offered more of the same: Mrs. Clinton did cross the Potomac River and campaign in Northern Virginia on behalf of Terry McAuliffe, the winner in that state\u2019s governor\u2019s race.\n\nStill it was cautious sledding, with Mrs. Clinton appearing at a women\u2019s rally quite literally in inside the Capitol Beltway. Not exactly \u201cDuck Dynasty.\u201d\n\nThe guess here: don\u2019t look for Mrs. Clinton to emerge as a fire-and-brimstone liberal campaigner in 2014. It\u2019s not in her political DNA. Nor does it make sense if indeed the midterm\u2019s prevailing theme is ObamaCare\u2019s ineptitude and, by default, the hazards of big-government solutions.\n\nSo how, then will Mrs. Clinton approach the 2014 landscape? Let\u2019s begin with the obvious: supporting big-state, blue-state Democrats who can\u2019t possibly lose.\n\nThat means New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, a possible running mate for Mrs. Clinton, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (once a possible 2016 rival) and, if she can put aside some unpleasant memories from the 1992 election that featured insults at her expense, hanging out with California Gov. Jerry Brown.\n\nPlan B \u2013 again, a political no-brainer \u2013 would be making appearances on behalf of the same coalition that re-elected President Obama in 2012: women, millennials, Latinos and African-Americans.\n\nLook for Mrs. Clinton to pop up in Nevada, where 37-year-Secretary of State Ross Miller aims to move up to Attorney General; in Maryland, where Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, an African-American, hopes to replace Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley (who in turn hopes to supplant Mrs. Clinton at the top of the Democratic ticket; and in Texas, a state with growing Latino clout, for a Democrat along the lines of Texas State Rep. Mary Gonzalez, should she survive a primary challenge.\n\nAll of which amounts to playing it safe, Hillary-wise. But what if she breaks with character and decides to risk a little political capital? That would require Mrs. Clinton to consider the following:\n\n1. Fly into Little Rock\u2019s Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport and stump for Sen. Mark Pryor, a Democrat in trouble. President Obama twice lost Mrs. Clinton\u2019s adopted state by 20% or more. At some point in 2015, Mrs. Clinton will begin the process of distancing herself from her most recent employer. A 2014 visit to Arkansas might begin the process sooner than she\u2019d like.\n\n2. Visit Texas and campaign and for State Sen. Wendy Davis, the likely Democratic candidate for governor. Davis is determined to make the contest a referendum on abortion \u2013 a variation of the Republican \u201cwar on women\u201d that paid huge dividends for Democrats in 2012. Then again, Texas is a socially conservative state that hasn\u2019t chosen a Democratic governor since before the Clinton presidency. Does Mrs. Clinton want to be associated with a campaign that thrills East Coast Democrats, but probably doesn\u2019t click in the Central time zone?\n\n3. Coming to the rescue of red-state Democratic damsels in distress. Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu is on the politically endangered list (last month, she purposely avoided a presidential visit to New Orleans), as is Kay Hagan in North Carolina. Mrs. Clinton could play it safe in these states \u2013 limiting her appearances to university towns and big cities. Then again, it begs the question of how the South, New and Deep, fits into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plans in 2016?\n\nOne final note: Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t the only 2016 possibility carefully weighing their 2014 options. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for example, will be selective in his travel.\n\nBut in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s case, it\u2019s a situation frontrunners seldom face: she doesn\u2019t need the exposure; she won\u2019t feel the pressure to start working the swing states.\n\nThe reward for the rest of us: to the extent that Hillary Clinton is politically active in 2014, it keeps us guessing as to what she\u2019ll share with us in 2015 \u2013 which would be her plans in 2016.\n\nBill Whalen is a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, where he analyzes California and national politics.
