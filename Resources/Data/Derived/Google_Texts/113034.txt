The importance of leadership in the response to HIV/AIDS was underscored in a recent blog post by Julie Scofield, Executive Director of the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors (NASTAD). In her post on the NASTAD blog paying tribute to Mario Cuomo, the late former governor of New York and her former boss, she reflects on some of the important appointments as well as policy and funding actions the governor took during the early years of the AIDS epidemic that served to pave the way for the state and national responses to the epidemic. Her post is a reminder that our response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to demand the thoughtful engagement of individuals from all sectors of society. We appreciate the leadership of all who have helped advance us toward an AIDS-free generation.
