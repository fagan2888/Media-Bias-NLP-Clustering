He was 79.\n\nGroff is survived by his wife, Callie Brownlee-Groff; children Peter, Traci and James; and eight grandchildren. He had been in hospice care while staying at his daughter\u2019s house the past two weeks. The family will announce funeral plans.\n\n\u201cIf you asked him what his biggest accomplishment was, he would tell you he was a teacher,\u201d his eldest son, Peter, said Sunday. \u201cHe taught for 40 years.\u201d\n\nGroff once taught with former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb at Smiley Middle School, Webb recalled Sunday.\n\n\u201cHe was a great teacher. Charismatic,\u201d Webb said. \u201cRegis was a dedicated family man. If you look at his life at its totality, he was a true public servant. \u2026 He was a voice for the voiceless. \u2026 He was a defender of civil liberties, making sure that the Constitution was for everyone.\u201d\n\nGroff served as a state senator from 1974 to 1994. There were only a handful of blacks who served with him during that period, including Penfield Tate and Webb\u2019s wife, Wilma, said Webb. Peter Groff became Colorado\u2019s first black state Senate president in 2008.\n\nThe history teacher\u2019s proudest moment came when he spearheaded passage of a law establishing the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday in Colorado, Peter Groff said. He also spearheaded a bill to require Colorado to divest in any business relationship with South Africa, Groff said.\n\nGroff left the state Senate when former Gov. Roy Romer appointed him as the first director of the youth offender corrections system following the summer of violence in 1994. Webb noted that Groff was a religious man dedicated to serving his church.\n\n\u201cHis passing will be a great loss to Colorado,\u201d Webb said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado\u2019s second black state senator Regis Groff dies at 79", "title": "Colorado\u2019s second black state senator Regis Groff dies at 79", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/05/colorados-second-black-state-senator-regis-groff-dies-at-79/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141005_100940_Regis-Groff-obit.jpg", "height": 468}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141005_100940_Regis-Groff-obit.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-05T22:04:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T16:32:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd20f0\"", "article_summary": "Groff, the second black state senator in Colorado history, died Sunday with family all around him.\nPeter Groff became Colorado\u2019s first black state Senate president in 2008.\nAlthough Regis Groff was one of the first black legislators in Colorado history, he would say his biggest achievement in life was teaching history.\nThe history teacher\u2019s proudest moment came when he spearheaded passage of a law establishing the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday in Colorado, Peter Groff said.\n\u201cHis passing will be a great loss to Colorado,\u201d Webb said."}
