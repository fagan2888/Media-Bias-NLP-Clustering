Sunday on Fox News Channel’s “America’s News Headquarters,’ ranking Senate Budget Committee member Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) said considering the majority of those effected by President Barack Obama’s executive order amnesty have low income jobs, when you factor in both the Earned Income Tax Credit and child tax credits, the federal government will end up writing checks to the majority of the 5 million illegal immigrants effected by the executive order.

“Some of the people will pay taxes. but a huge percentage of them will be in that income level, the Earned Income tax level, or who have children, child tax credit, which are basically checks from the federal government,” Sessions said. “So their incomes will be so low, they’ll pay no income taxes. Many millions of Americans do today. But they will get a check from the government for Earned Income Tax Credit or child tax credit. So it is going to cost money really in the long run.”
