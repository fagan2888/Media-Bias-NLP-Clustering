We've confirmed one of the 12 men missing after a Marine helicopter crash in Hawaii has ties to Southwest Florida.

Tommy Jardas is among the missing. His sister, Haely Jardas, is currently Miss District of Columbia.

The Miss District of Columbia Scholarship program posted the following on its Facebook page Saturday.

"Our thoughts and prayers are with Haely and the entire Jardas family. Haely's brother was one of the Marines involved in the helicopter crash in Hawaii yesterday. Please help us pray for his safe return.

A special thank you to the USO and TAPS who helped get Haely and one of our volunteers escorted though security and completely taken care of to get her home to be with her family."

The search is in its second day.

Two helicopters collided off the coast of Hawaii Thursday night. The wreckage scattered over a wide area. The search has been hampered by high waves.
