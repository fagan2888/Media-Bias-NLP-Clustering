It was an attempt to \u201crestore more rational payments,\u201d the insurer said, estimating that cutting the fees would save $200 million per year and thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs for members receiving cancer treatment.\n\nThat was before Highmark and UPMC entered into a state-brokered consent decree keeping in-network access for certain Highmark members, including seniors on Medicare Advantage. After Highmark acquired greater Pittsburgh\u2019s second major hospital system, the Allegheny Health Network, and launched a new narrow network plan excluding UPMC facilities, UPMC wanted to end the contract with the insurer, but instead the two agreed to a mediated network scale-back.\n\nNow, UPMC, western Pennsylvania\u2019s largest provider and second-largest health plan, is fighting back against the oncology reimbursement changes, amid other skirmishes that haven\u2019t been entirely solved by the consent decree.\n\n\u201cNo responsible organization could enter into \u2014 let alone extend \u2014 such illusory and one-sided contracts,\u201d UPMC said in a statement outlining the decision. \u201cHighmark has not been paying us. It\u2019s now up to $143 million,\u201d UPMC Chief Communications Officer Paul Wood told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n\nUPMC said it gave Highmark a year to reverse the payment decision, which the health system argued was a breach of contract, and to drop a related lawsuit. Unless Highmark ends up changing course, UPMC will end network contracts covering Highmark\u2019s Medicare Advantage plans effective in January 2016. Last July's consent decree \u201cexplicitly contemplated this possibility, giving UPMC the right to withdraw from its Medicare Advantage arrangements with Highmark,\u201d according to the UPMC statement.\n\n\u201cUPMC shall treat all Medicare-participating consumers as in-network,\u201d the consent decree reads. \u201cHighmark acknowledges that UPMC reserves the right to withdraw from these arrangements if Highmark should take the position that it has the authority to revise the rates and fees payable under those arrangements unilaterally.\u201d\n\nAnother factor in the dispute is Highmark\u2019s new, zero-premium Community Blue Medicare Advantage plan that does not include UPMC providers. Currently covering around 7,000, the Community Blue Medicare plan is a version of the narrow network plan, and was introduced last fall, while premiums were increased by 25 percent and more for Highmark\u2019s other MA plans covering some 180,000 seniors. UPMC and the Pennsylvania government challenged Highmark, arguing that the consent decree mandated that all Medicare plans keep UPMC in-network. But a judge sided with the Highmark, which argued that it could offer an Medicare Advantage plan without UPMC as long as it still sold other Medicare plans with UPMC.\n\nIn the latest oncology dispute, Pennsylvania\u2019s new governor, Democrat Tom Wolf, is largely siding with Highmark. Wolf called UPMC\u2019s plan to end network access \u201cunacceptable\u201d and vowed to pursue \"all options to reverse this decision, including court action.\u201d\n\nHighmark lauded Wolf\u2019s stance on the issue, and argued that the proposed contract cancellation is unfair retaliation for the oncology reimbursement changes. \u201cBecause of Highmark's leadership in keeping cancer care affordable and saving area employers and self-insured individuals from paying grossly inflated prices for cancer drugs, UPMC is holding 180,000 seniors hostage,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nAs the case is sorted out, UPMC is beckoning seniors to its own health plan, UPMC for Life Medicare Advantage, and also noting that other insurers include UPMC networks, from Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Cigna-Health Spring.\n\nUPMC for Life currently covers around 123,000 seniors on Medicare Advantage, plus 18,000 in special needs plans. As Highmark increased Medicare Advantage rates for this year, it lost some of its membership, as it has among employer groups, including a public school teachers' health plan concerned about UPMC Access. UPMC for Life, meanwhile, has reduced premiums for four of its six Medicare Advantage plans, and is pitching perks like an unlimited fitness network, a $5 copay for primary care visits, vision allowance, discounts for dental and hearing services, and a $0 premium HMO plan.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/upmc-takes-stand-network-war", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/UMPC-Facebook-Feature_0.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Challenging Highmark's cuts to cancer payments, UPMC is playing the long-game in being the provider of choice for western Pennsylvania's seniors.", "title": "UPMC takes a stand in network war"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/UMPC-Facebook-Feature_0.png"}, "description": "Challenging Highmark's cuts to cancer payments, UPMC is playing the long-game in being the provider of choice for western Pennsylvania's seniors.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "UPMC takes a stand in network war"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Barely a year after a new state-mediated agreement between two rivals, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is moving to end its in-network contract for all of Highmark Health\u2019s Medicare Advantage members, unless the Blue Cross insurer once again starts including facility fee payments in oncology reimbursement.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "That was before Highmark and UPMC entered into a state-brokered consent decree keeping in-network access for certain Highmark members, including seniors on Medicare Advantage.\nUPMC and the Pennsylvania government challenged Highmark, arguing that the consent decree mandated that all Medicare plans keep UPMC in-network.\nBut a judge sided with the Highmark, which argued that it could offer an Medicare Advantage plan without UPMC as long as it still sold other Medicare plans with UPMC.\nUnless Highmark ends up changing course, UPMC will end network contracts covering Highmark\u2019s Medicare Advantage plans effective in January 2016.\nLast July's consent decree \u201cexplicitly contemplated this possibility, giving UPMC the right to withdraw from its Medicare Advantage arrangements with Highmark,\u201d according to the UPMC statement."}
