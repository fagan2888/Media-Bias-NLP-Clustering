Because otherwise, it could only be read as the self-pitying rant of someone who has lost a historically defining argument \u2013 someone who has been \u201csonned,\u201d to use Coates\u2019 term \u2014 and is still too hurt to have access to his powers of reason.\n\nEven with the knowledge that Chait\u2019s cover story predates his debate with Coates, I\u2019m not sure what to make of an article that purports to seriously examine the role of race in politics in the age of Barack Obama, and then compares liberals\u2019 claims of conservative racism to McCarthyism (specifically: \u201cthe poisonous waft of the debates over communism during the \u00adMcCarthy years\u201d). \u201cLiberals dwell in a world of paranoia of a white racism that has seeped out of American history in the Obama years and lurks everywhere, mostly undetectable,\u201d he claims.\n\nThough Chait acknowledges that appeals to white racism have undergirded the modern Republican Party since the civil rights era, he insists liberals are bullies who refuse to \u201cacknowledge that the ability to label a person racist represents, in 21st-century America, real and frequently terrifying power.\u201d He singles out MSNBC for special scorn (full disclosure: I\u2019m a contributor there), while never once mentioning Fox by name. \u201cMSNBC has spent the entire Obama presidency engaged in a nearly nonstop ideological stop-and-frisk operation,\u201d Chait writes.\n\nSee what he did with that \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d reference? In case you\u2019ve missed it, police departments in some cities have been accused of infringing the civil rights of blacks and Latinos by physically stopping them, and invasively frisking them, with little and sometimes no evidence of wrongdoing. It\u2019s kind of a big deal to civil rights liberals, of every race. So Chait tweaks them by accusing MSNBC of stopping and frisking conservatives \u201cideologically\u201d \u2013 as in metaphorically and without consequence, which technically means not stopping and frisking them at all.\n\nIf you liked that comparison, you\u2019re going to love the whole piece.\n\nWell, that\u2019s if you can get past the opening anecdote, which features a clash between Bill Maher and Bill Kristol in which Maher claims the rise of the Tea Party is about having \u201ca black president\u201d and Kristol gets really mad and sad, and the whole mess is supposed to sum up the ugliness of American political debate. Clearly the angels are crying over poor Bill Kristol being hurt by charges of conservative racism made by a liberal comedian on TV. I think Reince Priebus ought to set the whole Kristol-Maher exchange to that Sarah McLachlan music the SPCA uses, and raise money for the RNC.\n\nHere\u2019s what Chait admits Republicans are doing wrong, with regard to race: Enacting restrictive voter laws in states where black turnout has risen. Refusing to expand Medicaid, which disproportionately hurts African-Americans (who vote Democratic). Lying about Obama cutting Medicare, which scares older whites (who vote Republican). Explaining the GOP\u2019s opposition to a Western-style social safety net, he even admits: \u201cThe factor that stands above all the rest is slavery.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s what Chait claims liberals are actually doing wrong with regard to race: mostly telling the truth about all of those things, while occasionally exaggerating it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New York magazine's cover story suggests liberals are paranoid, MSNBC is like stop-and-frisk -- and other oddities", "title": "Jonathan Chait\u2019s epic race fail: How a story about racism and Obama goes horribly wrong", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New York magazine's cover story suggests liberals are paranoid, MSNBC is like stop-and-frisk -- and other oddities", "title": "Jonathan Chait\u2019s epic race fail: How a story about racism and Obama goes horribly wrong", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/07/jonathan_chaits_epic_race_fail_how_a_story_about_racism_and_obama_goes_horribly_wrong/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/jonathan_chait2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New York magazine's cover story suggests liberals are paranoid, MSNBC is like stop-and-frisk -- and other oddities", "title": "Jonathan Chait\u2019s epic race fail: How a story about racism and Obama goes horribly wrong", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/jonathan_chait2.jpg", "creator": "@joanwalsh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joan Walsh", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Bill Kristol, Bill Maher, Democratic Party, Jonathan Chait, Media Criticism, MSNBC, New York Magazine, Race, Racism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Clearly the angels are crying over poor Bill Kristol being hurt by charges of conservative racism made by a liberal comedian on TV.\nIt\u2019s kind of a big deal to civil rights liberals, of every race.\nHere\u2019s what Chait admits Republicans are doing wrong, with regard to race: Enacting restrictive voter laws in states where black turnout has risen.\n\u201cMSNBC has spent the entire Obama presidency engaged in a nearly nonstop ideological stop-and-frisk operation,\u201d Chait writes.\n\u201cLiberals dwell in a world of paranoia of a white racism that has seeped out of American history in the Obama years and lurks everywhere, mostly undetectable,\u201d he claims."}
