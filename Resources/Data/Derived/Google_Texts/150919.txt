Two brothers face charges in connection with more than a dozen armed robberies in the Denver area by the Milli Vanilli bandits, named for the wigs that made them resemble the pop-music duo.

Jeremy Ervin, 33, and Derrick Ervin, 30, also are charged with one count each of kidnapping and menacing involving numerous victims, according to the Denver district attorney’s office.

Jeremy Ervin’s bail is $400,000, and Derrick Ervin’s bail is $300,000. The district attorney’s office said more charges are likely. The investigation continues into the crimes, which investigators said began in November.
