During the last session, key Republican legislators put aside their dislike of Obamacare to craft a unique way to accept federal dollars to provide health insurance to Arkansans who desperately need it: the “private option.” Thank you, Sens. Sanders, Dismang and Burris. Thank you, Rep. Murdock and others who worked behind the scenes to make Arkansas a health care innovations model for the nation.
