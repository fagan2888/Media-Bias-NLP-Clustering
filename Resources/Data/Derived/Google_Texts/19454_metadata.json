Though still plagued by drought and wildfires (smoke fills the Corona sky last week), the Inland Empire is on its way back economically. Photo: Sal Guerra, Associated Press A nod to economic turnaround in the Inland Empire 1 / 1 Back to Gallery\n\nThe Empire is back.\n\nI\u2019m talking not about the new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie but about Southern California\u2019s Inland Empire. Of course, you shouldn\u2019t hold your breath waiting for a statewide celebration of the remarkable comeback of the I.E. \u2014 which encompasses Riverside and San Bernardino counties and their 4.4 million inhabitants. When it comes to this huge section of the state \u2014 with a population greater than Oregon\u2019s \u2014 if the good news isn\u2019t being ignored, it\u2019s being spun as bad.\n\nThe Inland Empire is by far California\u2019s least fashionable region. That\u2019s because it resembles the hotter, grittier, more working-class place the state is actually becoming, not the beautiful, wealthy place we aspire to be. When the I.E. is growing, such gains are dismissed as unwanted or unnatural sprawl; when the I.E. struggles, such pain is considered to be just rewards for an impudent dystopia.\n\nThe glare on the I.E. was especially harsh during the Great Recession, with some pinning the global economic meltdown on its foreclosure crisis. Unfortunately, that narrative proved so durable that it\u2019s obscured the Inland Empire\u2019s startling recovery. An unemployment rate that topped 14 percent in late 2009 has been cut in half. Housing prices have roared back. If there really is a \u201cCalifornia comeback\u201d like one the governor is touting, the I.E. is driving it.\n\nIf you live near the coast, you may not have heard that the Inland Empire has been leading the state in new business creation and industrial space under construction. Or that it rivals the Bay Area in job growth.\n\nThe really good news is that this turnaround is multifaceted. The region\u2019s logistics industry, which warehouses and moves goods coming in and out of the ports, is booming, with a strong dollar inspiring a spike in imports. Low gas prices are helping the region\u2019s transportation firms and commuters. And retail is back in population centers like Ontario, Chino Hills, Corona and Riverside. The high-end grocery store chain Whole Foods is even making a push into the area.\n\nOf course, this sort of growth \u2014 in housing, in retail, in logistics \u2014 is considered gauche in California\u2019s loftier (and leftier) precincts. As Inland Empire Economic Partnership chief economist John Husing has pointed out, California\u2019s environmental regulations are essentially at war with four major sectors in the I.E. \u2014 logistics, construction, manufacturing and mining. And the drought is making the Inland Empire even less popular; photos of drier areas of the Empire often accompany newspaper stories blaming water shortages on supposedly \u201climitless\u201d growth in today\u2019s low-growth California.\n\nOf course, the I.E. has real problems. Poverty rates are among the highest in the state \u2014 more than 17 percent in Riverside County and more than 20 percent in San Bernardino County, or about double the rate of the Bay Area. The education levels of its population are abysmal; only 1 in 5 adults in the Inland Empire has a college degree (compared with 35 percent in San Diego County and more than 40 percent in the Bay Area). The region\u2019s biggest airport, Ontario, has been run poorly for years by Los Angeles\u2019 notoriously dysfunctional airport commission. And the region\u2019s public health statistics are ugly, with the Inland Empire suffering California\u2019s biggest shortages of primary care and specialist physicians.\n\nThe good news about all these problems is the enormous room, and potential, for improvement. The health care industry is starting to take off inland, with the Affordable Care Act creating more patients seeking health care as training programs promise to bring more skilled health care workers and higher-income people to the region. Business and government leaders are trying to take the Ontario airport back from L.A. The leaders of UC Riverside and Cal State San Bernardino have launched an effort to double the number of local students finishing their degrees.\n\nIf the comeback continues, the I.E.\u2019s problems will have more to do with its success. Will the region run out of space for warehouses? Will rising housing costs price out too many families? Will too many people leave the expensive coast and create more traffic?\n\nYou can be sure that Californians will hear more about these problems than the I.E.\u2019s successes. But these will nonetheless be good problems for a region to have. As Alien Ant Farm \u2014 a band with Riverside roots \u2014 likes to sing, \u201cThese days are great. There\u2019s work to do.\u201d\n\nJoe Mathews is California & innovation editor for Z\u00f3calo Public Square, for which he writes the Connecting California column.
