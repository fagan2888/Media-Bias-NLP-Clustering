According to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more women than ever are opting for longer-term birth control rather than a daily pill.\n\nThe report, which used data from 2011 to 2013, found 7.2 percent of American women ages 15 to 44 were using long-acting reversible contraception, like IUDs. According to the Washington Post, that's a huge jump; when asked from 2006 to 2010, only 3.8 percent of women said they used long-term birth control. IUDs were most common in women from 25 to 34; younger women more commonly used the Pill.\n\nMost Popular\n\nBut among the 62 percent of women who said they used contraception, the IUD still has a long way to go. The Pill was still most common form of birth control at 16 percent, sterilization (like getting your tubes tied) was next at 15.5 percent, and male condoms were third at 9.4 percent. About 38 percent of women said they weren't using any contraception, either because they wanted to get pregnant, were pregnant, or weren't sexually active.\n\nThe rise in long-term birth control might be coming from doctors, since new studies have confirmed how effective they are for women of all ages. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists officially recommends them, and they've been proven to help lower the teen pregnancy rate. But some anti-abortion activists say IUDs can induce abortion, since they can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus if inserted up to five days after sex. This belief led Hobby Lobby to petition the Supreme Court in order to avoid covering IUDs under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSo while IUDs are becoming more widespread\u2014and doctors keep singing their praises\u2014there's a whole lot of work to do until they become as common (and accepted) as the Pill.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.contenttype": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://ell.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/02/160x160/54ac0a26cd6b9_-_elle-iud-lgn.jpg", "description": "The percentage of women using long-term birth control has doubled.", "title": "Long Term Birth Control - More Women Using IUDs", "og": {"site_name": "ELLE", "description": "The percentage of women using long-term birth control has doubled.", "title": "More Women Are Ditching the Pill for an IUD", "url": "http://www.elle.com/news/lifestyle/more-women-using-iuds", "image": {"url": "http://ell.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/02/54ac0a26cd6b9_-_elle-iud-lgn.jpg", "width": 656, "identifier": "http://ell.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/02/54ac0a26cd6b9_-_elle-iud-lgn.jpg", "height": 437}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ElleMagazine", "image": {"src": "http://ell.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/02/54ac0a26cd6b9_-_elle-iud-lgn.jpg"}, "description": "The percentage of women using long-term birth control has doubled.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "More Women Are Ditching the Pill for an IUD"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-11T09:45:00-05:00", "sailthru.socialtitle": "More Women Are Ditching the Pill for an IUD", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1020430032, affiliate-data=pt=300297&ct=OnSiteELM&mt=8", "fb": {"app_id": 364664413547847, "pages": 31911516300}, "auto-publish": "evergreen", "sailthru.tags": "Life & Love, life & love news,birth control,birth control", "google-site-verification": "_9K14mnjQnY1H1YpyTiLdbU_MrfASP05oqmwHL_t3yw", "keywords": "birth control,iud,birth control pill", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellemagazine", "section": "Sex & Relationships", "published_time": "2014-12-11 02:45:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-06 20:49:18"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://ell.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/02/640x320/54ac0a26cd6b9_-_elle-iud-lgn.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "According to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more women than ever are opting for longer-term birth control rather than a daily pill.\nThe rise in long-term birth control might be coming from doctors, since new studies have confirmed how effective they are for women of all ages.\nAccording to the Washington Post, that's a huge jump; when asked from 2006 to 2010, only 3.8 percent of women said they used long-term birth control.\nMost PopularBut among the 62 percent of women who said they used contraception, the IUD still has a long way to go.\nThe Pill was still most common form of birth control at 16 percent, sterilization (like getting your tubes tied) was next at 15.5 percent, and male condoms were third at 9.4 percent."}
