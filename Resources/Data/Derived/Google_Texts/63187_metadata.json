Just as the ACA was about to drop in 2012, we convened a panel of Westchester County\u2019s leading healthcare experts to tell us what they expected (\u201cCounty Check-Up,\u201d 914INC., Q2 2012). Now, three years later, with the ACA underway and here to stay, we went back to the county\u2019s healthcare leaders to find out what has changed in the business of healthcare in the past three years: what\u2019s new, what\u2019s working, what isn\u2019t, and whether Obamacare has been great, terrible, or somewhere in-between for the healthcare industry.\n\nThe answer is, as saner heads predicted, the latter. The ACA has not solved all the problems of the American healthcare system; neither has it ushered in a socialist state. On the whole, though, our experts believe that the ACA has been a success.\n\n\u201cThe ACA has borne out as quieting the naysayers,\u201d says Daren Wu, MD, chief medical officer of Open Door Family Medical Centers, a nonprofit, federally qualified community health center, with locations in Ossining, Port Chester, Brewster, Sleepy Hollow, and Mount Kisco. \u201cAs flawed as it is, many of us who work with the indigent or those with barriers to access [to healthcare] were in favor of the ACA even with its limitations. Now we are seeing it is very beneficial. The number of uninsured have come down substantially, and that is a good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone predicted Armageddon, and we haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d agrees Simeon Schwartz, MD, president and CEO of WESTMED Medical Group, a large provider group with six offices in Westchester and others in Connecticut. \u201cI think it has worked out really well for medical groups and the [insurance] carriers. We are providing better access to the community regardless of the payer.\u201d\n\nAiming at \u2018the Triple Aim\u2019\n\nOur experts also agree on another point: The ACA has fundamentally changed the healthcare business model. Whether that, too, is good or bad, and for whom, is still up in the air. \u201cHealthcare has been fairly archaic and culture-bound in many ways, and we are now adapting to a new environment that is not entirely here just yet,\u201d says Dr. Wu. \u201cThis is exciting and necessary to improve quality and reduce costs, but we are still in the transition phase.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ACA has borne out as quieting the naysayers. As flawed as it is...it is very beneficial.\u201d \u2014Darren Wu, MD, Open Door Family Medical Centers\n\nImproving the quality of care and reducing costs, along with improving the health of populations most at risk for disease, constitute the so-called Triple Aim of healthcare reform and comprise the shaky bedrock under the seismic changes occurring in the industry. Healthcare is moving from its traditional fee-for-service model\u2014you perform an x-ray; you get paid for it\u2014to outcomes-based or value-based compensation, in which doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers are paid for meeting health goals. For hospitals, that includes, for example, reducing readmission rates or improving infection scores.\n\nThat should be good for the healthcare system generally, but when you drill down it presents its own specific difficulties. \u201cThe goals are very positive in focusing on quality and efficiency, but the challenges are that different pieces of the healthcare continuum are being affected at different times,\u201d says Susan Fox, president and CEO of White Plains Hospital. \u201cHospitals are penalized if patients are readmitted in 30 days, and that goal is good, but while the hospital has a role in that, so do the physicians and patients. Right now, only the hospital is being penalized; not everyone is incentivized the same way.\u201d That has required more collaboration between hospitals and community physicians, she says, to ensure that \u201cthe pieces work together so that patients get the care they need.\u201d\n\nMergers and acquisitions\n\nConsolidation among the various players in the healthcare space has never been greater. We are in the midst of a feeding frenzy, in fact, as bigger systems purchase smaller community hospitals and provider groups in dizzying numbers. White Plains Hospital, for example, recently became part of the Montefiore Health System, just one of numerous mergers bringing hospitals, small private physician practices, outpatient care facilities, and others in the healthcare industry into ever larger conglomerates. As in other industries, size helps control costs through economies of scale and elimination of redundancies. But healthcare isn\u2019t like other industries\u2014people\u2019s lives are at stake. Is so much medical consolidation good for the patient?\n\n\u201cThe impact of escalating prices and provider consolidation on healthcare quality is still unknown.\u201d \u2014Georgeanne Chapin, Hudson Center for Health Equality and Quality\n\nThe jury is still out, according to Schwartz. \u201cThe economics of the ACA and the current climate of medicine does not favor private practice, and that has accelerated a trend that had already started,\u201d he says. \u201cHospitals are concerned about their survival and consolidating rapidly. The biggest surprise to me is the speed at which traditional, small private practices are leaving the county. There are fewer and fewer of them; most have joined larger groups or gone to hospitals.\u201d\n\nThat could prove costly both financially and in terms of patient satisfaction, says Georganne Chapin, founder of Hudson Center for Health Equity and Quality. Because of all this consolidation, she says, \u201c\u2018competition,\u2019 which was supposed to keep costs down, is elusive. The impact of escalating prices and provider consolidation on healthcare quality is still unknown.\u201d\n\nBut it is worrisome. \u201cPatient perception is what keeps me up at night,\u201d Dr. Wu says. \u201cPatients want convenience and quality in their interactions with us, as opposed to cost scores.\n\nAnd clinicians don\u2019t want to work in this environment. They want to work for urgent care or concierge practices, somewhere without so many mandates. As the CMO, I struggle with making sure clinicians feel satisfied and supported in the model we have.\u201d\n\nConsolidation is adding financial stress to the big players, as well. \u201cThe whole landscape of healthcare, the way we organize and deliver care, is changing before our eyes,\u201d says Joel A. Perlman, executive vice president\u2013finance, Montefiore Health System. \u201cIt has been breathtaking what\u2019s happened in the last 18-24 months. In Westchester County, virtually every hospital was independent back then, and now virtually every hospital has joined a system or acquired other hospitals to become larger themselves.\u201d With this growth come a lot of stresses, he adds, including the impacts on the treasuries of the organizations. \u201cIt is very difficult to change the system without spending money. In the case of Montefiore, we have added hospitals and doctor groups to our network, many of which were financially frail. We took six hospitals out of bankruptcy, one or more of which wouldn\u2019t be here without us stepping in. That taxes the resources of any organization. It will take time for us to come out the other end,\u201d Perlman explains.\n\n\u201cThere was the view that Obamacare would be expensive and cost jobs, and that is absolutely false.\u201d \u2014H. Michael Dreher, MD, School of Nursing, The College of New Rochelle\n\nWinners and losers\n\nConsolidation is not the only surprise in the wake of ACA implementation. Other, more positive results have been noticed. \u201cThere was the view that Obamacare would be expensive and cost jobs, and that is absolutely false,\u201d says H. Michael Dreher, MD, dean of the School of Nursing at the College of New Rochelle. \u201cThe opposite has happened. The industry has gotten larger and so has the need for workers in all sectors of healthcare. If you look at Bureau of Labor statistics, their projections show occupational therapy, physical therapy, health educators, nutritionists and dietitians, IT, and nursing as growth areas.\u201d\n\nAnother positive: While the annual costs of healthcare continue to rise, the cost curve is decreasing, Dr. Dreher says. In addition, he points out, many prognosticators, \u201cin their hysteria,\u201d thought employers would drop their insurance plans and force employees into the ACA marketplace. \u201cThat has not happened. The employee-based system remains relatively intact,\u201d he says.\n\nMontefiore Health System has expanded its presence in Westchester over the past few years, adding several hospitals and medical groups to its network. Photo by Daniel Federowicz\n\nStill, there have been losers\u2014or, at least, strugglers\u2014as well as winners in the past few years. Countywide, hospital utilization is down approximately 7 percent over the past few years. \u201c[Hospitals] were definitely prioritized in how the legislation focuses on keeping patients out of the hospital and decreasing the most expensive care in the system,\u201d Fox says. \u201cWe have fewer patients to cover our costs, so we have all had to deal with that in different ways.\u201d One way for White Plains Hospital was merging with Montefiore\u2014a trend that is happening across the healthcare spectrum, she says. \u201cEverybody is trying to figure out what their new place is, what the future is, and what their role is in healthcare\u2026trying to understand what partnerships are out there, to understand that there are a lot of blurred lines among providers now.\u201d\n\nAnother way organizations like White Plains Hospital cope with fewer inpatients lies in expanding both inpatient and outpatient services. \u201cWe opened two cardiac catheterization labs to provide advanced cardiology services, and we are following up with an application to perform open-heart surgery,\u201d Fox says. \u201cWe have also increased the level of cancer care with the recruitment of thoracic surgeons. We have turned the challenge into an opportunity to focus on providing programs and services here that traditional community hospitals hadn\u2019t provided before. We are increasing our complexity of care and program offerings to make sure our business model improves.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Westchester, virtually every hospital was independent, and now virtually every hospital has joined a system or acquired other hospitals to be larger themselves.\u201d \u2014 Joel A. Perlman, Montefiore Health System\n\nStill Not Enough?\n\nBut some experts, like Chapin, believe that the ACA has not gone far enough. \u201cNine million people have gotten health insurance, which is good for 9 million people,\u201d she explains. \u201cPrivate insurance companies have gained 9 million new customers, many of them paid for (at least in part) with government subsidies. But the \u2018uninsured problem\u2019 has not been solved\u2014the nation still has at least 33 million uninsured\u2014and the system for financing uncompensated care has not evolved to respond to the new reality.\u201d Chapin also notes that many of the new insurance plans have punishingly high deductibles. \u201cSo [people] are \u2018insured\u2019 but actually cannot afford to get the healthcare they need,\u201d she says. \u201cUnder-insurance, due to people purchasing lousy plans or plans with very high deductibles, is a problem that is worsening.\u201d\n\nMontefiore\u2019s Perlman agrees. \u201cShifting costs to patients and families is fine in some respects, when the purpose is to get people engaged and knowledgeable about their own care, but when you cost-shift to people with little discretionary income who are living paycheck to paycheck, I worry about self-denial and not accessing the system in the right way. It works fine for someone like me, because I can afford it, but it doesn\u2019t work for everybody. I think there is still work to be done on this,\u201d he says.\n\nIf there is one agreed-upon villain in all this, it is Big Pharma. The ACA contains little if any power to regulate the pharmacy industry, and Dr. Schwartz calls skyrocketing pharmacy costs \u201cunbelievable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that the ACA did not take on the pharmacy industry makes the management of value-based healthcare very difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact that 10 to 15 years ago you could have gotten an asthma inhaler for $20, and now it costs $500 a month, should be criminal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have turned the challenge into an opportunity to focus on providing services that community hospitals hadn\u2019t provided before.\u201d \u2014Susan Fox, White Plains Hospital\n\nSo what can we expect next? \u201cMay you live in interesting times\u201d is the oft-repeated curse that perhaps best describes the current state of the healthcare business. Our experts all think the climate will remain \u201cinteresting\u201d for some time to come. \u201cI suspect that five years from now we will be delivering and experiencing care in very different ways than we are today,\u201d Perlman says. \u201cThat\u2019s why anticipating the future and investing in the right things is critically important [for healthcare businesses]. For a successful future, you have to be out in front, and that requires some level of risk taking. With so much going on simultaneously, it taxes everybody, so getting our decisions and investments right the first time is best.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a business it is a completely new paradigm,\u201d Dr. Wu agrees. \u201cHealthcare will always be phenomenally profitable for those who understand the new rules and build their partnerships well. The ACA is bending the cost curve, and as data is better understood and utilized to reduce excessive costs and remove waste, it will help all of America. I am a firm believer that the ACA was a positive thing. I will never say it was perfect, but it is a big, important step in the right direction.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Obamacare, healthcare, Affordable care act, ACA, medical, care", "p": {"domain_verify": "5b2d509b76c48ac5b136eca273d3c367"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.westchestermagazine.com/914-INC/Q4-2015/Obamacares-Effect-On-Our-Healthcare-Business/", "image": "http://www.westchestermagazine.com/914-INC/Q4-2015/Obamacares-Effect-On-Our-Healthcare-Business/WPH-retouched-blue-logo-glow-sept-23.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "How has the healthcare business changed in the wake of Obamacare?
