That in turn is connected to a theme I mentioned back in the first dispatch from this \"East River\" part of the Dakotas: Sioux Falls has made such a powerful and mostly positive impression on us largely because it so clearly represents a long-standing part of the essential American bargain. It is successful, and rough-edged -- a contemporary City of Big Shoulders, with lots of its economic machinery displayed rather than tucked out of site. A century-plus ago, one aspect of its economic boom was its role as quickie-divorce center. A generation-plus ago, it put itself on the financial-services map when South Dakota eliminated usury laws and drew Citibank and other credit-card companies to set up headquarters in Sioux Falls. There will be more to say about that phase of the city's history.\n\nBut in addition to the visible raw edges, like the huge slaughterhouse and the penitentiary that both sit right downtown, the city also has an extensive and remarkable architectural heritage. That is what John Tierney describes today, starting with the striking Richardson-style Romanesque buildings that define much of the look of downtown. The image at the top shows one of many buildings by the city's most influential architect, Wallace L. Dow. It's part of the state pen. By John Tierney It used to be that if you wanted to get a sense of what distant cities and towns looked like, you had to travel there yourself, view guidebooks and coffee-table photobooks, get hold of postcards, or endure friends\u2019 slide shows and endless monologues. These days, it\u2019s easy to learn the look of other places by turning to Google\u2019s Street View, YouTube, and other Web resources.\n\nRead more Reinvention and resilience across the nation But it\u2019s still helpful, if you\u2019re trying to get a sense of a city\u2019s architectural style and its most treasured structures, to have someone curate a selection of buildings and sites for you. So, in that spirit, for many of the cities that Jim and Deb will be visiting for the American Futures project, we\u2019ll provide an amateur\u2019s guide to notable buildings in town. Some of these will be Fallows photos; most will be from the Web. Sioux Falls is a terrific city to begin this exercise because it contains many beautiful buildings, over 65 of them on the National Register of Historic Places. Carolyn Torma, an expert on South Dakota\u2019s architectural treasures, explains in a 1989 article in the journal South Dakota History, that many of the grand buildings in Sioux Falls were designed in the late nineteenth century by Wallace L. Dow and Joseph Schwarz, architects who \u201ccelebrated the picturesque and the romantic,\u201d working in \u201crichly ornamented and colorful styles.\u201d Torma explains: Both employed in many of their buildings rusticated or rock-faced Sioux quartzite [a red/pink quartzite quarried in abundance in the Sioux Falls region], round-arched Romanesque [Richardsonian] details, and irregular floor plans. Further, the picturesque styles of the era \u2013 Romanesque, Stick, Shingle, Italianate, Queen Anne, and Gothic Revival, to name a few \u2013 made little attempt to reproduce faithfully their historical sources. Instead, designs were bold, almost freehand, interpretations.
