George this week launched a bi-partisan, interfaith effort calling for the military destruction of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS/ISIL) and an intervention by the United States and international community to bring an end to the genocide against Christians, Yazidis, and others in Iraq.\n\n\u201cWe call upon President Obama and the U.S. Congress to expand airstrikes against ISIS/ISIL with a view to eroding its military power, and to provide full air support for Kurdish and other forces fighting against ISIS/ISIL,\u201d said Robert P. George, McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence at Princeton, in an online petition signed by dozens of leaders from the intellectual left, right and center including Susannah Heschel, Dartmouth College\u2019s Eli Black professor of Jewish Studies; Russell D. Moore, President of the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission; Dr. Benjamin Carson; writer Leon Wieseltier; and publisher Martin H. \u201cMarty\u201d Peretz.\n\nThe petition found at IraqRescue.org, which is supported by conservatives, moderates, and liberals, states, \u201cno options that are consistent with the principles of just war doctrine should be off the table\u201d and \u201cthat the United States\u2019 goal must be more comprehensive than simply clamping a short-term lid on the boiling violence that is threatening so many innocents in ISIS/ISIL\u2019s path. Nothing short of the destruction of ISIS/ISIL as a fighting force will provide long-term protection of victims.\u201d\n\nThe group endorses the Washington Post\u2019s call for the United States to provide arms, ammunition, and equipment to Kurdish forces, Sunni tribesmen, and others who are currently hampered in their ability to fight ISIS/ISIL and to do \u201ceverything necessary\u201d to empower local forces fighting to protect the people of Iraq.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that the United States and the international community act immediately and decisively against the attacks by ISIS/ISIL,\u201d said Dr. George. \u201cISIS/ISIL has engaged in crimes against humanity by deliberately causing mass starvation and dehydration, and by committing unconscionable acts of barbarism against noncombatants, including defenseless women, children, and elderly persons.\n\n\u201cThe time to act is now and the United States should take the lead in bringing an end to this genocide and protecting the innocent against attacks by ISIS/ISIL.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama recently authorized bombing against ISIS/ISIL\u2019s artillery to protect humanitarian efforts to provide food and water for the refugees trapped by ISIS/ISIL on a mountain in Iraq.\n\nYesterday former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee (R) on Fox News said condemning the genocide in Iraq is not enough. \u201cI think the world is looking for a [Good] Samaritan. The priests and the Levites are walking by and saying, \u2018This is horrible. Gee, this is terrible,\u2019 but that doesn\u2019t save those children who are getting their heads cut off, and it\u2019s not saving those babies who are starving up in 100-degree heat up on Mt. Sinjar,\u201d Huckabee stated on the Kelly File.\n\n\u201cJesus said, \u2018Blessed are the peacemakers.\u2019 And I think a lot of people don\u2019t understand that there\u2019s a difference between a peace lover and a peacemaker. Everybody loves peace, but wearing jewelry around your neck and saying \u2018I love peace\u2019 doesn\u2019t bring it. It takes sometimes military action to make peace especially when you have wolves who are devouring the sheep. That\u2019s what we have going on in Iraq right now,\u201d Huckabee said.\n\n\u201cYou either kill the wolf or you stand by and watch the sheep get slaughtered,\u201d Huckabee noted that sometimes a just war is the only option.\n\nEven the Vatican acknowledged that air strikes are necessary to stop the bloodshed of innocents.\n\nArchbishop Giorgio Lingua, the pope\u2019s ambassador to Baghdad, told Vatican radio that the American strikes are \u201csomething that had to be done, otherwise [the Islamic State forces] could not be stopped.\u201d Lingua spoke plaintively of the ordeals faced by an estimated 100,000 Christian refugees from northern Iraq \u2013 many of whom, he said, are children \u2013 to account for his view of the American campaign. \u201cYou can see these kids sleeping on the streets,\u201d Lingua said, adding, \u201c[there is so much] suffering.\u201d In a similar vein, Archbishop Silvano Tomasi, the Vatican\u2019s envoy to the United Nations in Geneva, told Vatican Radio that \u201cmilitary action in this moment is probably necessary.\u201d Both Lingua and Tomasi went on to say that the international community needs to do more to unmask whoever\u2019s supporting the radical Islamic State forces and to cut off its supply of arms, signaling reservations about widening the conflict. At the same time, their endorsement of the American action, however grudging, was unmistakable. In light of recent history, it\u2019s a sharp reversal of course.\n\nExpanding military action in Iraq will likely meet opposition.\n\nU.S. Senator Paul Rand (R-KY) last week in Iowa said that he opposed sending troops back to Iraq.\n\n\u201cEverybody is saying we have to be involved in Iraq to do something about ISIS. How did ISIS get so strong? Because we are arming the Islamic rebels. Maybe not them directly, but we created a safe haven for them by beating back Assad. Who is the number one military opponent of ISIS right now? Assad. He is the one bombing ISIS\u2019 camp. The second strongest opponent of ISIS? Iran. What happened when they attacked Mosul? They ran. The Iraqis ran. So people are saying we need to get back in there. Do you really want to send our sons and daughters to fight for Mosul when the Iraqis won\u2019t fight for Mosul? I can\u2019t do that,\u201d Paul stated.\n\nU.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) told reporters after The FAMiLY Leadership Summit in Ames, IA last Saturday that the events in Iraq are the latest manifestations of President Obama\u2019s failed foreign policy. \u201cFor the last five years America has receded from leadership in the world and that has created a vacuum. And into that vacuum have stepped in nations like Iran, like Russia, like China and it has made the world a much more dangerous place,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cWhat ISIS is doing in Iraq is unspeakable. ISIS is the face of evil. ISIS right now is crucifying Christians in Iraq. Crucifixion is not something that just occurred two thousand years ago they are doing it right now today. ISIS is beheading children who are Christians in Iraq. ISIS consists of radical Islamic terrorists who are so extreme they were thrown out of Al Qaeda,\u201d Cruz added. \u201cI am glad that President Obama is finally beginning to take the threat of ISIS seriously. Just a few months ago he dismissed ISIS as the junior varsity and the President\u2019s foreign policy team utterly missed the threat of ISIS and indeed was actively working to arm Syrian rebels who were fighting side by side with ISIS. Now ISIS has taken over much of Iraq and we\u2019re engaged right now in military strikes, but sadly when the President spoke (Saturday) morning he did nothing to articulate a clear military objective of what we were trying to accomplish.\u201d\n\nCruz said that President Obama needs to articulate a \u201cclearly stated military objective that hinges off of U.S. national security interests.\u201d He also aid if military action is ongoing President Obama needs to come to Congress for authorization of military action. He said it may well be in the U.S. national security to take out ISIS ability to wage war because of their use of American weaponry including Abrahams tanks, but the President has not made that case Cruz said.\n\nOther Republicans are in favor of some action in Iraq to curb ISIS.\n\nHuckabee at the same event on Saturday said he opposed troops on the ground citing that not even the Kurds have asked for that. \u201cWhat they want is arms. They need something other BB guns. They\u2019ve got nothing. They are using AK-47s. They don\u2019t even have a bullet that we\u2019ve left for them. We promised them arms. We said we were going to give it. Maliki said \u2018give it to me and I\u2019ll see that they get it\u2019 and that was an absolute lie. Because he is an absolute liar, he\u2019s an utterly corrupt person,\u201d Huckabee said.\n\nHuckabee noted that the U.S. should have left Iraq in 2011 with a status of forces agreement, but the Obama administration neglected make sure that was in place.\n\nGovernor Bobby Jindal (R-LA) also weighed in on ISIS at the Summit citing that the Obama administration has lacked a coherent foreign policy, but supported his recent action.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice to hear a coherent foreign policy when it comes to ISIS. He owes it to the American people. He owes it to our troops in uniform to define what the strategic vision is, what the strategic plan is. It is unacceptable, I believe that it is unacceptable to allow ISIS to occupy territory in Iraq and Syria to continue to grow in strength. The President did admit that they underestimated this threat, and the strength of ISIS. This is a dangerous threat,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cThis is a terrorist group that is not going to be satisfied simply with the territory in Iraq and Syria. This is certainly an issue for those innocent civilians caught in the middle of this fighting. This is also an issue for all of us who care about our safety, our values and our freedoms. These are terrorists who disagree with our fundamental values and our beliefs. This is a group that will, if it has the capability, bring that fight to us. So I think it was right to order the airstrikes. I wish he had given us a more coherent overview of his strategy, his plan to deal with ISIS, and I also wished they acted sooner and not let the crisis grow to this point.\u201d\n\nFox News reported today that the White House and Pentagon are at odds with how to proceed in Iraq.\n\nAs of this writing the Iraq Rescue petition launched by George has gathered over 3300 signatures.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/08/human-rights-activists-call-for-destruction-of-isis-as-fighting-force/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ISIS-Iraq.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2014-08-14T17:47:02+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "barack obama, ben carson, bobby jindal, christian persecution, iraq, iraqrescue.org, isil, isis, islamic state of iraq and syria, mike huckabee, rand paul, robert p. george, ted cruz, u.s. politics", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Human rights activists say immediate action is needed to protect religious minorities against Islamic militants\u2019 genocide in Iraq.", "title": "Human Rights Activists Call For Destruction of ISIS As Fighting Force | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ISIS-Iraq.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-14T12:56:56-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/08/human-rights-activists-call-for-destruction-of-isis-as-fighting-force/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Human rights activists say immediate action is needed to protect religious minorities against Islamic militants\u2019 genocide in Iraq.", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ISIS-Iraq.jpg", "title": "Human Rights Activists Call For Destruction of ISIS As Fighting Force | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2014-08-14T12:47:02-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "U.S. Politics", "modified_time": "2014-08-14T12:56:56-05:00", "tag": "Ted Cruz"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f89\"", "article_summary": "It takes sometimes military action to make peace especially when you have wolves who are devouring the sheep.\n\u201cI am glad that President Obama is finally beginning to take the threat of ISIS seriously.\nThat\u2019s what we have going on in Iraq right now,\u201d Huckabee said.\nWho is the number one military opponent of ISIS right now?\n\u201cIt is imperative that the United States and the international community act immediately and decisively against the attacks by ISIS/ISIL,\u201d said Dr. George."}
