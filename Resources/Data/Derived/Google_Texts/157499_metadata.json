(Photo: EPA)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s less than a year until the election and \u201cunsure\u201d is running away with the Florida Senate race.\n\nMany voters still have no idea whom they like among the candidates running to succeed Republican Sen. Marco Rubio in 2016.\n\nThe latest evidence came this week from the Saint Leo University Polling Institute, which polled likely voters from both parties and found little enthusiasm for either slate.\n\nIn the Republican field, \u201cunsure\u201d received 56.5 percent, followed by Rep. David Jolly (11.6 percent), Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera (8.2 percent), entrepreneur and combat veteran Todd Wilcox (6.8 percent), Rep. Ron DeSantis (6.1 percent) and writer Ilya Katz (4.1 percent). \u201cSomeone else\u201d got 6.8 percent.\n\nOn the Democratic side, \u201cunsure\u201d led with 46.9 percent, followed by Rep. Patrick Murphy (16.9 percent), Rep. Alan Grayson (7.1 percent), life coach Lateresa Jones (6.3 percent), and lawyer and Navy veteran Pam Keith (4.4 percent). \u201cSomeone else\u201d got 7.7 percent.\n\nThe margin of error was large \u2014 plus or minus 8 percentage points for Republicans and plus or minus 7.5 percentage points for Democrats) \u2014 but Floridians don\u2019t seem to be paying much attention to the Senate race.\n\nThe results of an August poll by Quinnipiac University were even less revealing.\n\n\u201cNone of the possible candidates in the 2016 race for Rubio's Senate seat has achieved enough voter recognition for a valid measure of their favorability,\u201d that poll concluded.\n\nRubio adds another deep-pocketed donor\n\nMarco Rubio is on a roll, picking up the endorsement Thursday of yet another big-name Republican fundraiser.\n\nNorth Carolina discount store magnate Art Pope told the (Raleigh, N.C.) News & Observer that he intends to raise money for the Florida senator\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s the best-qualified candidate based on his public service and life experiences, and I agree with him on most of the issues,\u201d Pope told the paper.\n\nWhile Pope may not be a household name, he\u2019s an influential player in conservative politics. The owner of Variety Wholesalers, he\u2019s the former budget director for North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory and a long-time ally of libertarian billionaire Charles Koch (who hasn\u2019t endorsed anyone in the GOP primary).\n\nPope\u2019s move comes a day after Chicago hedge-fund billionaire Ken Griffin announced his support for Rubio. The freshman senator also has picked up endorsements from financier Paul Singer and Idaho businessman Frank VanderSloot, a top fundraiser for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign. He\u2019s also being backed by Miami auto magnate Norman Braman.\n\nBush picks up\n\nneeded endorsement\n\nJeb Bush, hovering around 4 percent in national polls, got some good news on the campaign trail this week.\n\nSen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi endorsed Bush\u2019s bid for president on Tuesday, calling the former Florida governor a \u201cproven leader.\u2019\u2019\n\nCochran, chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, is the fourth senator to endorse Bush\u2019s campaign for the GOP nomination. The others are Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Orrin Hatch of Utah and Dean Heller of Nevada.\n\nCochran\u2019s endorsement comes after recent trips by Bush to Mississippi. Bush attended a fundraiser in Jackson on Monday, and he visited the state last month for a tailgate party at the Egg Bowl between Mississippi State and the University of Mississippi.\n\n\u201cJeb Bush is the proven leader the American people need as we face grave threats from abroad and continued economic challenges at home,\u2019\u2019 Cochran said in a statement released by the Bush campaign. \u201cJeb is a serious leader with executive experience and a forward-looking vision. He offers real solutions to lead our nation, to return more power to the states and to keep us secure.\u201d\n\nCochran and the Bush family have a long history. Cochran worked with Bush\u2019s father, George H.W. Bush, when he was president and when he served as chairman of the Republican National Committee in the 1970s. Cochran also worked closely with Bush\u2019s brother, former president George W. Bush, when he sought federal aid and help after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nThe Republican primary in Mississippi is March 8.\n\nHealthcare sign-ups\n\napproach 600K\n\nWith a crucial deadline approaching, nearly 590,000 Floridians already have signed up for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act during the current enrollment period, the Obama administration reported Wednesday.\n\nEnrollment began Nov. 1 and runs through Jan. 31. People who want coverage starting Jan. 1 must sign up by Dec. 15 on HealthCare.gov or its Spanish-language counterpart, CuidadodeSalud.gov.\n\nFlorida is one of 38 states where people use the federal exchange \u2014 rather than a state-run exchange \u2014 to shop for health care plans and learn whether they qualify for a subsidy in the form of a tax credit. More than 90 percent of state residents who got coverage on the federal exchange during the previous enrollment period qualified for a subsidy.\n\nPeople who choose to go uninsured face a penalty equal to 2.5% of their household income or a dollar amount based on the number of people in their household who lack coverage \u2014 whichever is higher. The per-capita penalty could run as high as $2,085, according to the federal government.\n\nContributing: Fredreka Schouten and Deborah Berry, USA TODAY\n\nContact Ledyard King atlking@gannett.com; Twitter:@ledgeking\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1QDJ0u5", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Rubio, Bush get valuable donors, backers", "og": {"site_name": "Florida Today", "description": "Rubio, Bush get valuable donors, backers", "title": "Fla.
