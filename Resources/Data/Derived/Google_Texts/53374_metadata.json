With those, you get so many fine particulate pieces of coffee and so many coarse bits that the resulting brew is both under- and over-extracted at the same time,\u201d she said. \u201cThe real key is finding an amazing grinder that is consistent, that is even. When you set it, it won\u2019t shift around.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not ground appropriately for your brew method or if it\u2019s not grinding consistently, you can buy the best beans in the world and they would not taste good,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you got the water temperature right, if you got your coffee-to-water ratio right on, it still wouldn\u2019t be good, because there would be parts of coffee in there that were under-extracted and parts that were over-extracted. You\u2019d get this strange both cardboardy and tart thing going on at the same time, and that\u2019s not good.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "coffee tips,Denver Coffee,latte art,Novo Coffee", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/2014/11/24/denver-coffee-novo-coffee/", "site_name": "The Den", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/files/2014/11/IMG_0395-495x371.jpg", "type": "blog", "title": "Denver Coffee: Getting a better grind with Novo Coffee"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Denver Coffee: Getting a better grind with Novo Coffee", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/2014/11/24/denver-coffee-novo-coffee/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/files/2014/11/IMG_0395-495x371.jpg", "creator": "@emilierusch", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Want better coffee at home?
