It\u2019s not a big chance \u2014 5 percent \u2014 but you can imagine a scenario in which the stop Trump forces produce a hung convention, and Kasich emerges as the supposedly reasonable candidate. So an advance warning: he\u2019s a con artist too.\n\nFor one thing, he engages in his own form of ludicrous self-aggrandizement, claiming to have been the \u201carchitect\u201d of the briefly balanced federal budget of the late Clinton years \u2014 which is sheer fantasy:\n\nThat\u2019s only true if by \u201cchief architect,\u201d you mean that he voted against the two bills that did the most to get the government in the black, and sponsored one that sounded like it did a lot but actually didn\u2019t.\n\nBut what provoked this post was his line, which he repeats often, about wanting to \u201cUberize\u201d the federal government. Ask yourself: what is that supposed to mean?\n\nBear in mind that the federal government is best thought of as a giant insurance company with an army. Nondefense spending is dominated by Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and a few smaller social-insurance programs (now including the subsidies in the Affordable Care Act.) How, exactly, is an Uber-like model supposed to do anything to make that work better?\n\nAnd don\u2019t say it would remove the vast armies of bureaucrats. Administrative costs for those federal programs are actually quite low compared with the private sector, mainly because they\u2019re not trying to deny coverage and don\u2019t engage in competitive advertising.\n\nIf Kasich means anything, he means \u201cprivatize\u201d, not Uberize \u2014 convert Social Security into a giant 401(k) plan, replace Medicare with vouchers. But that wouldn\u2019t poll very well, would it?\n\nThe point is that Kasich is running on a false boast about his past and a nonsense slogan about the present. No, he\u2019s not the grownup in the room.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160305103521, "BN": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 5, 2016", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/The Kasich Con ( 20160305 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "twitter": {"description": "Nonsense Uber alles.", "title": "The Kasich Con", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/the-kasich-con/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Nonsense Uber alles.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "March 5, 2016", "article": {"published_time": 1457192121, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2016-03-05T15:35:21-05:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20160305153521, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20160305, "pdate": 20160305, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Nonsense Uber alles.", "title": "The Kasich Con", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/the-kasich-con/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/the-kasich-con/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Kasich Con", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "If Kasich means anything, he means \u201cprivatize\u201d, not Uberize \u2014 convert Social Security into a giant 401(k) plan, replace Medicare with vouchers.\nNondefense spending is dominated by Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and a few smaller social-insurance programs (now including the subsidies in the Affordable Care Act.)\nAdministrative costs for those federal programs are actually quite low compared with the private sector, mainly because they\u2019re not trying to deny coverage and don\u2019t engage in competitive advertising.\nBut what provoked this post was his line, which he repeats often, about wanting to \u201cUberize\u201d the federal government.\nThe point is that Kasich is running on a false boast about his past and a nonsense slogan about the present."}
