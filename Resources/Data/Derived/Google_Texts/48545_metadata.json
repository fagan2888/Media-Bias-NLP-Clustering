Warren/AP\n\nWashington state Rep. Jim Moeller, D-Vancouver, will challenge Republican Congresswomen Jaime Herrera Beutler in the state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent my life representing the families of Clark County,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a public servant, my goal is to basically give the representation we deserve. Unfortunately, it is not happening in Washington D.C. I emphatically intend on changing that.\u201d\n\nMoeller said he\u2019s a \u201cliberal\u201d and objects to the repeated attempts by congressional Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMoeller also said Herrera Beutler is a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for Republican leaders.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Jaime has represented the district very well in the last six years,\u201d Moeller said. \u201cShe has been disengaged from serving as our representative. We need principled leadership in Washington and I know that I can provide that.\u201d\n\nMoeller represents the most formidable challenger to enter the 2016 race against Herrera Beutler.\n\n\u201cIt means that is a competitive race, where it wasn\u2019t before\u201d said Carolyn Long, a political professor at Washington State University, Vancouver.\n\nMoeller served as a member of the Vancouver City Council before running for state representative. He was elected to the Washington House in 2002 and served as speaker pro tempore until giving up his seat this year to run for lieutenant governor.\n\nMoeller has worked as a drug dependency councilor in Clark County for the last 30 years. While in the Washington Legislature, he authored a bill that became law aimed at curbing opiate addiction.\n\nLong said Moeller will have access to donors and likely party resources because he\u2019s been in Democratic politics for so long. She said those connections will help him run a competitive race.\n\nBut Long also noted that when Washington\u2019s 3rd Congressional District was redrawn, it was done so as a relatively safe district that favors Republicans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now a conservative congressional district,\u201d Long said. \u201cAs a conservative congressional district, any challenge to Herrera Beutler is an uphill battle.\u201d\n\nLong said she sees two things working in Moeller\u2019s favor:\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty of how the Trump-Clinton match will affect down ticket races,\u201d she said. \u201cJim\u2019s high name recognition in the region will help him more than previous challengers who were new comers to politics.\u201d\n\nHerrera Beutler maintains she\u2019s an independent voice and one willing to speak out against her party.\n\nSpokeswoman Amy Pennington said the congresswomen has objected to the way Republican party leaders have approached funding for the Zika virus \u2013 essentially repurposing funds meant to target Ebola.\n\n\u201cJaime knows no party is right 100% of the time and she hasn\u2019t been afraid to speak out or vote for the people she represents,\u201d Pennington said in an email.\n\nLong noted that Herrera Beutler is in a difficult spot when it comes to the party\u2019s presumed presidential nominee. Unlike some of her Republican colleagues, the Congresswoman hasn\u2019t declared support for Trump.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to me whether she supports Trump\u2019s candidacy as many of her colleagues have, or will continue to distance herself from Trump as she has done so far,\u201d Long said. \u201cEither strategy for Herrera Beutler has its risks. She is going to find herself in a difficult position with her own conservative base.\u201d\n\nPennington said in an email that Herrera Beutler has concerns about Trump, but said there\u2019s plenty of time between now and November\u2019s election for Trump to clarify his stances.\n\n\u201cJaime wants Donald Trump to clear up questions on important issues like his past enthusiasm for the use of eminent domain to condemn private property and his support for socialized health care, and whether he stands by his comments about Mexicans as \u2018rapists\u2019 \u2014 something that didn\u2019t sit well with Jaime, who comes from Mexican heritage,\u201d Pennington wrote.\n\nTwo other challengers have filed their candidacy in Washington\u2019s 3rd Congressional District: Democrat David McDevitt and L.A. Worthington, who is not affiliated with a political party.\n\nRich Rogers, Chair of the Clark County Democratic Party, said the party will remain neutral through Washington\u2019s August primary. But he said Moeller\u2019s entry into the race gives Democrats a better chance.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably one of our strongest candidates we\u2019ve seen in the 3rd Congressional District, not to put anything down for our previous candidates,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIt gives the 3rd Congressional District some visibility and some viability.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"author": "Conrad  Wilson", "og": {"url": "http://www.opb.org/news/series/election-2016/wash-state-rep-jim-moeller-sets-his-sights-on-dc/", "image": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,g_north,h_300,q_90,w_400/AP_1603110530438337_kzek8p.jpg", "description": "Washington state Rep.
