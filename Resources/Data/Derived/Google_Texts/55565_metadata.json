But Tuesday\u2019s proposal would put the law in place for the long term, removing any sunset date.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe long-term extension is largely noncontroversial. The House bill sponsored by Judiciary Committee Chairman(R-Va.) had 188 co-sponsors, and 50 senators are backing a similar bill in the Senate.\n\nGoodlatte warned that failing to renew the ban would result in a \u201csubstantial\u201d tax increase on consumers.\n\n\u201cImagine if we, you, your constituents, everyone in the country that uses the Internet, has to pay for access to the Internet,\u201d said Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.).\n\nThe House easily passed the proposal last Congress, but it stalled in the Senate after some members attempted to tie the measure to a more controversial online sales tax bill, which would give states the power to collect a sales tax from businesses that don\u2019t have a physical presence in their boundaries.\n\nTying the two items together faced resistance in the House last year and would prove harder in the current Congress, now that Republicans control the Senate.\n\nThe hold-up last Congress forced both chambers to pass another short-term extension in an omnibus spending bill last December. It is slated to expire again on Oct. 1.\n\nFirst signed by then-President Clinton, the temporary ban was meant to give the Internet industry time to breathe as it emerged as a huge boon for the economy in the 1990s. Clinton said he did not want burdensome taxes to stifle the Internet\u2019s growth, but was at odds with state governors at the time.\n\nThe law also played a heightened role in the fight surrounding the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s net neutrality rules, which would reclassify broadband Internet under rules governing traditional telephones.\n\nProponents of the net neutrality rules slated to take effect Friday have pointed to the tax ban to push back on one major argument of critics.\n\nCritics argue that the reclassification could open Internet service up to billions of dollars in new state taxes and fees. They say even with the tax ban in place, states could impose a number of fees \u2014 rather than taxes \u2014 on Internet service providers that could later get passed on to the customer.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The bill would permanently extend the ban on taxes for Internet access.", "description": "The bill would permanently extend the ban on taxes for Internet access.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The bill would permanently extend the ban on taxes for Internet access.", "title": "House passes extension of Internet tax ban", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/244471-house-passes-extension-of-internet-tax-ban", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/internet_laptop_042414getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/244471-house-passes-extension-of-internet-tax-ban", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-09T17:41-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cristina Marcos", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Mario Trujillo and Cristina Marcos", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Internet Tax Freedom Act,Bob Goodlatte,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-09T17:41:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/244471-house-passes-extension-of-internet-tax-ban", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The bill would permanently extend the ban on taxes for Internet access.", "card": "summary", "title": "House passes extension of Internet tax ban"}, "dcterms.title": "House passes extension of Internet tax ban"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6f6\"", "article_summary": "The House on Tuesday passed a bill that would permanently extend a ban on state and local taxes on Internet access.\nThe House bill sponsored by Judiciary Committee Chairman(R-Va.) had 188 co-sponsors, and 50 senators are backing a similar bill in the Senate.\nCritics argue that the reclassification could open Internet service up to billions of dollars in new state taxes and fees.\nProponents of the net neutrality rules slated to take effect Friday have pointed to the tax ban to push back on one major argument of critics.\nThey say even with the tax ban in place, states could impose a number of fees \u2014 rather than taxes \u2014 on Internet service providers that could later get passed on to the customer."}
