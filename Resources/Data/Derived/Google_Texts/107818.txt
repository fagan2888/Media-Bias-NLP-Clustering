Praising his anti-abortion, anti-immigration, anti-Obama, anti-equality, and pro-war stance as upstanding principles to be held by a future United States president, Iowa Congressman Steve King formally threw his support behind Ted Cruz.

The Iowa Republican said that he had been praying for Cruz’s presidential run for almost a year, calling the Texas senator “the candidate who God will use to restore the soul of America.”

“I believe that Ted Cruz is the answer to my prayers,” King said in a campaign ad announcing his endorsement.

King, who proclaimed Sarah Palin correct in describing parts of Obamacare as “death panels,” said that Cruz had “unmatched intellect grounded in constitutionalism”:

We need a president who is pro-life, pro-marriage, a constitutional originalist, who will make judicial appointments of judges to the Supreme Court and all federal courts who believe the Constitution means what is says and means what it was understood to mean when ratified
