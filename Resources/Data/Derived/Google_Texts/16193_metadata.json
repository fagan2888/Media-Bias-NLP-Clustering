In its letter, the agency told 23andMe that it was concerned about the possibility of erroneous test results, about false positives and false negatives. The FDA warned that false positives \u2013 for example, being told that one has a high risk of breast cancer when really one doesn\u2019t \u2013 might lead customers to seek expensive testing or medical treatment that they don\u2019t really need. False negatives \u2013 which are just the opposite \u2013 might lead customers to ignore serious health problems or deviate from a prescribed treatment regime. The company had been out of contact with the FDA since May of 2013, and had not filed the required information to allay the bureau\u2019s concerns.\n\nWhen word about the letter got out, the ever-ready machine of Internet journalism whirred quickly to life. Defenders of the genetic research firm argued that the information, if used properly and with a physician\u2019s supervision, is not only a wondrous tool for protecting health and prolonging life, but a fascinating look into the mysteries of one\u2019s genetic code. Besides, they continued, the technology is here to stay; fighting it will be like lashing the sea to stop the tide. Critics, however, shared the FDA\u2019s worries that the company\u2019s products might drive a frenzy of self-diagnosis and hypochondria. In their view, putting unfiltered diagnostic information in an anxiety-prone person\u2019s hands could be dangerous \u2013 better to leave it to the trained judgment of a licensed doctor. Neurologists have reported, for example, that otherwise healthy twenty-somethings, upon getting back their 23andMe results, have marched into their clinics demanding MRIs to check for signs of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nBut how does 23andMe\u2019s process actually work? Upon receiving a saliva sample from a customer, 23andMe draws statistical inferences about that person\u2019s likelihood of having certain diseases based on what are called \u201csingle nucleotide polymorphisms\u201d or \u201cSNPs\u201d (pronounced \u201csnips\u201d). A SNP is a genetic mutation at a single, specific location along a person\u2019s DNA strand. Rather than the base pair that the vast majority of the population has for a given location, an individual with a SNP has a different base pair, which can lead to anomalies in the production of amino acids (i.e., proteins in the body). When 23andMe finds certain SNPs in someone\u2019s DNA, it then cross-references its vast databases of medical literature, which contain findings from thousands of studies showing correlations between certain SNPs and certain diseases. To guard against misinforming its customers, 23andMe maintains precise standards about which studies make it into its databases. The political fight about the company, thus, is drawing the troops into a swamp \u2013 into the muddy marsh of arguing over whether consumers are intelligent enough to process this sort of sophisticated statistical and epidemiological information on their own. The question quickly becomes not about 23andMe\u2019s little kits, but about government paternalism more generally.\n\nLegally speaking, however, the entire argument is moot. There is no need to wade into the muck of one\u2019s feelings about big-government paternalism or the perils of new technologies \u2013 at least not right now. And that is for a simple reason: The FDA is right. According to the law, 23andMe\u2019s kit is a \u201cmedical device,\u201d which federal law defines as any product useful in diagnosis or treatment, which means that the kit is subject to the FDA\u2019s regulations about the marketing of medical products. Those regulations require 23andMe to provide the FDA with information about its statistical methods, to conduct studies of its products\u2019 effects, and to address the agency\u2019s concerns about the risks of erroneous test results. It hasn\u2019t done so. In the real world, thus, 23andMe will have to comply the FDA\u2019s guidelines, and it will have to find some way of reassuring the government that its brightly-colored little kit is not actually Pandora\u2019s box. From a legal perspective, that is the end of the discussion.\n\nWhich is not, of course, to say that it should end the discussion. There is another aspect of 23andMe\u2019s business, one which has received less attention from the media (with the exception of an excellent writeup in Scientific American by Charles Seife), but which is, in actuality, both equally troubling and equally fascinating. The company also houses a sizable research wing. 23andMe intends to aggregate the genetic information it receives and correlate that information with self-supplied data from customers about their biological traits \u2013 for instance, whether they clasp their hands with left thumb over right or vice versa; whether black coffee tastes bitter to them; or, more seriously, whether they have Parkinson\u2019s disease. According to its website, the company hopes to use this information to find new ways to predict the incidence of disease in the population.\n\nIf the project is successful, 23andMe\u2019s roof would shelter a veritable warehouse of genetic information, mapping correlations between phenotypes, SNPs and diseases across a huge swath of the population (albeit not a particularly diverse swath, given the company\u2019s likely market demographics). To date, 23andMe says that it has received saliva samples from approximately 500,000 people \u2013 a figure many times the size of those employed in most large-scale genetic studies \u2013 and the company has only existed since 2006. Once it clears its name with the FDA, the amount of genetic information available to the firm\u2019s research arm will only grow. \u201cThe long game here is not to make money selling kits, although the kits are essential to get the base-level data,\u201d said Patrick Chung, a 23andMe board member. And the company\u2019s privacy policy, it\u2019s worth noting, makes no promises that it will not share aggregate-level genetic data with its vendors and affiliates, such as the company that manufactures the chips used in processing saliva samples.\n\nIn a dashed-off writeup, Ezra Klein blithely opined that the company\u2019s research wing is simply \u201can experiment in big-data genetics.\u201d Citing Harvard political science professor Daniel Carpenter, who recently published a lengthy history of the FDA, Klein argued that new technologies like 23andMe\u2019s might provide a salubrious occasion to reevaluate how the law deals with cutting-edge bioinformatics. (How exactly the rules should change, though, Klein shrewdly declined to say.) There might be something to the point, but saying that we might possibly want to eventually give some consideration to maybe letting the political process (in consultation with appropriate experts, of course) arrive at some new rules about how such products might or might not be regulated is, ultimately, not to say much at all. It is almost as if Klein sees that there is a steep cliff off which he might take a sharp plunge into a sea of difficult and frightening questions, and decides instead simply to gesture offhandedly in its general direction.\n\nBut the only way forward is downward. Whatever happens to 23andMe, the idea of aggregating and cross-referencing huge amounts of genetic information is now a cultural reality. A private corporation, backed by some of the largest tech companies in the world (including Google), is planning to do genetic research through statistical modeling on an unprecedented scale. The implications of such a venture are profound, but the national conversation about the company has focused almost exclusively on what consumers will do with the information. This is not to say that it is not perfectly reasonable to have such a conversation. In fact, it is even reasonable to slosh around in the muddy waters of the swamp \u2013 the battle over paternalism and the authority of the medical establishment. But if we dare not ask, for example, whether an advanced, large-scale statistical model of human genetics might not be used to make predictions about, say, criminal behavior, or academic success, or lifetime income, who will? Let us dare to dive into the sea.\n\nTo be clear, at present, 23andMe\u2019s databases are used for properly epidemiological purposes. And the company seems to be quite serious about protecting the privacy of customer data and fostering trust. Identifying information, for example, is encrypted and stored separately from genetic material. I am not, that is, accusing them of wrongdoing \u2013 of conspiring to create a genetic dystopia like the ones envisioned in films like \u201cGattaca\u201d and \u201cMinority Report.\u201d Rather, I am suggesting that the idea of a massive genetic database holds all the ominous potential, if not used with extreme circumspection, to lead exactly there.", "article_metadata": {"description": "23andMe's FDA problems are just the beginning -- the company's DNA tests open up a wealth of privacy concerns", "title": "A genetic \u201cMinority Report\u201d: How corporate DNA testing could put us at risk", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "23andMe's FDA problems are just the beginning -- the company's DNA tests open up a wealth of privacy concerns", "title": "A genetic \u201cMinority Report\u201d: How corporate DNA testing could put us at risk", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/26/a_genetic_minority_report_how_corporate_dna_testing_could_put_us_at_risk/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/computer_dna.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "23andMe's FDA problems are just the beginning -- the company's DNA tests open up a wealth of privacy concerns", "title": "A genetic \u201cMinority Report\u201d: How corporate DNA testing could put us at risk", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/computer_dna.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Benjamin Winterhalter", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 23andMe, DNA, Genetics, Privacy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca30e\"", "article_summary": "Whatever happens to 23andMe, the idea of aggregating and cross-referencing huge amounts of genetic information is now a cultural reality.\nOnce it clears its name with the FDA, the amount of genetic information available to the firm\u2019s research arm will only grow.\nTopics: 23andMe, DNA, Genetics, Privacy, Technology News, Life News, NewsOn Nov. 22, 2013, the FDA sent a now-infamous letter to the genetic research startup 23andMe, ordering the company to stop marketing some of its personal DNA testing kits.\nA private corporation, backed by some of the largest tech companies in the world (including Google), is planning to do genetic research through statistical modeling on an unprecedented scale.\nA SNP is a genetic mutation at a single, specific location along a person\u2019s DNA strand."}
