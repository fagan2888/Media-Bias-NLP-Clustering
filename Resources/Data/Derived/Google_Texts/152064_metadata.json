Right-wing pundit Wayne Allyn Root theorized along similar lines when the situation in Ferguson first erupted this summer. Gun-rights extremist Larry Pratt has argued for some time that Obama\u2019s immigration policies are intended to provoke a race war. Some anti-immigration extremists accused Obama of intending to spark such a conflict with his executive order on immigration.\n\n[youtube]http://youtu.be/pPN86PVCUkQ[/youtube]\n\nBut leading the parade has been Alex Jones, whose radio broadcasts for the past week have focused on the civic unrest erupting nationally after a grand jury ruled not to indict a white police officer for the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson this summer.\n\nJones\u2019 theory is that President Obama and the media are combining forces to stir up so much racial unrest that it will give them a pretext to declare martial law and impose a dictatorship. Joining Jones in this theory have been right-wing pundits such as Austin Miles at Renew America; radio host Rick Wiles; onetime presidential candidate Alan Keyes; and Glenn Beck, who has been pitching a version of the theory for over a year now.\n\nJones laid out his version of the theory for listeners on Monday, noting that he had been issuing warnings about this possibility for some time:\n\n\n\nThey [globalists] want to cause a civil war in order to go confiscate the guns, and then we are forced to defend ourselves and then it kicks off, and the police and military get taken out, along with the Patriots, in a civil war against each other. \u2026 This is the grand game. This is divide and conquer. This is what I have warned you about thousands of times, no exaggeration.\n\nJones, citing a Time magazine op-ed piece justifying riots as an expression of civic anger, explained that the media has been complicit in this conspiracy, using race to attack Obama\u2019s critics while whipping up anger in the black community:\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s going on: Media nationwide is pushing race war. That\u2019s all they\u2019ve got. Don\u2019t like Obamacare, you\u2019re a racist. Don\u2019t want to turn your guns in, you\u2019re a racist. Michael Moore \u2013 \u2018if you own guns and you\u2019re white, it\u2019s because you\u2019re scared of black people.\u2019 That\u2019s a quote from CNN. This is all they\u2019ve got, while these big foreign banks that own the country loot the treasury with bailout money, Obamacare scamming everybody, Obama opening the borders up, giving free welfare to tens of millions of people, all these unconstitutional scams happening. And all they\u2019ve got is getting us to fight with each other.\n\nJones has frequently attacked law enforcement around the nation for their supposed attacks on American civil liberties, typically in cases involving gun owners and right-wing extremists. At the same time, most of his reporting about Ferguson has focused on the supposed violent depravity of the demonstrators and the need for police intervention.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the most popular stories at Jones\u2019 InfoWars website so far have featured such headlines as \u201cBlacks Screamed \u2018Kill the White People\u2019 Before Brutal Murder of Zemir Bergic\u201d and \u201cRap Star \u2018Jokes\u2019 About \u2018Killing Crackers\u2019 in Their Sleep.\u201d The effect of this barrage of dubious information is to whip up fear of an imminent civil war featuring hordes of rampaging black people.\n\nAnd there are others with variations of the idea.\n\nMiles\u2019 theory includes the idea \u2013 also promoted by would-be presidential candidate Ben Carson \u2013 that Obama intends to cancel the 2016 election: \u201cIf all works according to plan, there will be no further presidential elections. Obama will declare a crisis (he can pick from a large number of those) so he can use Executive Privilege to declare himself President for Life, which he fully intends to do.\u201d Miles contends that Obama is the product of a long-running Communist conspiracy (indicated by his \u201clack\u201d of a birth certificate) to control America. \u201cThe Communists are scheming for the Ferguson, Missouri incident to be the fuse that explodes into a national race riot,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton are hoping to accomplish since this would put citizens at war with themselves in a new civil war while at the same time sapping the strength out of America, making her easier to control.\u201d\n\nWiles used one of Alex Jones\u2019 pet concepts\u2014the \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation in which a violent incident is actually a government-fabricated media event\u2014to explain the situation in Ferguson: \u201cI was thinking how easily something like this could get out of control and there\u2019s gunfire in the cities, if they go into the suburban neighborhoods and begin burning buildings and upsetting cars, homeowners are going to come out with their firearms and begin defending their property,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that sets the stage for Emperor Obama to say, \u2018We have to get guns off the streets and this Congress has refused to implement my gun control legislation, therefore by executive order I am doing this, this and this.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2014/12/04/conspiracy-theories-fan-fears-race-war-alex-jones-leading-parade", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/10426930_10152512727559700_2647771730634151427_n.png", "site_name": "Southern Poverty Law Center", "title": "Conspiracy Theories Fan Fears of Race War, With Alex Jones Leading the Parade"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2014/12/04/conspiracy-theories-fan-fears-race-war-alex-jones-leading-parade", "title": "Conspiracy Theories Fan Fears of Race War, With Alex Jones Leading the Parade", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": {"identifier": "@splcenter", "id": 65698096}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Gun-rights extremist Larry Pratt has argued for some time that Obama\u2019s immigration policies are intended to provoke a race war.\nIn truth, the notion that Obama is inciting a race war in America has been floating around the extremist right almost since the beginning Obama\u2019s presidency.\nMichael Moore \u2013 \u2018if you own guns and you\u2019re white, it\u2019s because you\u2019re scared of black people.\u2019 That\u2019s a quote from CNN.\n\u201cThe Communists are scheming for the Ferguson, Missouri incident to be the fuse that explodes into a national race riot,\u201d he said.\nSome anti-immigration extremists accused Obama of intending to spark such a conflict with his executive order on immigration."}
