Marco Rubio spoke before a crowded yet intimate group of voters Saturday night at the Palafox Warf in Pensacola.

Rubio is attempting to win over voters at the last minute before Florida heads to the polls for Tuesday's primary. We spoke directly with the GOP candidate before the rally about the violent protests at Donald Trump's cancelled Chicago rally Friday night, and he told News Channel 7 why he can unite a divided America.

"The images that came out of Chicago last night makes America look like a Third World country," said Sen. Rubio. "It is sad and it has to stop. I will be everyone's president, even people that don't agree with me. I'm a strong conservative, I'm sticking to my principles. But I will be everyone's president. I will work every day on behalf of all Americans, even the ones who don't agree with me."

The candidate spoke directly to voters in the crowd about issues in Florida like Common Core, immigration, and problems with the VA. Will have more from our interview with Marco Rubio Sunday on News Channel 7.
