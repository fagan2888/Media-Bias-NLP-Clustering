Colorado is moving ahead on projects to restore stream banks and other watershed areas hit by floods.

Gov. John Hickenlooper on Friday announced the distribution of $2.29 million in grants, approved July 16 by state water officials, for 19 new stream projects in Boulder, Larimer, Weld and Jefferson counties.

“Quickly and strategically rehabilitating streams damaged by the flood is critical for many reasons — most notably so that we are prepared to endure any future surprises Mother Nature might throw our way,” a statement from Hickenlooper’s office said.

The projects are designed to reduce future flood risk and shore up stream banks, wildlife habitat, agricultural areas and recreational opportunities.

Severe flooding due to heavy rain last fall affected 24 counties. Flooding triggered failures of nine dams and damaged or destroyed nearly 225 water diversion structures. An estimated 32,000 acres of croplands were damaged, and state officials say they lost $540,000 in state-owned stream-gauge equipment.

The grants, created under recent legislation, reimburse up to half of eligible expenses in cleaning up debris and restoring watersheds.

The legislation authorizes payments to private entities and people whose property was affected as well as local governments, watershed coalitions and other nonprofit groups engaged in restoration work.
