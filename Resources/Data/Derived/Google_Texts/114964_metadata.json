He lobbied previously in Washington, D.C., in an attempt to cover alternative care providers under the federal Affordable Care Act, he said.\n\nMajken Tranby, owner of Moodra yoga studio in South Hero, does a hand stand at the open posture session held at the conclusion of a class taught at Yoga Vermont in Burlington on Wednesday.

The yoga group does not expect unlimited free classes for everyone.\n\n\"We'll have to make the same kind of cost arguments that everyone else does,\" Sterrett said. \"I'm fully aware that people are reticent about increasing costs, and so am I.\"\n\nSpecial-interest groups regularly push for health insurance coverage, said Rep. Christopher Pearson, P-Burlington, vice chairman of the House Health Care Committee.\n\n\"We would certainly need to see some clear data to suggest that this would be cost-effective,\" Pearson said when asked about the yoga group's goals. There's nothing to prevent private insurance plans from recognizing yoga currently, he added, but a state mandate would be a challenge.\n\nSterrett is optimistic about his chances in the statehouse and working with private insurers. He guesses that some legislators likely practice yoga themselves.\n\n\"I've definitely talked preliminarily to folks, and there's a strong interest,\" Sterrett said. \"One of the reasons why Vermont's a good place for this is that yoga's pretty popular.\"\n\nJust how popular? No one seems to know exactly, as Vermont lacks registration for yoga teachers. As one possible measure of popularity, Burlington International Airport opened one of the first airport yoga rooms in the country in January 2013.\n\nIn 2012, the magazine Yoga Journal reported that about 8.7 percent of adults nationwide practiced yoga. Sterrett estimates that the rate is at least as high in Vermont.\n\n\"It remains a pretty middle-class and upper-middle-class practice,\" Sterrett said, \"and the benefits are so undeniable. My goal is to try to make it available to anyone.\"\n\nMajken Tranby, a South Hero yoga studio owner who began the yoga advocacy group with McNames and Sterrett, calls yoga preventative medicine.\n\nIf yoga were recognized by health insurance, Tranby predicted, \"there would be less doctor visits. I think people would make better food choices.\"\n\nAnd yoga teachers would, naturally, reap financial benefits. But insurance recognition could also require yoga teachers to register as part of a professional group, McNames said \u2014 hand-in-hand with greater regulation.\n\n\"I'm sure that there is going to be regulation coming,\" McNames said, \"and I feel that this is a really positive way for us to take action on what the regulation looks like and how it benefits us.\"\n\nKathy McNames adjusts the position of fellow instructor Majken Tranby during a session held at Yoga Vermont studio in Burlington on Wednesday.

But other discussions continue about how health insurance plans should cover particular services.\n\nFor example, Sen. Kevin Mullin, a Republican who represents Rutland County, has introduced a bill that would boost health insurance coverage for chiropractic services.\n\nAccording to the bill, health insurance plans would be required to reimburse licensed chiropractors the same amount that physicians receive for the same \"clinically necessary health care services.\"\n\nPearson, the vice chair of the House Health Care Committee, said he's sympathetic to the legislation and expects a mirror bill to come through the House.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://bfpne.ws/1D1fcRp", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "New Vermont yoga advocacy group says the practice has preventative and healing properties.", "og": {"site_name": "Burlington Free Press", "description": "New Vermont yoga advocacy group says the practice has preventative and healing properties.", "title": "Yoga teachers want health insurance reimbursement", "url": "http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2015/02/05/yoga-teachers-want-health-insurance-reimbursement/22898619/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/burlingtonfreepress.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Vermont yoga advocacy group says the practice has preventative and healing properties.", "title": "Yoga teachers want health insurance reimbursement", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5c8c8b5f1b49c7f1ccdecb76b494fe7ab975287b/c=442-0-2382-1940&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Burlington/2015/02/04/B9316044340Z.1_20150204210627_000_GAT9S9344.2-0.jpg", "creator": "@bfp_news", "site": "@bfp_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=835986144", "fb": {"app_id": 151224581596873}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/aburbanknews"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Vermont Yoga,health insurance,Kathy McNames,Student and Teachers Yoga Association"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd30e9\"", "article_summary": "Special-interest groups regularly push for health insurance coverage, said Rep.
