Medicaid patients, in particular, face a shortage of primary-care doctors and specialists willing to accept the program\u2019s reimbursement.\n\nThe days before Sunday\u2019s deadline were busy. \u201cIt was a blowout weekend for us,\u201d Kevin Counihan, CEO of the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov, said in a conference call Wednesday. More people logged in, called, created accounts and selected plans on Saturday and Sunday than on any previous day this year or last.\n\nThe rate of sign-ups from New Jersey \u2014 30,000 in the 11 days leading into Feb. 15 \u2014 was more than three times the rate of the previous weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s testament to the desire and need for this here in New Jersey,\u201d Cornell-Bechelli said.\n\nThat number may increase, as extensions were granted to those who were unable to complete their enrollment because of a technical glitch or long wait at the federal call center.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell also is considering whether to give another chance at enrollment to people who discover they face penalties at tax time. Rep. Frank Pallone, D-Monmouth, who joined Cornell-Bechelli on the conference call, said he would work with his Democratic colleagues in Congress to push to give people that opportunity to sign up for coverage.\n\nIn all, a total of 11.4 million people signed up nationwide, President Obama announced via Facebook on Tuesday. That exceeded the government\u2019s prediction of 9 million. \u201cIt represents a 10 percent increase over where we were expecting to be,\u201d said Counihan.\n\nThe federal figures released Wednesday do not show how many of the 252,792 New Jersey consumers who chose marketplace plans were previously uninsured. Some were among the approximately 100,000 people last year who had to find new coverage after their previous plans were discontinued because they did not comply with the new law.\n\nMore than four out of five enrollees in the federal marketplace in New Jersey qualified for tax credits that averaged $309 monthly, the federal government said. With those credits, three out of five were able to purchase coverage for less than $100 a month.\n\nThe subsidies, combined with tax penalties for going without insurance, drove New Jersey\u2019s high enrollment, said Linda Schwimmer, vice president of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute, a non-partisan policy group. \u201cThe reason people were uninsured is that they couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d she said.\n\nBut looming over the year\u2019s success is a challenge to the subsidies pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOpponents of the law argue it only gives states that run their own insurance marketplaces, such as California and New York, the right to provide tax credits to their customers. The court may rule that HealthCare.gov customers in New Jersey and the 36 other states that rely on the federal marketplace are not eligible for subsidies \u2014 a decision that would wreak havoc on the insurance market.\n\n\u201cWhat happens if the Supreme Court says we don\u2019t get the subsidies because we\u2019re not a state-run marketplace?\u201d asked Schwimmer. \u201cThat would be a disaster.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s decision not to establish a state-run marketplace also resulted in less federal funding for marketing and outreach to the uninsured. But a well-coordinated volunteer effort, augmented by the work of Enroll America, a non-profit working in New Jersey and 10 other states, appeared to overcome that disadvantage.\n\nSign-ups for coverage in 2015 jumped by 56 percent in the state compared with last year. \u201cWe did not in New Jersey let any obstacle stand in our way,\u201d state Sen. Nia Gill, D-Essex, said in a press call with Cornell-Bechelli.\n\nRay Castro, an analyst with New Jersey Policy Perspective, termed this year\u2019s result \u201cpretty amazing. \u2026 That\u2019s a very short period of time to make that big of a change\u201d in the number of uninsured. In future years, it will be a \u201cbigger challenge with fewer resources,\u201d he added, as funding for outreach is reduced. But rising tax penalties \u2014 from $95 or 1 percent of taxable income to $325 or 2 percent of taxable income next year \u2014 could motivate some of those who have resisted enrolling so far, he said.\n\nThe date has not been set for the start of open enrollment for 2016 coverage.\n\nEmail: washburn@northjersey.com", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "New Jersey\u2019s uninsured population has been cut in half as the Affordable Care Act enters its second year, with the federal government announcing Wednesday that more than 250,000 people had signed up for coverage in Obamacare health plans by midnight Sunday.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "author": "LINDY WASHBURN", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/more-than-250-000-new-jerseyans-sign-up-for-health-care-plans-1.1273462", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com/designimages/NorthJerseyFacebook_377x196.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "New Jersey\u2019s uninsured population has been cut in half as the Affordable Care Act enters its second year, with the federal government announcing Wednesday that more than 250,000 people had signed up for coverage in Obamacare health plans by midnight Sunday."}, "title": "N.J. cuts number of uninsured by half", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "DC.creator": "LINDY WASHBURN", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "N.J. cuts number of uninsured by half"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt was a blowout weekend for us,\u201d Kevin Counihan, CEO of the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov, said in a conference call Wednesday.\n\u2026 That\u2019s a very short period of time to make that big of a change\u201d in the number of uninsured.\nThe federal figures released Wednesday do not show how many of the 252,792 New Jersey consumers who chose marketplace plans were previously uninsured.\nMore than four out of five enrollees in the federal marketplace in New Jersey qualified for tax credits that averaged $309 monthly, the federal government said.\nAn estimated 900,000 New Jersey residents were uninsured and eligible for coverage before the first open enrollment under the law known as Obamacare began in October 2013."}
