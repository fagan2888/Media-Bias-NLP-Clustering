Sioux Falls, SD

As estimated 184 million Americans tuned in to watch the Super Bowl this evening. Some went to a Sports Bar to take in the sights and sounds of the big game. KELOLAND News was the first to tell you about how Overtime Bar and Grill is using the game to raise money for a family with a special connection to its owner.

Today is a big day for Overtime. It's not just a busy day at the sports bar, but there's exciting news for Owner Jeff Doughtery. His neighbor, 7th grader Nate Wick, is back home after spending time in the hospital after suddenly collapsing during basketball tryouts.

"Strange not to have a diagnosis as to why it really happened but obviously he's back and getting better," Doughtery said.

The bar is trying to make life easier for Nate and his family. Doughtery says the restaurant brought in extra staff to deal with the super rush. Ten percent of all sales will be given to Nate's family. People have been bringing in cash all week and dropping it off at this donation box at the front of the store.

"Sioux Falls obviously a very giving community and it's not more than I expected but it's what I expected, people would show up and support something like this and they've done so," Doughtery said.

According to the National Retail Federation, almost 26 percent of Americans that watch the big game watch it at a house party, but that's not stopping some from coming to Overtime to help out the Wick family.

"I think it's a great idea. I mean, there are going to be so many sales from the Super Bowl and people are going to be so willing so buy extra for this family, because that's just a tragedy," Kayla Hanson.

For Brian Mack and his family, he was planning on watching the game at home. When he heard the news of what Overtime was doing, he knew where he was going to eat before kickoff.

"We like to come to Overtime anyways and so we just like, snowy days, cooped up in the house, let's get out of the house and go over and have some lunch before the game," Mack said.

As the fans come together to cheer on their teams, the community comes together to help a family in need.
