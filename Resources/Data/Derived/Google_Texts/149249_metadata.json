But in the meantime, Republican officials have staked out clear ground, which may prove to be politically tricky this election year.\n\nYesterday, for example, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) issued a statement urging the justices to rule against the contraception policy in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThis case concerns every American who cherishes that first line in the Bill of Rights where it states our government will never come between us and our faith. Religious freedom is not for some people under some circumstances; it is for one and all. In that spirit, I join with those who are standing up for what\u2019s right and what\u2019s sacred. I hope that, after due consideration, the Court will reverse this attack on religious liberty and reaffirm our founding principles.\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t come as too big a surprise; Boehner said something similar in November when the high court agreed to hear the case. He hasn\u2019t said he\u2019s against contraception, per se, but the Ohio Republican believes that if an employer limits contraception access, that\u2019s fine, because it falls under the guise of \u201creligious freedom.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Speaker\u2019s position is hardly unusual in his party. All kinds of Republican policymakers, including national aspirants like Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, have said it\u2019s imperative under \u201creligious liberty\u201d that corporations be free to restrict employees\u2019 access to birth control if the corporations\u2019 owners say so.\n\nIt\u2019s not at all clear the GOP has thought this through. Or put another way, do Republicans believe it\u2019s a winning election-year message to tell millions of American women their access to contraception should be based in part on their bosses\u2019 religious beliefs?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the line the party is taking right now. They wouldn\u2019t put in those terms, exactly, but as a practical matter, that\u2019s the real-world consequence of the Republican position.\n\nThis came up quite a bit in 2012, when congressional Republicans championed a measure from Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) that would have empowered private-sector employers to deny health services that business owners find morally objectionable.\n\nIn one of the presidential candidate debates, President Obama hammered Mitt Romney over his support for the Blunt Amendment. The GOP candidate, the president said, argued \u201cemployers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage. That\u2019s not the kind of advocacy that women need.\u201d\n\nRomney balked, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.\u201d\n\nThe trouble seemed to be that Romney heard Obama\u2019s description of Romney\u2019s own position and was repulsed. But in reality , both Romney and his running mate endorsed a policy that would leave contraception decisions for millions of workers in the hands of employers. Romney\u2019s denial was a lie.\n\nTwo years later, the Republican position hasn\u2019t changed. More than two-thirds of U.S. women oppose allowing corporations to drop contraception from their health plans due to spiritual objections, but GOP leaders are nevertheless saying the exact opposite.\n\nMost of the recent discussion about the case has focused, for good reason, on the legal merits and what the justices are likely to do, but the election-year politics of this may very well be awful for Republicans. Democrats are worried about their base staying home this fall, but if conservatives on the Supreme Court, cheered on by conservatives in Congress, announce birth control decisions will start being based by employers\u2019 religious beliefs, it\u2019s likely to get some progressive voters off the couch on Election Day.\n\nIndeed, a Democratic leadership aide told Greg Sargent in November, \u201cThis could be very helpful with younger and middle aged women \u2013 particularly many who may have been disenchanted with the rollout and who are having an impact on polling numbers. The idea that a boss calls the shots on a woman\u2019s ability to get free birth control is really powerful. This is the kind of issue that could help change the ACA debate by reminding women in particular that at its core it\u2019s all about access and affordability.\u201d\n\nBoehner & Co. seem to think they have a political winner if they just stick to the \u201creligious liberty\u201d line. But if millions of women have to start hoping that their bosses allow them to have access to contraception, this will be a political landmine for Republicans for the rest of the year \u2013 and beyond.\n\nADDING: Related video:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "This election year, the Republican line is that bosses can block workers' contraception access if their religion says so.
