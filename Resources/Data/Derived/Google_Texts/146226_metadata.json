Fewer than 50 showed up.\n\nIn the wake of this summer\u2019s horrific murders of nine black churchgoers \u2014 committed by a man who admired the Confederate flag \u2014 universities and state governments have faced heated calls to remove the flag from their public spaces. In response, many have taken down the symbols, prompting fierce backlash including pro-flag rallies in Alabama, Georgia, and now Washington, D.C.\n\nIn interviews with ThinkProgress, members of the small crowd said they wanted the U.S. government to hear their messages: preserve Confederate symbols, and squash the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\u201cThis Black Lives Matter bull is racism that the government don\u2019t see. It\u2019s white genocide propaganda. They\u2019re pushing folks to shoot cops and white people,\u201d said Ron Feathers from Elliston, Virginia. Behind him, the crowd waved flags, let out \u201crebel yells,\u201d and showed off their Confederate tattoos and belt buckles.\n\nThis Black Lives Matter bull is racism that the government don\u2019t see.\n\nLooking across the park at a cluster of anti-Confederate protesters \u2014 who far outnumbered his own group \u2014 Feathers added: \u201cIf Robert E. Lee was alive today, this shit wouldn\u2019t be going on. That\u2019s when we had a true American in office.\u201d\n\nFeathers, a self-identified Democrat who believes President Obama is planning to declare martial law and \u201crule the whole world,\u201d said he\u2019s been organizing \u201cflag rollings\u201d across Virginia \u2014 where people drive together with Confederate symbols on their cars \u2014 to push back against those he feels are \u201ctaking [his] history away.\u201d\n\nUnprompted, Feathers offered his thoughts about why \u201ccolored people in general\u201d have a \u201cghetto lifestyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because their daddies ain\u2019t in the picture. All these kids are latchkey kids. They\u2019re not being taught the right way. And they only do things in groups. They\u2019ve got so much hatred.\u201d\n\nWhen DC artist and activist Sima Lee \u2014 who is black and indigenous \u2014 approached Feathers and yelled at him to get the Confederate flag out of her city, he repeatedly called her \u201cbabe\u201d and told her, \u201cGo back to that side where you belong.\u201d\n\nRon Feathers gets into a shouting match with a Black Lives Matter demonstrator.

That is the Confederacy. We are it.\n\n\u201cI am restraining myself because I am a southern belle,\u201d said Ginny Meerman, a beauty pageant consultant and former \u201cMrs. Maryland\u201d winner who sported a Confederate flag tattoo across her upper back. \u201cBut bless their little hearts if I got them in a quiet alley somewhere.\u201d\n\nWhen a group of several dozen local D.C. activists across the park began chanting \u201cblack lives matter,\u201d she assured the group: \u201cWe are above them. We are so far above them they will never, ever be on the same plane that we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are the Confederacy,\u201d Meerman called out. \u201cLook at the person standing to your left and right. That is the Confederacy. We are it.\u201d\n\nAnti-Confederate protesters block the street in front of the U.S. Capitol.

I wonder what the person holding it thinks of me,\u201d said Winter Brooks, an African-American student at American University. \u201cIt\u2019s a symbol of hate, of pro-slavery, anti-blackness, anti-minorities. It\u2019s frightening.\u201d\n\nThough a line of Capitol Police and several hundred feet separated the two protests, at least one protester on the pro-Confederate side expressed fear that something dangerous might happen if the two crowds collided. Jason Berry, a Civil War reenactor from Detroit, said he had wanted to bring his mixed-race 12-year-old child to the event, but decided against it.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the most racist group there is,\u201d he said, referring to Black Lives Matter.\n\nConfederate flag supporter Jason Berry shows off his tattoo.

When asked if there were any presidential candidates who he thought would protect his beliefs, Berry was enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cTrump 2016!\u201d he said. \u201cShut down the borders.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "One protester offered his thoughts about why \u201ccolored people in general\u201d have a \u201cghetto lifestyle.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "One protester offered his thoughts about why \u201ccolored people in general\u201d have a \u201cghetto lifestyle.\u201d", "title": "Here\u2019s What It\u2019s Like Inside A Pro-Confederate Flag Rally", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/09/05/3699034/confederate-flag-rally-capitol-hill/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/05140548/Andrew.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One protester offered his thoughts about why \u201ccolored people in general\u201d have a \u201cghetto lifestyle.\u201d", "creator": "@AliceOllstein", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/05140548/Andrew-321x214.jpg", "title": "Here\u2019s What It\u2019s Like Inside A Pro-Confederate Flag Rally", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/05140548/Andrew.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/05140548/Andrew.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-05T15:21:09+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/emorweee"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "CREDIT: Emily AtkinBerry said he hoped the movement to protect the Confederate flag would continue, particularly among elected officials.\n\u201cThis Black Lives Matter bull is racism that the government don\u2019t see.\nThis Black Lives Matter bull is racism that the government don\u2019t see.\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 More than 1,300 people were expected to attend a \u201cSouthern Heritage\u201d rally in support of the Confederate flag on Saturday in front of the U.S. Capitol.\nConfederate flag supporter Jason Berry shows off his tattoo."}
