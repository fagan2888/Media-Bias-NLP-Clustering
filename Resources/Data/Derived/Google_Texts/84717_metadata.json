I don\u2019t quite get up from this table the same way. I may want to but I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nYet the actor says the similarities end there. Simon may be ready to give up acting but Pacino is not.\n\n\u201cActing, especially if you\u2019ve done it as long as I have,\u201d he said, \u201cit becomes such a part of your nature you rarely ever think about quitting or anything like that.\u201d\n\nThe star of such iconic films as \u201cThe Godfather\u201d trilogy and \u201cScent of a Woman,\u201d which won him his 1992 best actor Oscar, says he\u2019s convinced there\u2019s another big role ahead of him, but adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be in movies. \u2026 Acting, it can take on different forms.\u201d\n\nPacino was scheduled to perform with the Philadelphia Orchestra this weekend, doing Shakespeare and personal readings. \u201cThat\u2019s a variation on a thing that takes acting and it\u2019s a little different,\u201d he explained.\n\nPacino will return to Broadway this fall to appear in David Mamet\u2019s latest work \u201cChina Doll,\u201d even if he won\u2019t do the standard eight performances a week. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do eight performances if you paid me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too much. I gave that up a long time ago.\u201d\n\nTelevision remains in Pacino\u2019s acting future, as well.\n\nThe two-time Emmy winner (\u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Jack,\u201d \u201dAngels in America\u201d) says he\u2019s looking into an episodic series that could stream on a service like Netflix or Amazon about Napoleon\u2019s final days on the Island of Saint Helena.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Al Pacino looks to diversify, not retire from acting", "author": "Lauri Neff", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Al Pacino looks to diversify, not retire from acting", "title": "Al Pacino looks to diversify, not retire from acting", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/24/al_pacino_looks_to_diversify_not_retire_from_acting/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/people-al-pacino.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Al Pacino looks to diversify, not retire from acting", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/people-al-pacino.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Al Pacino looks to diversify, not retire from acting", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Al Pacino looks to diversify, not retire from acting", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01bd\"", "article_summary": "Simon may be ready to give up acting but Pacino is not.\nI gave that up a long time ago.\u201dTelevision remains in Pacino\u2019s acting future, as well.\n\u2026 Acting, it can take on different forms.\u201dPacino was scheduled to perform with the Philadelphia Orchestra this weekend, doing Shakespeare and personal readings.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a variation on a thing that takes acting and it\u2019s a little different,\u201d he explained.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Al Pacino says he can relate to Simon Axler, the lead character in his film \u2018The Humbling\u2019 \u2014 about an aging actor who worries he\u2019s lost his craft and his appetite for acting."}
