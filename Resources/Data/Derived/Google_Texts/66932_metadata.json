But the Yarmouk Camp is in Syria, where images of atrocities go viral only when misrepresented as coming from Gaza, so the world has paid little attention to their suffering.\n\n\u201cMy Twitter and Facebook feeds would have me believe that the only noteworthy military conflict in the world today is that between Israel and Hamas,\u201d wrote Jonathan Messing, a research fellow at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, at JonathanMessing.com. \u201cEither many of you care about war only when it involves a Jew holding a gun, or you are woefully unaware of what else is going on in the world.\u201d\n\nAt the time Mr. Messing wrote, about 170,000 had died in ongoing violence in Syria; 600 in Gaza.\n\n\u201cIt must be so awkward having to check whether the dead child is from Gaza or Syria before deciding whether to be morally outraged,\u201d tweeted Marc Lynch, director of the Institute for Middle East Studies at George Washington University.\n\nThe sequence of events triggered by the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers reminded Clarice Feldman that \u201cProvidence isn\u2019t just a city in Rhode Island.\u201d She wrote at AmericanThinker.com that \u201chad thugs not brutally murdered three young men in Israel, the Israelis would not have stepped up efforts to find those responsible. Had the Israelis not done so, Hamas would not have begun the rocket barrage. Had the rocket barrage not occurred \u2026 the Israelis would not have entered Gaza \u2026 would not have found the tunnel system \u2026 nor learned of the long-planned Hamas effort to send thousands of their troops deep into lightly guarded Israeli communities on the holiest of days, Rosh Hashanah, to murder thousands.\u201d\n\nThe elaborate tunnel system was dug in part by child labor, according to a 2012 paper in the Journal of Palestine Studies. Each of the 31 tunnels discovered so far cost about $1 million to build. \u201cAt least 160 children have been killed in the tunnels,\u201d the author of the journal article says he was told by Hamas officials. \u201cMuch as in Victorian coal mines, they are prized for their nimble bodies.\u201d\n\nPer capita national income in Gaza is a meager $2,900, 172nd in the world \u2014 but many ordinary people have to live on less than $3 a day. Hamas leaders Mousa Abu Marzook and Khaled Mashaal are reportedly billionaires, their top lieutenants millionaires.\n\nGazans live in abject poverty chiefly because most of the money Hamas leaders don\u2019t stuff into their pockets is spent to attack Israel. Destroying the Jewish state and murdering all the Jews in it is just an intermediate goal, according to Mosab Hassan Yousef, son of the Hamas founder and a convert to Christianity who rejects Hamas objectives.\n\nThe ultimate goal is building a worldwide Islamic state upon the \u201crubble of every other civilization,\u201d Mr. Yousef told CNN July 24.\n\nHamas (the Arabic acronym for \u201cIslamic Resistance Movement\u201d) was founded in 1987 with initial funding from Saddam Hussein, according to Discover the Networks, a website that tracks the political left. Hamas is an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan Muslimin) founded in 1928, which received initial support from Adolf Hitler.\n\nAn Islamist state can\u2019t be built without shedding innocent blood, Hamas teaches children, according to Mosab Yousef. Many civilians die because Hamas clusters them around its rocket launchers and the entrances to its tunnels.\n\nIsrael builds shelters to protect its people. Hamas digs tunnels to protect its weapons. Hamas kills Israeli civilians. Israeli soldiers die trying to protect Palestinian civilians.\n\nThere are only about 13 million Jews in the world. They\u2019ve been productive citizens wherever they\u2019ve lived since Rome drove them from their homeland in 70 A.D. It\u2019s hard to find in history an ethnic group less threatening or more persecuted. Israelis want only to live in peace in their tiny portion (about 0.2 percent) of the Middle East, just 23 percent of what Jews were promised for a homeland.\n\nWhen Clarice Feldman spoke of Providence, I imagine she was referring to the Bible\u2019s description of the Jews as \u201cGod\u2019s Chosen People.\u201d\n\nThe utter moral depravity of support for Hamas inclines me to believe hatred of the Jews is Satanic. God didn\u2019t choose this \u201cstiff-necked people\u201d through which to tell His story because He admired their qualities, the Bible makes clear. But because He chose them, Jews acquired the eternal enmity of God\u2019s foremost adversary, and of those in Satan\u2019s thrall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Starvation has claimed the lives of 128 people \u2014 18 of them children or babies \u2014 in the Palestinian refugee camp since the conflict began.
