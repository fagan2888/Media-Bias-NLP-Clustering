From Carlos Gonzalez to Troy Tulowitzki to Dexter Fowler, Dugger\u2019s training room was filled with the Rockies\u2019 best players.\n\nBut the smile on Dugger\u2019s face Saturday afternoon said the M*A*S*H episode of 2013 is all in the past.\n\nAs the 2014 spring training opens, the Rockies\u2019 trainer is busy, certainly, but he believes the team is in a very healthy place. Pitchers and catchers have their official physicals on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great right now,\u201d Dugger said at the Rockies headquarters at Salt River Fields. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few guys we have to watch and monitor, but things are looking really good.\u201d\n\nDugger said a decision to keep Gonzalez from swinging a bat until December is paying dividends now. The painful sprained finger that ruined the second half of CarGo\u2019s 2013 season is now a non-factor. Still, CarGo is going to ease into full physical activity as he regains full strength after undergoing an emergency appendectomy on Jan. 10. Gonzalez also had a small hernia near his navel repaired when his appendix was removed.\n\n\u201cHis finger is really good,\u201d Dugger said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t allow him to swing until December, and that let that swelling get down.\u201d\n\nGonzalez hasn\u2019t changed his grip on the bat handle much, but he\u2019s taping the handle differently and the bat has been tapered differently.\n\n\u201cWe think the bat fits in his hand better, so no issues with that,\u201d Dugger said.\n\nThe two pitchers the Rockies will be keeping a close eye on as camp opens are right-handed starter Tyler Chatwood and lefty reliever Boone Logan. Both of them had bone chips removed from their throwing elbows during surgeries in early October.\n\n\u201cWith Chatwood, it was something we knew was coming, but we never thought it was anything major. Still don\u2019t,\u201d Dugger said. \u201cWe will have some restrictions on both of them early in camp; keep a close watch on their bullpens and monitor their throwing. But I think they\u2019ll be good to go. I\u2019m not concerned at all.\u201d\n\nThe other pitcher Dugger is keeping close tabs on is minor-league right-hander Chris Martin, acquired along with lefty Franklin Morales in the trade that sent infielder Jonathan Herrera to the Red Sox. Martin is dealing with an inflamed ulnar nerve that forced him to shut down during winter ball.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Boone Logan,Carlos Gonzalez,Colorado Rockies,Keith Dugger,Tyler Chatwood", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "The Rockies enter spring training healthy.
