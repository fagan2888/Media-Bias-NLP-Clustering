Deputies say two men robbed a convenience store and tied up the clerk.

An armed robbery at a Henderson County convenience store has prompted a search for two suspects.

The Henderson County Sheriff's Office was called to the El Chapulin convenience store at 1726 Old Spartanburg Road in Hendersonville just before 9:00 p.m. on Friday.

Deputies were told that two Hispanic males entered the store, approached the counter to purchase items and then robbed him at gunpoint.

Investigators said the clerk told deputies that the suspect then took him to the back of the store, tied him up and proceeded to take an undetermined amount of money from the register along with several other items from the business.

Deputies said witnesses described seeing the suspects in an older model, dark-colored Ford Explorer with South Carolina license plates. Investigators said the vehicle was last seen turning onto Upward Rd from Hwy 176.

The Henderson County Sheriff's Office requested that anyone with information about the incident or the suspects contact Detective Johnny Duncan at (828) 697-4911.
