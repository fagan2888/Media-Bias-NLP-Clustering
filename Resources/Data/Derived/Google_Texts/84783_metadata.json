Dean (Viking)\n\nPresident Richard Nixon\u2019s decision to install a secret recording system \u2014 and then to retain the tapes \u2014 perhaps ranks as the most consequential self-inflicted political wound of 20th-century America. The criminality, abuse of power, obsession with real and perceived enemies, rage, self-focus, and small-mindedness revealed on those tapes left him abandoned by his own party and forced him to resign 40 years ago.\n\nTo date, the dissemination of some 250 White House conversations has defined his presidency and its corruption. Now comes John W. Dean, Nixon\u2019s White House counsel and later his chief accuser, to transcribe and analyze at least 600 new conversations in his book \u201cThe Nixon Defense.\u201d The title is misleading, because it suggests there is a case for Nixon\u2019s innocence. Dean quickly clears that up when he writes in the preface, \u201cFortunately for everyone, his defense failed.\u201d\n\nThe new material reveals further examples of the administration\u2019s contempt for the law. It provides a detailed narrative of precisely what happened inside the Nixon White House beginning three days after the June 17, 1972, burglary when five men were arrested in the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate, and continuing until the taping system was shut down after aide Alexander Butterfield revealed it 13 months later.\n\nI never doubted that Nixon was the ringleader and driving force behind the Watergate crimes and mind-set. The evidence on previous tapes, the testimony at hearings and trials, and the memoirs of his closest aides made that clear. But Dean\u2019s book seals that conclusion, perhaps forever. He brings the microscope as close to the Nixon of Watergate as anyone has, and he has done so in a generally dispassionate presentation of hundreds of pages of content from the tapes, plus quotations and scenes from previously released recordings, including conversations in which he participated.\n\n\u201cWatergate,\u201d Dean concludes, \u201cas the overwhelming evidence revealed, was merely one particularly egregious expression of Nixon\u2019s often ruthless abuses of power. Had Richard Nixon not encouraged his aides to collect political intelligence by any means fair or foul, or insisted from the moment of the [Watergate] arrests that there must be no coverup, neither would have taken place. Nixon was not only responsible for all that went amiss during his presidency, he was in almost every instance the catalyst, when not the instigator.\u201d\n\nThe new tapes depict a White House full of lies, chaos, distrust, speculation, self-protection, maneuver and counter-maneuver, with a crookedness that makes Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d look unsophisticated. Dean himself was eventually charged with obstruction of justice and served four months in prison. Describing himself and Nixon\u2019s other top aides in the spring of 1973, he writes: \u201cWe had become something of a criminal cabal, weighing the risks of further criminal action to prevent the worst while hoping something might unexpectedly occur that would resolve the problems. \u201c\n\nThe book contains no blockbusters, but the new tapes suggest that the full story of the Nixon administration\u2019s secret operations may forever remain buried along with their now-deceased perpetrators. For example, on Oct. 10, 1972, Carl Bernstein and I wrote in The Washington Post that Watergate was not an isolated operation but only part of a massive campaign of political espionage and sabotage run by the Nixon re-election committee and the White House.\n\nDean shows White House chief of staff H.R. \u201cBob\u201d Haldeman and the top domestic adviser, John D. Ehrlichman, at one moment denying to the president any role in clandestine, criminal activities, then acknowledging it. The tapes also capture Nixon shading the truth after admitting knowledge of the activities. On April 14, 1973, Ehrlichman told the president that, based on his own investigation of the Watergate cover-up, \u201cthere were eight or 10 people around [the White House] who knew about this, knew it was going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I knew it, I knew it,\u201d Nixon replied. But then he quickly tried to backtrack. Dean writes: \u201cRealizing what he had just confessed, and possibly realizing that it had been recorded, the president immediately tried, rather awkwardly to retract it.\u201d Nixon is then heard saying, \u201cI knew, I must say though, I didn\u2019t know it.\u201d This type of classic doubletalk appears time and again.\n\nOn April 9, 1973, three months before the secret White House recording system was revealed publicly, Nixon instructed Haldeman to get rid of all the tapes. \u201cI think we should take all that we\u2019ve got and destroy them,\u201d the president is heard saying on tape. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have in the record the discussions we\u2019ve had in this room about Watergate.\u201d\n\nAs Dean writes, \u201cHad he destroyed the tapes he would have survived, tarnished but intact.\u201d But the order was not carried out.\n\nDean, as always the model of precision and doggedness, has performed yeoman service in this more-than-700-page monster of a book. Page after page of taped dialogue reveals the rambling, ugly fog of scandal as Nixon and his top aides scramble to deceive one another and save themselves.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u201cDefense\u201d paints damning portrait of Nixon", "title": "\u201cDefense\u201d paints damning portrait of Nixon", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/07/defense-paints-damning-portrait-of-nixon/", "image": {"width": 260, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140807__20140810_E8_BK10NIXONBOOKp1.jpg", "height": 393}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140807__20140810_E8_BK10NIXONBOOKp1.jpg?w=240", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-07T17:06:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:04:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb91\"", "article_summary": "To date, the dissemination of some 250 White House conversations has defined his presidency and its corruption.\n\u201cWatergate,\u201d Dean concludes, \u201cas the overwhelming evidence revealed, was merely one particularly egregious expression of Nixon\u2019s often ruthless abuses of power.\nDean shows White House chief of staff H.R.\nOn April 9, 1973, three months before the secret White House recording system was revealed publicly, Nixon instructed Haldeman to get rid of all the tapes.\nNow comes John W.
