Several have since posted big losses and it looks like Blue Cross Blue Shield got the losing end of the stick, too.\n\nFitch Ratings looked at nearly three dozen BCBS companies and found that 23 saw a decline in earnings that totaled $1.9 billion in the first nine months of last year, while 16 had net losses.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan lost $622 million from January through September last year. Blue Cross plans in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Montana lost $442 billion. And those in Pennsylvania, Delaware and West Virginia lost $266 million.\n\nThe reason is ObamaCare.\n\nOr as Fitch puts it: \u201cCost and utilization trends from state insurance exchanges from the Affordable Care Act have been higher than anticipated and are the primary drivers of declining earnings.\u201d\n\nThis is a big deal, given that Blue Cross plans are often the largest provider of individual insurance policies in any given market. The Blue Cross plan in Michigan has more than a third of the exchange market, in Delaware it\u2019s more than 80%, and it is almost 90% in North Carolina.\n\nGiven their size, these insurers should have had the broadest and most stable insurance pools in ObamaCare. What they found instead was that the young and healthy are avoiding ObamaCare\u2019s overpriced insurance. If the Blues are struggling, how likely is it that the smaller insurers can succeed?\n\nMany of the Blues sharply increased premiums this year, which Fitch says should improve earnings. Plus, the administration is planning to dole out $7.7 billion in \u201ctransitional reinsurance\u201d money, which it hopes will keep insurers in the ObamaCare game at least one more year. They also backpedaled on requiring insurers to have a reasonable network of providers in their plans out of fear that those rules would only fuel more premium inflation.\n\nThe law isn\u2019t getting any more popular with the public, either. An AP poll found that just 26% say they support the law, vs. 42% who oppose it. And a separate survey by NPR and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that while 15% say the law directly benefited them, 25% said it hurt them.\n\nIn short, the stars continue to align for repealing ObamaCare next year, but only if the GOP nominates someone who can win in November.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health Care: The insurance industry must be kicking itself for backing ObamaCare.
