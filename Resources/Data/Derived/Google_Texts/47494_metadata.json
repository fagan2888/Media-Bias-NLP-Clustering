Nobody is talking about taking that away from you.\u201d \u2014 President Barack Obama\n\nHome Deport has joined the growing number of employers that will no longer offer health insurance benefits to part-time workers. The country\u2019s largest home improvement retailer announced last week that it would instead shift some 20,000 part-timer workers to ObamaCare\u2019s health insurance exchanges:\n\nEmployees with fewer than 30 hours a week will no longer be offered limited liability medical coverage, Stephen Holmes, a spokesman, said today by telephone. About 5 percent of Atlanta-based Home Depot\u2019s 340,000 employees are enrolled in that plan.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nHome Depot said it is maintaining coverage for full-time workers, though those people will pay more next year, reflecting a rise in the cost of health care. Whether part-timers pay more under the health law\u2019s insurance marketplaces will depend on the type of plans they choose, Holmes said. The company will continue offering part-time employees coverage for dental, vision, critical illness, disability and back-up dependent care, according to Holmes. The Affordable Care Act defines part-time workers as those working fewer than 30 hours a week. Holmes said Home Depot had already been using the 30-hour standard for defining part-time versus full-time work.\n\nHome Depot joins a list of more than 300 employers, both private and public, that have either cut workers\u2019 hours or shifted them to ObamaCare\u2019s state exchanges to avoid added healthcare costs that are a direct result of the 2010 healthcare law. Some employers, such as Walgreens, have shifted workers to a privately-run health insurance exchange, as an alternative to ObamaCare\u2019s state exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Health Insurance,health insurance exchanges,Home Depot,ObamaCare,obamacare exchange,part-time,part-time employees,part-time workers,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "description": "Home Depot &#8220;If you\u2019ve got health insurance, you like your doctors, you like your plan, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.
