Peyton Manning has already showed the NFL’s young stars how it’s done on the field. Now he’s showing them how it’s done off the field.

The Broncos 38-year-old star quarterback capped his record-setting season by moving up three spots to No. 5 among American athletes on The Fortunate 50, the annual rankings by Sports Illustrated and Fortune of the highest-paid athletes.

Manning reportedly pulled in $12.5 million in endorsements from companies like Papa John’s, Gatorade, DirecTV and Buick last season. Add in his $25 million salary and the surefire Hall-of-Famer took in $37.5 million last year.

Not too shabby.

Manning’s total earnings put him at No. 2 among NFL players, trailing only Aaron Rodgers, who reportedly earned $45.8 million last year ($40 million in salary, $5.8 million in endorsements), thanks in part to a $35 million signing bonus.

Boxer Floyd Mayweather again ranked No. 1 on the list with $105 million, thanks to his fight against Marcos Maidana in May. LeBron James ($57,067,500) and Kobe Bryant ($50,453,805) sat at No. 2 and 3 respectively.

Manning ranked No. 8 on the list in 2013 with a total of $31 million ($18 million in salary, $13 million in endorsements), reigning as football’s biggest endorser.
