Over the weekend, they met in a Northern Virginia Hotel to hash out a list of questions and demands that they would present to future debate hosts.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Trump Is Still Ahead, Despite Carson\u2019s Surge\n\nAmong other things, they planned to demand parity in airtime, approval over graphics displayed on screen, and guarantees that the temperature in the hall would not exceed 67 degrees Fahrenheit, and more.\n\nBut there was never a final agreement on the text, and the first cracks in the erstwhile candidates\u2019 union began to appear Monday, when frontrunner Donald Trump announced that he would not sign the letter, preferring to negotiate directly with the networks. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina didn\u2019t even send a representative to the meeting and refused to participate. Then New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich indicated that they wouldn\u2019t join, either.\n\nBy late Monday night, Fox News host Megyn Kelly was openly ridiculing the list of demands on her show, The Kelly File, asking sarcastically if the candidates might also like foot massages during the debate, and mocking the demand that they be allowed to approve networks\u2019 graphics. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s gonna happen,\u201d she said dismissively.\n\nOn Tuesday, former GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) criticized the candidates\u2019 complaining while talking with reporters in Washington. \u201cI think their complaints are legitimate, but come on. Man up and move on,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Trump Cuts His Opponents Off at the Knees\n\nBy late Tuesday, the possibility that a broad agreement between the candidates would be struck appeared to be in question, according to multiple reports. The four candidates who have definitively refused to sign the list of demands all campaigned on the issue in one way or another Tuesday.\n\nTrump, as is his habit, made it all about Trump, saying that the whole issue had arisen when CNBC moderator John Harwood used the first question of the night to ask Trump if he was running a \u201ccomic book campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe guy asked me a question,\u201d Trump said Tuesday. \u201cI think Harwood is probably finished as a credible reporter. He\u2019s a disaster. And it was such a horribly put question and so obvious. And the Republicans coalesced around each other. It was actually pretty beautiful, when you think about it.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Says Social Security Is Being Robbed. It\u2019s Not True\n\n(For the record, John Harwood is actually a widely respected journalist and is not, by any means, \u201cfinished.\u201d)\n\nFiorina, Christie, and Kasich all used the controversy to differentiate themselves from the rest of the field, suggesting that the other candidates are afraid to take on difficult questions.\n\nThe controversy over the debates has been a major headache for the Republican National Committee, which is ultimately in charge of organizing and sanctioning the contests. RNC chair Reince Priebus was forced to rearrange the staff members charged with overseeing the debates over the weekend.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Mocked by network anchors and ridiculed by senior members of their own party, the Republican presidential candidates who have been attempting", "title": "Megyn Kelly to GOP: No Foot Massages on Network TV", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/04/Megyn-Kelly-GOP-No-Foot-Massages-Network-TV", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Megyn_Kelly_Fox.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/04/Megyn-Kelly-GOP-No-Foot-Massages-Network-TV", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Megyn_Kelly_Fox.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Mocked by network anchors and ridiculed by senior members of their own party, the Republican presidential candidates who have been attempting", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think Harwood is probably finished as a credible reporter.\nOn Tuesday, former GOP presidential nominee Sen.
