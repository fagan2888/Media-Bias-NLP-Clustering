Detroit, MI

A man pumping gas attempts to kill a spider - and ends up setting the entire pump on fire.

Susan Adams, Gas Station Employee: "There are some people who are scared of spiders, but..."

Taryn Asher, Reporter: "Would you set it on fire?"

Adams: "No."

Well, that's exactly what one person did in Detroit.

The man spotted a spider on his gas tank and because he is deathly afraid of them, he pulled out his lighter and decided to burn it.

Susan Adams watched the whole thing go down last week while she was working inside the Mobil Gas Station.

"He didn't have a cigarette. He didn't have anything on him so all of a sudden I looked out and I seen flames," Adams said.

His car was barely damaged by the flames, but his embarassing mistake didn't stop the man from coming back the next day, Adams says - almost like nothing ever happened.
