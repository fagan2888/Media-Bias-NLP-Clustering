The ratio is the amount an insurer spends on medical claims compared with its income from premiums.\n\nCentene's net profit rose to $107 million, or $1.76 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $53 million, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.74 per share, above the average analyst estimate of $1.69, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nRevenue rose 61 pct to $4.73 billion, topping the analysts' estimate of $4.61 billion.\n\nCentene's shares rose as much as 4 percent to a record high of $113.62 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.\n\n(Editing by Simon Jennings and Don Sebastian)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Amrutha Penumudi and Ankur Banerjee", "Author": "Amrutha Penumudi and Ankur Banerjee", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Health insurer Centene Corp (CNC.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as it added more Medicaid members, and assured investors of \"stable medical costs\" in 2015.", "title": "Health insurer Centene's profit beats as membership rises", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "News", "DCSext.ContentID_gc07": "USKBN0L71X420150203", "sailthru.tags": "US, CENTENE, RESULTS", "sailthru.title": "Health insurer Centene's profit beats as membership rises", "keywords": "US,CENTENE,RESULTS,Managed Healthcare (TRBC),United States,Healthcare Services (TRBC),Performance / Results / Earnings,Company News,Healthcare (TRBC),Life and Health Insurance (TRBC),Healthcare Providers and Services (TRBC),Content produced in Bangalore,Healthcare Facilities and Services (TRBC),English,Corporate Events,Health / Medicine,Results Forecasts / Warnings,Insurance (TRBC)", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;CENTENE;RESULTS;Managed Healthcare (TRBC);United States;Healthcare Services (TRBC);Performance / Results / Earnings;Company News;Healthcare (TRBC);Life and Health Insurance (TRBC);Healthcare Providers and Services (TRBC);Content produced in Bangalore;Healthcare Facilities and Services (TRBC);English;Corporate Events;Health / Medicine;Results Forecasts / Warnings;Insurance (TRBC)", "WT.cg_n": "News -
