But two court rulings this week about Obamacare could focus more attention on the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 decision.\n\nIn case you missed it, the HHS said on July 17 that Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands aren\u2019t considered \u201cstates\u201d for most ACA insurance purposes, and people who buy and sell in the health insurance marketplace there aren\u2019t subject to most Obamacare mandates. The new ruling effectively overturned a 2013 HHS ruling that said the opposite \u2013 that the five territories were \u201cstates\u201d under the ACA\u2019s provisions.\n\n\u201cAfter a careful review of this situation and the relevant statutory language, HHS has determined that the new provisions \u2026 are appropriately governed by the definition of \u2018state,\u2019 \u201d said the HHS said in a statement. \u201c[T]hese new provisions do not apply to individual or group health insurance issuers in the U.S. territories.\u201d\n\nThe two unrelated federal court rulings this Tuesday disagreed on another part of the ACA that uses the word \u201cState.\u201d\n\nObamacare opponents believe a strict reading of the ACA says that only people in state-run health-care exchanges can qualify for the Obamacare tax breaks. That would exclude people in 34 states from getting Obamacare tax subsidies to pay for health insurance.\n\nThe Obama administration argues that an Internal Revenue Service ruling makes it clear that the tax credits apply to states that have federally run insurance exchanges, and any misunderstanding about the word \u201cState\u201d was a drafting error in the law and not the true intent of Congress.\n\nWhile the argument over what is a \u201cState\u201d for Obamacare purposes within the 50 United States seems headed toward the Supreme Court for its next term, the 4.5 million people in the five U.S. territories face a different situation.\n\nThe ACA was written by Congress to let the HHS set the Obamacare rules for the five U.S. territories. In turn, the HHS re-interpreted the Public Health Service Act to say that the five U.S. territories, which aren\u2019t states to begin with, shouldn\u2019t be treated like states.\n\nThe previous HHS ruling required insurance companies offering policies in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands to accept all applicants and offer all mandated benefits to the applicants, regardless of earlier health problems. But the HHS didn\u2019t require residents to buy health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nThe imbalance between new patients seeking policies without more money flowing to insurers to offset expenses gave insurance companies a powerful reason to leave those five marketplaces.\n\nAn administration official from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services acknowledged as much last week, telling the Washington Post that the insurers in the five U.S. territories couldn\u2019t handle the influx of sicker patients.\n\n\u201cWe are providing additional flexibility to the territories in order to implement the law in a way that recognizes their unique situations,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nSo for now, some Obamacare regulations stay in the five territories, including the ban on lifetime and annual limits, and the contraception coverage requirement.\n\nBut the decision will undoubtedly give more fodder to the ACA\u2019s critics, who believe the administration isn\u2019t consistent with what it defines as a state for insurance purposes. It also could fuel criticism that the HHS\u2019s efforts aren\u2019t helping uninsured or under-insured in the five territories.\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nUpdate: Federal courts split on key part of Obamacare funding\n\n10 fascinating facts about the Scopes Monkey Trial\n\nCongress remains unpopular, inactive in mid-term year\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "The mass media downplayed last week\u2019s Obama administration ruling that five U.S. territories don\u2019t have to implement most of the Affordable Care Act.
