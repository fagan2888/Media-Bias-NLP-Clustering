His supporters also turned out in Daphne and across the Southeast, where Cruz is seen to be rapidly gaining ground.\n\nAll perceived standings at this point in the race are based on polls that are prone to fluctuations, but notably, Cruz has been ahead of his closest rival in the primary race, Donald Trump, in recent polls of likely Republican voters in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nBefore Cruz took the stage in Trussville, a local talk show host spoke briefly to the crowd a young woman sung the national anthem, and a preacher gave a brief invocation, exhorting attendees to be steadfast in their religious faith and to vote for Cruz.\n\nCruz emphasizes his Christianity, and that plays well in places like Iowa, where the evangelical vote is important in the Republican primary.\n\nAlso opening for Cruz was Rep. Mo Brooks, Republican from Alabama\u2019s 5th Congressional District. By way of foreshadowing one of the major themes of Cruz\u2019s speech, Brooks focused his remarks on immigration. He talked about a bill \u2014 which had made it through the Senate \u2014 that he and his House colleagues were able to \u201ckill\u201d that would have \u201copened the floodgates for even more foreign labor that would undermine the ability of Americans and lawful immigrants who are already here to find jobs that paid well.\u201d Brooks specifically credited Rep. Steve King of Iowa and Senator Jeff Sessions, along with Cruz, for working with him to constitute the \u201ccore leadership fighting that legislation.\u201d\n\nCruz began with warm praise for his Alabama audience. \u201cThere must be something in the water down here; the state of Alabama knows how to produce fighters,\u201d Cruz said to loud applause. He also had warm words for Brooks and Sessions.\n\nThe candidate referred several times to the importance of the \u201cSEC primary,\u201d a reference to March 1, 2016 (so-called \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d), when Alabama and 11 other states hold their primary ballots, among them other Southern states like Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas. The primary, which derives its nickname from the athletic conference to which Alabama\u2019s two major public universities belong, is considered one of the major \u201csorting\u201d days for candidates.\n\nCruz\u2019s speech was consistent with the firebrand image he has built for himself over the past several years since he arrived in the Senate. He delivers like a practiced politician, but also like a preacher, saying, \u201cThere is a spirit of revival sweeping the country \u2026 I just want to tell you today: help is on the way.\u201d The last sentence was delivered with the gusto of a revival preacher, and this does make sense; Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael Cruz \u2014 a Cuban who fled the island after Fidel Castro came to power \u2014 is a traveling Christian preacher with a fairly high profile. In fact, the elder Cruz was in Birmingham with Glenn Beck for his \u201cRestoring Unity\u201d rally in late August.\n\nCruz\u2019s religious appeal is a big part of his message, and it appears to be resonating with voters. One attendee, LeAnn Beverly of Crestwood, said she has made up her mind in favor of Cruz, the main reason being, \u201cOverall, Christian values.\u201d She also cited immigration and opposition to President Obama\u2019s healthcare law, but she emphasized that above that, \u201cfamily is the most important thing. Family values, keeping our families together, that\u2019s the backbone of any nation. Anything or anyone who wants to destroy our country, the most effective way to do that would be to destroy the family. [Cruz] stands for Christian family values; that\u2019s the backbone.\u201d\n\nShe also mentioned religious freedom, and in particular, that Christianity, is \u201cstarting to be persecuted \u2026 Persecution isn\u2019t just having your head chopped off; persecution is having your values minimized and having that of other groups \u2014 like Muslims \u2014 raised, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. That\u2019s also persecution.\u201d\n\nCruz is aware of the popularity of such opinions. He has openly said (on more than one occasion) that \u201cPresident Obama is acting as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first thing I intend to do on the first day in office is rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive order,\u201d Cruz said. His words were drowned out at the end by a thunderous standing ovation, but he continued. \u201cAnother thing I intend to do on the first day in office is begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, the once and eternal capital of Israel.\u201d\n\nThat comment, too, was met with enormous enthusiasm from the audience. Cruz acknowledged that advisors would likely come to him and warn that such a course would \u201cmake other folks in the Middle East really, really unhappy with us.\u201d He laughed off this potential advice, to the delight of the crowd.\n\nCruz also drew loud applause and standing ovations for his strong criticism of Planned Parenthood and for his condemnation of the Obama administration\u2019s recent nuclear agreement with Iran. At the end of this litany of denunciations, Cruz said, \u201cAnd that\u2019s just day one \u2026 By the end of eight years, there are going to be a whole lot of newspaper reporters and editors and journalists that check themselves into therapy,\u201d a prediction that also was a hit with the audience.\n\nPledging to \u201crepeal every word of Obamacare\u201d and to \u201cinstruct the Department Education that Common Core ends today,\u201d Cruz followed up with a fiery passage about immigration and securing the border. Perhaps the loudest applause for the entire speech came when he said he would \u201cend welfare benefits for those here illegally.\u201d That set the packed auditorium cheering and chanting \u201cCruz! Cruz!\u201d\n\nAll told, Cruz spoke for about half an hour, and the crowd, which ranged in age from young teenagers (and some small children) to octogenarians, was fervently supportive of everything he put forth.\n\nAfter the event, Aaron Parker of Tuscaloosa said he would vote for which ever Republican wins the primary, \u201cbut I hope it\u2019s Cruz. He\u2019s the best choice.\u201d Asked what he cared about the most, Parker said, \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, absolutely the economy. It\u2019s the number one issue for everybody, but following that, it\u2019s national security; I\u2019d like to be able to go back into the military, but it\u2019s not going to happen under this president.\u201d Parker is a recent service veteran from the 10th Mountain Division, a light infantry division of the US Army. He said he would not trust Obama as his commander-in-chief.\n\nParker went on to articulate a detailed plan for how he would deal with the current problems in the Middle East, and said that he prefers limited government and term limits for elected officials. \u201cNo career politicians anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe three or four terms, but we need to figure it out, get it done, and do it right.\u201d When officials are not so fixated on staying in office, he said, they would be able to deal more effectively with the task of governance.\n\nIn any case, he said, Ted Cruz is the man he feels is best suited to the job of President. It remains too early to tell who will get the Republican nomination, but if Sunday\u2019s event was anything to go by, it would appear that Cruz can likely count on a significant base of support in the so-called \u201cSEC primary\u201d in early March.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Weld for Birmingham", "description": "The Republican senator made stops in Trussville and Daphne this month.", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign tour visits Alabama", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 896, "identifier": "http://weldbham.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/9904ca09-69c3-4b64-aa9d-09b4d8ff184d.jpg", "height": 597}, "url": "http://weldbham.com/blog/2015/12/25/ted-cruz-campaign-alabama-news/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 199569796846147}, "template": "WeldBham 1.0", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "voting", "published_time": "2015-12-25T18:55:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-25T21:25:11+00:00", "author": "http://weldbham.com/blog/author/edwardashton2/"}, "google-site-verification": "878969361de6ef4b", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Cruz emphasizes his Christianity, and that plays well in places like Iowa, where the evangelical vote is important in the Republican primary.\nIn any case, he said, Ted Cruz is the man he feels is best suited to the job of President.\nBy way of foreshadowing one of the major themes of Cruz\u2019s speech, Brooks focused his remarks on immigration.\nFamily values, keeping our families together, that\u2019s the backbone of any nation.\n\u201cThere must be something in the water down here; the state of Alabama knows how to produce fighters,\u201d Cruz said to loud applause."}
