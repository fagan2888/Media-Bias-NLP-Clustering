Instead, they\u2019ve focused their efforts on dismantling enforcement and shutting down states that have tried to enact bills reacting to the inaction in Washington,\u201d said Bob Dane, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\n\nDane added: \u201cCongress must also act to restore its power to \u2018establish a uniform rule of naturalization\u2019 under Article I, Section 8, Clause 4 of the Constitution, meaning Congress makes the laws; the president must carry them out.\u201d\n\nOutgoing Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., issued a scathing report over the weekend, declaring that less than 3 percent of illegal immigrants will ever be deported. Last week, the Congressional Research Service announced that illegal immigration began to rise in 2012 after a five-year lull.\n\nThough House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has soft-pedaled the immigration issue, some newly elected House Republicans are spoiling for a fight \u2014 with or without their party\u2019s current leadership.\n\nRep. Dave Brat, R-Va., who defeated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a stunning primary victory last year, said Sunday:\n\nWhen the new Republican-led Congress takes office this week, one of our first priorities must be to have a clean bill to reverse the amnesty spending by immediately restricting any federal funds from being used to carry out Mr. Obama\u2019s illegal decree. There is speculation that there may only be a show vote on rescinding that money, and instead a \u2018border security\u2019 bill would be offered as a substitute for stopping amnesty. A border spending bill that doesn\u2019t really strengthen the border and allows illegal immigrants to continue living and working in the United States would only make things worse.\n\n\u201cThat is unacceptable,\u201d Brat said.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "An immigration group is urging Congress to join the fight on behalf of taxpayers and the Constitution.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An immigration group is urging Congress to join the fight on behalf of taxpayers and the Constitution.", "title": "Immigration Group Urges Congress to Join States in Amnesty Fight", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/epalive445797.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-09T16:12:41+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1436PGQ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An immigration group is urging Congress to join the fight on behalf of taxpayers and the Constitution.", "title": "Immigration Group Urges Congress to Join States in Amnesty Fight", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/epalive445797.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-01-10T03:01:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-09T16:12:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Dave Brat, Immigration, amnesty, executive order"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd9e\"", "article_summary": "As 25 states sue the Obama administration over the president\u2019s controversial executive amnesty order, an immigration group is urging Congress to join the fight on behalf of taxpayers and the Constitution.\nLast week, the Congressional Research Service announced that illegal immigration began to rise in 2012 after a five-year lull.\nA border spending bill that doesn\u2019t really strengthen the border and allows illegal immigrants to continue living and working in the United States would only make things worse.\n\u201cFor six years, the Obama administration has been obsessed with centralizing power but refused to use it to enforce immigration laws.\nThough House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has soft-pedaled the immigration issue, some newly elected House Republicans are spoiling for a fight \u2014 with or without their party\u2019s current leadership."}
