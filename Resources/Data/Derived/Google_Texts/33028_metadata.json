The price of health care should be what the market will bear, which, for someone in a life-or-death situation, is a lot. If someone is a poor negotiator, or if circumstances such as a ruptured artery make them unable to negotiate, then they might pay more. If they can\u2019t afford it, then they can\u2019t buy it, and the rest of us should feel no more remorse than if they can\u2019t afford a pickup. They should have made better economic choices before they went shopping at the hospital.\n\nVery few of us see health care this way. So if it\u2019s not a commodity, then what is it? The opposite would be an entitlement \u2014 a service the government bestows. That\u2019s how it works in a lot of European social democracies and in Canada.\n\nAmericans don\u2019t like that either. The idea of the government having the power to give and take away free stuff, particularly something as important as health care, typically makes us uneasy (unless we can figure out some way of justifying it when we personally benefit, of course).\n\nIf health care isn\u2019t a commodity, and it\u2019s not an entitlement, then it\u2019s something in between \u2014 a partial responsibility for middle- and upper-class individuals under age 65. That\u2019s the messy middle ground Americans have selected, and the way it\u2019s implemented is through insurance.\n\nAll of this is relevant because it\u2019s time for Americans to once again sign up for health insurance. It\u2019s now mandatory, of course, and this time, the fine for not paying is $695, which is enough to sting a little.\n\nYou can bet that Republicans will use this fact to score political points, even though this part of Obamacare was a conservative idea not long ago.\n\nInsurance\u2019s purpose is to insure us against unforeseeable costs we cannot pay. We pay thousands to the insurance companies today so we\u2019ll be assured of receiving much more expensive care if we need it tomorrow.\n\nFor that system to function properly, most of us must lose money on this deal. And it only works fairly if all of us who can afford it pay in. The 23-year-old with money who doesn\u2019t buy insurance will still be allowed to access the system if he crashes his motorcycle, because in that moment, his life is so precious that it cannot be commodified. But somebody has to pay for saving that life, and because he didn\u2019t, his health care will be subsidized by the rest of us. That makes it an entitlement.\n\nOne of the problems with this middle ground is that it doesn\u2019t contain enough cost controls. If health care were a commodity, care would be rationed by the market. If it were an entitlement, care would be rationed by the government. As insurance exists now, buyers pay most of their health-care costs upfront and have few incentives to shop around. Sellers therefore have few incentives to provide the cheapest deal possible.\n\nThe United States spends about 18 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, far more than the rest of the world, and the costs still are rising at unsustainable rates. If you\u2019re wondering why you haven\u2019t received a raise in a while, the truth is that you have: Your employer is paying more for your insurance every year rather than increasing your salary.\n\nThis can\u2019t continue. In any economy, costs must be controlled by something, and if nothing else will do it, eventually the government will. So the buzzword these days is \u201cconsumer-driven health care\u201d \u2014 making health care a little more of a commodity, but within the current system. Policymakers who are interested in solving problems are considering how to incentivize consumers to make more informed economic choices. Making them spend more of their own money, but not a crippling amount, through higher deductibles is one imperfect way of doing this.\n\nThis will be messy, it will be hard to figure out, and there will be a lot of yelling. So far, the United States has foregone the more cut-and-dried choices \u2014 making health care either a commodity or an entitlement \u2014 because of those choices\u2019 problems. In other words, we still have a majority consensus about what health care is not. Now we just have to figure out what it is.\n\nSteve Brawner is an independent journalist in Arkansas.
