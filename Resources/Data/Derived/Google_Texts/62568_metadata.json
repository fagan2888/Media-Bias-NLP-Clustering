During the shoot, Obama and the British adventure celebrity posed for a selfie? They were smiling? Summon the trolls, the id-driven commenters, and the na\u00effs for another anonymous verbal crusade. Obama\u2019s not dignified, he\u2019s a celebrity president, and, my current favorite on a site detailing Obama\u2019s Alaska schedule, he\u2019s \u201cthe missing Kardashian brother,\u201d even though we all know that great honor belongs to Brody Jenner.\n\nI\u2019m not here to argue about Obama\u2019s public appearance decisions, especially not to flame-throwers and threadjackers. It\u2019s just well worth reminding those who are genuinely dismayed by Obama\u2019s choice to go on \u201cRunning Wild\u201d to talk climate change \u2014 the episode will air later this year \u2014 that the world is not ending. He\u2019s merely continuing a trend that began decades ago, probably when President Eisenhower showed up on \u201cThe Colgate Comedy Hour\u201d in 1955 and on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d three years later. It\u2019s not too far of a fetch to see links between Ike\u2019s star turns, President Ford\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d bit in 1976, President Bush\u2019s moment reaching out to the military on Howie Mandel\u2019s \u201cDeal or No Deal\u201d in 2008, and Obama gone \u201cWild.\u201d The age of the humorless president is long gone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not a partisan issue, except for those who want it to be so. Pop culture and politicians from both sides of the aisle \u2014 including sitting presidents, former presidents (the Fords on \u201cDynasty,\u201d OMG), and candidates on the campaign trail \u2014 have been mingling with increasing intensity basically since the advent of TV. There\u2019s no reason our cultural lives ought to remain off-limits to elected officials; we only need to hope for discretion. Many of us, I\u2019m betting, don\u2019t want to see Obama screaming back at Gordon Ramsay on \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen,\u201d just as we don\u2019t want to hear politicians yell out insults during a joint session of Congress.\n\nDiscretion: I vote yes.\n\nLike presidential candidates, sitting presidents often need to employ the art of politicking through pop culture. With its more casual tone, it can be a hugely effective instrument. Richard Nixon, in perhaps the most oft-cited example, said, \u201cSock it to me\u201d on \u201cRowan and Martin\u2019s Laugh-In\u201d in September 1968, to improve his inelegant public image with some flower power; two months later he won, narrowly. \u201cNixon said . . . appearing on \u2018Laugh-In\u2019 is what got him elected,\u201d \u201cLaugh-In\u201d creator George Schlatter once said, \u201cand I believe that.\u201d Bill Clinton on \u201cThe Arsenio Hall Show\u201d in June 1992? Same deal.\n\nWhat is interesting about Obama going on \u201cRunning Wild\u201d to promote his environmental agenda is that his media choices of late have been, in some ways, far outside the box. He is clearly of a mind to expand beyond the familiar network outlets and into more alternative spaces, in an acknowledgment of the increasingly fractured media and its many niches. If you want to reach people these days, you have to find out what they\u2019re watching; the country is more of a demographic puzzle than ever. Only the Super Bowl is going to get the massive numbers and broad audiences of olden days. The science of demographics is growing more powerful by the year, and it might be a good thing if our presidents and their staffs are savvy enough to recognize that.\n\nWhen Obama waged his campaign to promote the Affordable Care Act last year, he visited late-night TV, of course, but he also visited the Web-only talk-show satire \u201cBetween Two Ferns With Zach Galifianakis.\u201d In order to reach those younger, healthier viewers that he needed to sign up for insurance, to balance out the older and sicker subscribers, he found a novel outlet \u2014 and it worked, according to White House spokespeople, boosting health care enrollment overnight. Between the \u201cFunny or Die\u201d site and YouTube, the \u201cFerns\u201d interview has drawn 42 million views. Only a fool would dismiss the power of the YouTube star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama also pushed the envelope this year by giving a free-flowing interview to Marc Maron, a podcaster who gets personal with his guests in his LA garage. The president\u2019s goal: to humanize himself. Obama talked one-on-one to Maron, who is not a White House reporter, for just over an hour \u2014 much longer than, say, his visits to \u201cThe View,\u201d \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d \u201cEllen,\u201d and \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d Maron\u2019s series, which usually tops the iTunes charts, reached its 100 million download landmark two years ago; only a fool would dismiss the power of a podcaster in his garage whose show is called \u201cWTF.\u201d\n\nWill Obama\u2019s appearance on \u201cRunning Wild\u201d succeed in calling attention to climate change? Will turning his concerns about the environment into a pop cultural meme top his more sedate appeals? Let\u2019s see if his message will fly.\n\nPhotos and video from Obama\u2019s trip to Alaska:\n\nMarkers throughout Exit Glacier show how much it's receded over time. The impacts of climate change are real, and the people of Alaska are living with them every day. It's never been more important for us to work together to address this challenge. -bo A photo posted by The White House (@whitehouse) on Sep 1, 2015 at 5:43pm PDT\n\nWatch @POTUS go behind the camera in Alaska to talk about the impacts of climate change: http://t.co/eAVC9RjeMV https://t.co/5y0EZH9RKi \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) September 2, 2015\n\nGlad this was the only Bear I met in the park. -bo A photo posted by The White House (@whitehouse) on Sep 1, 2015 at 10:39pm PDT\n\nResurrection Bay is one of those places that reminds you of all the beauty this country has to offer. It's home to whales (I got to see one!), sea lions, and dozens of other species. Surrounded by jagged cliffs and alpine glaciers, this is a place that's worth protecting. -bo A photo posted by The White House (@whitehouse) on Sep 1, 2015 at 11:30pm PDT\n\nI?m very proud to be the first president to travel above the Arctic Circle. Thank you Alaska, for your warmth and your hospitality. It was extraordinary. -bo A photo posted by The White House (@whitehouse) on Sep 3, 2015 at 2:17pm PDT\n\nComing soon: a Behind the Lens gallery on the President's trip to Alaska. I'll post the link in my profile as soon as it's up. Here, the President gathers a cup of water to boil from the melting Exit Glacier at Kenai Fjords National Park. DSLR.
