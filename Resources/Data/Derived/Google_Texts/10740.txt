Changes in the health insurance landscape have the Pinellas school district exploring its options for self-insurance.

Superintendent Mike Grego said the district could save as much as $3.7 million on taxes and fees if it goest that direction, with additional savings if claims are lower than projected. The district also could earn money on the program reserves, which would be held by the district and not an insurance carrier.

Grego added the federal Affordable Care Act made self-insurance more viable than in the past.

During a workshop Tuesday, he and his staff reviewed the pros and cons of the plan with the School Board. He has laid out a schedule in which the district could become self-insured by January.

The board would have to approve the change.
