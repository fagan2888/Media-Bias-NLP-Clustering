So far, one of the projected benefits of Obamacare\u2013a decrease of volume in crowded emergency rooms across the country due to new healthcare policy holders who would theoretically have access to primary care\u2013has not come to fruition.\n\nIn the online poll conducted by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), 86 percent of respondents expect emergency visits to increase over the next three years, and more than three-fourths said their emergency rooms are not adequately prepared for significant increases.\n\n\u201cEmergency visits will increase in large part because more people will have health insurance and therefore will be seeking medical care,\u201d said Alex Rosenau, DO, FACEP, president of the ACEP in a statement referencing the poll. \u201cBut America has severe primary care physician shortages, and many physicians do not accept Medicaid patients, because Medicaid pays so low. When people can\u2019t get appointments with physicians, they will seek care in emergency departments.\u201d\n\nThis Kaiser Health News article focuses on the bottom line: coverage does not equal access. Continued crowding and even increased ER volumes underscores the challenges beyond expanded healthcare coverage under Obamacare, including improving access to primary care and changing the habits of patients accustomed to using the emergency room as a one-stop-shop for medical care.\n\n\u201cLong-term solutions, such as increasing the supply of primary care physicians, will take years to develop and will not solve our immediate and short-term problems,\u201d said Dr. Rosenau. \u201cCongress and President Obama must make it a national priority now to strengthen the emergency care system. ACEP is urging Congress to make a firm commitment to emergency patients by holding a hearing to examine whether additional strains are occurring in the emergency department safety net as a consequence of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\u2014Dr. Jim Palermo, Editor-in-Chief\n\nKAISER HEALTH NEWS \u2014 Experts thought if people bought health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, they would find a private doctor and stop using hospital emergency rooms for their primary care.\n\nWell, more people have health insurance. But they are still crowding into emergency departments across the nation.\n\nAn online study by the American College of Emergency Room Physicians found that nearly half of its members have seen a rise in visits since Jan. 1 when ACA coverage began. A resounding 86 percent of the physicians said they expect that number to continue growing.\n\nIn Philadelphia, emergency room visits were 8 percent higher in June than in November 2013, according to the Delaware Valley Healthcare Council, which collects data from 70 percent of the region\u2019s hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe find that when people don\u2019t have health care, there is a degree of pent-up demand,\u201d said Alex Rosenau, the ER physicians\u2019 group and an ER doctor in Allentown. \u201cPeople finally feel like they can go get medical care once they have some insurance.\u201d\n\nThe spike in emergency room visits isn\u2019t totally surprising. Rosenau said when Massachusetts enacted its own health care reform in 2006, everyone predicted the newly insured would find a private doctor. Instead, emergency departments saw a 3 to 7 percent increase in volume.\n\n\u201cInsurance does not equal access,\u201d said Rosenau, adding that his group believes everyone should have access to care. \u201cThey know when they go to the emergency department, they are going to be seen.\u201d\n\nComplicating the matter is the growing shortage of primary care physicians. People who have never had a private doctor may have trouble finding one. So they continue to rely on emergency rooms.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing some folks who have new insurance but they just can\u2019t get access to primary care,\u201d said Theodore Christopher, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital\u2019s chairman of emergency medicine. \u201cIf you can\u2019t access a primary care doctor, then you are going to go to the emergency room.\u201d\n\nFrom July 2013 through January 2014, Jefferson\u2019s emergency room visits fell 6 percent. But from February through June of this year, visits picked up, increasing 4 percent. Since July, the start of the hospital\u2019s new academic year, business has been brisk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s back to the old days,\u201d said Christopher, an avowed supporter of the ACA. \u201cA lot of emergency department overcrowding, a lot of patients.\u201d At Einstein Medical Center in North Philadelphia, Jack Kelly, the ER\u2019s associate chair, says it\u2019s still too early to tell what impact the law has had on his department. But from conversations with his North Philadelphia patients, he knows many don\u2019t have insurance. \u201cI find that there are still a lot of impoverished people here at Einstein who have not had access to the [ACA] website or who haven\u2019t made the call to sign up,\u201d said Kelly. Those who have gone on healthcare.gov have told Kelly that the price of insurance is out of their reach. \u201cI\u2019ve had numerous patients tell me that,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI think another important question is what is affordable health care and what are people willing to budget for it?\u201d What people can afford is also a \u201cbig concern\u201d for emergency medicine, Rosenau said. People who bought bronze plans because of the low premium payments didn\u2019t always consider the other costs of their plan, such as high deductibles, large co-payments, and other costs. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve made the bronze plan very low-cost and people bought them,\u201d Rosenau said. \u201cBut these are the people who can\u2019t afford the $6,200 deductible and may not have in their lifetime, in their economic status, ever heard of the concept of a deductible.\u201d And because many won\u2019t pay their bills because they can\u2019t, emergency departments, which treat 140 million patients a year, are bracing for the worst. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really seen this yet because it hasn\u2019t played out,\u201d Christopher said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be hard for us to collect those dollars.\u201d In Pennsylvania, the real X factor for emergency departments is what the state is going to do with Medicaid. Gov. Corbett\u2019s Healthy Pennsylvania plan is still awaiting a decision on a waiver from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. If the plan is approved or if Medicaid is expanded, it could introduce as many as 400,000 Pennsylvanians into the health system. Many of those newly insured people may be unable to find a primary care doctor and will likely turn to the hospital emergency department. \u201cThe Medicaid issue is the real issue that might hit us,\u201d Christopher said. \u201cIf expansion passes, we will see a lot more patients in the emergency department.\u201d Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
