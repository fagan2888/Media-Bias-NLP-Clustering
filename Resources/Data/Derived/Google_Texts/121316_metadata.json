It operates the only publicly funded detox center in Snohomish County.\n\nThey take in about 1,000 drug addicts every year; they are mostly low-income on Medicaid, people who wouldn\u2019t have anywhere else to go for help.\n\n\u201cGod I hate this stuff,\u201d said a patient who asked that he be identified only by his first name, Hahn.\n\nHahn is talking about heroin and the agonizing withdrawal he is feeling.\n\n\u201cI am pacing here up and down, you have anxiety, so much pain,\u201d Hahn said.\n\nHis only lifeline is the 24-hour counseling and medical care at Evergreen Manor.\n\nBut there are only 16 beds on any given night so space is limited.\n\n\u201cWe had 30 people call, wanting a bed today, and we have two beds,\u201d Director Linda Grant said.\n\nEvergreen Manor says they are getting less Medicaid money since the Affordable Care Act went into effect.\n\n\u201cIt sounds pretty discouraging,\u201d Grant said.\n\nIf lawmakers don\u2019t approve $250,000 for state detox programs, Evergreen Manor will have to lose all 16 beds and cut many of its outpatient services\n\n\u201cMany programs cannot survive this,\u201d Grant said.\n\nAnd some patients may not survive without the programs.\n\n\u201cThis is about life, it\u2019s life or death for us,\u201d Nicole Hydara said.\n\nHydara says she lost custody of her son because of meth addiction.\n\nWith the help of Evergreen Manor, she kicked the habit and now she has her 3-year-old son back.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of criminal history and since I\u2019ve been in treatment and out of treatment I have not gotten into trouble,\u201d Hydara said.\n\nGrant says her center is helping to keep addicts out of police cruisers.\n\n\u201cWhen a person gets out of recovery, they stop stealing, they stop prostitution, all the things they were doing illegally,\u201d Grant said.\n\nIt\u2019s one more night of staying drug free. For Hahn there is a long road ahead. He says the only thing keeping him away from the needle is this center.\n\n\u201cI probably would be doing drugs,\u201d Hahn said.\n\nGrant says lawmakers got no where on Wednesday and time is running out. This year\u2019s legislative session ends Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "EVERETT -- Several drug detox centers across Washington could be shut down in months if the Legislature does not act.
