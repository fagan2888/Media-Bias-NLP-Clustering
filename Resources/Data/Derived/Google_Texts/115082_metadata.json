People who don't vaccinate by choice tend to cluster. That amplifies their risk.\"\n\nWith the ongoing measles outbreak linked to Disneyland, local schools and districts are fielding parent calls about vaccinations.\n\nIn the first month of this year, 102 people from 14 states were reported to have measles, including one reported Colorado case in El Paso County.\n\nMost of these cases were part of a large, ongoing outbreak linked to Disneyland in California, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The majority of the people who got measles were unvaccinated, according to the CDC.\n\nA recent CDC report also found that Colorado kindergartners had the lowest vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella in the country \u2014 81.7 percent \u2014 in the 2013-14 school year, according to federal data.\n\nOne reason is a high exemption rate, with parents claiming personal views in opposition to immunization programs. Colorado was one of 20 states in 2013 that allowed parents to opt out of shots required for school enrollment because of personal views.\n\nIndira Gujral, communicable disease division manager at Boulder County Public Health, said low vaccination rates are concerning because it means that a population no longer has \"herd\" immunity. The vaccine itself isn't 100 percent effective, while children under a year and those with compromised immune systems aren't vaccinated, she said.\n\n\"It takes an immunized community to protect those who can't be vaccinated,\" she said. \"The vaccine has become a victim of its own success. People have stopped vaccinating because they don't see the disease. What Disneyland has illustrated for us is that measles is still a threat.\"\n\nShe said parents considering vaccination rates in making school decisions should look for rates around 90 percent to 95 percent \u2014 95 percent is the goal for measles, she said, because it's so contagious.\n\nIn local school districts, school health aides generally handle vaccination requirements and exemptions at schools.\n\nIn Boulder Valley, health services director Susan Rowley said health aides work with parents to who haven't turned in paperwork confirming all vaccinations and haven't signed an exemption form. In Boulder Valley, 6 percent of students fall in that \"non-compliant\" category.\n\nIn the 2012-13, Boulder Valley and St. Vrain Valley worked with the Boulder County Public Health to study the effectiveness of school outreach efforts in increasing rates of the DTaP vaccination for whooping cough.\n\nSchool staff members contacted parents of kindergartners who were missing a shot or two in the five-dose series. As a result, the Boulder Valley kindergarten immunization rate for whooping cough increased by 11 percent.\n\nAt Horizons K-8, a Boulder charter school, health aide and principal's assistant Hope Nelson-Roohr said her job includes tracking down paperwork for parents who aren't compliant \u2014 they don't have proof that their children have received all the required shots, but they haven't signed exemption letters.\n\nGenerally, she said, those parents just haven't gotten paperwork to the school yet. For the 30 percent of elementary parents and 35 percent of middle school parents who have signed exemption letters, she said, \"we just accept it and move on.\"\n\n\"It's not a lack of education,\" she said. \"It's a choice that a parent makes.\"\n\nNelson-Roohr, who's been at Horizons since it opened in 1991, said she only remembers one instance some 20 years ago when a student at the school was diagnosed with measles.\n\nIn that case, she said, the school followed the direction of the health department and required unvaccinated students to stay home for a certain number of days.\n\nAt the 15-student Jamestown Elementary, health aide and principal's assistant Beth Brotherton said she encourages parents to get their kids vaccinated, handing out fact sheets in an effort to ease fears.\n\n\"I really encourage it,\" she said.\n\nThough the district numbers show half of the school's students had an exemption from at least one vaccine last school year, she said she didn't think the numbers were accurate. This school year, she said, she only has one student with a personal exemption after a bad reaction to a vaccine.\n\n\"We have done a lot to educate parents,\" she said.\n\nAmy Bounds: 303-473-1341, boundsa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/boundsa", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_27488314/vaccination-rates-vary-by-school-boulder-st-vrain", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27488314:view"}, "startDate": "2015-02-08T21:28:12-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "The percentage of students who opted out of the state's school vaccination requirements based on parents' personal beliefs varies widely among area schools, leading health officials to warn that low vaccination rates can leave schools vulnerable to outbreaks.", "title": "Vaccination rates vary by school in Boulder, St. Vrain, worrying health officials", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_27488314/vaccination-rates-vary-by-school-boulder-st-vrain", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-02-08T21:33:00-0700", "endDate": "2025-02-08T21:28:12-0700", "news_keywords": "Boulder County,Colorado,news,events,weather,breaking news,lifestyles,things to do,", "byline": "By Amy BoundsStaff", "pubDate": "2015-02-08T21:34:27-0700", "sailthru.date": "2015-02-08T21:28:12-0700", "sailthru.title": "Vaccination rates vary by school in Boulder, St. Vrain, worrying health officials", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County News", "description": "The percentage of students who opted out of the state's school vaccination requirements based on parents' personal beliefs varies widely among area schools, leading health officials to warn that low vaccination rates can leave schools vulnerable to outbreaks.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_27488314/vaccination-rates-vary-by-school-boulder-st-vrain", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "The percentage of students who opted out of the state's school vaccination requirements based on parents' personal beliefs varies widely among area schools, leading health officials to warn that low vaccination rates can leave schools vulnerable to outbreaks.", "title": "Vaccination rates vary by school in Boulder, St. Vrain, worrying health officials"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc403\"", "article_summary": "On the high end, two Boulder Valley elementary schools also had half their students exempted from at least one vaccine, according to district records.\nIn local school districts, school health aides generally handle vaccination requirements and exemptions at schools.\nIn the 2012-13, Boulder Valley and St. Vrain Valley worked with the Boulder County Public Health to study the effectiveness of school outreach efforts in increasing rates of the DTaP vaccination for whooping cough.\nIn the neighboring St. Vrain Valley School District, St. Vrain Community Montessori had the highest exemption rate at 31 percent, followed by Lyons Elementary at 19 percent.\nAs a result, the Boulder Valley kindergarten immunization rate for whooping cough increased by 11 percent."}
