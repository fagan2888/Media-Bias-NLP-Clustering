Last one is the best one. Can white Baby Boomers and the leftovers of the Silent Generation make one last great white push to turn the evil tide of LIB'RUL-ISM? Tune in for the next 18 interminably long months to find out!

Kyle D: I loved all BUT the last one. I'm an old white guy who doesn't believe white guys vote the way that cartoon portrays us. But it's not wrong to get us off the couch to defend ourselves either. Don't be cruel about it though.

And STOP calling me a "baby boomer"! I'm from the "least great generation".

Larry Bergan @ 2: I'm an old white guy who doesn't believe white guys vote the way that cartoon portrays us. You (notice I say "you" and conveniently not "we") may not always vote that way. But those who do vote that way are, indeed, a bunch of old white guys.

Sure won't argue with that Brad. There are those who don't care if we know who we really are, as long as they come out alive. I can't live with that. If democracy hurts me, I'll have to live with that. I'll die knowing I didn't work for truth enough, but I worked for it. I'm from "the least great generation". What can I say?
