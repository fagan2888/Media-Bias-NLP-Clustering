Approximately 50 positions have been cut at Syracuse-based POMCO.

According to the company, it initially expanded its staff rapidly to match demand for Health Republic services â€“ a product of Obamacare.

Regulatory agencies recently announced that they were shutting down Health Republic.

POMCO provides health insurance services for other companies.
