In many cases these plans \u2013 sold by Internet-based companies that cater to international students \u2013 provide coverage that is not comprehensive in nature and falls short of the university\u2019s criteria for what counts as adequate health insurance.\n\n\u201cWe have had several incidents where students thought they purchased the plan offered by Cornell, because the marketing indicated it was a plan \u2018for Cornell students,\u2019 \u201d Craig R. McAllister, the director of risk management and insurance for the university, said in an e-mail interview. \u201cIn cases where the plan did not meet university requirements, there was understandable confusion when the \u2018Plan for Cornell Students\u2019 didn\u2019t result in an approved waiver [of the requirement that students enroll in the Cornell student health insurance plan].\u201d Like many institutions, Cornell has a \u201chard waiver\u201d requirement in which students are automatically enrolled in the university-sponsored health plan unless they can prove that they have an alternative plan that meets the university\u2019s minimum criteria.\n\nCornell is not the only place where this issue has come up. \u201cI think we have all seen on our respective campuses international students who have been surprised in an unpleasant way when they seek medical care and they find out they owe sums of money that they didn\u2019t expect to have to pay or that the insurance is not covering them at all or it is covering them at a very low percentage of the cost,\u201d said Anita L. Barkin, director of Carnegie Mellon University Health Services and a past president of the American College Health Association.\n\nShe pointed out that in choosing between insurance plans international students have to learn a whole new language with words and phrases like \u201ccopays\u201d and \u201cdeductibles\u201d and \u201cpreexisting conditions\u201d and \u201cexclusions\u201d and \u201cout-of-pocket maximums\u201d \u2013 a language that can be difficult for American students to interpret, let alone international students, some of whom are coming from countries with socialized health care systems or where the costs of many medical procedures are fractions of what they are in the United States. While a subset of international students come for short, summerlong stints, on the other extreme international graduate students may be coming for five or more years -- and often with families -- increasing the odds of a serious incident occurring.\n\n\u201cWe're concerned that students will look at the bottom line by looking at cost rather than cost-benefit,\u201d Barkin said.\n\nSome of the plans available for international students to purchase online are strikingly cheap. If you\u2019re between the ages of 12 and 24 you can purchase the COMPASS Silver plan from ISO \u2013 Student Health Insurance for $31 a month. With a maximum per-injury or sickness benefit of $150,000 and medical evacuation and repatriation of remains benefits of $60,000 and $50,000 each, the plan is advertised, truthfully, as exceeding the U.S. State Department\u2019s minimum insurance requirements for J visa holders.\n\nHowever, read the plan brochure and you\u2019ll find myriad exclusions and benefit caps. The plan only covers treatment for the first 13 weeks after onset of a given injury or sickness. Childbirth is only covered if conception occurs after the term of coverage begins. There is no coverage for preexisting conditions or for routine care, for injuries sustained from participation in \u201camateur, club, intramural, interscholastic, intercollegiate, professional or semi-professional sports,\u201d nor from injuries resulting from the use of alcohol or drugs, except when prescribed by a physician. There is no coverage for suicide or attempted suicide or intentionally self-inflicted injuries (that last exclusion may vary by state). If you need surgery, the maximum benefit is $3,000. If you need chemotherapy or radiation treatment, the maximum benefit is $1,000. (Keren Ziv, ISO\u2019s CEO, declined to be interviewed for this article.)\n\nBrooke H.M. Stokdyk, an assistant director of Michigan State University\u2019s Office for International Students and Scholars, is also CEO of IE Student Health, a company she founded in 2012 in order to advise student services professionals on how to help international students navigate health care issues. The private market for international student insurance is something of a mixed bag, she said, in that on the one hand companies can offer lower premiums simply because international students have lower health care usage rates. \u201cBut the more I looked into the private market the more I discovered how rife it is with deception and unethical business practices,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing something illegal but they\u2019re really doing something awful.\"\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re preying on the fact that international students don\u2019t know what the cost is of medical care is in the United States,\u201d she said, noting for example, that \"international students have no hope of knowing there\u2019s no surgery you can get for $3,000.\" When international students rack up unexpected bills they\u2019re unable to pay for, they often return home, she said \u2013 forfeiting their chance to complete their degree program and leaving the local hospital to eat the unreimbursed costs of their care.\n\nIn fairness, not all colleges offer health insurance plans of their own \u2013 and some have historically offered pretty flimsy coverage. A number of universities have dropped their plans because it would be impractical to increase the level of benefits to a point that they would conform with the minimum coverage levels set by the Affordable Care Act. The healthcare reform law will raise the overall level of coverage provided by individual plans sold on the private market, but crucially, as far as international student health insurance goes, short-term limited duration plans \u2013 of which the ISO\u2019s COMPASS Silver is one of them \u2013 won\u2019t be subject to those requirements.\n\nSome insurance companies that cater to the international student market are creating ACA-compliant plans, but they exist alongside the lower-benefit plans, Stokdyk said. The same company might offer a comprehensive plan at one price point and another, lower-priced plan that, say, excludes coverage for cancer. \u201cMy primary concern is getting schools to build quality boundaries to help students who are ill-equipped to make decisions in this market \u2013 which is basically all of them,\u201d she said. Starting next year, Stokdyk said that Michigan State plans to prescreen a few private insurance plans and promote them to international students as the only acceptable alternatives to enrolling in the university plan.\n\nPSI is another example of a company that specializes in health insurance plans for students and scholars in the U.S. on non-immigrant visas: you can\u2019t purchase its plans if you\u2019re a U.S. citizen. It advertises its gold, platinum and diamond plans as being ACA-compliant. Its silver plan has a $5,000 maximum for surgery for each injury or sickness with the caveat that \u201cif two or more procedures are performed through the same incision or in immediate succession at the same operative session, the maximum amount paid will not exceed 50 percent of the second procedure and 50 percent of all subsequent procedures.\u201d Among the exclusions are coverage for assistant surgeon fees and coverage for chemotherapy and radiation.\n\n\u201cTheir [international students\u2019] health insurance needs are not the same as American students\u2019,\u201d said Chris Wacker, a regional accounts manager for PSI. \u201cIf they get cancer they\u2019re going to want to go back to their home country. They\u2019re not going to want to be here for that. They\u2019re generally here for two, three, maybe four years, and they don\u2019t have the same health care needs.\u201d\n\nAs is a common practice with companies that market insurance plans directly to international students, PSI prominently features university names on its website. If you select Carnegie Mellon, for example, you\u2019ll get a list of three \u201crecommended plans according to your school's requirement.\u201d It also includes the caveat \u201cCheck with your school before buying PSI coverage\u201d and there is a link to the official Carnegie Mellon student health insurance policy. If you follow that link, you\u2019ll learn that Carnegie Mellon only accepts employer- or government-sponsored plans as alternatives to the university\u2019s plan. Plans purchased on the private market will not meet the university\u2019s hard waiver requirements.\n\n\u201cWe will have to update the portal for that school,\u201d Wacker said, when told of Carnegie Mellon\u2019s requirements by Inside Higher Ed last Wednesday. (Correction: an earlier version of the story said that the portal had not since been updated. Wacker said that the portal for Carnegie Mellon has in fact been updated with the caveat that students should check with their institution before buying the plan; however, it continues to list three PSI plans as being recommended according to Carnegie Mellon's requirements.) \"We\u2019re kind of a demand-driven company. Unless people come to us and say we don\u2019t accept any of these plans, then we just don\u2019t have dozens of agents who are checking the portal for each of these schools. It\u2019s hard to keep everything updated all the time,\u201d he said. He added that sometimes universities run specialized or short-term programs -- outliers, of sorts -- in which participants wouldn\u2019t be eligible for the university insurance plan: \u201cschools can actually need a company like us.\u201d\n\nAsked why the company uses university names in cases in which PSI doesn\u2019t have a relationship with that institution, Wacker made the comparison to \u201ca deli across the street from a main gate of a university that says \u2018XYZ university specials; come and get this special sandwich.' I don\u2019t see the big difference\u2026. I see it as just helpful information.\u201d\n\nWacker said that PSI is fighting for the right of international students to have options in their choice of insurance plans. \u201cTo get the best coverage with every benefit and no exclusions, that\u2019s not necessarily what we\u2019re fighting for.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/09/17/colleges-fear-international-students-are-purchasing-inadequate-health-plans-private", "image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/all/themes/ihecustom/images/facebook_icon_large.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "College officials raise concerns about the private international student health insurance market, where there are plans that exclude coverage for chemotherapy or only pay up to $3,000 for surgery.", "title": "Colleges fear international students are purchasing inadequate health plans on private market"}, "msapplication-config": "/IEconfig.xml", "description": "College officials raise concerns about the private international student health insurance market, where there are plans that exclude coverage for chemotherapy or only pay up to $3,000 for surgery.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "follow, index"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf941\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTheir [international students\u2019] health insurance needs are not the same as American students\u2019,\u201d said Chris Wacker, a regional accounts manager for PSI.\nIn fairness, not all colleges offer health insurance plans of their own \u2013 and some have historically offered pretty flimsy coverage.\nSome of the plans available for international students to purchase online are strikingly cheap.\nWhile a subset of international students come for short, summerlong stints, on the other extreme international graduate students may be coming for five or more years -- and often with families -- increasing the odds of a serious incident occurring.\nI see it as just helpful information.\u201dWacker said that PSI is fighting for the right of international students to have options in their choice of insurance plans."}
