He reportedly outlined a hypothetical situation in which a business employs someone from September to June but denies them health care coverage during their tenure. Francis observed that when the job ends, the worker \u201cmust eat air.\u201d\n\n\"Exploitation of people today is a true slavery,\u201d the pope said, referring to the suffering of workers who aren\u2019t treated fairly. \u201cWe thought that slaves do not exist anymore. They exist. It's true, people don't go to Africa to take them and then sell them in America, no. But it's in our cities.\"\n\nLiving off the blood of the people: This is a mortal sin.\n\n\"Living off the blood of the people: This is a mortal sin,\" he added. \"And it takes much patience, much restitution to convert ourselves from this sin.\u201d\n\nThe pontiff then pretended to be the hypothetical business leader, saying, \u201cI will pay you this much, without vacation time, without health insurance, all under the table \u2014 but I will become rich!\u201d\n\n\u201cMay the Lord make us understand today that simplicity that Jesus tells us in the Gospel today,\u201d Francis said. \u201cA glass of water in the name of Christ is more important than all the wealth accumulated by exploitation of people.\u201d\n\nThe comments are in line with Francis\u2019 longstanding advocacy on behalf of the poor and underprivileged. Francis\u2019 first apostolic exhortation as pope focused on progressive economics and the flight of the impoverished, saying that trickle-down economics has \u201cnever been confirmed by the facts.\u201d And in May 2014, the pontiff called for \u201cthe legitimate redistribution of economic benefits,\u201d arguing that the Bible demands an economic system that cares for the \u201cpoorest and those most excluded.\u201d\n\nFrancis has said less about the specific issue of health care, although he sometimes attaches the issue to concerns about struggling families. Earlier this year, Francis lamented in an exhortation that so many poor families work meager jobs that force them to live without adequate health coverage. Francis\u2019 comments also come just hours after the Archdiocese of Chicago announced it is rolling out a new parental leave policy for 7,000 eligible church employees, offering mother and fathers three months paid leave, plus three more months without pay.\n\nOther aspects of health care have proven to be sources of division for U.S. Catholics, however. In 2010, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops \u2014 which has long supported health care reform \u2014 officially opposed President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act (ACA), citing concerns about the bill\u2019s contraception mandate. But a consortium of American Catholic nuns quickly came out in support of the bill, saying expanded health care coverage is in line with the Catholic Church\u2019s \u201cpro-life\u201d agenda.\n\nFor Francis, however, denying people health care is ultimately an act of greed \u2014 a sin that can permeate many aspects of life. He appeared to condemn the so-called \u201cprosperity gospel\u201d preached by some popular American ministers, dismissing a \"theology of prosperity\u201d by quoting the scripture passage \u201cYou cannot serve God and wealth.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "He said they \"live on the bloodletting of the people they make slaves to work.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "He said they \"live on the bloodletting of the people they make slaves to work.\"", "title": "Pope Francis To Employers Who Don\u2019t Offer Health Care: You Are \u2018True Leeches\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/05/19/3779838/pope-francis-health-care-leeches/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/19110337/AP16139429292118-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He said they \"live on the bloodletting of the people they make slaves to work.\"", "creator": "@jackmjenkins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/19110337/AP16139429292118-321x214.jpg", "title": "Pope Francis To Employers Who Don\u2019t Offer Health Care: You Are \u2018True Leeches\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/19110337/AP16139429292118-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/19110337/AP16139429292118-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-19T11:12:55+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jackiswriting"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "He reportedly outlined a hypothetical situation in which a business employs someone from September to June but denies them health care coverage during their tenure.\nFor Francis, however, denying people health care is ultimately an act of greed \u2014 a sin that can permeate many aspects of life.\nOther aspects of health care have proven to be sources of division for U.S. Catholics, however.\nPope Francis is blasting employers who deny workers health insurance coverage, referring to them as \"true leeches\u201d who \u201clive on the bloodletting of the people they make slaves to work.\"\nEarlier this year, Francis lamented in an exhortation that so many poor families work meager jobs that force them to live without adequate health coverage."}
