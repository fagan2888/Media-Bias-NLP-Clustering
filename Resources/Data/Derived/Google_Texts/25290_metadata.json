Bruce Poliquin \u201ca capable guy\u201d and said he campaigned for the Republican from Maine\u2019s 2nd District when he ran for U.S. Senate in 2012.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Poliquin was among just three House Republicans who voted against the chamber\u2019s 56th attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the health care law reviled by Republicans that President Barack Obama and Democrats have championed.\n\nAdditional Images U.S. Rep.

Still, it burned Sleeper and others like him. To the 57-year-old retiree from Bangor, Poliquin\u2019s vote runs counter to his 2014 campaign slogan: \u201cMore jobs, less debt.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you run on a platform of less debt and then go vote for Obamacare?\u201d Sleeper said. \u201cWe\u2019re the folks who voted for him, and he said he won\u2019t vote for it; and he isn\u2019t in office a few weeks, and he goes and does what he did.\u201d\n\nWhen Poliquin ran for Senate, he said one of the first things he\u2019d do in Washington is \u201crepeal Obamacare.\u201d Repealing and replacing Obamacare was listed as a goal on his website during the 2014 House campaign, but his rhetoric softened a bit. He said he liked certain aspects of the law and he told WCSH that it\u2019s \u201cthe law of the land\u201d and said he\u2019d work to improve it.\n\nPoliquin\u2019s Tuesday vote got national media attention. In a Thursday video on his Facebook page, littered with negative comments, he defended it by saying while people have been \u201churt by the negative impacts\u201d of the law, Republicans must coalesce around an alternative that builds momentum and makes \u201ca way forward\u201d for the 60,000 Mainers with insurance policies under the law.\n\n\u201cA free market alternative that ends the expensive Obamacare mandates will help our small businesses grow and hire more workers,\u201d he said, \u201cand a healthy, growing economy will provide our families with fatter paychecks and more freedom.\u201d\n\nBut his vote has been criticized by libertarian-leaning conservative groups. The Republican Liberty Caucus pulled its 2014 endorsement of Poliquin, saying in a statement that it was \u201cstunned and disappointed\u201d by his vote; while the Campaign for Liberty said Poliquin violated a pledge he had made after answering \u201cyes\u201d to a survey question that asked if he would vote for bills that \u201cwill repeal or defund\u201d the law.\n\nHowever, Brent Littlefield, Poliquin\u2019s political adviser, said the word \u201cwill\u201d in that question is crucial, since the bill Poliquin voted against has no shot at becoming law.\n\n\u201cHis position has not changed,\u201d Littlefield said. \u201cPeople say they are tired of politics as usual in Washington. If they\u2019re tired of politics as usual, they should look towards leaders who don\u2019t just keep trying to do the same thing over and over again and get the same results.\u201d\n\nThe slim chance of passage isn\u2019t lost on Vic Berardelli, a Republican Liberty Caucus board member from Newburgh. But he called Poliquin\u2019s move \u201cpolitically tone-deaf,\u201d since the vote was \u201csymbolic to the base\u201d and is a litmus test for Republicans to show their base that \u201cyou\u2019re still with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes me now not trust him, and it\u2019s hard to give him the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Berardelli said.\n\nSleeper and Berardelli said Poliquin could feel the effect of the vote in the 2016 election, with Berardelli saying \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of anger\u201d in the grass roots. But Lance Dutson, a Republican strategist who has worked for U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, doubted Poliquin\u2019s vote would hurt the congressman.\n\nHe said the groups criticizing Poliquin don\u2019t like moderate Republicans such as Collins, yet they have had \u201czero impact\u201d on her political trajectory. Dutson said Poliquin clearly opposes the health care law and would repeal it if he could, but he \u201cvoted pragmatically on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe good thing about the grass roots is they provide you an army during the election,\u201d Dutson said. \u201cThe bad thing about the grass roots is sometimes they don\u2019t understand the process of governing if someone wins.\u201d\n\nMichael Shepherd \u2014 370-7652\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @mikeshepherdme", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican's backers say his vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act was pragmatic, but it angered activists who helped him win his 2nd District seat in 2014.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "The Republican's backers say his vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act was pragmatic, but it angered activists who helped him win his 2nd District seat in 2014.", "title": "Poliquin's vote on Obamacare sparks anger among Maine's conservative activists - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/365403_gop_convention_maine_jpeg_5.jpg", "height": 721}, "updated_time": "2015-02-06T18:07:55-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/02/06/poliquins-vote-on-obamacare-sparks-anger-among-maines-conservative-activists/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/365403_gop_convention_maine_jpeg_5.jpg", "description": "The Republican's backers say his vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act was pragmatic, but it angered activists who helped him win his 2nd District seat in 2014.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Poliquin's vote on Obamacare sparks anger among Maine's conservative activists - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2015-02-06T17:52:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-06T18:07:55-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb0f5\"", "article_summary": "But Lance Dutson, a Republican strategist who has worked for U.S. Sen.
