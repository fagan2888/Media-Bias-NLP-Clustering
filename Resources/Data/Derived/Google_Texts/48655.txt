Friends and family are rallying behind a young woman recovering from a car crash that nearly killed her.

A fundraiser was held Saturday afternoon help her family with some of the medical expenses.

22 year old Jackie Kuzniar graduated from Rutherford High School, was crowned homecoming queen and was a star volleyball and soccer player.

She earned a scholarship to Gulf Coast State College where she continued to play volleyball.

From there she went to Alcorn state; studying civil engineering with a 4.0 GPA.

However, her life turned upside down September 14th after a car crash left her with a serious brain injury.

now she's in a rehab facility, working with therapists to re-learn basic abilities.

Her father, John Kuzniar, said, "I feel like she's going to come out of this. You know she's moving her arms, she's moving her legs, she's using her vocal cords."

Saturday afternoon's basket-raffle is just one of the many fundraisers for Jackie.

Her dad says the communities support is unbelievable.

"I wasn't planning on coming in town this weekend, but I had to come and say, 'Thank You' to all these wonderful people showing up to show all the wonderful support for her," he said.

Kuzniar is pleased with the turnout, but he says more still needs to be done.

Kuzniar said, "The place that she's at now she needs more stuff than what they provide. There are certain things I gotta go ahead and get for her. The doctors see her strength, her will and her determination to do things they said she wouldn't do."

If you'd like to help, a donation account has been setup at Tyndall federal credit unions under the name, Jackie Kuzniar.
