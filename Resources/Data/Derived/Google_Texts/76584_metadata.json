Marco Rubio, R-Fla., holds up an anti-Trump sign during a rally in Oklahoma City, Monday, Feb. 29, 2016. At rear is former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.\n\nIn the wake of Donald Trump mocking him with a bottle of water last Friday, Marco Rubio decided to engage in some gutter fighting of his own.\n\nDuring a Saturday rally in Roanoke, Virginia \u2014 one of the 12 states involved in today\u2019s Super Tuesday contests \u2014 the usually mild-mannered Rubio deployed a dick joke against Trump.\n\nAfter ridiculing Trump for allegedly using spray tan \u2014 \u201cDonald is not going to make American great, he\u2019s going to make America orange\u201d \u2014 Rubio broke out an insult worthy of a high school playground.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always calling me \u2018little Marco,\u2019 and I\u2019ll admit he\u2019s taller than me \u2014 he\u2019s like 6-2, which is why I don\u2019t understand why his hands are the size of someone who\u2019s 5-2,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd you know what they say about men with small hands\u2026 You can\u2019t trust \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out there\u2019s social science supporting Rubio\u2019s decision to focus on going after Trump\u2019s character instead of the issues. A new Democracy Corps survey of 800 Republican base voters tested a variety of ways to go after Trump, and the most effective ones weren\u2019t those criticizing his controversial policy positions. Instead, as Stanley Greenberg and James Carville write, the most damaging attacks proved to be those \u201ccentered on [Trump\u2019s] character and leadership qualities: that he is an ego-maniac at the expense of the country, that he is disrespectful towards women, and that he cannot be trusted to keep the country safe and handle our nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nPart of the reason for that is because there isn\u2019t much daylight between the Republican candidates and base GOP voters on the core issues \u2014 while there are disagreements with regard to social issues and gun rights, polling indicates they\u2019re almost universally worried about illegal immigration, hostile toward the Affordable Care Act, and don\u2019t believe President Obama respects the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThat is what Donald Trump understands,\u201d a summary of the study, entitled \u201cThe GOP Civil War & Its Opportunities,\u201d says. \u201cThe conventional conservative views on national defense, regulation, markets and taxes just are not that important at the moment\u2026 Immigration is the animating issue that organizes GOP base thinking more than any other.\u201d\n\nLast fall, Jeb Bush, referring to Trump, said, \u201cI don\u2019t see how over the long haul that you can insult your way to the nomination or the president \u2014 certainly not the presidency \u2014 and not the nomination either.\u201d In a similar vein, John Kasich has decried \u201cthe name-calling and what I consider to be childishness\u201d that Rubio and Trump are using against each other.\n\nBut Bush didn\u2019t make it to Super Tuesday, and Kasich\u2019s campaign is barely a blip on the political radar at this point. In short, there\u2019s a good reason why Rubio has switched tactics and now finds himself down in Trump\u2019s gutter making dick jokes.\n\nAs Rubio\u2019s senior adviser Todd Harris told the New York Times, \u201cWe came to the conclusion that if being a part of the circus is the price you have to pay in order for us to ultimately be able to talk about substantive policy, then that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d But that\u2019s the dilemma \u2014 in order to advance to get to a position where he can talk policy during the general election, Rubio has to beat Trump in the GOP primary. But new polling released Tuesday as people head to the polls indicates Rubio isn\u2019t having much success playing Trump\u2019s game.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "In the wake of Trump shaming him last Friday, Marco Rubio decided to engage in some gutter fighting of his own.
