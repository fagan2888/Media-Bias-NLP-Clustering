I\u2019ve been creating Curls since college and have transitioned Curls from being printed in the university newspaper to self-publishing the strip online. Curls is an important presence in comics right now. A lot of what I see are post-apocalyptic stories, zombies, and things telling me to come to the dark side. Now, I\u2019m not saying these creations are bad \u2014 there is truly something for everyone to enjoy and that\u2019s what makes the medium of comics so great. However, all these things are over-saturating the marketplace. Curls is instant happiness \u2014 and the world needs more of that.\n\nI can turn on the news to see or hear about real violence that is really happening to real people. When I look at many comic shelves I see a lot of anger and violence there too. I like to live in a land of endless rainbows and bubble tea, but the world outside my protective bubble is a messed up place. There is a time for realism and a time for fun. I\u2019m here to make comics fun again.\n\nSure, I bet you\u2019re thinking \u2014 that\u2019s cute. Isn\u2019t she cute? This little girl draws comics \u2014 and she\u2019s gonna change the world! Good for her. I get that. A lot. Honestly, I\u2019m a little sick of hearing it because it doesn\u2019t matter what race, sex, or age you are. I have a brain and a body and that allows me to think and draw and have a creative voice. Can you believe it? So now let\u2019s get to the fun part. Everyone loves a good time and most people, even loners, want to have some friends. Do you want to have adventure? Do you want friends?\n\nStep right up \u2014 you\u2019re invited to join the Curls world. The Curls characters have human connections, but they live in their own world where they participate in turtle derby races, wear ice cream cones on their head as a fashion statement, and get fantastic ideas while brushing their teeth (or smell like onions if they don\u2019t). They visually turn into Manga style after sipping bubble tea, get captured by giant fish, and dream of being able to fly. If these ideas sound like a world you\u2019d like to be a part of then take a chance to discover Curls and pledge to the Curls Kickstarter going on right now.\n\nI adore the characters in Curls. At first I used to deny Curls was based on me because she is her own character. That was until Dave Navarro called her \u201ckinda hot\u201d on Twitter. Then I started thinking well, yeah, I guess she is sorta based off me and what I observe! She\u2019s a piece of me. Then there\u2019s Applause and his girlfriend, Surprise. They are both Siamese Fighting Fish \u2014 torn by love and their species, as they should not be in the same bowl together because they will fight! But\u2026 they are in love. Conehead is a bird with an ice cream cone on his head. Turtle Neck has excellent adventures and carries a lot of junk in his trunk\u2026 meaning that he stores lots of stuff in his shell. Pitter Patter is a penguin waiter who helps the gang in troubled situations. He\u2019s the brains of the operation. There\u2019s also Toast of the Town \u2014 a large slice of bread with two punched out holes for eyes and a giant jelly smile.\n\nLaunching this Kickstarter has been one of the best things I\u2019ve done for Curls because it\u2019s allowed the established fans to support this comic strip, but it\u2019s also allowed many new people to find it. The campaign is going well \u2014 we\u2019ve currently reached over 60% of the goal, got selected as a \u201cKickstarter Staff Pick\u201d and are listed in \u201cNew & Noteworthy\u201d projects, but we still have a lot to achieve and I hope you\u2019ll be a part of it.\n\nI\u2019ve been having a great career year. Some of the highlights include being asked to do a Cartoon Network Adventure Time comic cover for BOOM! Studios and more recently I worked with The White House on comics for the Affordable Care Act \u2014 Michele Obama even posted them on Twitter and Instagram last month! Now with Kickstarter my goal is to become fully funded to be able to print all the Curls strips in one book for everyone to enjoy.\n\nMaking people happy is something that makes me happy. I contacted the American Red Cross to start \u201cCartoonists Draw Blood,\u201d a blood drive in DC. People can donate their blood and receive sketches from a group of local cartoonists as a thank you. It a great way to get the community to know us and give back. We\u2019ve done two blood drives and have saved the lives of up to 120 strangers. That is pretty cool and that is the power of cartoons. This year we are doing the blood drive on Halloween, which adds another layer of bloody good fun.\n\nThis is my first Kickstarter and I\u2019ve already learned a ton about crowdfunding and how different it is to network online than at the comic cons I exhibit in-person are. Kickstarter requires social media savvy. Not only that, but the post reminders and promotion come and go so quickly. It\u2019s a bit of a different crowd here on the internet. There\u2019s so much noise and so much wonder and so much discussion on dress colors. Sometimes I wonder if I\u2019m contributing to the sound, but I\u2019d like to think Curls is an original voice within the noise.\n\nSince the project is not funded yet, I think about failure and how much energy and lost nights I give to comics and how it will all be for nothing if we aren\u2019t successful. Then I look into the light and I think about how much I love being a cartoonist and how I would still create forever, no matter what. I\u2019m a lifer. We have 18 days to go. I have hope that we can do it together! I\u2019m excited that some of my heroes in the comics industry have posted or retweeted news about the Kickstarter (Raina Telgemeier, Brad Guigar, Jimmy Palmiotti, Kenneth Rocafort, Dean Haspiel, and Elizabeth Watasin to name a few). Now if I could only get Michelle Obama to Instagram again!\n\nI hope you can join me in supporting the Curls Kickstarter and we can make the book to come to life. As a special offer to readers of Bleeding Cool, if you pledge and send me an email at info@curls-studio.com or tweet @CarolynBelefski telling me you pledged, I\u2019ll send you a special print in addition to the rewards you select to receive. Let\u2019s make comics fun again!\n\nYou can reach out to me on CarolynBelefski.com, Curls, Twitter, or Instagram. I hope to meet you on tour this year as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carolyn Belefski writes for Bleeding Cool: Curls is a comic strip I write and draw featuring a gal named Curls who dreams of adventurous situations that co", "og": {"site_name": "Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movie, TV News", "description": "Carolyn Belefski writes for Bleeding Cool: Curls is a comic strip I write and draw featuring a gal named Curls who dreams of adventurous situations that co", "title": "Curls is Here to Make Comics Fun Again! - Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movie, TV News", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.bleedingcool.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2013-03-25-curls_bestofthe90s.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-09T13:38:59+00:00", "url": "http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/03/08/curls-make-comics-fun/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movie, TV News", "description": "Carolyn Belefski writes for Bleeding Cool: Curls is a comic strip I write and draw featuring a gal named Curls who dreams of adventurous situations that co", "title": "Curls is Here to Make Comics Fun Again! - Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movie, TV News", "image": "http://cdn.bleedingcool.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2013-03-25-curls_bestofthe90s.jpg", "creator": "@bleedingcool", "site": "@bleedingcool", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "fb": {"admins": 100000448608664}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.bleedingcool.net/wp-content/themes/bleeding-cool-theme-hub-async/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "google-site-verification": "xC4QJeYDnVm58lbkOY8Dc1DRQOLe0l7UTTDF5kl90fA", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bleedingcoolnews", "published_time": "2015-03-08T14:00:00+00:00", "author": "Mark Seifert", "section": "Comics", "modified_time": "2015-03-09T13:38:59+00:00", "tag": "kickstarter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "carolyn belefski, comics, curls, entertainment, kickstarter, film"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb409\"", "article_summary": "I hope you can join me in supporting the Curls Kickstarter and we can make the book to come to life.\nStep right up \u2014 you\u2019re invited to join the Curls world.\nSometimes I wonder if I\u2019m contributing to the sound, but I\u2019d like to think Curls is an original voice within the noise.\nWhen I look at many comic shelves I see a lot of anger and violence there too.\nI contacted the American Red Cross to start \u201cCartoonists Draw Blood,\u201d a blood drive in DC."}
