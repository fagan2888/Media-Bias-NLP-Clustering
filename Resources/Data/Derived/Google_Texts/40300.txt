Sioux Falls, SD

Local film group Cinema Falls will be screening an exposé on rape culture on college campuses.

Directed and produced by an Oscar-nominated team, the film The Hunting Ground will feature first-person testimonies from victims, offenders, and other experts on the subject. The film aims to shed light on the issues behind rape culture in college, from victim-blaming to institutional cover-ups.

The screening will take place Sunday, March 22 at West Mall 7. Doors will open at 5:30 p.m., and the film will begin at 6:00 p.m.

Cinema Falls and Augustana College in Sioux Falls are also planning on teaming up to screen the film on their campus at a later date.

The Hunting Ground is rated PG-13, although subject matter is suited to more adult audiences. Tickets can be purchased on their website or at the doors as long as supplies last.
