MIAMI - For the second time in as many weeks, first lady Michelle Obama will make a stop in South Florida this week.

Obama will visit a health center in Miami on Wednesday afternoon to highlight the work of hospitals and what they're doing to educate their patients about the Affordable Care Act and how they can get insurance.

The first lady was just in Miami last week, promoting her "let's move" campaign to fight childhood obesity.

A new study shows Obama continues to be more popular than her husband, President Barack Obama.

According to the latest Gallup poll, 66 percent of people favored Michelle Obama, while the president received 52 percent of the votes.
