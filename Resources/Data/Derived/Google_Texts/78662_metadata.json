It\u2019s not just the Kentucky senator complaining about folks at MSNBC [Rachel Maddow et al.] who \u201cmisrepresent\u201d his past viewpoint opposing the Civil Rights Act by replaying videotape of him refusing to support it. It\u2019s a malady affecting the GOP as a whole as its racial incoherence reaches a new high.\n\nOn the one hand, there\u2019s Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, blasting Democrats for waging a \u201cwar on whites\u201d\u2014it\u2019s only Republicans who are \u201cbeyond race,\u201d as he made plain in a follow-up interview.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Maryland GOP, which has its hands full with a wealthy, self-funded county council candidate, Michael Peroutka, who\u2019s a past leader of the League of the South, a group that thinks the wrong side won the Civil War, and whose president, Michael Hill, recently openly fantasized about creating their own three- to five-man death squads. The squads\u2019 \u201cprimary targets will not be enemy soldiers; instead, they will be political leaders, members of the hostile media, cultural icons, bureaucrats, and other of the managerial elite.\u201d There\u2019s even a videotape of Peroutka leading a meeting of the League of the South in singing \u201cthe national anthem,\u201d as he introduced it\u2014yes, \u201cDixie.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just that state and local GOP leaders have had to struggle with themselves over whether to support Peroutka\u2019s candidacy, as he has refused to disavow the League of the South or its belief in secession. Deepening the incoherence even further, Peroutka himself uses exactly the same sort of rhetoric that Brooks uses\u2014he\u2019s not the racist, he explains, the Democrats are! They\u2019re the real haters, the real dividers of America\u2014despite the fact that Michael Hill, founder and president of the League of the South recently wrote:\n\nIt is clear, then, that God intended men to live separately with their own languages, kith and kin, and nations. Therefore, nations (i.e. peoples) have a Biblical mandate to exist and thereby to protect their interests from those who would destroy them either by war or more subtle means. Because of a resurgence of godless multiculturalism and universalism (the new Tower of Babel), white Western Christians are threatened with extinction as a separate and identifiable people because of their own weakness and lack of Biblical understanding about the God-ordained principles of nationhood. While all other \u201cnations\u201d (i.e. groups based on race and ethnicity and \u201cblood and soil\u201d) are encouraged to preserve themselves and their cultures, white Christians in the West (the descendants of Japheth) are told that we must give up everything we have in order to placate those different from ourselves and who bear some alleged grievance toward us (i.e. slavery, \u201cracism,\u201d hatred, etc.)\n\nThis is not just the language of racism\u2014a broad, often nebulous term. It\u2019s the language of theocratic white nationalism\u2013which is a great deal more specific. It\u2019s surely not the case that every Republican is a secret white supremacist \u00e0 la Michael Hill\u2014far from it. There\u2019s a very good reason that even Michael Peroutka didn\u2019t want to talk much about the League of the South in a recent \u201ccome clean\u201d press conference he called. He told insistent questioners to go look at their website and see for themselves, rather than say anything himself. Yet, it is true that strikingly similar arguments are made by Republicans of all different stripes\u2014including those in the League of the South\u2014absolving themselves of any racial animus and shifting blame to everyone else instead. And those same arguments persist right alongside recurrent racist incidents.\n\nThat\u2019s why Rand Paul\u2019s racial incoherence is not just the image problem of one leading presidential contender, it\u2019s why Mo Brooks is not just an isolated congressperson, and why Michael Peroutka is not just an obscure local candidate. They are all actors in a much broader drama which they nonetheless help to vividly illuminate. So there\u2019s value to be had in considering each of these figures in turn.\n\nFirst to Rand Paul, who\u2019s been getting a lot of attention lately for changing his positions and then lying about them\u2014most notably\u2014but not exclusively\u2014about his position on the Civil Rights Act, which he now says he supports unequivocally\u2026and always has, despite the aforementioned videotaped evidence to the contrary. He\u2019s even gone so far as calling the folks at MSNBC \u201chaters\u201d because they won\u2019t play along with his \u201cI have always been perfect\u201d charade.\n\nPaul epitomizes the white conservative majority of today\u2019s GOP: On the one hand, he clings to an ideology of moral superiority\u2014in Paul\u2019s case, based on his libertarian ideology; one the other hand, other people can clearly see the racial subtext to what he\u2019s doing, even if he cannot\u2014and that makes him really, really angry, not to mention unelectable at the presidential level.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s continued dependence on Nixon\u2019s racist Southern Strategy is an inescapable fact of life\u2014even affirmed by insiders like Lee Atwater\u2014although sophisticates like RealClearPolitics senior analyst Sean Trende have tried to argue that the South\u2019s shift is driven by economics, not race. However, a 2005 paper by Nicholas Valentino and David Sears showed the opposite. Using the gold standard of U.S. public opinion research\u2014the National Elections Survey and the General Social Survey\u2014it found that \u201cwhites residing in the old Confederacy continue to display more racial antagonism and ideological conservatism than non-Southern whites. Racial conservatism has become linked more closely to presidential voting and party identification over time in the white South,\u201d the exact opposite of what Trende claims.\n\nAmerica\u2019s overt anti-racist consensus is so powerful, however, that Republicans simply can\u2019t handle that truth, which is why they\u2019ve developed elaborate conceptual workarounds that allow them to pretend that they\u2019re the real anti-racists, no matter what. As civil rights historian Taylor Branch explained last year, just before the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, George Wallace pioneered this evasion within months of the March, which so thoroughly discredited his former segregationist stand:\n\nBy the end of 1963, with segregation losing its stable respectability, he [Wallace] dropped the word altogether from a fresh stump speech denouncing \u201cbig government\u201d by \u201cpointy-headed bureaucrats,\u201d tyrannical judges, and \u201ctax, tax, spend, spend\u201d legislators. He spurned racial discourse, calling it favoritism, and insisted with aplomb that he had never denigrated any person or group in his fight for local control.\n\nSo, there\u2019s absolutely nothing new about post-segregation-era racists claiming not to hate or denigrate anyone else. In fact, it\u2019s pretty much what they teach you on day one of Racism 101.\n\nMore than that, however, there\u2019s a clear connection between economic conservatism and opposition to black political power. The year after the March on Washington, pioneer pollsters Lloyd Free and Hadley Cantril conducted surveys that were the basis for their 1967 book, \u201cThe Political Beliefs of Americans: A Study of Public Opinion.\u201d They found that those opposed to five forms of federal spending were three times as likely as those who supported the spending to think that blacks should have \u201cless influence\u201d in politics. Since blacks only had five representatives in Congress at the time\u2014just over 1%, compared to 11% of the population\u2014the notion that they had too much influence was ludicrous on its face\u2014and clearly racist. Yet, that\u2019s precisely what 60% of those \u201csmall government conservatives\u201d\u2014people like Rand Paul and the Tea Partiers\u2014believed. But Paul is only the starting point for Republican\u2019s racial incoherence.\n\nMo Brooks is not exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer. A local publication\u2019s collection of his \u201cgreatest hits\u201d of rabid rhetoric reads more like a string of b-sides, and his global warming trollery is decidedly second-rate. But his \u201cwar on whites\u201d charge just magically broke through\u2014and for good reason. Brooks\u2019 claim that Democrats were fomenting a \u201cwar on whites\u201d can be read as a perfect illustration of Corey Robin\u2019s thesis in \u201cThe Reactionary Mind,\u201d that \u201call rightwing ideologies, from the eighteenth century through today, are historical improvisations on a theme: the felt experience of having power, seeing it threatened, and trying to win it back.\u201d [Emphasis added]\n\nToday\u2019s conservatives are particularly keen on feeling the felt experience. They all want to impeach Obama\u2014but no one\u2019s really sure what for. There\u2019s just this felt experience that he deserves it somehow\u2014a felt experience that him being in the White House steals something essential from them\u2014the \u201creal Americans.\u201d What\u2019s more, they also somewhat know that impeachment is a bad idea, which will only further erode their power\u2014though some feel this much more keenly than others. The combination of those two conflicting feelings\u2014both concerned with the loss of power\u2014perfectly captures where Mo Brooks was coming from. After his initial remarks, Brooks elaborated further, as Paul Gattis of AL.com reported:\n\nBrooks said the tactic to repeatedly invoke race goes beyond the national debate on immigration issues. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThe Democrats do it on a regular basis and you can see it in the campaign appeals that they make based on skin color. I don\u2019t know of a single Republican who has made an appeal for votes based on skin color. I don\u2019t know of one. The Democrats routinely make appeals based on race and they get away with it.\u201d\n\nThat, my friends, is what felt experience looks like. Not the felt experience of black Republican Colin Powell, who has spoken of \u201ca dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the party\u201d\u2013but the felt experience of \u201creal Americans,\u201d if you catch my drift. As Brooks would have it, it must have been Barack Obama who accused Sarah Palin of \u201cpalling around with terrorists,\u201d and not the other way around. And it must have been Palin\u2013not Obama\u2014or maybe even Brooks himself who said, \u201cThere\u2019s not a liberal America and a conservative America; there\u2019s the United States of America. There\u2019s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there\u2019s the United States of America\u2026. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.\u201d\n\nThat, my friends, is fact-free felt experience.\n\nWhich brings us to Michael Peroutka, a lower-profile, but far more skilled manipulator than Brooks, who first came to my attention back in February, thanks to author/journalist/researcher Frederick Clarkson, a senior fellow at Political Research Associates, where he published a story, \u201cTwo Neo-Confederate Leaders Join Republican & Democratic Parties to Run for Office.\u201d Both were former members of the Constitution Party, as well as current members of the League of the South, long identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group \u201cthat advocates for a second Southern secession and a society dominated by \u2018European Americans.\u2019\u201d The two were running for positions on the county party\u2019s central committees, as well as for the Anne Arundel County Council. Peroutka, the new Republican, had been the Constitution Party\u2019s 2004 presidential candidate. The other party-switcher, Pastor David Whitney, was Peroutka\u2019s minister, as well as a business partner. By way of background, Clarkson noted:\n\nPeroutka, who has been a regular speaker at League of the South national conferences for years, was elected to their board of directors in 2013, and pledged \u201cresources\u201d to the group. The League\u2019s website currently features photos of billboards in Florida and Georgia simply reading, \u201cSECEDE\u201d\u2026. Although the League says it does not support violence, in the past year Whitney has said that church members should own but not register guns; that citizen militias are a bulwark against governmental tyranny; that secession of the states from the union is valid; that vigilante violence is justified in response to legal abortion; and that the only real law is God\u2019s Law.\n\nIt might seem bizarre that an advocate of Southern secession would claim to be anti-racist, but that\u2019s exactly the line that Peroutka would take, when questioned\u2014showing just how far this feigned posture of wounded innocence can go. The \u201cAmerican View\u201d website, sponsored by Peroutka\u2019s law firm, even contains a 1956 article defending segregation, which begins, \u00e0 la Rand Paul 2010, \u201cWhereas liberty is a prerequisite to happiness, the unrestricted right to discriminate is in turn a prerequisite to liberty,\u201d and goes on to say, \u201cWe see no reason why men should not discriminate on grounds of religion, race, or nationality, if they wish.\u201d Such are Peroutka\u2019s anti-racist bona fides.\n\nClarkson wrote several follow-up pieces on these races, and was joined by Jonathan Hutson\u2013whose wife, Betsy Bury, was running against Whitney for a seat on the Democratic Party County Committee\u2014who wrote pieces for Talk2action.org, the group blog on religion, politics and culture that Frederickson co-founded, as well as for Huffington Post. Adele Stan of RH Reality Check wrote an early, detailed story about the race, but the local political press was slow to catch on. The only major media notice came just days before the election, when the the Baltimore Sun explored some of Peroutka and Whitney\u2019s views, along with those of the League of the South, but it was muddled by the conventions of he said/she said journalism.\n\nIn late June, Peroutka won\u2014by a whisker\u2014Whitney did not. \u201cPeroutka won his party primary, with denialism on the part of the media and the political community as his greatest ally,\u201d Clarkson told Salon. \u201cThe Capital Gazette newspaper rather belatedly warned voters to go to the websites of Peroutka\u2019s The American View and the League of the South and see for themselves what he is about\u2013but it seems unlikely that very many did so. We have a political culture based on a willing suspension of disbelief, to borrow from Matthew Arnold. This allows us to enter into a semi-imaginary world in which we can kid ourselves that there are no threats to political business as usual. Peroutka and his ilk know better and they are not kidding.\u201d\n\nHutson expressed a complementary view, focused on Peroutka\u2019s performance of normalcy. \u201cWielding his wealth (garnered as a hard-nosed debt collector), presidential campaign experience, and a jovial, avuncular demeanor, Peroutka lends a veneer of sophistication to a regional, neo-Confederate network that aims to build a new Southern, Christian nation of the white folks, by the white folks, and for the white folks,\u201d Hutson said.\n\nAfter Peroutka\u2019s victory was assured in a recount, he emailed Hill, who posted the following on the League of the South\u2019s website:\n\nThe League office received the following e-mail today. This means that after a vote recount, our Southern Nationalist candidate won the primary election! Dr. Hill: I am happy to report that after all votes were counted, we were ahead by 38 votes\u2026 They will come after me in the general election in November. Not only locally, but also from across the country. There are many, as you well know, who hate the idea of Godly, constitutional government. I ask you to ask the membership for prayers and for whatever financial support they can muster\u2026.\n\nTypically, Peroutka was reaching out to a national network of theocratic white nationalists for support, but would later insist to questioning reporters that that network and those views had nothing to do with the election\u2014and any questions about them were just distractions cooked up by his opponents.\n\nAfter the election, Clarkson reported further on Peroutka\u2019s theocratic views:\n\nThe day after the primary, Peroutka issued a pronouncement that is likely to make his fellow Republicans, to say the very least, uneasy. In his regular broadcast of \u201cThe American View,\u201d he suggested that all of the laws of the state of Maryland may be invalid, because the state legislature is an invalid body of government for having considered initiatives that, in his view, \u201cviolate God\u2019s Law.\u201d \u201cFor the past few years,\u201d Peroutka declared, \u201cthe behavior of the legislature in my home state of Maryland raises the question whether the people of Maryland may be justified in reaching the conclusion that what we call our \u2018General Assembly\u2019 is no longer a valid legislative body. And if the case can be made that the legislature of Maryland or of your state is not a valid body, then, it follows that no validity should be given to any of its enactments.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stephen Colbert isn't the only one who thinks we're beyond race.
