On Dec. 18 Roseville's Cirby Elementary School partnered with Hillside Church to transform a Cirby classroom into a Holiday Toy Store for the school's less fortunate families. According to representative Allyson Wyles, more than 75 percent of the school’s students are on a free or reduced lunch program. The school’s teachers and staff, along with volunteers from Hillside, helped families choose age-appropriate gifts and wrap presents.
