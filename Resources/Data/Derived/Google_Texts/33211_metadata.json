The amazing, new shapeable bends that stick and stay, then pull away for endless play!\" the Bunchems ad said.\n\nThe problem is the Bunchems didn't want to pull away from 4-year-old Mayson's hair.\n\n\"It hurt a little bit,\" Mayson said.\n\n\"It seemed like it was never going to end. Some of them seemed like I was going to have to cut a chunk of her hair out,\" Mayson's mother Jaquel Calaustero told KERO.\n\nAnd Bunchems must be aware of the hair issue; it posted a removal video on its YouTube page in August.\n\nBut Mayson's family told Newsy's partners at KERO they tried what the company suggested and were even desperate enough to try WD-40.\n\n\"I could not believe after reading everything that that toy is still being sold without anymore consumer protection notification,\" said Vince Calaustero, Mayson's grandfather.\n\n\"The family eventually resorting to splitting the balls in half with wire cutters to get them out. Mayson lost a lot of hair during the process,\" the KERO reporter said.\n\nForty-two percent of people gave the product a one-star rating on Amazon.com, many complaining it got stuck in their kids' hair. There are quite a few pictures of Bunchems balls tangled in knotted messes. One reviewer called the product \"A Toy Spawned From the Darkest Depths of Hell.\"\n\nOn the Bunchems support page, it says the toy is meant to adhere to other Bunchems \u2014 not your hair. And the box says it, too.\n\nBut you try telling kids not to make a crown and put it on their heads.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Parents haven't been forgiving when a soft building toy called Bunchems gets tangled in their kids' locks, leading to a few early haircuts.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Parents haven't been forgiving when a soft building toy called Bunchems gets tangled in their kids' locks, leading to a few early haircuts.", "title": "Squishy Lego-Like Toy Gets Stuck In Kids' Hair, And Parents Are Mad", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/squishy-lego-like-toy-gets-stuck-in-kids-hair-and-parents-are-mad/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1451321772.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Parents haven't been forgiving when a soft building toy called Bunchems gets tangled in their kids' locks, leading to a few early haircuts.", "title": "Squishy Lego-Like Toy Gets Stuck In Kids' Hair, And Parents Are Mad", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/squishy-lego-like-toy-gets-stuck-in-kids-hair-and-parents-are-mad/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1451321772.png", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=1wbGJzeTpaZ-WNItL3tEnAEKe4bRpHng&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://55307", "iphone": "newsy://55307", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://55307", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "newsy,newsy trending,bunchems,bunchems stuck in hair,kids toy stuck in hair,how to get bunchems out of hair,bunchems stuck in hair how to get out,weird news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1451321772.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Parents haven't been forgiving when a soft building toy called Bunchems gets tangled in their kids' locks, leading to a few early haircuts.\nA toy called Bunchems \u2014 which is comparable to flexible, squishy Legos \u2014 forced one girl to get a haircut after the product got stuck in her hair.\nForty-two percent of people gave the product a one-star rating on Amazon.com, many complaining it got stuck in their kids' hair.\nThe problem is the Bunchems didn't want to pull away from 4-year-old Mayson's hair.\nOn the Bunchems support page, it says the toy is meant to adhere to other Bunchems \u2014 not your hair."}
