According to the NCAA, the college expressed concern over a grade change during the 2011-12 season.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, the college questioned the timing and impact on student-athlete 7\u2019s eligibility,\u201d the NCAA reported, referring to former defensive standout Fab Melo. \u201cThe college also expressed concern that over a year had passed since student-athlete 7 completed the course.\u201d\n\nAfter a probe that covered 12 years and took eight years to complete, the NCAA cited Syracuse for \u201ca lack of institutional control,\u201d also finding it guilty of improper benefits and failure to enforce its drug policy.\n\nAvoiding suspension despite flunking tests for recreational drugs and being paid for \u201cvolunteer work\u201d at the local YMCA are legitimate violations.\n\nBut they\u2019re essentially misdemeanors compared to grade-fixing, which unlike other no-nos makes a farce of higher education\u2019s mission.\n\nNo matter what student-athletes do in dorm rooms or off campus, there can\u2019t be a separation of state, a wall between the classroom and the court or field. Universities must demand a level of academic integrity if they want both aspects in \u201ccollege sports\u201d to be taken seriously.\n\nBoosters, agents, drug dealers, car salesmen, memorabilia collectors, hangers-on and even coaches don\u2019t have the vested interest that faculty members should have in ensuring and assessing student-athlete learning. The same goes for administrators \u2014 at least those with offices away from the sports complex.\n\nBut according to the NCAA and reporting by The Syracuse Post-Standard, athletic director Daryl Gross met with at least seven other employees \u2014 including an assistant provost \u2014 after Melo had been declared ineligible when the second semester began in January 2012. The Orange needed him on the court and the gathering was to discuss alternatives for getting him back in uniform.\n\n\u201cAs the institution acknowledged at the hearing, a meeting like this, aimed at an individual student-athlete\u2019s eligibility options, had previously never occurred at the institution,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt was a conspiracy to commit fraud.\n\nA professor agreed to change a year-old grade if Melo submitted a paper, which ultimately was written by athletic department staffers. Multiple personnel from athletics and academics exerted pressure to have the grade changed quickly before Melo missed another game.\n\nThe director of compliance emailed the executive vice president/chief financial officer and said the vice chancellor would be \u201cvery disappointed\u201d if the request was not approved.\n\nVoices in the College of Arts & Sciences questioned the change right away, but Melo was cleared two days later. The unauthorized assistance came to light during a school investigation after the NCAA questioned the speedy process.\n\nIt was fast, but Boeheim and Gross \u2014 for starters \u2014 should be flushed even quicker.\n\n\u201cI came here in 1962 and I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d the 70-year-old coach told a booster group Sunday, drawing loud applause and a standing ovation.\n\nThe sanctions dropped Boeheim from No. 2 to No. 6 on the all-time wins list with 858, but he\u2019s still on the Mount Rushmore of active coaches alongside Mike Krzyzewski, Roy Williams and Rick Pitino.\n\nYou might notice that the others are in the midst of their own scandals, including a fake-classes scandal at the North Carolina that delves deeper into academic deception.\n\nNo coach is too big to fire, despite appearances and despite the crazy, infamous remark from one college president: \u201cI\u2019m just hoping that [Jim Tressel] doesn\u2019t dismiss me,\u201d Ohio State\u2019s E. Gordon Gee said in 2011 before a sea of lies regarding memorabilia and tattoos led him and the football coach to resign.\n\nFiring Gross isn\u2019t even debatable. And I don\u2019t care what Boeheim knew or when. It\u2019s his job to be informed on a timely basis, not turn a blind eye and hope everything is done within the rules.\n\nBut still, Boeheim is just a coach and his authority shouldn\u2019t extend to the classroom.\n\nUnlike sexual assault victims who fear the consequences of fighting the tide and perhaps sidelining star athletes, speaking up must be part of the job for professors and other academic faculty members when pressured to do wrong.\n\nOtherwise, colleges should make classes, homework and exams optional for athletes and be upfront about it.\n\nThat\u2019s about the only possible only shock left.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unlike sexual assault victims who fear the consequences of fighting the tide, speaking up must be part of the job for professors and other academic faculty members when pressured by athletic departments to do wrong.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Unlike sexual assault victims who fear the consequences of fighting the tide, speaking up must be part of the job for professors and other academic faculty members when pressured by athletic departments to do wrong.", "title": "SNYDER: Syracuse\u2019s actions underscore an obligation to academic integrity", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/11/snyder-syracuses-improprieties-underscore-universi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/06/acde676079ec020a700f6a706700f0a8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/06/acde676079ec020a700f6a706700f0a8.jpg", "description": "Unlike sexual assault victims who fear the consequences of fighting the tide, speaking up must be part of the job for professors and other academic faculty members when pressured by athletic departmen", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "SNYDER: Syracuse\u2019s actions underscore an obligation to academic"}, "Author": "Deron Snyder", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jim Boeheim, Ncaa, NCAA, Syracuse College Of Arts   Sciences"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f80\"", "article_summary": "The unauthorized assistance came to light during a school investigation after the NCAA questioned the speedy process.\n\u201cSpecifically, the college questioned the timing and impact on student-athlete 7\u2019s eligibility,\u201d the NCAA reported, referring to former defensive standout Fab Melo.\nUniversities must demand a level of academic integrity if they want both aspects in \u201ccollege sports\u201d to be taken seriously.\nAccording to the NCAA, the college expressed concern over a grade change during the 2011-12 season.\nVoices in the College of Arts & Sciences questioned the change right away, but Melo was cleared two days later."}
