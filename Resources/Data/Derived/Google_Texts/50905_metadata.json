The Court\u2019s reasoning may well provide fodder for challenges to the Proposed Guidance if and when it is finalized. We have to wonder whether, like HRSA\u2019s predecessor Omnibus 340B rule of June 2014, the final 340B Guidance never sees the light of day.\n\nHow Did We Get Here?\n\nSince those who don\u2019t learn from their history are doomed to repeat it, a recap of the history of the orphan drug rule is in order.\n\nAs we wrote in July 2013, \u201corphan\u201d drugs, designated as such by the FDA under the Orphan Drug Act, are used to treat specific rare conditions such as ALS or Huntington\u2019s disease. The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for manufacturers of such drugs and, through a specific provision in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Congress exempted orphan drugs from 340B drug discounts.\n\nIn a rule intended to implement the ACA orphan drug exception, HRSA adopted provisions limiting application of the ACA exception to situations where the drug was being used for the rare condition or disease for which it was designated as orphan by the FDA. So, for example, if drug X is designated as orphan for treatment of ALS, but is also FDA-approved to treat anorexia, manufacturers would have to make the drug available to covered entities at 340B discounted prices if the entity intended to dispense the drug to anorexia patients.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) filed a lawsuit to enjoin enforcement of the orphan drug rule, arguing in part that HRSA was not authorized to issue rules interpreting the legislatively adopted orphan drug exception to 340B pricing. In May 2014, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that HRSA lacked regulatory authority to promulgate regulations \u201cinterpreting\u201d the breadth of the statutory orphan drug exception, finding that \u201c(w)here Congress prescribes the form in which an agency may exercise its authority\u2026[the court] cannot elevate the goals of an agency\u2019s action, however reasonable, over that prescribed form.\u201d\n\nAs an immediate result of the court ruling, HRSA took two actions. First, HRSA pulled its promised 340B Omnibus rule, then pending review at OMB, and never issued the rule. Then HRSA reissued its intended orphan drug rule as a statutory interpretation. In response, PhRMA filed a new lawsuit seeking to enjoin any implementation or enforcement of HRSA\u2019s statutory \u201cinterpretation\u201d as beyond its authority. HRSA argued that because the rule was an \u201cinterpretation,\u201d it was not a final agency action subject to challenge. HRSA\u2019s position was that manufacturers had to wait until HRSA actually attempted to enforce the interpretive rule before bringing a challenge to the rule.\n\nIn the meantime, HRSA issued its 340B Proposed Guidance, with the comment period closing at the end of this month.\n\nThe Orphan Drug Ruling\n\nThe sum and substance of the orphan drug ruling is that there is no orphan drug rule.\n\nJudge Contreras was unimpressed with HRSA\u2019s argument that the interpretive rule was not a final agency action subject to challenge. Contreras found that the interpretative rule was in essence an agency pronouncement setting forth its view of the law and imposing duties and obligations on the manufacturers and covered entities in the name of compliance. Thus, the interpretive rule met the criteria for judicial review. And in that review Judge Contreras found that the ACA\u2019s statutory exemption for orphan drugs was plain on its face: the exemption was for drugs designated as orphan, and was not dependent on how the drugs were used. Therefore, the interpretive rule was not consistent with the statute and could not stand.\n\nWhat it Means?\n\nSo the open question we referenced in our earlier post is answered. And the answer clearly has the potential to affect the future of the Proposed Guidance.\n\nThe orphan drug ruling may well impact HRSA\u2019s willingness to proceed on the Proposed Guidance given that a number of the provisions in the Proposed Guidance impose duties in the name of compliance that go beyond statutory requirements, such as the expanded definition of a 340B patient, the audit requirements for Contract Pharmacy arrangements, and mandatory notice of Limited Distribution Agreements. So just like its predecessor, the 2014 Omnibus 340B Rule, HRSA may decide to pull the Proposed Guidance and spare itself the attacks that are sure to come.\n\nIf HRSA does decide to go ahead with the Proposed Guidance, all impacted parties now have a blueprint on how to initiate affirmative litigation to enjoin the Proposed Guidance. Every provision that imposes duties or obligations on a manufacturer, covered entity, or contract pharmacy, not authorized by the 340B statute, can potentially be challenged.\n\nAs previously noted, this year there has been increasing Congressional attention to the 340B Program, with a March 2015 hearing in the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee and requests for Senate hearings. The orphan drug ruling may further fuel congressional interest in a legislative fix to our 340B problems.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If HRSA does decide to go ahead with the Proposed Guidance, all impacted parties now have a blueprint on how to initiate affirmative litigation to enjoin the Proposed Guidance.
