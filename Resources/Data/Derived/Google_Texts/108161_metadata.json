The findings, however unimpressive, actually reflect some improvement.\n\nLakewood\u2019s score of 60 percent in instruction and programs is actually an improvement from the 2010-11 school year, when it received a score of 46 percent, Vespucci said.\n\n\u201cThe District Improvement Plan will be submitted to the Department of Education for review after the Feb. 11, 2015, Board of Education meeting,\u201d Winters said. She provided no further details.\n\nBoard of Education President Ada Gonzalez could not be reached for comment.\n\nIn April, the state appointed a fiscal monitor, Michael Azzara, to Lakewood. The district avoided the grounds for a state takeover. In a district with a state monitor, a takeover is possible if there are scores below 50 percent in the four categories besides fiscal management, according to state documents.\n\nThe state conducts the test every three years, Vespucci said.\n\nLakewood\u2019s 2013-14 results are down from the 2010-11 school year in several categories: the district previously received a 88 percent score in fiscal management and a 67 percent score in governance, Vespucci said.\n\nThe district\u2019s performance in the QSAC examination is expected to be reviewed during the Board of Education\u2019s meeting at 7:30 p.m. today at Lakewood High School, 855 Somerset Ave.\n\nLAKEWOOD SCHOOL DISTRICT\u2019S REPORT CARD\n\n2007-08; 2010-11; 2013-14\n\nInstruction and Programs: 57%, 46%, 60%\n\nFiscal Management: 90%, 88%, 48%\n\nGovernance: 100%, 67%, 44%\n\nOperations: 100%, 88%, 85%\n\nPersonnel: 100%, 77%, 80%\n\n(Passing grade: 80 percent)\n\nSource: state Department of Education\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1IJQEvT", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Lakewood received a passing grade in only two of five categories the state Department of Education considers important indicators for successful school districts.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Lakewood received a passing grade in only two of five categories the state Department of Education considers important indicators for successful school districts.", "title": "Lakewood district gets failing grade", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/education/in-our-schools/2015/01/14/lakewood-school-district-fails/21741013/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lakewood received a passing grade in only two of five categories the state Department of Education considers important indicators for successful school districts.", "title": "Failing grade for Lakewood school district", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ec8c18e19bed100d1e3f2d0ff966c64ff3bb4dc5/c=584-0-2418-1834&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2015/01/14/B9315850958Z.1_20150114083201_000_GVB9LTB8A.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Lakewood school district, fail, fails, Lakewood, Department of Education"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ec3\"", "article_summary": "Buy Photo Lakewood received a passing grade in only two of five evaluation categories as part of an examination by the state Department of Education during the 2013-14 school year.\nLakewood received scores of 85 percent in operations and 80 percent in personnel as part of the evaluation, conducted during the 2013-14 school year, according to the findings.\n(Photo: Thomas P.
