He was a passenger in the vehicle.\n\nAuburn coach Gus Malzahn called Lutzenkirchen \u201ca great player and competitor\u201d and \u201ca great teammate and friend off the field.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a sad day for the entire Auburn family,\u201d Malzahn said Sunday in a statement. \u201cI find peace knowing that even though Philip was taken from us too soon, that he lived his life to the fullest, leaving a lifetime of great memories for his family and friends to cherish forever.\u201d\n\nAuburn athletic director Jay Jacobs said Lutzenkirchen\u2019s death was \u201ca devastating tragedy for his family, the Auburn family and his countless friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had a strong faith, a big heart and a burning desire to help others,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cPhilip was a bright light this world desperately needed, and his death leaves a void that can\u2019t possibly be filled.\u201d\n\nDriver Joseph Ian Davis, 22, was partially ejected from the vehicle and was also killed, investigators said. Authorities said blood was drawn from Davis to determine whether alcohol was a factor in the crash.\n\nTroopers said 22-year-old Elizabeth Craig of Eatonton, Georgia and 20-year-old Christian Case of Dadeville, Alabama were injured.\n\nLutzenkirchen set school records for a tight end with 14 career touchdown catches and seven during the 2011 season. He scored the winning touchdown against Alabama to preserve the national title run in 2010, performing an end zone dance later nicknamed \u201cThe Lutzie.\u201d\n\nHis Auburn career ended early when he opted to undergo hip surgery late in his senior season in 2012.\n\nLutzenkirchen signed as a free agent with the St. Louis Rams but was waived in August 2013. He was a volunteer assistant coach at Saint James School in Montgomery, Alabama and worked at a wealth management company.\n\n\u201cPhilip Lutzenkirchen was what every parent aspires their son to be,\u201d former Auburn coach Gene Chizik said in a statement released through the school. \u201cHe was compassionate, determined, honorable and full of love, integrity and respect. In 27 years of coaching, I have come across what I would consider to be a few \u2018rare\u2019 young men. Phillip was certainly one of those \u2018rare\u2019 ones. He truly lived his life for other people and always found time to give to others.\u201d\n\nOther Auburn players and coaches posted tributes to Lutzenkirchen on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe Auburn Family is broken today with the loss of a great Auburn man and friend (Philip) Lutzenkirchen,\u201d offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee wrote. \u201cCrushed and without words.\u201d\n\nLutzenkirchen\u2019s Auburn teammate Kodi Burns posted: \u201cLutz was a brother to me and my other brothers. I loved him. And I will miss him. One of the greatest men I will ever know. RIP love you man.\u201d\n\nLutzenkirchen was a graduate of Lassiter High School in Marietta, Georgia.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ex-Auburn tight end Philip Lutzenkirchen killed in crash", "title": "Ex-Auburn tight end Philip Lutzenkirchen killed in crash", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/29/ex-auburn-tight-end-philip-lutzenkirchen-killed-in-crash/", "image": {"width": 435, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140629__auburnp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140629__auburnp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-29T15:20:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:43:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd229\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe Auburn Family is broken today with the loss of a great Auburn man and friend (Philip) Lutzenkirchen,\u201d offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee wrote.\nLAGRANGE, Ga. \u2014 Former Auburn tight end Philip Lutzenkirchen, a fan favorite who played on the 2010 national championship team, has died in a one-car crash in Georgia, state police said.\n\u201cPhilip Lutzenkirchen was what every parent aspires their son to be,\u201d former Auburn coach Gene Chizik said in a statement released through the school.\nLutzenkirchen set school records for a tight end with 14 career touchdown catches and seven during the 2011 season.\nAuburn coach Gus Malzahn called Lutzenkirchen \u201ca great player and competitor\u201d and \u201ca great teammate and friend off the field.\u201d\u201cThis is a sad day for the entire Auburn family,\u201d Malzahn said Sunday in a statement."}
