The actual accident along Interstate 40 near Shawnee itself is not being shown, but it does show the split second before and the last few moments of one trooper's life.\n\n\u201cWe got a crash. Semi rollover. One lane is blocked,\u201d Trooper Keith Burch said.\n\nBurch pulled up to the scene of the semi-rollover and got out of his patrol car. He called for a wrecker and then backed up to his vehicle.\n\n\u201cYou'll notice that traffic onto the right is progressing very slowly but very uniform and doing what they're supposed to,\u201d Oklahoma Highway Patrol Lt. John Vincent said.\n\nBut, there was one driver who wasn't.\n\nThe video shows Trooper Nicholas Dees on the right and on the left is Burch when suddenly Burch can be seen jumping to the left, as an out of control car comes flying up behind them.\n\nBurch was able to somewhat leap out of the way, but Dees' back was turned, and there was not enough time for him to see what was coming.\n\nThe next four and half seconds of video have purposely been removed.\n\n\u201cWe've redacted four and a half seconds of it,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cYou see them working the collision. All of a sudden it just stops.\u201d\n\nMoments later, a car driven by Steven Wayne Clark of Cushing crashed into the semi. Trooper Dees died instantly.\n\nClark had an infant in the back seat of his vehicle. Investigators reportedly believe Clark was updating his social media page at the time of the accident.\n\nHe was charged with first degree manslaughter.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Newly released dash camera video shows the moments before and the frantic moments after two Oklahoma Highway Patrol troopers were hit by a distracted driver.", "author": "Joleen Chaney", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/28204945/ohp-lt-comments-on-dash-cam-video-released-in-deadly-accident", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/6840718_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Newly released dash camera video shows the moments before and the frantic moments after two Oklahoma Highway Patrol troopers were hit by a distracted driver.", "title": "OHP Lt.
