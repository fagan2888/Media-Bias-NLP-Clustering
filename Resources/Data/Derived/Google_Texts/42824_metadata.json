Last week, legal counsel at Ice Miller held a seminar to help the agribusiness industry understand the steps they need to take now to prepare. Melissa Proffitt Reese, Agribusiness Chair at Ice Miller, told HAT that business owners may view new hires differently.\n\n\u201cI think the greatest fear in the business community is that this law is going to somehow, and it is in an indirect way, dictate how they use their workers and how many hours they can have their workers work without imposing a penalty as a result of that. And so it\u2019s affecting how employers run their businesses. I think it\u2019s going to affect, at the initial hiring stage, what the expectations are with regard to that individual in terms of their job description and how many hour they\u2019re going to work. I do think because there\u2019s a cost associated with it, employers are going to look at that differently.\u201d\n\nProffitt Reese said one area where agriculture can expect to be most affected is in the hiring of seasonal workers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got very complex rules under this law about how you count full-time employees. And when you have seasonal workers, there\u2019s not the predictability. When you hire a seasonal worker, you don\u2019t know how long you\u2019re going to need them or how many hours for the most part. And these rules mandate a predictability to know how much your exposure is going to be. So it falls very, very hard on industries such as agriculture and retail where you have a lot of seasonal workers.\u201d\n\nWho will see the biggest impact on their business as a result of Healthcare Reform?\n\n\u201cDefinitely employers with 50 or more employees because they\u2019re subject to the \u2018pay or play\u2019 requirements; but it affects every single individual in the United States in terms of whether they have to get health coverage or pay a penalty.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Hoosier Ag Today", "description": "Melissa Proffitt Reese of Ice Miller\u00a0\u00a0A piece of legislation with many layers, the Affordable Care Act is raising questions by employers and employees across", "title": "Agribusinesses Meet to Understand and Plan for Impact of Health Care Reform", "url": "http://www.hoosieragtoday.com/agribusinesses-meet-to-understand-and-plan-for-impact-of-health-care-reform/", "image": "http://www.hoosieragtoday.com//wp-content/uploads//2013/11/proffitt-reese-316x400.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 247496978659781}, "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Cayla McLeland"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccab2\"", "article_summary": "And when you have seasonal workers, there\u2019s not the predictability.\nMelissa Proffitt Reese of Ice MillerA piece of legislation with many layers, the Affordable Care Act is raising questions by employers and employees across the nation.\nMelissa Proffitt Reese, Agribusiness Chair at Ice Miller, told HAT that business owners may view new hires differently.\nLast week, legal counsel at Ice Miller held a seminar to help the agribusiness industry understand the steps they need to take now to prepare.\nWhen you hire a seasonal worker, you don\u2019t know how long you\u2019re going to need them or how many hours for the most part."}
