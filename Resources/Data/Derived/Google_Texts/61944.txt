Egypt has banned Hollywood's big screen biblical epic 'Exodus: Gods and Kings,' a 20th Century Fox spokesman said on Friday.

The studio owned by Twenty-First Century Fox Inc declined to give a reason for the ban, but films that depict biblical figures have been prohibited before in the Muslim country.

Paramount Pictures' Bible tale 'Noah' was banned in several countries in the Middle East this year for its depiction of a prophet, which is forbidden in Islam.

'Exodus' is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Christian Bale as Moses, a Hebrew leading God's enslaved people out of Egypt and the clutches of Ramses, the Egyptian pharoah.

It has come under criticism for casting mostly white actors in the lead roles and some historical anachronisms.

Morrocco has also reportedly banned the film, which has so far grossed $107 million in two weeks in worldwide release.

Despite Box Office success, 'Exodus' has received mixed reviews. Writing for Christian Today, Krish Kandiah, president of London School of Theology, said:

"Should you go and see 'Exodus'? If you are looking for classic Ridley Scott movie along the lines of 'Gladiator' or 'Alien' then sadly, no. 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' is nowhere near as innovative. And if you're hoping for a biblically faithful retelling of the book of Exodus â€“ then again, no. Scott plays fast and loose with the scriptures, making some huge deviations for artistic effect. But, if you want a talking point movie that will make you gasp, think and wonder then this film is a real treat."
