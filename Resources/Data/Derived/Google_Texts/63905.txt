Decrying the Obama administration for using strong-arm, “coercion tactics” in an effort to force his state to expand ObamaCare coverage, Florida Governor Rick Scott says he’s suing the president.

In an interview Thursday night with Fox News’ Kimberly Guilfoyle, the Republican governor of the Sunshine State lashed out at the administration for threatening to cut back funding on an assistance program for low-income families unless Florida officials comply with Washington’s demands. Guilfoyle, substituting for Greta Van Susteren in On the Record, said, “That sounds like extortion.” Gov. Scott replied, “Oh, absolutely.”
