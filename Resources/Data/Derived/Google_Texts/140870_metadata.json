Ted Cruz is a hard man to feel sorry for. A person who inspires approximately zero empathy, his go-to facial expressions on the campaign trail are a smirk and a sneer. The list of people from both his distant and recent past going public to say they unreservedly loathe him grows by the day.\n\nHe is, to put it gently, not a likeable guy. But given the abuse he has suffered at the hands of his ostensible allies over the past two days, it\u2019s almost \u2013 almost \u2013 enough to make you feel sorry for him.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Big Weakness in Iowa \u2013 and What He Plans to Do About It\n\nOn Wednesday, former Kansas senator and Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole became the latest in a long line of GOP stalwarts to publicly attack Cruz, saying that if he were to win the Republican presidential nomination, the result would be \u201ccataclysmic\u201d losses for the GOP not just at the presidential level, but all the way down the ticket in November.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times Wednesday, Dole predicted, \u201cIf he\u2019s the nominee, we\u2019re going to have wholesale losses in Congress and state offices and governors and legislatures.\u201d\n\nDole\u2019s decision to come out against Cruz means that four out of the five Republicans who have been given the party\u2019s presidential nomination in the past 28 years have publicly said they do not support the first-term Texas senator. 2012 nominee Mitt Romney has been more cautious, but even he is not on the record as a Cruz supporter.\n\nBut Dole, who served as Senate Majority Leader, went further than many who have simply expressed their dislike for Cruz, saying that in his view, billionaire and former reality television star Donald Trump would be a better president than the junior senator from Texas.\n\nRelated: Cruz Shares Memories of His Half-Sister Who Died of a Drug Overdose\n\nTrump, at least \u201ccould probably work with Congress,\u201d Dole said, drawing what he apparently viewed as a sharp contrast with Cruz.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to deal with Congress,\u201d Dole told the Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman. \u201cNobody likes him.\u201d\n\nThe unexpected broadside from Dole came just a day after Sarah Palin, the poster child of the anti-establishment Republican right from 2004 and, to a lesser degree, 2008, appeared in Iowa to deliver her endorsement of Trump, rather than Cruz.\n\nAnd hours before, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said, it would be \u201ca big mistake\u201d for Iowa voters to support Cruz in his state\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucus on February 1. (The senator, from oil-rich Texas, has been a vocal opponent of the ethanol subsidies that help keep prices for Iowa\u2019s corn crop inflated.)\n\nRelated: Is It Time for Hillary Clinton to Start Lowering Expectations in New Hampshire?\n\n\u201cI know he's ahead in the polls,\u201d Branstad said. \u201cBut the only poll that counts is the one they take on caucus night and I think that could change between now and then.\u201d\n\nCruz still appears to be besting Trump in Iowa polls, but it now looks as though the Republican Party establishment has decided that, of the two evils available, it prefers Trump to Cruz.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Texas Sen.
