(AP Photo/Paul Vernon)\n\nBy Laura A. Bischoff\n\nColumbus bureau\n\nRepublican presidential candidates Jeb Bush and Bobby Jindal dished up political red meat Friday to 3,600 conservative activists at an Americans for Prosperity summit as billionaire industrialist David Koch watched from a front row seat.\n\nBush and Jindal called for regulatory reform, a federal balanced budget amendment, a repeal of Obamacare and more items on the to-do list pushed by Americans for Prosperity and David Koch and his brother, Charles.\n\nJindal and Bush were the first of five Republican presidential contenders slated to speak at the two-day conference in downtown Columbus.\n\nBush delivered an 18-minute speech that was politely received.\n\n\u201cThe world is a lot more dangerous today than it was the day Barack Obama got elected president,\u201d said Bush, who pledged to strengthen ties with traditional allies and make enemies of America \u201ctwitch.\u201d \u201cThe world has been turned upside down because of the lack of American leadership. I promise you, if I\u2019m elected president of the United States I will restore the traditional role of the United States as a leader for peace and security.\u201d\n\nJindal, meanwhile, delivered hard line rhetoric on immigration.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you something: I am done with the hyphenated Americans,\u201d Jindal said to huge applause. \u201c\u2026We are all Americans, united as one. I think it is reasonable to tell folks if you want to come to our country, come legally, learn English, adopt our values and when you get here, roll up your sleeves and get to work. We have got to insist on assimilation. Make no mistake about it immigration without assimilation \u2014 that\u2019s not immigration. Immigration without assimilation is invasion.\u201d\n\nIn his 26-minute speech, Jindal put himself forth as an experienced executive, more qualified than other GOP candidates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a famous last name, my daddy wasn\u2019t president, I don\u2019t have my own reality TV show, I\u2019m not the best speaker, I\u2019m not the best looking candidate. But I am ready on the first day. The reason that\u2019s important: our next commander in chief will be across the table from Putin, from an ayatollah. He better not need a Teleprompter,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group founded in 2004 by the Koch brothers, advocates against collective bargaining rights, Obamacare, global warming regulations, and increases in the federal minimum wage.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, who expanded Medicaid under Obamacare for 500,000 working poor, was not invited to the summit. But U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Urbana, received an AFP award from David Koch, who said Jordan has a nearly perfect lifetime score on AFP\u2019s report card.\n\nThousands of union members rallied and marched against AFP earlier in the day.\n\n\u201cWe need to stop playing by the rules that have been laid down by corporate CEOs. And we call on the politicians to stop kowtowing to groups like Americans for Prosperity, this includes any politician who is over there talking to Americans for Prosperity today and tomorrow, this includes our Sen. Rob Portman,\u201d said Tim Burga, of the Ohio AFL-CIO, at the rally.\n\nThis week, AFP launched a $1.4 million TV ad campaign in Ohio, criticizing former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland who is running against Portman for U.S. Senate next year. The group also dropped $1.2 million on ads in New Hampshire.\n\nThese August ad buys put Americans for Prosperity \u2014 it expects to spend at least $225 million this year and next \u2014 on early offense in two states that will be important for both the presidential contest and in helping Republicans hold the Senate.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to use their billions to buy control of America\u2019s government and economic system. They\u2019re doing that by buying politicians who are willing to support their agenda, including Rob Portman,\u201d Strickland said. He added that AFP is worried Portman could lose his senate seat. \u201cSo they\u2019re spending their millions to prop him up \u2014 or more accurately, to tear me down.\u201d\n\nInformation from the Associated Press is included in this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Presidential candidates are in Columbus addressing Koch brothers event.
