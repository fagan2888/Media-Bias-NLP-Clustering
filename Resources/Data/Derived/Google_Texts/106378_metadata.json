It is caused due to injury and various diseases such as osteoarthritis, chronic arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, stomach ulcer, fibromyalgia and cancer. It can be classified on the basis of duration as acute pain and chronic pain. Acute pain is sudden onset of pain where as chronic pain persists for long periods. Chronic pain is mainly caused due to aging conditions of bone and joints and nerve damage and injury. Pain is managed by a particular set of drugs to reduce the symptoms or treat pain. Pain process is complex and there are various drugs that provide relief by acting through a variety of physiological mechanism. Opioids are the most prescribed pain medication. These are narcotic pain medications containing natural and synthetic opiates. Opioids are usually used for acute pain, such as short-term pain after surgery. Morphine, Fentanyl, Oxycodone and Codeine are some of the opioids used for pain management.\n\nNorth America dominates the global market for pain management drugs due to large number of aging population and favorable regulatory and healthcare reforms such as the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.
