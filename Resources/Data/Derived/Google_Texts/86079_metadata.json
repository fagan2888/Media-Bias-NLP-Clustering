That claim doesn\u2019t apply to exotic species such as axis deer, which are treated as livestock subject to the rules of the Texas Animal Health Commission, officials say.\n\nThe first report of chronic wasting disease in Texas whitetails prompted state leaders to discuss whether to euthanize all 238 deer at Texas Mountain Ranch for testing, concerned that farm-raised bucks could infect wild deer when released in advance of the fall hunting season.\n\nThe ranch\u2019s owner, Robert Patterson, took the offensive by filing suit July 15 against the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the Texas Animal Health Commission, asking a state district court in Hondo to block the taking of any deer there not exhibiting CWD symptoms and to declare him the rightful owner of breeder deer in his possession.\n\nBut Patterson dropped the lawsuit two days later, and the agencies agreed instead to incrementally test his herd. So far, four of the 43 deer euthanized at Patterson\u2019s ranch have tested positive for CWD.\n\n\u201cWe are still considering additional measures, including more testing,\u201d TPWD spokesman Steve Lightfoot said.\n\nStatewide, the agencies have expanded mandatory testing for CWD in captive-bred deer and are restricting their movements and release sites. Increased testing is also planned on hunter-harvested deer, but it\u2019s voluntary.\n\nThe new rules take effect Monday and are intended to safeguard the state\u2019s estimated 3.9 million wild deer and a deer-hunting industry that contributes an estimated $2.1 billion annually to Texas\u2019 economy.\n\nThe denial of ownership rights to their four-legged inventories has long been a sore point among the state\u2019s 1,300 breeders of native deer, whose state-issued permits merely allow them to raise, transport, buy, sell and release the animals.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of confusion and disagreement in the community about who owns the deer,\u201d said Chase Clark, whose tenure ended last Saturday as president of the Texas Deer Association.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough discrepancy out there in how these animals are treated in both (court) case law and in the permitting process, that it will probably come to a head,\u201d he said.\n\nPatterson\u2019s attorney, John Chunn, wouldn\u2019t detail the legal basis for his client\u2019s claim to own the deer but said the issue is still very much alive, even though the lawsuit was dropped. \u201cThat area of law has really not been well litigated,\u201d he said.\n\nProtecting the public\u2019s faith in the health of hunted deer outweighs concerns about lost profits among deer breeders who entered the business \u201cwith their eyes wide open,\u201d said David Yeates, director the Texas Wildlife Association.\n\n\u201cThe captive breeder permit issued by the state specifically states it is a permit to possess, not a permit to own,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe breeding industry creates a higher-risk profile of disease transmission than native deer by raising them in high-density pens and transporting them around the state.\u201d\n\nBefore the Medina County cases this year, the only other Texas CWD cases involved seven wild mule deer diagnosed since 2012 in far West Texas, officials say.\n\nA form of spongiform encephalopathy similar to mad cow disease, CWD is fatal, believed to be spread through saliva, blood, urine, carcasses and infected plants and soil. The state uses post-mortem tests on the brain stems of deer to diagnose it.\n\nPatterson didn\u2019t mention his lawsuit in a July 27 interview at his ranch, where he hand-fed peanuts to young deer.\n\nHis wife, Susan, who names all their deer, likened the animals to thoroughbred racehorses. The couple put the value of one of the bucks put down for state testing at $50,000.\n\nTests on 174 deer at other sites that did business with Patterson have yielded no CWD cases, Lightfoot said this week.\n\nHe said Patterson\u2019s lawsuit claims were \u201cwithout merit,\u201d and he cited a recent federal court ruling in a separate case as verification of state ownership of captive-raised deer.\n\nIn that case, James and Jimmie Anderton of Quinlan sued TPWD and TAHC officials over the shooting of 71 deer for CWD testing after the Andertons admitted in 2010 to smuggling deer to their ranch from Arkansas.\n\nThe admissions prompted the TPWD not to renew their breeder\u2019s permit and resulted in the father and son serving time in federal prison. A judge dismissed the Andertons\u2019 lawsuit complaints, which included claims they were subject to unconstitutional searches and seizures.\n\nIn upholding that decision in March, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said TPWD officials \u201clawfully entered the Andertons\u2019 property and had the right to kill the deer\u201d since the animals, without a valid permit, were there illegally.\n\nThe deer ownership debate arose in the case, said Steve Griggs, the Andertons\u2019 attorney. \u201cThe stance of the state is that all deer are wildlife and all of the wildlife is owned by the state, but there hasn\u2019t been court finding that captive-bred deer are wildlife,\u201d he said.\n\nThe issue has also surfaced in the Legislature. Rep. Ryan Guillen, D-Rio Grande City, was unsuccessful in pushing for a bill in 2011 that would have made all deer held under a breeder permit or born in a breeder facility the personal property of the breeder.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only a couple of states in the country where they are like Texas and consider that they own captive-bred deer,\u201d said Tim Condict of Deer Breeders Corp., an industry group.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we own the deer because we buy them, sell them, feed them, build pens for them and breed \u2018em,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they are turned out into the wild, they are the state\u2019s animals at that point.\u201d\n\nBut Jenny Sanders of Texans For Saving Our Hunting Heritage said such arguments don\u2019t square with history.\n\n\u201cGoing back to a Supreme Court decision in 1841, we have this idea of the Public Trust Doctrine, where wildlife resources are managed by the state for the people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty well settled.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: San Antonio Express-News, http://www.mysanantonio.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "They're raised in high-fenced pens, named and nurtured from birth by breeders hoping for a big payoff when the deer are sold as quarry for hunters or to propagate elsewhere.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/22/new-texas-deer-rules-pending-over-chronic-wasting-/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "They\u2019re raised in high-fenced pens, named and nurtured from birth by breeders hoping for a big payoff when the deer are sold as quarry for hunters or to propagate elsewhere.", "title": "New Texas deer rules pending over chronic wasting disease"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "They're raised in high-fenced pens, named and nurtured from birth by breeders hoping for a big payoff when the deer are sold as quarry for hunters or to propagate elsewhere.", "card": "summary", "title": "New Texas deer rules pending over chronic wasting disease"}, "Author": "ZEKE MacCORMACK", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of confusion and disagreement in the community about who owns the deer,\u201d said Chase Clark, whose tenure ended last Saturday as president of the Texas Deer Association.\nThe first report of chronic wasting disease in Texas whitetails prompted state leaders to discuss whether to euthanize all 238 deer at Texas Mountain Ranch for testing, concerned that farm-raised bucks could infect wild deer when released in advance of the fall hunting season.\nThe couple put the value of one of the bucks put down for state testing at $50,000.\n\u201cAll wild animals, fur-bearing animals, wild birds and wild fowl inside the borders of this state are the property of the people of this state,\u201d reads the Parks and Wildlife Code.\nStatewide, the agencies have expanded mandatory testing for CWD in captive-bred deer and are restricting their movements and release sites."}
