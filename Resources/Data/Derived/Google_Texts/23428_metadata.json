On top of that, McClanahan said, those customers are getting extra financial help to pay their out-of-pocket health expenses \u2014 the copayments, coinsurance and deductibles that aren't covered by their insurance plan.\n\nThe idea of giving rich people discounted Obamacare plans raises the eyebrows of even McClanahan's clients, who were initially skeptical when she described the option.\n\n\"Everybody was like, 'Are you sure this is going to work?'\" McClanahan said of her clients' reaction.\n\n\"And I'm like, 'Yes, I'm sure it's going to work.'\"\n\nAnd it's legal as well, because of the way the Affordable Care Act focuses on income rather than net worth to establish eligibility for Obamacare aid.\n\n\"The law was set up that way, so I'm going to help them take advantage of it.\"\n\nThe ACA was enacted primarily to help uninsured people get health coverage at a price they could afford. To help do that, the ACA authorized the federal government to issue tax credits, or subsidies, to people with low or moderate incomes who buy health plans sold on government-run Obamacare exchanges.\n\nFor 2016, individuals with annual taxable income between $11,770 and $47,070 qualify for such aid.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Obamacare subsidies are available to people with low or moderate income, and aren't tied to net worth.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Subsidies are available to people with low or moderate income, and aren't tied to net worth.", "title": "These millionaires get Obamacare subsidies", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/27/theyre-millionaires-and-they-get-obamacare-subsidies.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/08/26/102949239-GettyImages-546825883.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Subsidies are available to people with low or moderate income, and aren't tied to net worth.", "title": "They're millionaires, and they get Obamacare subsidies", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/27/theyre-millionaires-and-they-get-obamacare-subsidies.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/08/26/102949239-GettyImages-546825883.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Insurance, Health Care, Obamacare, Health Insurance, Politics, US: News, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-01-27T13:01:52-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Insurance", "modified_time": "2016-01-27T14:29:57-0500", "tag": "US: News"}, "pageNodeId": 103337832, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, health insurance, HealthCare.gov, Affordable Care Act, millionaires"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcaa3\"", "article_summary": "The idea of giving rich people discounted Obamacare plans raises the eyebrows of even McClanahan's clients, who were initially skeptical when she described the option.\nTo help do that, the ACA authorized the federal government to issue tax credits, or subsidies, to people with low or moderate incomes who buy health plans sold on government-run Obamacare exchanges.\n\"The law was set up that way, so I'm going to help them take advantage of it.\"\nThose clients are saving between $4,600 and $8,800 in annual premium payments as a result of subsidies.\nAnd it's legal as well, because of the way the Affordable Care Act focuses on income rather than net worth to establish eligibility for Obamacare aid."}
