Why? Because there are no cost containment features in the Act. None. Nada. Zippo.\n\nWhat that means is that the drug companies can raise the prices of drugs 5000% like Martin Shkreli of Turing Pharmaceuticals did for Daraprim without breaking the law. Shkreli\u2019s arrogance, the latest example of which is calling the Congressmen who interrogated him \u201cimbeciles\u201d, has gotten him into much trouble but not for raising the price of a life-saving drug 5000%.\n\nYou see in America, my friends, screwing unfortunates with heart disease and cancer is not a crime but defrauding investors out of their money is. Your Republican controlled government is not looking out for the little guy. Lobbyists are running the lawmakers. Oh, you don\u2019t have a lobbyist working for you? Then you\u2019re shit out of luck. With the exception of a few good Democrats like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, your interests are not only being ignored. You\u2019re being considered as sheep to be led to slaughter.\n\nRepublican gerrymandering, voter suppression, and the filibuster have guaranteed that only Republican laws will be put into effect, and that means that corporations have the right to screw you but the investor class will be protected. In fact, after the 2008 Wall Street-caused financial meltdown, investors were paid back 100 cents on the dollar (there were no haircuts), and the only rule applying to the little guy was that he had to pay his debts 100 cents on the dollar (there were no writedowns for underwater mortgages).\n\nBut I digress. The company leading the pack in drug price increases is Canada-based Valeant, which lifted list prices by at least 20% some 122 times since the beginning of 2011. Isuprel and Nitropress, the heart drugs Valeant bought from another company, have been staples of medical care for decades. Doctors use Isuprel during procedures in treating heart-rhythm problems, and give Nitropress to emergency patients whose blood pressure has risen to life-threatening levels. Doctors say there are few good alternatives.\n\nValeant Pharmaceuticals Schemed Carefully\n\nValeant Pharmaceuticals has also been in the business of making life-saving drugs for heart disease, AIDS, and cancer unaffordable. Evidence has been brought to light that Valeant Pharmaceuticals carefully pondered how much it could raise the price of heart drugs Isuprel and Nitropress before buying them and then raised the prices overnight by 525% and 212% respectively.\n\nProfit was the only consideration. Blame the lobbyists who cut cost containment out of Obamacare, not Obama.\u201cOur duty is to our shareholders and to maximize the value\u201d of the products that Valeant sells, said Laurie Little, a company spokeswoman.\n\nAscension health system, which operates 131 hospitals across the country, estimates the increases will triple its spending on the drugs this year to $8 million. Ever wonder why health care premiums are so high? Richard Fogel, a heart doctor at Ascension\u2019s St. Vincent Heart Center in Indianapolis, said the lack of good alternatives in certain clinical situations leaves him little choice but to keep using the pair.\n\nCleveland Clinic says the price hikes for the two Valeant drugs is unexpectedly adding $8.6 million, or 7%, to this year\u2019s budget of roughly $122 million for medicines administered at its hospitals. Like its peers, Cleveland Clinic generally pays for drugs it administers, then hopes the reimbursement it receives for patient care will cover the expense.\n\nCompanies are buying established drugs from other companies and then jacking up the prices. Early last year, Mallinckrodt PLC paid $1.4 billion for Cadence Pharmaceuticals, though the Ofirmev pain injections that were the crown jewel of the deal were projected to have just $110.5 million in revenue for 2013, according to a Mallinckrodt conference call with analysts discussing the deal. However, Mallinckrodt had a better idea with regard to pricing.\n\nThree months later, the list price for a package of 24 Ofirmev vials jumped almost 2\u00bd times to $1,019.52. \u201cIt seemed like highway robbery,\u201d said Erin Fox, who directs the drug information service at University of Utah Health Care.\n\nThese price increases can be very lucrative; that, not patient care, is the whole idea. Horizon Pharma PLC upped the price of Vimovo pain tablets after buying the rights from AstraZeneca in late 2013. On Jan. 1, 2014, its first day selling Vimovo, Horizon raised the list price for 60 tablets to $959.04, a 597% increase. Horizon raised the price again onJan. 1 this year to $1,678.32 for the tablets.\n\nPrices were hiked dramatically on a drug used for \u201cswimmer\u2019s ear\u201d \u2013 Cortisporin-TC Otic Suspension. Cortisporin was originally developed by Glaxon Wellcome and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1975. Glaxo sold the rights to the drug to Monarch Pharmaceuticals in 1997. Ten years later it was sold to JHP Pharmaceuticals which was acquired by Par Pharmaceuticals in 2014 which was acquired by Endo International for $8 billion.\n\nA vial used to cost $6. A few years ago Cortosporin was selling for $10. Last year it went for $100. and now it\u2019s $200. This is a product that helps kids recover from ear infections. Heather Lubeski, Endo\u2019s senior director of corporate affairs, said the company is \u201ccommitted to providing top quality products to patients to improve lives.\u201d She believes the product\u2019s pricing is \u201crational and appropriate.\u201d\n\nAfter Price Gouging, Tax Avoidance\n\nEndo moved to Ireland to avoid paying millions of dollars in US business taxes. Endo\u2019s moving to Ireland is part of one of the biggest trends in global mergers and acquisitions. It\u2019s called tax inversion. By moving their headquarters to another country, US companies are able to slash taxes.\n\nNow Pfizer, maker of Viagra and Celebrex, wants to pull the same crap: first price gouge, then move to Ireland to avoid US taxes. Pfizer intends to save $35 billion in taxes by merging with Allergan. A group called Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF) is urging the US government to block the merger which would let Pfizer do a \u201ctax inversion\u201d but keep its offices in New York City where they are now. The group also accuses Pfizer of gouging Americans with frequent and excessive price hikes while benefiting from multiple loopholes and deductions which effectively reduce its global tax rate to 6.4%.\n\n\u201cThis is theft, what Pfizer is doing,\u201d said Frank Clemente of ATF. \u201cThis is a company that is extremely profitable. It\u2019s ripping us off in two ways. It\u2019s dodging taxes and jacking up prices.\u201d\n\nPfizer has raised prices on multiple drugs including Viagra, Celebrex, Lyrica and Zyvox by over 39% from 2013 to 2015 \u2013 23 times the rate of inflation! This year it\u2019s already raised prices on 60 drugs by more than 10%. Like Shkreli of Turing Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer is pleasing its Wall Street overlords and masters by squeezing as much profit as possible out of its products. That\u2019s their only consideration.\n\nShkreli gloated to investors about all the money he and they were going to make on Daraprim while any compassion for the unfortunate people, for whom Daraprim was a life-saving drug, went totally out the window. Here\u2019s what he told his investors: \u201cSo 5000 paying bottles at the new price is $375,000,000 \u2013 almost all of it is profit, and I think we will get three years of that or more. Should be a very handsome investment for all of us. Let\u2019s all cross our fingers that the estimates are accurate.\u201d The unmitigated greed is appalling. Some patients were left with co-pays of $16,000!\n\nCredit Democrat Elijah Cummings for using his position as head of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to bring thousands of pages of documents to light that made it clear that Valeant\u2019s and Turing\u2019s only concerns were how much profit they could make by buying drugs and raising their prices exorbitantly.\n\nBefore buying Isuprel and Nitropress, Valeant hired a consultant to determine by how much the prices for the two drugs could be raised. It was determined that there was \u201cample room\u201d to price gouge unfortunates because previous large increases had not \u201cdampened use.\u201d Lambs being led to slaughter? You bet.\n\nImagine the Powerpoint presentation as the pricing consultant presented to Valeant executives the information that thegoal for 2015 was for $279.3 million in revenue for Isuprel up from $54.5 million in 2014. Similarly, the goal for Nitropress was $245.5 million up from $98.7 million in 2014. The executives probably were immensely satisfied as they high fived each other over \u201caggressive pricing through consultant recommendation.\u201d That quote was actually taken from one of the documents that Cummings was able to obtain.\n\nThe Truth About the Drug Companies\n\nWay back in 2004 Dr. Marcia Angell published a book, The Truth About the Drug Companies \u2013 How they Deceive Us and What to Do About It. During her two decades at The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Marcia Angell had a front-row seat on the appalling spectacle of the pharmaceutical industry. She watched drug companies stray from their original mission of discovering and manufacturing useful drugs and instead become vast marketing machines with unprecedented control over their own fortunes.\n\nInstead of doing research like they say they need their vast profits for, they lobby Congress, produce drugs of dubious value and pay their executives obscene sums. They use TV advertising to convince the American people they need their drugs \u2013 even those that will ultimately cause them harm. They pay competitors not to produce cheap generic drugs. They pay doctors to prescribe their drugs.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the free enterprise system, folks, conceived and dedicated to keeping Americans free to charge you outrageous prices especially if your life depends on their products. They have no mercy whatsoever or concern for their fellow human beings. It\u2019s all about making as much money as possible. As one of the 1% class said, \u201cYou only have to make a fortune once.\u201d Short term profits are what it\u2019s all about, folks.\n\nThis is from the New England Journal of Medicine:\n\nBy Angell\u2019s account, the current slide toward the commercialization and corruption of clinical research coincided with the election of President Ronald Reagan in 1980 and the passage of the Bayh\u2013Dole Act, a new set of laws that permitted and encouraged universities and small businesses to patent discoveries from research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Research paid for by the public to serve the public instantly became a private, and salable, good, one that is producing drug sales of more than $200 billion a year. \u2026\n\nThe same companies also spend heavily to lobby governments. According to Angell, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s U.S. trade association, has \u201cthe largest lobby in Washington,\u201d which in 2002 employed 675 lobbyists (including 26 former members of Congress) at a cost of more than $91 million. [In 2014 the pharmaceutical industry spent $229 million lobbying.] The result has been above-average growth in corporate profits during both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nThe most recent and (at least to observers outside the United States) perplexing lobbying effort caused Congress explicitly to prohibit Medicare from using its huge purchasing power to get lower prices for drugs, thus opening up a dollar pipeline, in the form of higher drug prices, directly from taxpayers to corporate coffers. These changes, along with the cave-in by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997 that permitted direct-to-consumer advertising to bypass mention in their ads of all but the most serious side effects, have further augmented profits. The overall effect has been a corruption not only of science but also of the dissemination of science.\n\nThat was in 2004. It\u2019s even worse today. The bottom line is that the American public is being screwed by Big Pharma in conjunction with Republican lawmakers. It\u2019s not Obama\u2019s fault. He did the best he could. Unfortunately, Obamacare is flawed not due to Obama but due to the fact that he had to make concessions to lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry to get the ACA legislation passed at all. Bernie Sanders wants to take it to the next level \u2013 Medicare for all. Just the elimination of all the paperwork involved in today\u2019s medical industry will save billions of dollars as will the proscription of the legislative provisions which disallow Medicare from negotiating drug prices.\n\nBig Pharma Raised Prices Again in January\n\nDrugmakers didn\u2019t let up on price increases with the start of the new year, demonstrating the industry\u2019s pricing power in the face of mounting criticisms of prescription costs in the U.S. Pfizer, Amgen, Allergan, Horizon Pharma and others have raised U.S. prices for dozens of branded drugs as of January 2016, with many of the increases between 9% and 10%. Some of the increases add thousands of dollars to the cost of already expensive drugs, and come on top of repeated price hikes in recent years.\n\nVanda Pharmaceuticals on Jan 1 raised the price of its new drug Hetlioz, which treats a sleep disorder in blind people, by 10%, to $148,000 a year, a spokeswoman said. Piper Jaffray analysts say the price of the once-daily capsule is now 76% higher than when it was introduced in 2014.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "OB Rag", "description": "Grassroots and Progressive views on local, national and world news", "title": "Americans Are Being Screwed by Drug Companies", "url": "http://obrag.org/?p=104441", "image": "http://obrag.org/facebook.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "b_7pYZR20ATVVjiOa4O5xxyuWXZJR96pNfP5-Vz60kU", "robots": "noodp, noydir", "description": "\u2026 and It\u2019s Not Obamacare\u2019s Fault By John Lawrence You can blame lobbyists from the health insurance and pharmaceutical industry in conjunction with Republican lawmakers who lobbied the Affordable Care Act to death making it in the long run unaffordable"}, "article_summary": "Isuprel and Nitropress, the heart drugs Valeant bought from another company, have been staples of medical care for decades.\nThe company leading the pack in drug price increases is Canada-based Valeant, which lifted list prices by at least 20% some 122 times since the beginning of 2011.\nValeant Pharmaceuticals Schemed CarefullyValeant Pharmaceuticals has also been in the business of making life-saving drugs for heart disease, AIDS, and cancer unaffordable.\nJust the elimination of all the paperwork involved in today\u2019s medical industry will save billions of dollars as will the proscription of the legislative provisions which disallow Medicare from negotiating drug prices.\nThese price increases can be very lucrative; that, not patient care, is the whole idea."}
