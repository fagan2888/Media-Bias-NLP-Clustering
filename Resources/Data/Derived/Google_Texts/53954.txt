Net migration (meaning arrivals of migrants minus emigration of locals) in the European Union shrunk by a dramatic 25% in 2013 compared to the year before, preliminary figures collected by Eurostat and released Thursday showed.

In 2012 net migration in the EU was 882,200 people; last year the figure stood at 653,100. The decrease came despite record numbers of refugees fleeing to Europe last year from conflict in Syria and Africa.

Eurostat couldn’t say whether the cause was fewer migrants arriving in the EU, fewer Europeans emigrating, more migrants returning home, or a combination of these and other factors. The uncertainty arises from the fact that the methodology Eurostat uses subtracts the “natural change” of the population (births minus deaths) from the overall population figure, the remainder being net migration.

The final migration figures for 2013, which will be calculated after emigration and immigration figures have been collected for all EU member states, will be available at the end of 2014, a spokeswoman for Eurostat said.

Two tiny EU countries that share a knack for banking services displayed particularly interesting demographic trends last year.

Luxembourg’s population (estimated this year at 549,700) grew most across the 28-member bloc, by 2.3%. That was propelled by a 0.42% increase in the “natural” population (births minus deaths) and a 1.9% increase in net migration, the biggest in the EU.

The picture in Cyprus (population estimate 858,000, not counting those living in the Turkish-occupied north of the island) was very different. While Cypriots got busy having babies, boosting the natural change by 0.47%, net migration fell 1.39% — the biggest drop across the EU. So, despite the procreative fervor, the Republic of Cyprus’s population shrunk by 0.9%.

We have unpicked some other interesting statistics from the survey:

The highest birth rates were recorded in Ireland (1.5%) and four EU countries with major immigrant populations: France (1.23%); the U.K. (1.22%); Sweden (1.18%) and Luxembourg (1.13%). Higher birth rates are observed in migrant communities in Europe.

Higher birth rates are observed in migrant communities in Europe. In the crisis-hit South of Europe –and in Germany- people were less keen to procreate. The lowest birth rate was recorded in Portugal (0.79%) while Germany, Greece and Italy saw the second-lowest (0.85%).

was recorded in Portugal (0.79%) while Germany, Greece and Italy saw the second-lowest (0.85%). The highest death rates were seen in the bloc’s poorest countries –the sad first going to Bulgaria (1.44%). The lowest death rate seems to confirm the theory that a Mediterranean diet can lead to a very long life: Cyprus recorded the lowest death rate (0.6%).
