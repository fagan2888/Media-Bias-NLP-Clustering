Larry Hogan, center, following a press conference at the Republican Governors Association annual conference Wednesday, Nov. 18, 2015.\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan signed a bill into law Tuesday yielding the most expansive insurance coverage for contraception in the country. By eliminating most co-pays and all prescriptions for birth control, demanding coverage for up to 13 months of birth control at a time, and shedding costs for vasectomies, the law pushes Maryland to the forefront of the national movement to expand contraception access.\n\n\u201cFamily planning is essential for women\u2019s rights and cost is a factor in family planning,\u201d said state Delegate Ariana Kelly, who sponsored the House bill. \u201cThis legislation is going to help eliminate barriers and reduce costs for women and for men.\u201d\n\nUnlike insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which already covers co-pay costs for prescription birth control, the Maryland law also requires state health insurance plans to cover vasectomies, the morning-after pill, and non-generic birth control drugs that may offer less side effects. It\u2019s the first law in the country to demand this kind of expansive coverage from insurers.\n\nDubbed the \u201cContraceptive Equity Act,\u201d the law won\u2019t go into effect into 2018 \u2014 but is already making waves. According to Karen Nelson, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Maryland, \u201cMaryland is on the forefront across the board with this act.\u201d\n\nThough Maryland\u2019s law had bipartisan support in the state, some conservatives argued that contraception isn\u2019t a health care priority, citing their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cThe Catholic Church is not in favor of artificial birth control or in vitro fertilization,\u201d said Republican Sen. Ed Reilly. \u201cBut health insurance is supposed to be designed to treat sickness or illness. Vasectomies and birth control aren\u2019t either. You\u2019re interrupting a normal healthy program that a person goes through.\u201d\n\nOn a national level, the conflict between conservative religious beliefs and women\u2019s access to birth control has been contentious. Religious groups, and even some secular for-profit companies run by religious CEOs, have fought for the right to deny insurance coverage of contraception \u2014 an issue that\u2019s wound its way up to the Supreme Court.\n\nGOP lawmakers in Maryland also argued that the cost of covering contraception will hurt state insurers. But according to Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen, Maryland insurance companies found that the cost to the system would ultimately decrease with the new law in effect.\n\nWhile Maryland\u2019s law remains the most comprehensive in bolstering contraception access, it\u2019s not the first state to begin shedding restrictions. In January, women in Oregon were granted the right to pick up birth control pills at a pharmacy without a prescription from a doctor. California enacted the same law last month. Many others have similar legislation on the table \u2014 but the inching progress is hard to compare to Maryland\u2019s quick leap forward.\n\n\u201cMany other states are implementing piecemeal provisions, but there\u2019s nothing as comprehensive as this act,\u201d said Planned Parenthood\u2019s Nelson.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "It's the first law in the country to demand this kind of coverage from insurers.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "It's the first law in the country to demand this kind of coverage from insurers.", "title": "Maryland Passes The Most Sweeping Birth Control Access Law In The Country", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/05/11/3777251/ma-contraception-insurance-coverage/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/11113943/AP_999297028388-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's the first law in the country to demand this kind of coverage from insurers.", "creator": "@alex_zee", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/11113943/AP_999297028388-321x214.jpg", "title": "Maryland Passes The Most Sweeping Birth Control Access Law In The Country", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/11113943/AP_999297028388-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/11113943/AP_999297028388-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-11T11:42:08+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/alexzielinskireporter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Maryland Passes The Most Sweeping Birth Control Access Law In The Country CREDIT: AP Photo/Chase Stevens Maryland Gov.\n\u201cThe Catholic Church is not in favor of artificial birth control or in vitro fertilization,\u201d said Republican Sen.
