The task force took on the local agency\u2019s clients and continues to maintain the Keene office, with Suzanne Mueller now as full-time case manager.\n\nIt was a move that will serve more people across the state, according to Christine Adamski, bureau chief of infectious diseases at the N.H. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cNumber one, we all want the same thing: We have to make sure they\u2019re getting all the care that they need and that all the services are met,\u201d Adamski said.\n\nLocal client Felton Ray Staton says the medical services he\u2019s now receiving are adequate, but something is missing, he said.\n\nBefore, the organization was \u201clike a family. Susan makes it feel like home. For a person with HIV, you need that feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s corporate; I don\u2019t feel that feeling when I go to the office.\u201d\n\nStaton moved here from New York about 15 years ago. For a time, he was incarcerated at the Cheshire County jail, and that\u2019s when he learned that a former girlfriend had given him HIV, he said.\n\nIt was MacNeil who broke the news to Staton about his HIV. When Staton got out of jail, McNeil became a major presence in his life, pushing him to go to the doctor and urging him to take his medications. She also fought for him when he faced discrimination in the community for having HIV.\n\n\u201cShe saved my life,\u201d Staton said.\n\nWith the transition, MacNeil said she was relieved to know local clients will continue to get necessary medical care and case management without any interruption.\n\nBut those are just some of the services the former organization provided; MacNeil said she wants to ensure that local education about HIV and AIDS continues.\n\nShe\u2019s focusing on keeping that part of AIDS Services for the Monadnock Region alive. Those efforts include the AIDS quilt tour, in which MacNeil and Staton go to area schools and speak to students about the disease.\n\nThis August, while AIDS Services for the Monadnock Region was in the midst of the changes, Staton said he was feeling discouraged.\n\n\u201cIt just brought me down,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to just fade away.\u201d\n\nAnd then Staton received a framed picture of a high school class he had spoken to at Conval Regional in Peterborough. Around the frame, each student wrote messages of thanks. Many told Staton they thought his story was \u201cstrong and powerful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is proof that it matters,\u201d MacNeil said.\n\nThis year, Staton and MacNeil have spoken at Fall Mountain Regional High School, and they will be at Keene High School next week. Keene students are also making an AIDS quilt panel for Bonnie White, a former local client who passed away this summer.\n\nMacNeil is reaching out to other community organizations and stakeholders in search of grant funding to continue the agency. She\u2019s trying to get funding and community partners aligned by March of next year. If she meets that deadline, the agency will continue with a name change and a slightly new role in the community, she said.\n\nIf she can\u2019t make that deadline, \u201cI think we would just have to dissolve,\u201d she said. But she said she\u2019s hopeful the public outreach in the community can continue.\n\n\u201cI feel really good about it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the right framework; it\u2019s good and it\u2019s meaningful work; and it\u2019s important for all of us to lock on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "SentinelSource.com", "description": "GILSUM \u2014 AIDS Services for the Monadnock Region has been a community stalwart for local HIV/AIDS patients for the past 25 years.", "title": "AIDS Services Monadnock persevering through changes", "url": "http://www.sentinelsource.com/news/local/aids-services-monadnock-persevering-through-changes/article_e7886b91-9101-5c5f-9f69-da9afcbf552b.html", "image": {"width": 304, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/sentinelsource.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/dc/fdc64d71-a1c4-5653-80af-f0e96f7f60eb/546fcf44771a6.preview-100.jpg?resize=304%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@sentinelsource", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 195134749461}, "keywords": "local", "google-site-verification": "oOCA50_TAAjdvXwxVnDnOs5yS_kZUqHI6u4prlFHnH4", "news_keywords": "local", "description": "GILSUM \u2014 AIDS Services for the Monadnock Region has been a community stalwart for local HIV/AIDS patients for the past 25 years."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddeb9\"", "article_summary": "This August, while AIDS Services for the Monadnock Region was in the midst of the changes, Staton said he was feeling discouraged.\nGILSUM \u2014 AIDS Services for the Monadnock Region has been a community stalwart for local HIV/AIDS patients for the past 25 years.\nShe\u2019s focusing on keeping that part of AIDS Services for the Monadnock Region alive.\n\u201cWe had been told by the state to expect this would occur.\u201dIn response to the increase, AIDS Services for the Monadnock Region partnered with the Southern New Hampshire AIDS Task Force of Nashua.\nLocal client Felton Ray Staton says the medical services he\u2019s now receiving are adequate, but something is missing, he said."}
