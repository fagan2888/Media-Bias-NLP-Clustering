AFTERNOON: The word has come down from Fort Collins: The Colorado State vs. Utah State game at 5 p.m. is a sellout. Athletic department officials are urging fans to arrive earlier than usual because of the potential backups in entering the stadium.

This is CSU’s first sellout since Oct. 22, 2004. That day, the crowd was 30,108 in the then-30,000-seat stadium. The Rams beat Wyoming 30-7. CSU’s most recent home crowd of 30,000-plus was 30,027 against Boise State on Oct. 15, 2011. Also, CSU said this was only the second advance sellout in school history, after the Sept. 14, 2002 game against Louisville that drew 31,607.

UPDATE: Man, they weren’t kidding. There were pockets of stop and go from Longmont on up, but since Northern Colorado traffic has become Houston North, that wasn’t surprising. I came across Prospect to access the north gate for the press parking … and crawled (if that) from Shields on. And this was over two hours before the game.

I know this is completely useless to anyone who anyone who isn’t coming to the game, but perhaps you’re coming to the game and can read this because someone else is driving OR YOU’RE STOPPED IN TRAFFIC.

See you at the stadium.

THIRD QUARTER: The official crowd count is 32,546.
