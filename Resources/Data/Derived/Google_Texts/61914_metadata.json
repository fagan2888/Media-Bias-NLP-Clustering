Although the decline\u201435 percent in just one year, according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources\u2014did not appear to be affected by the limited hunting of the tribes for sustenance, the Fond du Lac decided, after issuing permits for a maximum of 25 bull moose in ceded territory, to err on the side of caution.\n\n\u201cTheir original decision to hold a hunt was really split among the community members, and this decision was, too. But, yes, the decision is to take this year off and try to see what caused this precipitous decline,\u201d Band Chairwoman Karen Diver told the Duluth News Tribune. \u201cWe\u2019ll review this annually as we see what direction the population is going.\u201d\n\nThe Bois Forte Band of Chippewa and the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa each canceled their respective hunts earlier this month, the latter after the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources threatened them with legal action. State officials had held that a court agreement between Minnesota and the two bands prohibits them from holding a hunt if the state has canceled its hunt, Minnesota Public Radio reported on September 6. The hunt would have occurred in 1854 ceded territory, off-reservation land in which the Bois Forte, Fond du Lac and Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa still have hunting and fishing rights under treaty. The Fond du Lac are not subject to the court agreement.\n\nThe state is on the verge of classifying the majestic animals as threatened or endangered, if their numbers don\u2019t start increasing, the News Tribune said. Earlier this year moose were placed on the state\u2019s list of species of concern, after an aerial survey showed an accelerated decline.\n\nAs recently as 2006, the Department of Natural Resources said, the population had been as high as 8,840. But the January 2013 survey showed that moose had dwindled to 2,760 from 4,230 in 2012.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s moose population has been in decline for years but never at the precipitous rate documented this winter,\u201d said resources department commissioner Tom Landwehr in a media release back in February. \u201cThis is further and definitive evidence the population is not healthy. It reaffirms the conservation community\u2019s need to better understand why this iconic species of the north is disappearing from our state.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Natural Resources will not entertain the idea of a new hunt until the moose population has rebounded, the statement said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three Minnesota tribes have canceled their seasonal moose hunts because of the animals\u2019 dwindling numbers.Three Minnesota tribes have canceled their seasonal moose hunts because of the animals\u2019 dwindling numbers.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/13/minnesota-tribes-cancel-moose-hunt-animals-population-plummets-151276", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/bull_moose-thinkstock.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Minnesota Tribes Cancel Moose Hunt as Animals' Population Plummets"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-09-13T16:15-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Minnesota Tribes Cancel Moose Hunt as Animals' Population Plummets"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/13/minnesota-tribes-cancel-moose-hunt-animals-population-plummets-151276", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Moose, Hunting and Fishing Rights, Hunting, Grand Portage Band of Ojibwe, Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, Bois Forte", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Minnesota Tribes Cancel Moose Hunt as Animals' Population Plummets"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd06f\"", "article_summary": "State officials had held that a court agreement between Minnesota and the two bands prohibits them from holding a hunt if the state has canceled its hunt, Minnesota Public Radio reported on September 6.\nThree Minnesota tribes have canceled their seasonal moose hunts because of the animals\u2019 dwindling numbers.\nAs recently as 2006, the Department of Natural Resources said, the population had been as high as 8,840.\n\u201cThe state\u2019s moose population has been in decline for years but never at the precipitous rate documented this winter,\u201d said resources department commissioner Tom Landwehr in a media release back in February.\nThe latest to do so, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, confirmed on Friday September 13 that they would not hold even a limited hunt this year."}
