Accordingly, people from the same neighborhood or even the same family experience (sometimes, wildly) different outcomes.\n\n\u201cIncome inequality\u201d is an artificial political construction progressives cynically use to confuse personal income and self-worth. \u201cFixing\u201d it is a political stunt, a con.\n\nFor the con to work, liberals must repetitiously employ emotional rhetoric to generate and exploit public envy, so they relentlessly invoke \u201cfairness,\u201d while reserving the right to define what is \u201cfair.\u201d Misrepresenting America\u2019s economy as a zero-sum game fosters envy.\n\nKevin Williamson wrote: \u201cOf the seven deadly sins, envy may not be the wickedest, but it is the most embarrassing. To be possessed by envy is to admit a humiliating personal inadequacy: We do not envy others whose attainments\u2026we think we\u2026might achieve, but those we despair of ever possessing. \u2026Envy is\u2026the small man\u2019s sin.\u201d\n\nAccording to available statistics, by 2011, federal and state governments were already spending $1 trillion per year on means-tested public assistance.\n\nIgnoring assets, current government estimates put the incomes of 50 million Americans at or below the poverty level, so, using older 2011 expenditures, simple math says that annual combined expenditures are at least $20,000 per welfare recipient, or a generous $80,000 for a family of four.\n\nBut the math doesn\u2019t balance.\n\nThe official 2013 poverty level for a family of four was $23,550. $80,000 is 3.4 times the Federal Poverty Guideline.\n\nIf it isn\u2019t spent on poor people, where does the money go?\n\nIt\u2019s spent on eighty ever-growing, permanent federal means-tested benefits bureaucracies, more in the states, having thousands of well-paid positions for political allies, which \u201cadminister\u201d means-tested programs and, through withheld dues, on the unions which represent many bureaucrats.\n\nIn this way, tax money is laundered through unions into the campaigns of politicians who run cons like \u201csolutions\u201d to \u201cincome inequality.\u201d\n\nFrank Fleming observed: \u201c[Politicians expect that] Math will just relent and allow 2 + 2 to equal 5\u2026But Math can\u2019t be ignored and won\u2019t compromise. We can plead and cry\u2026 but this will not move Math. \u2026[Math] will eventually balance its numbers and doesn\u2019t care what it will have to destroy in the process. [P]oliticians don\u2019t believe this\u2026 But Math is coming. It\u2019s [$17] trillion in debt and growing\u2026\u201d\n\nAllegedly, Teen Talk Barbie once said, \u201cMath is h-a-a-r-d.\u201d\n\nSo is history, including recent history \u2013 at least for inattentive disciples of Washington\u2019s dissemblers-in-charge.\n\nFor several years, while the rest of America stagnated, the financial industry has enjoyed huge windfalls.\n\nSince 2009, Obama\u2019s ineffective \u201cstimulus\u201d and multiple rounds of \u201cquantitative easing\u201d by the Federal Reserve \u2013 trillions of dollars \u2013 coupled with its artificial suppression of interest rates, have spurred an equity market bubble and, at the expense of savers, generated tremendous paper profits and bonuses for Wall Street firms, their employees and large investors.\n\nAfter encouraging income inequality, the progressive architects of America\u2019s fiscal and monetary policies -- and the resulting problems \u2013 should be ashamed to even mention it.\n\nGenuine inequities lie in the Federal Register and Tax Code, but regulatory and tax reforms aren\u2019t in the president\u2019s calculus.\n\nLamenting income inequality isn\u2019t meant to get America back to work. Liberal politicians only wish to score political points while convincing dependent Americans that voting for rivals is counterproductive. Progressive policies create and feed the poor but don\u2019t really help them.\n\nThe true purpose of the sudden progressive focus on income inequality is to deflect attention from their still-unfolding Obamacare calamity.\n\nIt won\u2019t work.\n\nObamacare has finally made Big Government failures impossible to hide. Too many Americans are and will be affected by Obamacare to allow culpable politicians to escape electoral retribution by hyping distractions like \u201cincome inequality.\u201d\n\nJerry Shenk is a PennLive/Patriot-News community columnist.
