If the House follows, a partial government shutdown, closing many public facilities and sending workers home on Thursday, would be averted. But the legislation runs only until December, meaning staffers and citizens can look forward to more uncertainty just before the holidays.\n\n\u201cGod help us all come Dec. 11,\u201d said Rep. Gerald Connolly (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the House government operations subcommittee.\n\nIs this any way to run a government?\n\n[House Speaker John Boehner to resign at end of October]\n\nSpeaker John Boehner knows it is not. He announced his resignation from his leadership post and his Ohio congressional seat rather than continuing a fight with members of his own Republican caucus who favor confrontation over compromise. While his sacrificial resignation could allow the government to remain open for now, it also could mean greater danger for federal employees and the services they provide taxpayers in the long run.\n\nLegislatively, Boehner was no friend to feds. He made that clear in August 2010, when he said \u201ctaxpayers are subsidizing the fattened salaries and pensions of federal bureaucrats who are out there right now making it harder to create private sector jobs.\u201d Yet, while he is as conservative as his right-wing critics, he also had a pragmatic streak that those critics don\u2019t like.\n\nHe knew the 16-day shutdown two years ago, designed to thwart the Affordable Care Act, was a mistake.\n\nHouse Republicans are facing a leadership reshuffle within their ranks \u2014 but as some lawmakers pull the party more toward the right, can any leader really restore unity? The Post's Robert Costa takes us inside the infighting in the Capitol. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\n[Republican hard-liners are \u2018false prophets,\u2019 Boehner says]\n\n\u201cThis plan never had a chance,\u201d he told CBS on Sunday, criticizing Republicans who \u201cwhip people into a frenzy believing they can accomplish things that they know, they know are never going to happen.\u201d\n\nNot too long ago, it appeared their desire to oust Boehner was not going to happen. But he now plans to leave at the end of October. To some extent, the next speaker will owe that seat to the faction that unseated Boehner.\n\n\u201cI think the possibility just went up significantly that we are going to have a donnybrook in December,\u201d Connolly said. The Republican right wing \u201cgot a big trophy\u201d with Boehner\u2019s resignation and are in \u201ca pretty powerful mode\u201d for demanding concessions and taking hostages.\n\n\u201cNone of that is good news\u201d for citizens and federal employees, Connolly added.\n\n[Kevin McCarthy formally announces bid for House speaker]\n\nIf Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), now the number 2 in the House, becomes speaker, he could have even more trouble corralling House Republicans than Boehner did. McCarthy has a reputation for being nice, but not tough. But he has been tough on federal employee issues. His congressional voting record for 2014 earned him a score of zero from the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE). He fared a little better with the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), agreeing with its legislative positions 20 percent of the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Gregory J. Junemann, president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, hopes some good will come from the Republican turmoil.\n\n\u201cPerhaps now, in the closing weeks of your Speakership, you are free\u201d to govern for the good of the American people, Junemann said in a letter to Boehner last week, optimistically adding: \u201cYour sacrifice \u2026.brings the opportunity for sanity to prevail for at least the Fiscal Year 2016 (FY16) spending bills, and for good governance to return to Washington.\u201d\n\nJunemann wants Boehner to advance legislation \u201cthat overturns the Budget Control Act of 2011 to eliminate the catastrophic threat of sequester, a bill that funds the government for the entirety of FY16 with appropriate increases to both the domestic and military budget caps, and a bill that increases the debt ceiling for a period carrying the country forward beyond the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Congress will engage in a spurt of meaningful legislation, but a full fiscal year budget bill is not likely to be in the mix. Approving a short-term funding measure passes for success in Congress these days, and that means another threat of a shutdown is just a couple of months away.\n\n\u201cFederal employees are taken to the brink,\u201d said NTEU President Tony Reardon. \u201cIt happened in 2013. It\u2019s happening now\u2026 If Dec. 11 becomes the new date they\u2019re going to be taken to the brink again\u2026I believe this really destroys our country\u2019s confidence in our government.\u201d\n\nAlong with that goes the confidence of federal employees in their employer.\n\nChris Ziegler, an Internal Revenue Service information technology specialist in St. Louis, is the father of three whose his wife has had medical problems. The possibility of a shutdown, now or later, is scary.\n\nHe joined the government expecting lower pay than the private sector, because he thought it was more stable. Instead of more stability, he got more shutdown stress.\n\nNow, he said, \u201cit\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker John Boehner's announced resignation possibly means a feared government shutdown will not happen now.
