While some Obamacare kinks have been worked out over the past year, exchange plans remain as unfriendly to doctors as ever.\n\nObamacare puts physicians \u2014 especially the dwindling number of those in private practice \u2014 in an especially difficult financial situation, expecting doctors to eat the costs of patients who discontinue coverage and to simply take on more patients to make up for bottom-level reimbursements.\n\nExchange plans nationwide pay on average significantly less than plans in the private market and even Medicare, according to AAF. While private plans generally pay doctors $1.00 for performing a given service, Medicare averages just $0.80; exchange plans are allowing doctors just $0.60 for the same thing. That puts Obamacare plans more in line with Medicaid reimbursements, AAF reports, and Medicaid\u2019s low reimbursement rates have been driving doctors away for years.

In order to keep price low, insurers have to cut costs somewhere; in exchanges, companies moved to covering just narrow networks with few in-network physicians and offering low reimbursement rates to doctors with the promise that if physicians work even more, they\u2019ll recoup their losses.\n\nBut the structure of the Affordable Care Act itself puts doctors who accept plans purchased on Obamacare exchanges at risk of never being paid at all. Obamacare requires insurers who sell plans on the exchanges to keep coverage active even after a customer has stopped paying their premiums, for an extra 90 days.\n\nFor the first 60 days after a customer has stopped paying but is still insured, the insurance company has to pay for any care the patient uses. But for any services used in the final 30 days before a customer\u2019s insurance can be terminated, doctors that see those patients won\u2019t be paid at all.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that in such an unfriendly climate for physicians, many are staying out of Obamacare plans. At the beginning of Obamacare\u2019s first enrollment period last year, over 70 percent of California\u2019s physicians weren\u2019t participating in Covered California plans, according to AAF \u2014 a big problem for the state with the largest Obamacare enrollment in the nation.\n\nThat number has grown to over 200,000 physicians nationwide as of May, before the open enrollment period ended and before insurance was active for many customers. Doctors that took losses from their participation in Obamacare plans may be even more skittish about accepting exchange coverage this year.
