The lighthouse was built by the United States Lighthouse Establishment in 1849.

It was originally known as the Maurice River Lighthouse and was designed to guide fishermen, oystermen and recreational boaters to the mouth of the Maurice River.

The lighthouse got its present name in 1913.

The lighthouse is the second-oldest in New Jersey. Only the Sandy Hook Lighthouse, built in 1764, is older.

The U.S. Coast Guard operated the lighthouse from 1939 to 1941, when its light was extinguished because of the beginning of World War II.

The lighthouse was deeded to the state Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife in 1956.

The vacant lighthouse suffered damage from vandalism and weather, and was taken over by the Maurice River Historical Society in 1971.

In July 1971, the lighthouse suffered extensive damage when a trespasser in the building started a fire that destroyed the roof and lantern room.

The historical society, through local fundraising efforts and donations in the mid-1970s, had the roof and lantern room rebuilt.

The Coast Guard, on July 2, 1980, at the request of the public, reinstalled the beacon and put the lighthouse back on the list of active navigational aids.

The lighthouse is on the National Register of Historic Places.
