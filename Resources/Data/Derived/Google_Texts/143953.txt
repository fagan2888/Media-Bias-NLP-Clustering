Sioux Falls, SD

The Scheels IcePlex is opening its door to 15 teams from three different states this weekend for the hockey arena's first tournament.

The Sioux Falls Flyers Squirt B/C tournament features 225 players and 27 games over 3 days. It was a six month planning process to get the event off the ground, and volunteers are putting in over 100 hours to help it run smoothly. The President of the Sioux Falls Youth Hockey program says there's more tournaments in the future, and this weekend has been successful.

"I think everything is going good. You can always use more parking but that's what everything. The facility has been great. Three regulation-sized hockey rinks which the only place in South Dakota we can do this so it's working great," Bryan Kouri said.

The puck drops on the championship rounds of the tournament Sunday.
