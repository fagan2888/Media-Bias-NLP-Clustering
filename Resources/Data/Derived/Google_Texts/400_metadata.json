It seems that somebody has been listening, because researchers have been finding out just how much smuggling has been going on in areas where big tax increases were levied and the news is more than a little disturbing. So should the states reconsider these policies in light of these finding? Of course not! We should spend more money at the federal level to trace packs of smokes from the manufacturer to the consumer.\n\nA federal program that let law enforcement trace cigarette packs from manufacturer to consumer would reduce interstate trafficking and boost the public health benefits of state cigarette tax policies, researchers say. Without a national tracking system in place, smokers evade taxes, there\u2019s less of a barrier to youth smoking and local governments miss out on revenue, the authors of a new study contend.\n\nEven if the method is faulty, the problem they are highlighting is very real. In the areas where these sin taxes were jacked up the highest, it should come as no surprise that the greatest volume of illegally trafficked smokes was found. The group went around collecting empty cigarette packs from the trash in a number of cities and found that nearly half of them lacked a tax stamp from the local area. And in the northeast corridor alone, they estimate that this is costing state and city governments as much as three quarter billion dollars per year.\n\nKevin Davis of the nonprofit research organization RTI International in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, and his colleagues calculated that the cities of Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Providence and Washington, DC, combined, could collect between $690 million and $729 million per year in cigarette taxes if trafficking stopped. \u201cWhat is key about this is that these calculations are not actual losses in revenue,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThis is money that could be added to government income.\u201d\n\nOf course, the results are still cloaked in the excuse that we need to charge more for tobacco products so less people will use them. (They\u2019re just trying to save us from ourselves, don\u2019t you know.) But the reality is that these programs do little to affect individual behavior. What they\u2019re trying to do is maximize cash flow into government coffers and they get rather testy when people turn to smugglers to avoid the massive tax hikes.\n\nSooner or later these folks are going to realize that these sin tax cash grabs aren\u2019t working. Unfortunately, given the evidence of recent history, \u201clater\u201d is probably a lot more likely than \u201csooner.\u201d\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Pirates", "title": "New plan \u2013 let the feds trace cigarette traffic", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/01/11/new-plan-let-the-feds-trace-cigarette-traffic/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-11T19:31:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-11T15:09:43+00:00"}, "keywords": "regulations, sin taxes, tobacco,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c2b\"", "article_summary": "We should spend more money at the federal level to trace packs of smokes from the manufacturer to the consumer.\nA federal program that let law enforcement trace cigarette packs from manufacturer to consumer would reduce interstate trafficking and boost the public health benefits of state cigarette tax policies, researchers say.\nSooner or later these folks are going to realize that these sin tax cash grabs aren\u2019t working.\nIn the areas where these sin taxes were jacked up the highest, it should come as no surprise that the greatest volume of illegally trafficked smokes was found.\nThe group went around collecting empty cigarette packs from the trash in a number of cities and found that nearly half of them lacked a tax stamp from the local area."}
