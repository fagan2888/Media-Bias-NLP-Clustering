(Photo: AP)\n\nLet\u2019s put it on his desk and make him veto it, one Republican candidate exclaimed. Another candidate declared, let\u2019s force the president to do what he says he\u2019ll do.\n\nIt was like the Republican presidential field had leaped into a time machine, landed in 2013 and picked up the debate on shutting down the government as if President Barack Obama still had something to lose.\n\nThe question of whether Republicans in Congress should use the looming federal budget deadline to advance partisan legislation is a defining one for GOP presidential candidates. The CNN presidential debates on Wednesday highlighted the divisions among candidates on whether to allow a government shutdown to push for cutting off federal money to Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe conversation started in the \u201cundercard\u201d debate, with a spirited exchange between Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. The two candidates did an excellent job of staking out their roles: Jindal as the outsider frustrated with GOP leaders for not going to the mat for conservative principles; Graham as the pragmatic insider unwilling to waste political capital on futile gestures. If you missed the debate, at least check out the transcript.\n\n\u201cIf we can't defund Planned Parenthood now, if we can't stand for innocent human life after these barbaric videos, it is time to be done with the Republican Party,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nGraham was just as passionate in arguing that if Republicans want to defund Planned Parenthood, repeal Obamacare and tank the Iran nuclear weapons deal, they need a new president. Shutting down the government over these issues only hurts the GOP\u2019s ability to win in November, he said.\n\n\u201cYou know, Bobby, we're running to be president of the United States, the most important job in the free world,\u201d Graham said to Jindal. \u201cWith it comes a certain amount of honesty. I'm tired of telling people things they want to hear that I know we can't do.\u201d\n\nThe argument continued in the second debate. Ohio Gov. John Kasich said he supported cutting off federal money to Planned Parenthood but disagreed with a government shutdown. However, he said, he\u2019d like to see Republicans put tax reform on the president\u2019s desk and dare him to veto it.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas, one of the leaders holding out for the repeal of Obamacare that led to the 2013 shutdown, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie argued in favor of allowing a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood. Christie said GOP leaders were giving Obama a pass by not making him either sign or veto a bill.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s force him to do what he says he\u2019s going to do. Now I don\u2019t know whether he\u2019ll do it or not, but let\u2019s force him to do it,\u201d Christie said. Carly Fiorina agreed that Republicans should \u201cforce President Obama to veto this bill.\u201d\n\nConservatives in Iowa and elsewhere are more likely to agree with Jindal, Cruz, Christie and Fiorina on shutting down the government over Planned Parenthood money.\n\nBut a majority of Americans do not want the government to shut down over that issue, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Monday. The poll found 71 percent of Americans say it\u2019s more important for Congress to approve a budget resolution to avoid a government shutdown. That\u2019s compared with 22 percent who said it\u2019s more important to eliminate all federal funding for Planned Parenthood. In September 2013, a CNN/ORC poll showed 60 percent of Americans wanting to keep the government open, compared with 34 percent saying it was more important to defund Obamacare.\n\nRepublicans in the recent poll were more divided on the issue, with 48 percent saying keep the government open over 44 percent choosing to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nRepublicans talking about forcing Obama\u2019s hand seem to be forgetting that it\u2019s 2015, not 2013. They couldn\u2019t back him down when he was facing tough midterm elections, and they won\u2019t do it now when most Americans oppose another shutdown. Obama has little to lose by refusing to accept partisan riders on a budget resolution. If the government shuts down, he has plenty of Republicans to blame.\n\nMark J.
