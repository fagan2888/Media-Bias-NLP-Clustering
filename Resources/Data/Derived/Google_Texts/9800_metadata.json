(KOIN 6)\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN 6) \u2014 \u201cBefore there was Obamacare, there was Marycare.\u201d\n\nMultnomah County Commissioner Loretta Smith and others gave accolades to the woman who in 2005 sold her house \u2014 her \u201cwinterhome\u201d in Glendale, Arizona \u2014 to bring more than 40 people living in Louisiana and Texas to Portland following Hurricane Katrina.\n\nPHOTOS: see the celebration\n\nPastor Mary Overstreet Smith, 76, also helped start the North by Northeast Health Care Center, one of North Portland\u2019s first health clinics, along with an autism center.\n\nAfter decades of selfless work, the North Portland icon\u2019s health is failing, and her congregation at the Power House Temple Church on North Williams Street wanted to show their appreciation for her while she\u2019s still able to celebrate.\n\nAnd celebrate they did. A full weekend of festivities kicked off at the church Friday night with speeches from African American Chamber of Commerce Director Roy Jay, former Senator Margaret Carter and others.\n\nRemembering an icon\n\nOverstreet Smith\u2019s daughter recollected a time their house was flooded. Pastor Mary put on her fishing boots, put all the children in the neighborhood into a boat and paddled them to church. \u201cChurch started at seven. We were there by 6:45 \u2014 that\u2019s my mother,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen former Senator Margaret Carter took the microphone and led the congregation in gospel songs, not a single person was left sitting. The guest of honor herself, Pastor Mary, threw herself into a dance-off with a Sunday-schooler. Anyone in the room would say she won.\n\nAs younger members of the congregation handed out fans while church-goers caught their breath, Carter said \u201cif she had to sell her house to help the people of Portland, she would.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis woman did things as if she was the size of an 1,100 member church.\u201d\n\nDoing God\u2019s work\n\nBut, Pastor Mary doesn\u2019t see herself as a saint. Rather, a woman, guided by God, doing work that needs to be done.\n\n\u201cPeople have needs, and somebody has to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI just like helping people.\u201d\n\nBeing from the southern United States, Overstreet Smith grew up near the area hardest-hit by Hurricane Katrina. \u201cGetting these people on airplanes, they had no I.D., they lost everything,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what tomorrow\u2019s going to bring.\u201d\n\nAs for a weekend in her honor: \u201cI\u2019m always excited, I\u2019m looking forward to just being able to be there.\u201d\n\n\u2018I will be there\u2019\n\nWhen Barrack Obama was first elected president, she called Lorretta Smith, then a staffer for Ron Wynden, to ask for tickets to the inauguration.\n\nHowever, only people who would be in D.C. on the day of Obama\u2019s inauguration were eligible for tickets through their state senator, to be picked up on Martin Luther King\u2019s birthday.\n\n\u201cI will be in D.C. if I have to walk to D.C.,\u201d Overstreet Smith answered.\n\n\u201cShe had a Cadillac in D.C.,\u201d said Smith.\n\n\u201cWhat Pastor Mary showed me is she kept her word: she said \u2018I-will-be-there.'\u201d\n\nCelebrations will continue Saturday at 7 p.m. at the Power House Temple Church at 4525 N. Williams Ave., finishing off with Sunday service at 3 p.m., at the same location.", "article_metadata": {"norton-safeweb-site-verification": "46bykeo2i0s-akw2xw95c4niny8dm8q2hq2q--p6sq9m44il5276m4e6zl3aewxb9eje2k-8ahjwqf4l2xznzs7ryf88y3cugtu9sy16hu69onbc-aftcwjs4pwj7f74", "zipcodes": "97201, 97203, 97204, 97205, 97206, 97207, 97208, 97209, 97210, 97211, 97212, 97213, 97214, 97215, 97216, 97227, 97266, 97005, 97225, 97015, 98661, 97030", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=411685184", "og": {"site_name": "KOIN 6", "description": "\u201cBefore there was Obamacare, there was Marycare.\u201d After decades of selfless work, the North Portland icon\u2019s health is failing.", "title": "A celebration for Pastor Mary Overstreet Smith", "url": "http://koin.com/2014/05/17/power-house-temple-church-celebrates-pastor-mary-overstreet-smith/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://lintvkoin.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/pastor-mary-new-lead.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cBefore there was Obamacare, there was Marycare.\u201d After decades of selfless work, the North Portland icon\u2019s health is failing.", "creator": "@koinnews", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkoin.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/pastor-mary-new-lead.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "A celebration for Pastor Mary Overstreet Smith", "site": "koinnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Portland Breaking News, Weather, Sports and Traffic", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.koin", "fb": {"pages": 201148780086040}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "KOIN 6", "google-site-verification": "vzU_UZiJT4xFXAdXje_mcSljJEG-ROUbQhc5qkumYRE", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/koin6", "published_time": "2014-05-17T08:04:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-18T06:41:48+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://koin.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/14b04f7776cb146ac02da7d9f2520ae3?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9bc8\"", "article_summary": "Pastor Mary Overstreet Smith, shown at the Power House Temple Church May 16, 2014.\n\u201cI will be in D.C. if I have to walk to D.C.,\u201d Overstreet Smith answered.\n\u201cI just like helping people.\u201dBeing from the southern United States, Overstreet Smith grew up near the area hardest-hit by Hurricane Katrina.\nPHOTOS: see the celebrationPastor Mary Overstreet Smith, 76, also helped start the North by Northeast Health Care Center, one of North Portland\u2019s first health clinics, along with an autism center.\n\u201cWhat Pastor Mary showed me is she kept her word: she said \u2018I-will-be-there."}
