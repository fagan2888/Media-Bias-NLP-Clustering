The country is incredibly polarized and there's no real sign of it stopping any time soon.\n\nSo let's just put that all aside for about a minute and admire these pictures and videos of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with two baby pandas. Trudeau was tasked with unveiling the names of the two lil' guys, who are now known as Jia Panpan (\"Canadian Hope\") and Jia Yueyue (\"Canadian Joy\"). They live at the Toronto Zoo with their mom and another fully-grown panda.\n\nToday I had the pleasure to unveil the names of @TheTorontoZoo\u2019s panda cubs! Say hello to Jia Panpan & Jia Yueyue: pic.twitter.com/iFCAlID7bc \u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) March 7, 2016\n\nTrudeau said that the panda is a symbol of peace and friendship, and noted that Canada's Chinese communities are thriving.\n\nAren't they just adorable? (The pandas, not Trudeau...although he does have his fair share of admirers stateside.)\n\nThe public will be able to meet Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue starting on March 12.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Afternoon break..05/27/2016 2:20:12AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Afternoon break.", "title": "Here's the Canadian Prime Minister Cuddling Baby Pandas", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/03/08/heres-the-canadian-prime-minister-cuddling-a-baby-panda-n2130507", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/8/10.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Afternoon break.", "title": "Here's the Canadian Prime Minister Cuddling Baby Pandas", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/03/08/heres-the-canadian-prime-minister-cuddling-a-baby-panda-n2130507", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/8/10.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Here's the Canadian Prime Minister Cuddling Baby Pandas, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The public will be able to meet Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue starting on March 12.\nTrudeau was tasked with unveiling the names of the two lil' guys, who are now known as Jia Panpan (\"Canadian Hope\") and Jia Yueyue (\"Canadian Joy\").\nSo let's just put that all aside for about a minute and admire these pictures and videos of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with two baby pandas.\nSay hello to Jia Panpan & Jia Yueyue: pic.twitter.com/iFCAlID7bc \u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) March 7, 2016Trudeau said that the panda is a symbol of peace and friendship, and noted that Canada's Chinese communities are thriving.\nIt's a rough world out there, and this election season has led to intense rhetoric, political infighting, and other general nastiness."}
