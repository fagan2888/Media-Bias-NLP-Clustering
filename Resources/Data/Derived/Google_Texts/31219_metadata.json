Dr. Jennifer House, the department\u2019s public health veterinarian,said the fourth case did not reach that level.\n\nHouse added that the three latest patients were treated with antibiotics and had recovered; the initial patient is still hospitalized.\n\nOfficials said the initial case was the first instance of pneumonic plague in a human in Colorado in 10 years; the names of any of the patients or specific details from the cases have not been released.\n\n\u201cBut we believe the exposure to be over,\u201d House said.\n\nPlague is spread by fleas from rodents, most commonly prairie dogs. Flea samples recently collected from eastern Adams County tested positive for plague bacteria. Tri-County Health Department staff members have gone door-to-door in the area with information about plague and to assess prairie dog populations. People and pets walking in open spaces and trails should avoid contact with prairie dogs, rabbits and other rodents.\n\nAnthony Cotton: 303-954-1292, acotton@denverpost.com or twitter.com/anthonycottondp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Three more cases of plague identified in Colorado", "title": "Three more cases of plague identified in Colorado", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/18/three-more-cases-of-plague-identified-in-colorado/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140115__Prairie-Dogsp1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140115__Prairie-Dogsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-18T10:41:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:29:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce341\"", "article_summary": "The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said Friday that three additional cases of plague have been diagnosed in Colorado.\nThe dog likely was exposed to a prairie dog or rabbit with plague-infected fleas in eastern Adams County.\nDr. Jennifer House, the department\u2019s public health veterinarian,said the fourth case did not reach that level.\nTri-County Health Department staff members have gone door-to-door in the area with information about plague and to assess prairie dog populations.\nThe three latest patients all had contact with the same dog, with two of the three contracting pneumonic plague, as did the initial patient."}
