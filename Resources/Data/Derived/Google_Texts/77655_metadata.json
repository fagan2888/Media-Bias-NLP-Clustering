Here Devon Page considers hostile environment for endangered species. Canada\u2019s Species at Risk Act (SARA) is meant to protect endangered species and the habitat they need to survive and recover. It\u2019s a good law on paper, but it\u2019s not working the way it was intended because of Ottawa\u2019s recalcitrance \u2014 slow implementation and chronic underfunding. The law has the potential to help Canada\u2019s endangered species recover, but it\u2019s going to take the sort of political leadership at the federal level that\u2019s long been absent, as well as a meaningful financial investment, to turn this good law into strong on-the-ground protection. When it was passed in 2002, SARA was heralded as a major step forward for wildlife protection. It was a step that came none too soon. Almost 30 years earlier, Richard Nixon gave his nod to a similar law in the United States and emerging science was telling the tale of wildlife populations dropping rapidly across Canada, the primary cause being loss or degradation of habitat. To someone on the outside looking in, passing SARA might have seemed like a last-minute effort to curry favour by a government on its way out. But the law was actually drafted and passed in a manner that is becoming pass\u00e9 in Canada \u2014 more than a decade of exhaustive and extensive consultation with both proponents and opponents \u2014 regarding stricter measures to protect and restore endangered species. It wasn\u2019t until the law came into full force in 2004 that those who had spent years helping to shape it came to understand that a law \u201con the books\u201d doesn\u2019t mean very much if it\u2019s neither implemented nor enforced.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nCanada\u2019s national identity is bound up in the idea of boundless wilderness. It\u2019s a narrative that is perpetuated by governments that overuse phrases like Canada\u2019s \u201cnatural heritage.\u201d In reality, industrialization of Canada\u2019s landscape is vastly disproportionate to our population \u2014 a 2014 study by Forest Watch reported that Canada had cut down more virgin forests over the last 13 years than any other country on the planet \u2014 and that\u2019s bad news for wildlife. The reason for the disconnect between our national mythology and our environmental record boils down to the fact that selling oil and lumber doesn\u2019t mix very well with protecting wildlife. That\u2019s why environmentalists, including myself and many of my colleagues at Ecojustice, eventually started going to court to uphold SARA ourselves. We successfully defended a succession of unloved species such as the ugly nooksack dace (a fish), the flashy but slow greater sage grouse, and the iconic orca. The federal government has found itself on a losing streak, yet it has consistently failed to bring its approach to wildlife protection in line with the law. These days, the story of wildlife protection in Canada continues to play out in the courts. And the moral of that story is that regardless of the laws on the books, our government will not act to protect vulnerable wildlife, or the places they make their homes, unless forced to do so.\n\nArticle Continued Below", "article_metadata": {"description": "How Ottawa disobeyed a good law and failed to protect Canada\u2019s endangered species.", "og": {"site_name": "thestar.com", "description": "How Ottawa disobeyed a good law and failed to protect Canada\u2019s endangered species.", "title": "Canada is no country for vulnerable wildlife | Toronto Star", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/09/19/canada-is-no-country-for-vulnerable-wildlife.html", "image": "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/opinion/commentary/2015/09/19/canada-is-no-country-for-vulnerable-wildlife/orca.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-link": "https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/09/19/canada-is-no-country-for-vulnerable-wildlife.html", "twitter": {"description": "How Ottawa disobeyed a good law and failed to protect Canada\u2019s endangered species.", "creator": "Devon Page", "image": "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/opinion/commentary/2015/09/19/canada-is-no-country-for-vulnerable-wildlife/orca.jpg", "title": "Canada is no country for vulnerable wildlife | Toronto Star", "site": "@TorontoStar", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-image-url": "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/opinion/commentary/2015/09/19/canada-is-no-country-for-vulnerable-wildlife/orca.jpg.size.xxsmall.promo.jpg", "bt": {"pubDate": 1442694600000, "author": "Devon Page", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/09/19/canada-is-no-country-for-vulnerable-wildlife.html", "dateDisplay": "Sat., Sept. 19, 2015", "modDate": 1442694602255, "type": "Story", "id": "609ee8da-f05b-4f8f-91ba-2fed076c8158"}, "parsely-title": "Canada is no country for vulnerable wildlife", "parsely-tags": "endangered species, Environment, Species at Risk Act, wildlife, Devon Page", "parsely-author": "Devon Page", "parsely-section": "Commentary", "keywords": "endangered species, Environment, Species at Risk Act, wildlife, Devon Page", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/torontostar", "section": "Commentary", "modified": "2015-09-19", "published": "2015-09-19"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2015-09-19T20:30:00.000Z", "genre": "News Analysis", "thumbnail": "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/opinion/commentary/2015/09/19/canada-is-no-country-for-vulnerable-wildlife/orca.jpg.size.xxsmall.promo.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "endangered species, Environment, Species at Risk Act, wildlife, Devon Page"}, "article_summary": "These days, the story of wildlife protection in Canada continues to play out in the courts.\nCanada\u2019s Species at Risk Act (SARA) is meant to protect endangered species and the habitat they need to survive and recover.\nWhen it was passed in 2002, SARA was heralded as a major step forward for wildlife protection.\nThe federal government has found itself on a losing streak, yet it has consistently failed to bring its approach to wildlife protection in line with the law.\nHere Devon Page considers hostile environment for endangered species."}
