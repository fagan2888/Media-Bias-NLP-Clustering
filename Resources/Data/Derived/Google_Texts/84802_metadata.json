Breyer in a public conversation at the 92nd Street Y in New York.\n\nBut the justice proved nimble in avoiding giving much away.\n\nProfessor Feldman asked about the best way to interpret a statute, which was a way of talking about a challenge to nationwide tax subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. One approach, favored by the challengers, focuses on the law\u2019s plain words. The other, pressed by the administration, looks to the law\u2019s purpose.\n\nJustice Breyer responded that all of the justices consider five factors: words, history, tradition, purpose and consequences. \u201cSome people emphasize the first three,\u201d he said, naming Justice Antonin Scalia, while he said he was inclined to place weight on the last two.\n\n\u201cYou do normally interpret words in context,\u201d he said.\n\nProfessor Feldman switched to asking about social movements, but Justice Breyer saw where that was heading.\n\n\u201cIf what you\u2019re going toward is the gay rights case,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going there.\u201d The court will hear arguments next month on whether there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.\n\nIn general, Justice Breyer insisted that partisan politics played no role in the court\u2019s decisions. But he said the justices\u2019 life experiences could matter.\n\nProfessor Feldman asked whether that included religion. Six of the justices are Catholic, and three of them are Jewish.\n\n\u201cMight,\u201d Justice Breyer said. \u201cWho knows what goes into the great mix?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150313134315, "BN": "first-draft", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "politics/firstdraft", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 13, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Adam Liptak", "SCG": "First Draft", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Adam Liptak", "byl": "Adam Liptak", "twitter": {"description": "The trick to interviewing a justice of the Supreme Court as it prepares to issue major decisions is to ask seemingly general questions that might nonetheless elicit a preview of what is to come.", "title": "Grilling a Supreme Court Justice Is No Easy Task", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/03/13/grilling-a-supreme-court-justice-is-no-easy-task/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/03/12/us/politics/12firstdraft-justice-breyer/12firstdraft-justice-breyer-thumbLarge.jpg", "creator": "@adamliptak", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/post", "description": "The trick to interviewing a justice of the Supreme Court as it prepares to issue major decisions is to ask seemingly general questions that might nonetheless elicit a preview of what is to come.", "CG": "Politics", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "March 13, 2015", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-03132015.jsonp", "article": {"published_time": 1426268595, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/adam_liptak/index.html", "section": "Politics", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-03-13T17:43:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150313174315, "PUD": 20150313, "pdate": 20150313, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/03/12/us/politics/12firstdraft-justice-breyer/12firstdraft-justice-breyer-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "First Draft", "description": "The trick to interviewing a justice of the Supreme Court as it prepares to issue major decisions is to ask seemingly general questions that might nonetheless elicit a preview of what is to come.", "title": "Grilling a Supreme Court Justice Is No Easy Task", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/03/13/grilling-a-supreme-court-justice-is-no-easy-task/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/03/12/us/politics/12firstdraft-justice-breyer/12firstdraft-justice-breyer-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Grilling a Supreme Court Justice Is No Easy Task", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/03/12/us/politics/12firstdraft-justice-breyer/12firstdraft-justice-breyer-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "In general, Justice Breyer insisted that partisan politics played no role in the court\u2019s decisions.\n\u201cMight,\u201d Justice Breyer said.\nProfessor Feldman switched to asking about social movements, but Justice Breyer saw where that was heading.\nJustice Breyer responded that all of the justices consider five factors: words, history, tradition, purpose and consequences.\n\u201cYou do normally interpret words in context,\u201d he said."}
