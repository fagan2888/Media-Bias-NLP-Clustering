Taxpayers will be happy to know they not only fund abortions under the Affordable Care Act, they also help prostitutes stay healthy.

Prior to Obamacare, brothel workers at the Moonlight Bunny Ranch in Nevada said they were unable to find coverage under their profession.

Prostitute “Caressa Kisses” explained to WOAI NBC News:

“They equate us to illegal working girls who have very high STDS and AIDS rates. Which we have none of the above, we’re legal, licensed prostitutes. I see the doctor every week, it’s state mandatory. And we’re tested weekly and monthly for blood. We’re independent contractors, so we have to get our own insurance. So this is truly a blessing. We really hope that the kinks are worked out and that affordable healthcare for all happens.”

Yes, ‘legal’ prostitution does exist, but only in the state of Nevada. It dates back to the early 1900’s — apparently the morality of selling a woman's body for sexual pleasure doesn’t bother them.

Obamacare seems to be all for promoting sexual exploits. Remember the “Healthy Ho’s Party" in San Francisco? Bay Area sex worker "Siouxsie Q" helped nearly 40 men to enroll in the new insurance exchanges.

There are also the lewd ads on the Got Insurance? website. The legislation is praised for making it easier to binge drink, have casual sex and acquire painkillers.

Between promoting irresponsible, unhealthy lifestyles and allowing individuals to stay on their parent’s plans until the ripe age of 26, perhaps the new American dream is just to never grow up.

Brothel worker Taylor Lee is very pleased with President Obama's work:

“Having this profession, we aren’t exactly offered group health insurance. I’m really for Obamacare, I’m excited.”

Can’t wait...
