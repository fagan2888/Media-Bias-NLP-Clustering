Admire her the way you might the Yankees\u2019 consummate contact hitter, Ichiro Suzuki, or any other favorite relic. She is easy to spot on the driving range, with her short hair and her skirt so long the hem nearly reaches her knees.\n\nBetter hurry, though, because Inkster\u2019s celebrated career is winding down.\n\nAfter 35 starts, Inkster will play what is likely to be her final round in the United States Women\u2019s Open on Sunday. How remarkable is her longevity? In the field of 156, there are only 12 other players who have had 35 birthdays.\n\nInkster\u2019s departure from the scene carries no less historical import than the two-way player Chuck Bednarik\u2019s final game in the N.F.L. or Suzuki\u2019s final major league at-bat, whenever it takes place.\n\nWhen Inkster pulls away from Pinehurst No. 2, a curtain will fall on the era of the women\u2019s professional golfer as the multiple-decades multitasker. Inkster, 53, won four of her seven major titles, including the 2002 United States Women\u2019s Open, after giving birth to the second of her two daughters with husband, Brian, a California club pro.\n\nShe served as the model for a generation of working mothers on the L.P.G.A. Tour. But Inkster now envisions the top players following the path of Mexico\u2019s Lorena Ochoa, who won two majors and reached No. 1 before retiring at 28 to become a full-time mother.\n\n\u201cMost of these girls are starting off really young playing, and by the time they get out here, they\u2019ve played 10 years of competitive golf, and now you\u2019re asking them to play another 10 years or whatever,\u201d Inkster said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of golf, a lot of wear and tear on your body.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI really don\u2019t see a lot of the girls playing into their 30s.\u201d\n\nLucy Li, the 11-year-old who was the youngest to qualify for this tournament, has been playing since she was 7. Lydia Ko, the third-ranked woman in the world, won her first pro event at 14 and has already made 29 L.P.G.A. Tour starts. Michelle Wie, the 36-hole leader, is 24 and appearing in her 11th United States Women\u2019s Open.\n\nPhoto\n\nThen there is Inkster, who did not take up the sport until she was 15. She was 18 when she made her national championship debut, at the Country Club of Indianapolis. She advanced through qualifying as one of 297 entrants, then a record. This year there were 1,702 participants, including a 9-year-old.\n\nInkster carded rounds of 80, 72, 72 and 75 to finish in a tie for 23rd. \u201cAll I remember is they had brand-new Titleists on the range,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d hit one and I\u2019d put one in my golf bag. I\u2019m sure I was over the 50-pound limit flying home.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInkster went on to win three consecutive United States Women\u2019s Amateur titles and star at San Jose State. In 1984, her first full year on the tour, she became the first player to win two majors as a rookie.\n\nIn 1990, Inkster gave birth to her first child, Hayley. She delivered her second child, Cori, four years later. In 1999, she won her first United States Women\u2019s Open title. She remembers the 1990s as a blur of road trips from one tournament stop to the next in minivans stuffed with toys and luggage.\n\nWide-body jets have replaced the minivans as the mode of transportation for today\u2019s working mother on the tour. This year\u2019s schedule has more stops in East Asia than on the West Coast of the United States.\n\n\u201cI played through an era where I could have kids and travel domestically and bring my kids,\u201d Inkster said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really tough to be a mom and play out here because you\u2019re going overseas so much. And I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the smartest thing to bring your kids overseas.\u201d\n\nInkster\u2019s work-life balance, however tenuous, would be impossible for her to pull off today, she said, and not just because of the travel. Gone are the tournament breaks in the fall and the recovery Mondays, spent away from the course and considered sacrosanct by Inkster and her ilk.\n\n\u201cNow everybody\u2019s here on Sunday night and everybody is playing, practicing on Monday, and it\u2019s a grind,\u201d Inkster said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s good or bad, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m just glad I\u2019m drinking with my kids instead of putting diapers on them.\u201d\n\nWhile Inkster has strived for a life enhanced by golf, not consumed by it, she can grind with the best of them, as she has demonstrated during this tournament.\n\n\u201cI still try really hard,\u201d she said after opening with a 71. \u201cIt\u2019s just in my DNA.\u201d\n\nInkster carded a 75 on Friday to make the tournament cut for the 23rd time in 35 tries. Although she has played the weekend 65.7 percent of the time, she is not impressed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cTwo for 35,\u201d she said at the start of the week, referring to her winning percentage in the event. \u201cI would still be sitting on the bench if I was a baseball player.\u201d\n\nInkster finished her second round on the ninth hole and was shuttled by minivan to an area a few hundred yards from the clubhouse. She accepted an offer of a cart ride the rest of the way and passed one of her playing competitors, Cheyenne Woods, 23, who was on foot.\n\nLooking over her shoulder at Woods, she laughed and said: \u201cIf you\u2019re over 50, you can get a cart. You have a few more years.\u201d\n\nThe list of players that Inkster, a native Californian, has mentored is long and includes Inbee Park, the defending Open champion from South Korea, and the 2010 winner, Paula Creamer, a fellow Californian.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I\u2019ve just looked at her with such awe,\u201d Creamer said. \u201cAnd I still do.\u201d\n\nBefore the tournament began, the U.S.G.A. hosted a dinner for the past champions. Inkster was seated next to Creamer, 27, and near Meg Mallon, 51, and Karrie Webb, 39, but her reach extended all the way to the septuagenarians Sandra Palmer and Sandra Haynie, whom she competed against when she was starting out.\n\nAt the dinner were L.P.G.A. players old enough to remember competing on courses with rubber mats on the practice ranges and those playing Pinehurst No. 2 a week after the men. In the middle, at least figuratively, was Inkster, the link between the tour\u2019s past and its future.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140621122417, "twitter": {"description": "After 35 starts, Juli Inkster will play what is likely to be her final round in the United States Women\u2019s Open on Sunday.", "title": "Juli Inkster Leaves a Legacy as a Master Multitasker", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/sports/golf/in-likely-her-last-open-juli-inkster-leaves-a-legacy.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002954451"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/22/sports/DOG-22inkster1/DOG-22inkster1-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/sports/golf/in-likely-her-last-open-juli-inkster-leaves-a-legacy.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002954451", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/sports/golf/in-likely-her-last-open-juli-inkster-leaves-a-legacy.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "sports/golf", "hdl_p": "Inkster Leaves a Legacy as a Master Multitasker", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/golf/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 21, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "United States Women's Open (Golf),Golf,Inkster  Juli", "news_keywords": "Golf", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Karen Crouse", "SCG": "golf", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Inkster, Juli", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By KAREN CROUSE", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "After 35 starts, Juli Inkster will play what is likely to be her final round in the United States Women\u2019s Open on Sunday.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/22/sports/DOG-22inkster1/DOG-22inkster1-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "description": "After 35 starts, Juli Inkster will play what is likely to be her final round in the United States Women\u2019s Open on Sunday.", "CG": "sports", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 21, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/karen_crouse/index.html", "section": "Golf", "modified": "2014-06-25", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/golf/index.jsonp", "tag": "Inkster, Juli", "published": "2014-06-21", "section-taxonomy-id": "DE2B278B-2783-4506-AAD5-C15A5BB6DA1A"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "22inkster", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140625143125, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/sports/golf/in-likely-her-last-open-juli-inkster-leaves-a-legacy.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/22/sports/DOG-22inkster1/DOG-22inkster1-videoSixteenByNine1050-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "After 35 starts, Juli Inkster will play what is likely to be her final round in the United States Women\u2019s Open on Sunday.", "title": "Juli Inkster Leaves a Legacy as a Master Multitasker"}, "pdate": 20140621, "des": "Golf", "articleid": 100000002954451, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Juli Inkster Leaves a Legacy as a Master Multitasker", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/22/sports/DOG-22inkster1/DOG-22inkster1-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "After 35 starts, Inkster will play what is likely to be her final round in the United States Women\u2019s Open on Sunday.\nMichelle Wie, the 36-hole leader, is 24 and appearing in her 11th United States Women\u2019s Open.\nThis year\u2019s schedule has more stops in East Asia than on the West Coast of the United States.\nIn 1999, she won her first United States Women\u2019s Open title.\nPhotoPINEHURST, N.C. \u2014 Take a long look at Juli Inkster, who carded a four-under-par 66, the lowest round of the week, on Saturday."}
