He appeared to get the leg caught in the grass and did not put any weight on the leg when he was helped to the sideline and then to the locker room.\n\nSEE ALSO: Baker ejected in fight between Eagles and Redskins\n\nRookie Bashaud Breeland finished the game in Hall\u2019s place. He made two of his three tackles after replacing Hall and nearly had an interception, though a replay revealed he did not secure the ball before it hit the ground.\n\n\u201cI definitely feel like Breeland came in with the right mindset and definitely stepped up and made some plays for us,\u201d said cornerback David Amerson. \u201cWe all knew he can play, so we don\u2019t feel like we missed a beat or anything like that. We just know moving forward, we don\u2019t know how long D\u2019s going to be out, but us as a group \u2014 the secondary, period \u2014 we\u2019ve got to step up and take it to the next level.\u201d\n\nA torn Achilles\u2019 tendon would cost Hall the remainder of the season. After surgery, the general prognosis is a six-month recovery.\n\nHe was one of 10 Redskins players who missed part of the game because of injury. Coach Jay Gruden said defensive end Jason Hatcher will be day-to-day after straining a hamstring in the fourth quarter, while left guard Shawn Lauvao also left in the third quarter when his right knee, which he initially hurt Sept. 14 against Jacksonville, began to swell.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good, it\u2019s good,\u201d Hatcher said. \u201cIt just caught on me a little bit, it\u2019s tight. It didn\u2019t pop or nothing like that. Hopefully, we can get it loosened up this week and be ready for Thursday.\u201d\n\nOutside linebacker Brian Orakpo injured the middle finger in his left hand in the third quarter and thought he got it stuck in a player\u2019s shoulder pads. Center Kory Lichtensteiger missed a series with an unspecified injury, while right tackle Tyler Polumbus returned after injuring his right knee and running back Alfred Morris returned to the game after injuring one of his knees.\n\nStrong safety Duke Ihenacho did not return after injuring his left foot, though Frank Kearse was back on the field after sustaining an unspecified injury in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cThe guys battled their [rears] off,\u201d Lauvao said. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because you want to go out there and help your teammates. We have a quick week. Have to make sure I do what I got to do.\u201d\n\nSpecial teams woes not only culprit\n\nWashington\u2019s special teams units made several gaffes for the second time in three weeks. In addition to a missed 33-yard field goal by Kai Forbath with 10:07 remaining, the Redskins also allowed a touchdown on a 102-yard kickoff return by Chris Polk, which was the third-longest kickoff return in Eagles history.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t point the finger just at special teams,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe all had our hand in this \u2014 coaching also \u2014 in this defeat, so I\u2019m not going to point my finger at special teams. But we do have to find a way to cover kicks better.\u201d\n\nForbath earlier made field goals of 49 and 44 yards.\n\nGolston misses 2nd straight game\n\nDefensive end Kedric Golston, hampered by a strained left groin, did not play for the second consecutive week. Golston, listed as doubtful on the injury report, strained the muscle in the season-opener at Houston and missed the game against Jacksonville last week.\n\nFour other injured players were inactive: Quarterback Robert Griffin III, tight end Jordan Reed, cornerback Tracy Porter and inside linebacker Akeem Jordan. The healthy scratches were wide receiver Santana Moss and rookie left tackle Morgan Moses, who made his debut against the Jaguars.\n\nExtra points\n\nThe Redskins were called for 10 penalties for 131 yards, which is the most total yardage they\u2019ve surrendered in a game since Dec. 12, 2004, when they gave up 137 yards in a 17-14 home loss to the Eagles. \u2026 Officials flagged strong safety Akeem Davis for a horse-collar tackle on Darren Sproles as the Eagles running back returned a punt in the third quarter, though it appeared they waited to throw the flag until watching the replay on the stadium video boards. \u2026 Punter Tress Way kicked off again with Forbath nursing a strained right groin. \u2026 Rookie wide receiver Ryan Grant worked on catching punts before the game. Moss and DeSean Jackson are the two back-up punt returners. \u2026 Griffin, who is on crutches and has his left ankle in a hard cast, did not make the trip.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hall, one of the Redskins' starting cornerbacks, left the game with 10:36 to play in the third quarter while dropping back to cover Eagles wide receiver Jeremy Maclin.
