Those 29 students were celebrated on April 25. This is the sixth graduating class that has received the SMSC scholarship, representing 21 tribes from across the United States.\n\nAny student in financial need from any University of Minnesota campus is eligible for the SMSC scholarship. Scholarship recipient, Carla Big Bear, a member of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe who will graduate in May from the University of Minnesota Duluth with a master\u2019s degree, spoke at the celebration. \u201c\u201cThe SMSC Scholarship program let me focus more on learning than on how I was going to pay for it. This scholarship is making a tremendous impact on many people in Minnesota and across the U.S.,\u201d she said in a press release. Her degree in tribal administration and governance will aid her on her way to work in Washington, D.C. Law school may also be in her future.\n\nGraduates at the celebration were honored by SMSC with a star quilt, and congratulated by friends and family.\n\n\u201cThe SMSC endowed scholarship is here to ensure that deserving students like you have the chance to overcome financial hurdles and become the next generation of leaders in your communities,\u201d said SMSC Vice Chairman Keith B. Anderson in the release.\n\nIn the past seven years almost 200 Native American students have received the SMSC Endowed Scholarship. The scholarship program was established with a $2.5 million gift from the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community in 2009. The University of Minnesota matches the interest earned on the fund.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The University of Minnesota will graduate 29 Native American students thanks to the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community (SMSC) Endowed Scholarship.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/11/29-natives-graduate-university-minnesota-thanks-smsc-scholarship-160278", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/university-of-minnesota-native-american-graduates.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "29 Natives to Graduate from University of Minnesota Thanks to SMSC Scholarship"}, "abstract": "The University of Minnesota will graduate 29 Native American students thanks to the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community (SMSC) Endowed Scholarship.", "keywords": "University of Minnesota, University of Minnesota Duluth, SMSC, Shakopee Mdewakantan Sioux Community, Native American students, Native American Education, Native American Scholarships, Graduation, College Graduation", "dc": {"title": "29 Natives to Graduate from University of Minnesota Thanks to SMSC Scholarship"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/11/29-natives-graduate-university-minnesota-thanks-smsc-scholarship-160278", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-05-11T13:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "29 Natives to Graduate from University of Minnesota Thanks to SMSC Scholarship"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce491\"", "article_summary": "This year the University of Minnesota will graduate 29 Native American students thanks to the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community (SMSC) Endowed Scholarship program.\n\u201c\u201cThe SMSC Scholarship program let me focus more on learning than on how I was going to pay for it.\nAny student in financial need from any University of Minnesota campus is eligible for the SMSC scholarship.\nThis is the sixth graduating class that has received the SMSC scholarship, representing 21 tribes from across the United States.\nIn the past seven years almost 200 Native American students have received the SMSC Endowed Scholarship."}
