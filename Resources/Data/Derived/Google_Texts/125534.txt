With Colorado's expansion of Medicaid that went into effect in January as part of the federal Affordable Care Act, more than 160,000 Coloradans now have medical and dental coverage.

The influx of people needing treatment prompted Clear Creek Dental to open a secondary office dedicated solely to Medicaid patients at 373 W. Drake Road, Suite 6, in Fort Collins.

"Our goal is to serve this population in our local community that has not had affordable access to dental care," said Dr. Alex Knecht, the dentist who owns the office.
