The political odd couple\u2019s new book, \u201cLove & War: Twenty Years, Three Presidents, Two Daughters and One Louisiana Home,\u201d chronicles their public and personal lives and their move from Washington to New Orleans post-Katrina. Matalin, a Republican, and Carville, a Democrat, recently spoke with U.S. News about what\u2019s kept their marriage intact and how Washington could take a lesson. Excerpts:\n\nWhat has kept you both together for all of these years?\n\nMatalin: Our basic philosophical thrust about the level of government interaction is diametrically opposed, but our love for policy and politics and the need for informed citizenry and participatory democracy is the same. That we disagree on policy was tough, but it\u2019s not one of those deal-breakers. We\u2019re very practical in our local politics, and we\u2019re philosophically opposed on the role and scope of government, but we love each other. What can I say?\n\nCarville: I just think that at the end of the day, it\u2019s one of those kind of unexplainable things.\n\n[Check out U.S. News Weekly, an insider's guide to politics and policy.]\n\nDo you talk politics at home or is it off-limits?\n\nMatalin: We don\u2019t. We have pretty vigorous and active lives. We like to fish. We like to cook. We like history. We like church. Talking about the impact of the minimum wage is just not something that is high on our list of fun things to do. We don\u2019t mind talking about strategy and such and news of the day, but it takes its priority in relationship to what else is going on that day.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most divisive issue now?\n\nCarville: I guess, if we brought it up, Obamacare, what constitutes good economic policy. [That\u2019s] if I wanted to provoke or discuss it, [but] I have no desire to do that. I\u2019m not going to change, and she\u2019s not going to change.\n\nMatalin: We formed a kind of a pattern. We got in such horrible fights over Iraq that James just decided we weren\u2019t going to discuss it. My presumption is that if we got into it about Obamacare, we\u2019d get just as loud and as angry. I just think it\u2019s an atrocity in every conceivable way. I\u2019m sure he disagrees. We kind of agree on energy policy. We agree on local politics.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Republican Party.]\n\nWhy did you leave Washington?\n\nCarville: I was more about going somewhere than leaving somewhere. I never hated Washington. But it just wasn\u2019t home. I think the storm, and I talk about it a lot in the book, really drew me back. I have my own kind of views about Washington, the culture, whatever it is. I just love the sense of place and the fragility of [New Orleans], and the storm and everything just made me really push toward going home.\n\nHave any lessons from your time in politics had an impact on your family life?\n\nMatalin: One of the things every parent learns early is that kids can\u2019t at young ages distinguish between debating \u2013 what we thought was a healthy debate \u2013 and fighting. So that was the initial curtailment of talking about politics. And then, secondly, in our particular case, [our children] didn\u2019t like public displays of opinions about politics. They took them too personally. Complete strangers attacking their parents \u2013 that was strange to them. But on the flip side, they really understand the connection and the impact of being an involved citizen.\n\nAny early predictions for the midterms?\n\nCarville: Most prognosticators would say that it would be more difficult for the Democrats to win the House than it would be for Republicans to win the Senate. I probably agree with that. I think the Democrats probably have a 20 percent chance to win the House. That\u2019s conventional wisdom, and I would put myself somewhere in there.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on Obamacare.]\n\nWhat are your thoughts on \u2013 and for \u2013 polarized Washington?\n\nCarville: First of all, make sure that you do in fact disagree on everything. Because there might be things you find out that you can agree on. And then, sometimes people have to disagree. Washington has something that marriages don\u2019t: [the] enormously powerful and wealthy influence of lobbies, government relations offices, super PACs.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "James Carville and Mary Matalin Dish on Politics and Marriage", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "A Democrat and a Republican explain how they've stayed married despite political disagreements.", "title": "Survival Tips From a Political Odd Couple", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/02/11/james-carville-and-mary-matalin-dish-on-politics-and-marriage", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/0a/9d/f2e29f0a4e74b6de1402ff68012e/140210-carvillematalin-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "A Democrat and a Republican explain how they've stayed married despite political disagreements.", "card": "summary", "title": "James Carville and Mary Matalin Dish on Politics and Marriage"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Feb. 11, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Michael Morella,politics,Republican Party,Democratic Party,Washington, D.C.,Congress,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A Democrat and a Republican explain how they've stayed married despite political disagreements."}, "article_summary": "Matalin, a Republican, and Carville, a Democrat, recently spoke with U.S. News about what\u2019s kept their marriage intact and how Washington could take a lesson.\nCarville: I just think that at the end of the day, it\u2019s one of those kind of unexplainable things.\n[Check out U.S. News Weekly, an insider's guide to politics and policy.]\nWe\u2019re very practical in our local politics, and we\u2019re philosophically opposed on the role and scope of government, but we love each other.\nMatalin: Our basic philosophical thrust about the level of government interaction is diametrically opposed, but our love for policy and politics and the need for informed citizenry and participatory democracy is the same."}
