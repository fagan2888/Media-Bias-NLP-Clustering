Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), all states have exchanges \u2014 most of which are federally run \u2014 that help consumers find and buy health coverage.\n\nMay 11 is the federal deadline for insurers to inform the government of their exchange plans for 2017.\n\nDespite United\u2019s decision to pull out of the Georgia exchange next year, Allen said Harken Health, an independent subsidiary of United, will be a participant.\n\nUnited, citing financial losses, had warned weeks ago that it might pull out of the exchanges.\n\nIt said in January that it had lost $720 million nationally on its individual-market health plans in 2015, the first year the company participated in health insurance exchanges.\n\nThe insurer said the losses stemmed from sicker-than-average consumers enrolling in its health plans and a surplus of people signing up beyond the regular enrollment period. The insurer ended last year with about 500,000 enrollees in exchange plans.\n\nOther insurers also have criticized exchange enrollment rules for people who sign up outside the annual \u201cenrollment window\u201d \u2014 in other words, beyond the sign-up deadline.\n\nThe ACA allows customers to buy coverage outside the standard time frame if they lose a job, get divorced or have a child, among other reasons. But insurers want the federal government to take a closer look at such people, to find out whether some of them truly qualify for exemption from the time rules.\n\nThe law established an enrollment window, officially known as an open enrollment period, to prevent people from simply waiting until they became sick before they bought insurance. But insurers say it has become too easy for customers to sign up past the proper deadline.\n\nThe federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently outlined several changes it said it was making to help shore up exchange enrollment windows.\n\nBill Custer, a health insurance expert at Georgia State University, said Friday that United \u201cobviously is making a business decision on where to put their resources.\u201d\n\nThe company and other insurers feel that the enrollment rules are \u201ctoo easy to game the system,\u201d he said.\n\nHealth insurance markets in general \u2014 and the exchanges specifically \u2014 are in flux, Custer said. \u201cThe model is changing for all insurers.\u201d\n\nUnited\u2019s pullout is a blow to the Georgia exchange, he said. \u201cAny time consumers lose choice in the exchange, it\u2019s a setback.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut he said it\u2019s difficult to believe that United, the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, will remain out of the exchange market forever. \u201cThe ACA has created a market that insurers will have to adapt to,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nGeorgians may also lose other insurance exchange options if the pending mergers of Aetna and Humana, and Anthem and Cigna, are approved by regulators.\n\nMore than 580,000 Georgians signed up for coverage in the insurance exchange for this year.\n\nThe total of 587,845 during the sign-up period, which ended Jan. 31, was a 9 percent increase over last year\u2019s Georgia total of 536,929 at the end of open enrollment.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s enrollment total trailed that of Florida, Texas and North Carolina among states using the federally run exchange.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Health, Local News, Andy Miller", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "UnitedHealthcare will not offer any health plans on Georgia\u2019s insurance exchange in 2017, state officials say.", "title": "UnitedHealthcare quitting Georgia exchange for next year", "url": "http://onlineathens.com/health/2016-04-10/unitedhealthcare-quitting-georgia-exchange-next-year", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/AP_1603301549487043.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "article_summary": "UnitedHealthcare will not offer any health plans on Georgia\u2019s insurance exchange in 2017, state officials say.\n\u201cThe model is changing for all insurers.\u201dUnited\u2019s pullout is a blow to the Georgia exchange, he said.\nMore than 580,000 Georgians signed up for coverage in the insurance exchange for this year.\nThe giant Minnesota-based health insurer also said this week that it will pull out of Arkansas\u2019 exchange for next year.\nThe federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently outlined several changes it said it was making to help shore up exchange enrollment windows."}
