The HBO talk show host asserted on his show Friday night that the Tea Party \u2013 which celebrated its fifth anniversary this week \u2013 started not because of economic concerns but rather the color of President Barack Obama\u2019s skin.\n\n\u201cIt was about a black president,\u201d Maher said about the Tea Party\u2019s origins.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s bulls***,\u201d The Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol retorted back at him. \u201cThat is total bulls***. You think tens of millions of people just out there \u2014 even you don\u2019t believe that,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re just saying that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI totally believe that,\u201d Maher insisted.\n\nEarlier in the segment, Maher attempted to defend socialism by claiming that many of the companies that had been bailed out by the federal government in 2008 and 2009 had since paid back their debts to the treasury in full (or close to it). Kristol then explained to the liberal talk show host that the Tea Party had formed in response to President Obama\u2019s plans for healthcare reform (later known as the Affordable Care Act) and the passage of the $830 billion stimulus plan and the Trouble Asset Relief Program (TARP).\n\n\u201cThey were right to be worried about them, I think they were very bad precedent,\u201d Kristol said of the stimulus plan and TARP.\n\nConservative CNN commentator Margaret Hoover later chimed in, arguing that the Tea Party started out as \u201ca truly fiscal disciplinary mass movement\u201d calling out politicians on both sides of the spectrum but later grew out-of-control after the 2010 Midterm elections, as conservative firebrands like Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and grassroots organizations took over the movement.\n\nWatch the NSFW-segment below.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Red Alert Politics is owned by the same parent company as The Weekly Standard.\n\nh/t The Blaze", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Bill Maher's made some ridiculously outrageous claims about Republicans over the years, but his latest blows them all out of the water.
