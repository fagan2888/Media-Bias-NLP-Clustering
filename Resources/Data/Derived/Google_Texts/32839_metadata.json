Temperatures are expected to be above-freezing in the region on Sunday.\n\nAt least five people have died in accidents related to the ice storm, and another three have died in North Texas flash floods. One person is still missing. Thousands of people are without power as accumulated ice has downed power lines.\n\nMeanwhile, with up to 4 inches of rain expected in northeast Texas and central Arkansas, a flash flood threat continues in North Texas and most of Arkansas.\n\nRain is forecast Sunday from Texas to the Mid-Atlantic states. Freezing rain is expected in southern Nebraska and central Kansas.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Forecasters say a band of storms moving slowly through the nation's midsection is leaving Texas but will likely dump more freezing rain on parts of Oklahoma and Kansas.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/news/national/headlines/The-Latest-Freezing-rain-ice-forecast-in-Oklahoma-Kansas-357713031.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/ICY+ROADS22.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Forecasters say a band of storms moving slowly through the nation's midsection is leaving Texas but will likely dump more freezing rain on parts of Oklahoma and Kansas.", "title": "The Latest: Freezing rain, ice forecast in Oklahoma, Kansas"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Forecasters say a band of storms moving slowly through the nation's midsection is leaving Texas but will likely dump more freezing rain on parts of Oklahoma and Kansas.", "title": "The Latest: Freezing rain, ice forecast in Oklahoma, Kansas", "url": "http://www.kake.com/news/national/headlines/The-Latest-Freezing-rain-ice-forecast-in-Oklahoma-Kansas-357713031.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/ICY+ROADS22.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "The Latest: Freezing rain, ice forecast in Oklahoma, Kansas", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "The Latest Freezing rain, ice forecast in Oklahoma"}, "article_summary": "Forecasters say a band of storms moving slowly through the nation's midsection is leaving Texas but will likely dump more freezing rain on parts of Oklahoma and Kansas.\nFreezing rain is expected in southern Nebraska and central Kansas.\nThe National Weather Service says the storms causing icy conditions in Oklahoma and Kansas are expected to last through Saturday night.\nMeanwhile, with up to 4 inches of rain expected in northeast Texas and central Arkansas, a flash flood threat continues in North Texas and most of Arkansas.\nAt least five people have died in accidents related to the ice storm, and another three have died in North Texas flash floods."}
