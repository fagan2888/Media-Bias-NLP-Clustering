But two years of unforced errors \u2014 most recently including clumsy, nakedly political and utterly unsuccessful bids to ban the carriage horses and put the brakes on Uber, along with his stature-diminishing attempts to offer himself as a national progressive icon \u2014 is really pushing it.\n\nStill, critics who breathlessly branded him a one-term mayor should admit: The city\u2019s fundamentals \u2014 low crime, cranes everywhere, record crowds and swollen tax coffers \u2014 have held up in de Blasio\u2019s New York. And while white voters in particular remain skeptical, his public opinion numbers have rebounded enough that fellow Democrats at least have put down the 2017 primary lines of attack they\u2019d started field-testing last year.\n\nSpeaking of fundamentals, though, the chronic conditions that were sapping New York City\u2019s vitality when de Blasio took office are still doing so. You could even call it a tale of two cities \u2014 a tale that, it turns out, defies cheap slogans and quick fixes.\n\nThe New York City Housing Authority, our city within our city housing a population about the size of Miami\u2019s, remains a moldy, deteriorating mess.\n\nStreet homelessness is up, the shelter system is an overcrowded disaster and the seriously mentally ill still aren\u2019t getting the help they and the rest of us need them to receive.\n\nThe city\u2019s public hospital system, the care provider of last resort, is hemorrhaging money.\n\nAnd Rikers Island, despite a prisoner population less than half its peak two decades ago, is a dysfunctional if not downright dystopian place.\n\nThere are two through-lines connecting these problems.\n\nFirst, that these are systems that deal with the neediest among us, and that are overburdened, underfunded and overlooked by too many of the New Yorkers who don\u2019t depend on or encounter them \u2014 even as every New Yorker senses in their peripheral vision, as they see more panhandlers and mentally ill people on their streets and trains, how these problems interlock.\n\nSecond, these are systems that festered under Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who largely got a political pass for them. De Blasio, in part because of the grandiloquent promises he made when running for mayor, does not.\n\nThe truth is that these are things a mayor can\u2019t do alone. That the feds have largely abandoned their financial commitments to. That Gov. Cuomo has little interest in helping de Blasio claim credit for fixing.\n\nBut in shining a light on the \u201cother\u201d New York, and blaming Bloomberg for its troubles, de Blasio has taken political responsibility for its wellbeing.\n\nAnd having done so, he\u2019s been getting pummeled by left-right combinations, both from New Yorkers who just want orderly streets and the \u201cbad old days\u201d kept at bay and from those who want the miracle cures \u2014 to keep failed hospitals open, make NYCHA\u2019s aging buildings decent places to live again, city jails places that treat every inmate with basic human decency \u2014 de Blasio suggested he could provide but has yet to deliver.\n\nThis is a fix to be in.\n\nOccasionally, in attempts to wriggle free, de Blasio has turned his back on parts of that second city, as when he seemed to promise a powerful business group last year that he\u2019d resume his predecessors\u2019 practice of rousting the street homeless from Manhattan\u2019s sprawling central business district.\n\nBut for the most part, he\u2019s taken ownership of the intractable problems of the neediest New Yorkers \u2014 not the many of us who\u2019ve felt like bystanders to or casualties of the city\u2019s prosperity, but the group economically below that. The ones who need outside help, temporarily or for years, to stand up their own lives and who are often unable to access or even resistant to accepting that help.\n\nThe ones who aren\u2019t exactly a potent voting bloc. And who the rest of us are at the mercy of in public spaces if they don\u2019t either find the help they need or end up jailed in lieu of it, but are instead just left to their own devices.\n\nStanding up for those New Yorkers is to de Blasio\u2019s credit. The question now is what he does to actually improve their lives.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Harry Siegel", "twitter": {"description": "As Mayor de Blasio\u2019s approval ratings cratered last year, New Yorkers waited to see if he\u2019d ever manage to get out of his own way.", "title": "Harry Siegel: Bill de Blasio\u2019s two cities balancing act", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/harry-siegel-bill-de-blasio-cities-balancing-act-article-1.2569710", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2569709.1458335360!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/bratton.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Harry Siegel", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "nydn_tags": "bill de blasio, affordable housing, nyc homeless, rikers island, andrew cuomo, nycha", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-03-20T09:00:00", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/harry-siegel-bill-de-blasio-cities-balancing-act-article-1.2569710", "parsely-title": "Harry Siegel: Bill de Blasio\u2019s two cities balancing act", "sailthru.date": "2016-03-20T05:00:00-0400", "sailthru.title": "Harry Siegel: Bill de Blasio\u2019s two cities balancing act", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2569709.1458335360!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/bratton.jpg", "description": "As Mayor de Blasio\u2019s approval ratings cratered last year, New Yorkers waited to see if he\u2019d ever manage to get out of his own way.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "As Mayor de Blasio\u2019s approval ratings cratered last year, New Yorkers waited to see if he\u2019d ever manage to get out of his own way.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "As Mayor de Blasio\u2019s approval ratings cratered last year, New Yorkers waited to see if he\u2019d ever manage to get out of his own way.", "title": "Harry Siegel: Bill de Blasio\u2019s two cities balancing act", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/harry-siegel-bill-de-blasio-cities-balancing-act-article-1.2569710", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2569709.1458335360!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/bratton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "bill de blasio, affordable housing, nyc homeless, rikers island, andrew cuomo, nycha", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Harry Siegel", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2569709.1458335360!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/bratton.jpg"}, "article_summary": "The New York City Housing Authority, our city within our city housing a population about the size of Miami\u2019s, remains a moldy, deteriorating mess.\nThe city\u2019s public hospital system, the care provider of last resort, is hemorrhaging money.\nSpeaking of fundamentals, though, the chronic conditions that were sapping New York City\u2019s vitality when de Blasio took office are still doing so.\nYou could even call it a tale of two cities \u2014 a tale that, it turns out, defies cheap slogans and quick fixes.\nAs Mayor de Blasio\u2019s approval ratings cratered last year, New Yorkers waited to see if he\u2019d ever manage to get out of his own way."}
