Greta Van Susteren obviously has no problem with people putting President Obama‘s feet to the fire, but objected to Univision and Fusion anchor Jorge Ramos “insulting” Obama during a contentious interview yesterday.

During one particularly vibrant back-and-forth, Ramos brought up the “deporter-in-chief” line used by some critics of his immigration policy. Obama confronted Ramos and claimed the anchor had used that phrase too, though the line has been mostly attributed to the head of La Raza.

Van Susteren thought for any journalist to bring up a line like that before the president is just out of line. She said, “I thought the anchor was insulting to the president. It’s one thing to ask tough questions, but I think it’s insulting.”
