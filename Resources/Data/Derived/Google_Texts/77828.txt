A spokesperson for the Pentagon admitted live anthrax spores were accidentally shipped to nine states, as well as to a U.S. base in South Korea, Osan.

In a statement, the Pentagon said the “inadvertent transfer of samples containing live Bacillus anthracis,” or anthrax, began with a U.S. defense department lab in Dugway, Utah, the Guardian reported.

Officials thought the spores were dead. Fox News reported four government workers are being treated for exposure.

Col. Steve Warren, acting press secretary for the Pentagon, said in a media conference there is “no known risk to the general public” and lab workers at Dugway were “working as part of a DoD effort to develop a field-based test to identify biological threats in the environment.”

The Pentagon joined forces with the Centers for Disease Control to investigate the mishap. Officials declined to say when the shipment took place.

ABC News reported the affected states were California, Texas, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey and New York.

This isn’t the first government mistake involving anthrax.

A year ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported staff in Georgia were mistakenly exposed to live anthrax spores while conducting an experiment.
