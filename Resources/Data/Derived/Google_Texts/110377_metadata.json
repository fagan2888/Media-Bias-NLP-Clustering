Former government staff and ministers are expected to be called.\n\nDeaths arising from Labor's home insulation scheme:\n\n\u2022 October 14, 2009: Matthew Fuller, 25, is electrocuted laying insulation sheeting in the ceiling cavity of a house in Meadowbrook (Qld). He had started work with company 12 days earlier.\n\n\u2022 November 18, 2009: Rueben Barnes, 16, electrocuted laying batts in the ceiling cavity of a house at Stanwell (Qld). He had started with the company 21 days earlier.\n\n\u2022 November 21, 2009: Marcus Wilson, 19, dies from hyperthermia complications after installing batts in a St Clair (NSW) home in 40 degree heat.\n\n\u2022 February 4, 2010: Mitchell Sweeney, 22, is electrocuted laying insulation sheeting in the ceiling cavity of a home at Millaa Millaa (Qld). He had started at a new company a week earlier.\n\nWith Marissa Calligeros and AAP", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Queensland, Political News", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Between October 2009 and February 2010, four young men lost their lives while at work.", "title": "Commission begins into insulation deaths", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/commission-begins-into-insulation-deaths-20131222-2zsw5.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/2/z/s/x/q/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.2zsw5.png/1387750631193.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/2/z/s/x/q/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.2zsw5.png/1387750631193.jpg"}, "description": "Between October 2009 and February 2010, four young men lost their lives while at work.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Commission begins into insulation deaths"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Between October 2009 and February 2010, four young men lost their lives while at work."}, "article_summary": "In one of the first moves of the Abbott government, a Royal Commission was established to find out what went wrong.\nMr Potts said the royal commission was not just about inquiring into the deaths of the installers, ''but the circumstances that surrounded the deaths, the government decisions, the ministerial input''.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten has also written to the government asking that the royal commission focus on workplace safety.\nOn Monday, a Royal Commission of Inquiry hopes to begin to find out why.\nDeaths arising from Labor's home insulation scheme:\u2022 October 14, 2009: Matthew Fuller, 25, is electrocuted laying insulation sheeting in the ceiling cavity of a house in Meadowbrook (Qld)."}
