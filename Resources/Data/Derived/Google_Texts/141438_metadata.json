And hundreds of other tablets stand ready for checkout.\n\nEven the librarians imitate Apple\u2019s dress code, wearing matching shirts and that standard-bearer of geek-chic, the hoodie. But this $2.3 million library might be most notable for what it does not have \u2014 books.\n\nThat makes Bexar County\u2019s BiblioTech the nation\u2019s only bookless public library, a distinction that has attracted scores of digital bookworms, plus emissaries from as far away as Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cI told our people that you need to take a look at this. This is the future,\u201d said Mary Graham, vice president of South Carolina\u2019s Charleston Metro Chamber of Commerce. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be building new library facilities, this is what you need to be doing.\u201d\n\nAll-digital libraries have been part of college campuses for years. But Bexar County, which runs no other libraries, made history when it decided to open BiblioTech. According to information gathered by the American Library Association, it is the first bookless public library system in the country.\n\nSimilar proposals in other communities have been met with doubts. In California, the city of Newport Beach floated the concept of a bookless branch in 2011 until a backlash put stacks back in the plan. Nearly a decade earlier in Arizona, the Tucson-Pima library system opened an all-digital branch, but residents who said they wanted books got their way.\n\nGraham toured BiblioTech in the fall and is pushing Charleston leaders for a bond measure in 2014 to fund a similar concept, right down to the aesthetic reminiscent of Apple.\n\nBut Apple Stores aren\u2019t usually found in parts of town like this. BiblioTech is on the city\u2019s economically depressed South Side and shares an old strip mall with a Bexar County government building.\n\n60th in literacy\n\nSan Antonio is the nation\u2019s seventh-largest city but ranks 60th in literacy, according to census figures. In the early 2000s, community leaders in Bibliotech\u2019s neighborhood complained about not even having a nearby bookstore, said Laura Cole, BiblioTech\u2019s project coordinator. A decade later, Cole said, most families in the area still don\u2019t have wireless Internet access.\n\n\u201cHow do you advance literacy with so few resources available?\u201d she said.\n\nResidents are taking advantage now, however. The library is on pace to surpass 100,000 visitors in its first year. Finding an open iMac among the four dozen at BiblioTech is often difficult, and about half of the facility\u2019s e-readers are checked out at any given time, each loaded with up to five books. One of BiblioTech\u2019s regulars is a man teaching himself Mandarin.\n\nHead librarian Ashley Elkholf came from a traditional Wisconsin high school library and recalled the scourges of her old job: items hopelessly lost in the stacks, pages thoughtlessly ripped out of books and items that went unreturned by patrons who were unfazed by measly fines and lax enforcement.\n\nBut in the nearly four months since BiblioTech opened, Elkholf has yet to lend out one of her pricey tablets and never see it again. The space is also more economical than traditional libraries despite the technology: BiblioTech purchases its 10,000-title digital collection for the same price as physical copies, but the county saved millions because the building\u2019s design didn\u2019t need to accommodate printed books.\n\n\u201cIf you have bookshelves, you have to structure the building so it can hold all of that weight,\u201d Elkholf said. \u201cBooks are heavy, if you\u2019ve ever had one fall on your foot.\u201d\n\nCheaper to build\n\nIn Austin, for example, the city is building a downtown library to open in 2016 at the cost of $120 million. Even a smaller traditional public library that recently opened in nearby suburban Kyle cost that city about $1 million more than BiblioTech.\n\nOn her first visit, 19-year-old Abigail Reyes was looking only for a quiet space to study for an algebra exam. But she got a quick tutorial from a librarian on how to search for digital books and check out tablets.\n\n\u201cI kind of miss the books,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cI don\u2019t like being on the tablets and stuff like that. It hurts my eyes.\u201d\n\nAcross the room, Rosemary Caballeo tried shopping for health insurance on a set of computers reserved for enrollment in the Affordable Care Act. Her restless 2-year-old ran around and pawed at a row of keyboards. The little girl shrieked loudly. She was soon whisked outside by her father.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s still a library.\n\nPaul J.
