Sean Parnell. He is excited for the opportunity.\n\n\u201cWhat people were telling us throughout the campaign was they wanted change and they were tired of the fights,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI think what we offered was an opportunity of working together.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Walker will be sworn in as the 11th governor of Alaska and its first not affiliated with a political party. Two governors, Bill Egan and Wally Hickel, each served separate, non-consecutive terms.\n\nHickel, Walker\u2019s mentor, served his first term as a Republican and his second as a member of the Alaskan Independence Party.\n\nWalker, who finished behind Parnell in the 2010 GOP gubernatorial primary, ran this time as an independent, saying it was time to put politics aside for the betterment of the state. The campaign picked up momentum when, faced with the potential of splitting the opposition vote with the Democratic candidate Byron Mallott, Walker and Mallott - who often found themselves at debates or forums without Parnell, agreeing on many issues - banded together to create a \u201cunity\u201d ticket. As part of the package, Mallott abandoned his gubernatorial ambitions to become Walker\u2019s running mate, and Walker changed his voter registration from Republican to undeclared.\n\nNo deals were cut with Democrats, and there can only be one governor, Walker said. However, he has made clear his intent to reach out to Mallott as part of his decision-making process.\n\nKay Brown, executive director of the state Democratic Party, said she hopes to see a coalition-type government where different points of view are represented. \u201cThe government should strive to be inclusive and to listen carefully to all points of view and make decisions that reflect what\u2019s best for people as a whole, society as a whole,\u201d she said.\n\nThe last time Walker served in political office, as the youngest mayor of Valdez during the hectic early days of the trans-Alaska pipeline, Jimmy Carter was in the White House. Now 63, Walker, who was born and raised in Alaska, built a law career focused on oil and gas and municipal government issues. He is perhaps best known for his efforts to advance an all-Alaska gas line, which runs from the North Slope to tidewater.\n\nLongtime friend Merrick Peirce called Walker a family man who is warm, hard-working and genuine. \u201cHe has never said anything privately that was not consistent with what he has said publicly,\u201d Peirce, who worked with Walker through the Alaska Gasline Port Authority, said by email.\n\nIt was Walker\u2019s frustration with lack of state progress on a gas line that helped spur his return to politics in 2010. During this last campaign, while the gas line remained a major topic, Walker sought to show he wasn\u2019t a one-issue candidate.\n\nHe made expanding Medicaid coverage under the federal health care law a priority, something Parnell resisted, despite broad-based support, citing cost concerns. Walker said the state needs a fiscal plan and needs to take greater control of its destiny as an \u201cowner-state,\u201d not giving in to the whims of industry.\n\nIndustry groups that supported the rollback of oil production taxes championed by Parnell and his efforts to advance a liquefied natural gas project are anxious to see how the incoming administration will govern.\n\nWalker, who supported this year\u2019s failed effort to repeal the tax cut, has said he doesn\u2019t plan to offer changes to the tax structure this session. But he plans to monitor whether the tax is having the desired effect of more oil in the pipeline and increased industry investment. While he has raised concerns with Alaska\u2019s position in the gas project - namely, that Alaska isn\u2019t in the driver\u2019s seat - Walker also has said he is not interested in starting over or in slowing down efforts to make a gas line a reality.\n\nKara Moriarty, executive director of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, doesn\u2019t want delays, either. She said she\u2019s optimistic, but her group also is interested in who will comprise Walker\u2019s gas line team.\n\nOne of his first announced Cabinet picks was for Mark Myers, a former director of the Division of Oil and Gas, to replace Joe Balash as Natural Resources commissioner. Balash has been a prominent figure in gas line talks.\n\nSen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, who voted against Parnell\u2019s plan to advance the project, said if there\u2019s one person in the state he trusts on the gas line, it\u2019s Walker. He said he would defer to Walker and his administration a lot on the issue.\n\nRepublican legislative leaders, who had a good relationship with Parnell, expressed willingness to work with Walker. The GOP has controlled the Legislature since 2013, after Republicans regained control of the Senate from the bipartisan coalition that was in place for years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to be open and at least give him a chance and see what he can do because it\u2019s not about me and it\u2019s not about Bill Walker. It\u2019s about the future of the state of Alaska - and that\u2019s what we need to concentrate on,\u201d said House Speaker Mike Chenault, R-Nikiski.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Walker is coming into the governor's office faced with high expectations for a renewed spirt of bipartisanship in Alaska politics and the grim reality of plunging oil prices and gaping budget holes.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Bill Walker is coming into the governor\u2019s office faced with high expectations for a renewed spirt of bipartisanship in Alaska politics and the grim reality of plunging oil prices and gaping budget holes.", "title": "AP Interview: Alaska\u2019s Bill Walker knows tough days are ahead", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/28/ap-interview-walker-knows-tough-days-are-ahead/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/13/7b776cdba3c6412c650f6a7067007e7c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/13/7b776cdba3c6412c650f6a7067007e7c.jpg", "description": "Bill Walker is coming into the governor's office faced with high expectations for a renewed spirt of bipartisanship in Alaska politics and the grim reality of plunging oil prices and gaping budget hol", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "AP Interview: Alaska\u2019s Bill Walker knows tough days are ahead"}, "Author": "Becky Bohrer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Bill Walker, Sean Parnell, Republican Party, Byron Mallott"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29ba\"", "article_summary": "She said she\u2019s optimistic, but her group also is interested in who will comprise Walker\u2019s gas line team.\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to be open and at least give him a chance and see what he can do because it\u2019s not about me and it\u2019s not about Bill Walker.\nHe is perhaps best known for his efforts to advance an all-Alaska gas line, which runs from the North Slope to tidewater.\nDuring this last campaign, while the gas line remained a major topic, Walker sought to show he wasn\u2019t a one-issue candidate.\nKara Moriarty, executive director of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, doesn\u2019t want delays, either."}
