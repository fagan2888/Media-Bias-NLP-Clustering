John Kasich , a likely Republican presidential candidate, on Tuesday defended his decision to accept federal dollars for a Medicaid expansion as part of ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cThere is no money in Washington, it\u2019s money we sent from our state of Ohio to Washington that I was able to bring back to help the mentally ill get on their feet,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC.\n\n\u201cThere are more and more Republican governors who are getting their toes in the water and some of them sneaking into the water to do exactly what we are doing here. So I was just an early mover, but the fact is, overall, we have a healthier society.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT He defended the decision as rooted in Biblical teaching of helping the \u201cdowntrodden,\" and he pushed back against others in his party that panned Obama\u2019s Medicaid expansion as bloating the size of the federal government.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is the only other Republican governor in the field to expand Medicaid. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry chose not to.\n\n\u201cSometimes people say, 'well Kasich is not a conservative,' \u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI balanced budgets, cut taxes by more than anybody in the country, have a history of doing that. But yet I also think we have to reach out to people who live in the shadows. Sometimes I don't know that everybody gets it. Change is difficult, it always is.\u201d\n\nKasich also said his time working for Lehman Brothers just before the 2008 financial crash made him concerned about a creeping \u201cgreed factor\u201d that can lead to \u201cmistakes.\u201d\n\nWhile he cautioned that the conduct that led to the financial crash might not have been a crime, he didn't fully absolve those responsible.\n\n\u201cJust because you do something that's greedy that can end up in failure doesn't mean you committed a crime,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut you know what? There's a judgment that comes later, about how many people get hurt. And frankly, that's a pretty tough judgment in my opinion.\"\n\nKasich has flirted with a presidential bid for a while and will announce his late entry next week. He\u2019s currently well behind in the polls with less than a month before the first debate.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"The fact is, overall, we have a healthier society,\" he said.", "description": "\"The fact is, overall, we have a healthier society,\" he said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\"The fact is, overall, we have a healthier society,\" he said.", "title": "Kasich defends Medicaid expansion in Ohio", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/247895-kasich-defends-medicaid-expansion-in-ohio", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/kasichjohn_121414getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-14T16:23:03-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-14T16:23-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/247895-kasich-defends-medicaid-expansion-in-ohio", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-14T16:23-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Elliot Smilowitz", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Ben Kamisar", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",John Kasich,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-14T16:23:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-14T16:23:03-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/247895-kasich-defends-medicaid-expansion-in-ohio", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\"The fact is, overall, we have a healthier society,\" he said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Kasich defends Medicaid expansion in Ohio"}, "dcterms.title": "Kasich defends Medicaid expansion in Ohio"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a99\"", "article_summary": "John Kasich , a likely Republican presidential candidate, on Tuesday defended his decision to accept federal dollars for a Medicaid expansion as part of ObamaCare.\nKasich has flirted with a presidential bid for a while and will announce his late entry next week.\nChris Christie is the only other Republican governor in the field to expand Medicaid.\n\u201cJust because you do something that's greedy that can end up in failure doesn't mean you committed a crime,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere is no money in Washington, it\u2019s money we sent from our state of Ohio to Washington that I was able to bring back to help the mentally ill get on their feet,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC."}
