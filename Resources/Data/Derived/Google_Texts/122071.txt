Airlines are facing mounting pressure from Senate Democrats to prohibit hunters from bringing animal trophies on board following the uproar over the shooting of Cecil the lion.

Blocking hunters from transporting their trophies back to the U.S. would remove the incentive for them to kill endangered and threatened species, such as African lions, the senators say.

Delta, United and American Airlines have already bannedthe hunting trophies, but the senators noted that other airlines have yet to act.

"Americans who engage in trophy hunting do so because they are confident that they will be able to transport their trophies back to the United Staes with ease, including by airline,” Sens.(Conn.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) wrote Tuesday in a letter to the airline industry. “Passenger and freight airlines that permit shipment of animal trophies aid and abet trophy hunting and these abhorrent acts of barbarism.”

The leter comes amid international uproar over last month's shooting of Cecil, a popular African lion in Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwean government accused American dentist Walter Palmer of luring the lion out of a protected national park to shoot him, but Palmer blames the misunderstanding on his guides.

The senators asked the Airlines for America and International Air Transport Association for a list of their members’ policies regarding hunting trophies.

They also demanded the airline industry prohibit the transportation of hunting trophies.

“As long as even one carrier will transport trophies into the United States, these individuals have a way to bring their ill-gotten goods home for display,” the senators said.
