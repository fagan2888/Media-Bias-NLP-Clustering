(CNSNews.com) - Never-Trumps should think about the U.S. Supreme Court, Republican Donald Trump told Fox News Thursday night.



He said he will appoint "wonderful, conservative, good, solid, brilliant judges," whose names he hopes to "lay out" before the Republican National Convention.



But if his critics decide to split the Republican vote by running an independent candidate, "now you have four to five Supreme Court justices that will be picked by Hillary Clinton," Trump said.

"The worst thing that can happen -- because I'm going to win. I'm going to win. And I'm going to put wonderful, conservative, good, solid brilliant judges in the form of (the late Justice Antonin) Scalia -- I'm going to actually lay them out.



"I'm going to discuss people. I'm going to--actually I've met with Heritage and a couple of groups.



"I'm going to actually lay them out...I think before the convention, yeah, I want to, put up 10, 12, 15 names that's the type of people that we'd like. I would like to do that."



Trump said he would choose the finalists from that list. "These are conservative judges, would be great judges."
