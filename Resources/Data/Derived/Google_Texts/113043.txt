• Update: 252 enroll on HealthSource RI (Oct. 2)

HealthSource RI, the state’s Obamacare marketplace, went live this morning – and promptly crashed.

But the site was back up before long, giving Rhode Islanders their first chance to play around with the HealthSource RI Insurance Selector Tool, the place where individuals can compare rates for different plans and see how much of a tax-credit subsidy they can get from the federal government to offset the cost.

Right now there’s only one way for most individuals to buy health insurance coverage in Rhode Island: Blue Cross & Blue Shield. Blue Cross is also, of course, the major seller of plans on the new HealthSource RI exchange. So comparing its 2013 and 2014 rates is one way to get a sense of how the costs compare.

The simple answer is this: the more female, old, poor or unhealthy you are, the more likely you’ll get a better deal from HealthSource RI than you can now. That’s not a big surprise, since the health law was designed to subsidize coverage for those categories of people partly by raising rates for younger, healthier ones.

Let’s look at some examples.

The BCBSRI BlueSolutions for HSA Direct 5000/10000 plan is currently available direct from Blue Cross and is now being sold through HealthSource RI, too. The plan has relatively low premiums and no co-pays, but a high $5,000 deductible and a $6,350 out-of-pocket maximum.

Here’s who won’t be happy with what he finds: a 29-year-old male who earns $46,000 a year. He makes too much money to qualify for any tax-credit subsidies, so he has to pay the full premium himself. The Blue Cross website quotes his 2013 premium as $120 a month for the BlueSolutions 5000/10000 plan; HealthSource RI quotes his 2014 premium as $186 – a jump of 55% in one year.

This is the “rate shock for bros” you might have read about. If you’re a single, healthy, middle-income guy who buys individual health coverage, the Affordable Care Act is probably going to cost you more.

The difference is much less dramatic for a woman in the same situation. A 29-year-old female who earns $46,000 and signs up for BlueSolutions 5000/10000 gets a 2013 quote of $173, about $53 more than it costs a male. But since the health law bars insurers from charging men and women different rates, HealthSource RI quotes her 2014 premium as the same $186 – which for her is a jump of only 7%.

Now let’s imagine our hypothetical 29-year-olds earn a lot less than that: $26,000 a year. The base rates they pay Blue Cross this year don’t change ($120 for men, $173 for women) but the HealthSource RI rate for the same plan is suddenly a lot cheaper: $86. That’s because of the Affordable Care Act’s tax-credit subsidy for lower-income individuals, which in this case is worth $100 to our hypothetical 29-year-old buyer.

The difference is even starker for a 55-year-old woman who earns $35,000 annually and buys individual health coverage. Blue Cross quotes a 2013 premium of $329 for her to buy the BlueSolutions 5000/10000 plan, and HealthSource RI quotes a 2014 premium of $371 for it – except she’ll only have to pay $136 thanks to the tax credit. That’s a huge drop of 59% (or $193) in how much her premium will cost.

For a 55-year-old woman who earns $46,000 – too much to qualify for a tax credit – her premium for BlueSolutions 5000/10000 will increase from $329 this year to $371 next year, or $42. That’s a 13% increase – not nothing, but significantly less than the 55% hike for our 29-year-old male who earns the same amount.

So that’s a quick, early glance at how individual premiums look on the new HealthSource RI marketplace compared with what’s available in the Rhode Island marketplace today. You can play around yourself using the HealthSource RI tool and the BCBSRI “Get a quote” tool.

Also, it’s worth noting that the individual marketplace isn’t all of HealthSource RI. The new portal is also offering health plans for Rhode Island small businesses with 50 or fewer employees.
