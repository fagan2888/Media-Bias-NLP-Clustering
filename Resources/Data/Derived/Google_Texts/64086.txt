Just as children outgrow the clothes they wear, Pediatric Associates of Wichita Falls has outgrown the building it has been in the past 10 years.

That’s why they’ve broke ground on a brand new, state-of-the-art $2.5 million clinic on the city’s southeast side, said Karen Johnson, office manager of husband Dr. Terry Johnson’s clinic. The location of the new clinic will be at 4420 Kimbell Dr. near Kickapoo Downtown Airport.

With about 13,000 patients and a staff of 25, the clinic is bursting at the seems.

“We’ve just outgrown it,” she said. “We know that we needed a bigger facility in order to bring in a couple more pediatricians and nurse practitioners. And our parking lot. We want to be able to accommodate our patients because we are swamped.”

Christy Koski with Hirschi Realtors and Michael Detrick of Nortex Realty, the listing agency, worked in cooperation to complete the transaction. Architects for the design of the new facility is SLA Architects, formerly Secord & Lebow.

Pete Durant & Associates out of Fort Worth will be the lead contractor on the project.

Michael Johnson said the build and move will mean moving from a 7,000-square-feet facility to 11,000, and increase the number of exam rooms from 17 to 24.

Pediatric Associates was able to make the decision to build the new clinic because of a change to Medicaid reimbursements, he said. As part of the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid reimbursement rates were increased to the same level as Medicare, and the clinic received prorated amounts for 2013 and 2014.

About 70 percent of the patients seen at the clinic are on Medicaid.

“Because of that, a big part of this chunk that went down toward the down payment is from the Affordable Care Act, the ACA payments ...,” Michael said. “The Medicare allowable rates have always been higher than the Medicaid rates.”

While some pediatricians are part of a group that houses several physician specialties, Karen said the new build will allow them to continue to be a stand-alone pediatric-focused clinic in a part of town where one doesn’t exist.

“We wanted to be on our own, and we just really wanted to be here. We could have paid double for the (other) property,” she said of other options. “We didn’t feel like that’s what we’re supposed to do.”

Karen said the new clinic in that area could be the beginning of more growth in that area of Wichita Falls.

Another important part of the clinic’s mission is taking care of people, whether it’s Wichita Falls or Nairobi. Michael said Dr. Johnson makes two trips to the African nation annually, and Dr. Jake Kaiser makes a trip, too.

They’re hoping to expand that mission overseas while they expand their mission here.
