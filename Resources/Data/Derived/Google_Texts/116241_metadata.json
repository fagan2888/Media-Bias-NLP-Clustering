Anti-government protesters have set up an extensive tent camp there and erected barricades of snow hardened with freezing water and studded with scrap wood and other junk.\n\nU.S. Sens. John McCain and Chris Murphy joined the anti-government demonstration to express support for them and their European ambitions, threatening sanctions against the government of President Viktor Yanukovych if authorities use more violence to disperse the protests.\n\nThe protests began Nov. 21 after Yanukovych announced he was backing away from signing a long-awaited agreement to deepen trade and political ties with the EU and instead focus on Russia, and have grown in size and intensity after two violent police dispersals.\n\nIn the face of the protests, which present a serious challenge to Yanukovych\u2019s leadership, Ukrainian officials this week renewed talks with the EU agreement and promised that they would sign the deal once some issues are worked out.\n\nHowever, the EU\u2019s top official on expansion issues, Stefan Fuele, cast doubt on the prospect Sunday, saying on his Twitter account that work is \u201con hold\u201d and that the words and actions of Yanukovych and his government are \u201cfurther and further apart.\u201d\n\nYanukovych backed off the agreement on the grounds that the EU was not providing adequate compensation to his economically struggling nation for potential trades losses with Russia. Russia, which for centuries controlled or exerted heavy influence on Ukraine, wants the country to join a customs union, analogous to the EU, which also includes Belarus and Kazakhstan.\n\nThe opposition says that union would effectively reconstitute the Soviet Union and remain suspicious that Yanukovych might agree to it when he meets Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.\n\nArseniy Yatsenyk, a top opposition leader, warned Yanukovych against making such a move.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Momentum builds on Sunday as nearly 200,000 protestors took to the streets of Kiev's central square", "author": "Maria Danilova and Yuras Karmanau", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Momentum builds on Sunday as nearly 200,000 protestors took to the streets of Kiev's central square", "title": "Anger against Ukraine president mounts as thousands converge on capital city", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/15/thousands_of_demonstrators_converge_on_ukraine_capital/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/460x-21.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Momentum builds on Sunday as nearly 200,000 protestors took to the streets of Kiev's central square", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/460x-21.jpg", "title": "Anger against Ukraine president mounts as thousands converge on capital city", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Anger against Ukraine president mounts as thousands converge on capital city", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, kiev, Ukraine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdefdc\"", "article_summary": "A much smaller demonstration of government supporters, about 15,000, was taking place about a kilometer (less than a mile) away from Kiev\u2019s Independence Square.\nRussia, which for centuries controlled or exerted heavy influence on Ukraine, wants the country to join a customs union, analogous to the EU, which also includes Belarus and Kazakhstan.\nThe opposition says that union would effectively reconstitute the Soviet Union and remain suspicious that Yanukovych might agree to it when he meets Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.\nArseniy Yatsenyk, a top opposition leader, warned Yanukovych against making such a move.\nAnti-government protesters have set up an extensive tent camp there and erected barricades of snow hardened with freezing water and studded with scrap wood and other junk."}
