His presidential ambitions, however, may be less substantive, though he did not hold back in teasing the gathered reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see what happens in \u201816,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t see the right person I will do something in \u201916; I will do it sure as you\u2019re sitting here.\u201d\n\nThose words neatly echoed threats he made during the last presidential campaign in 2012, not to mention the threats he made in the 2000 campaign to run on the Reform Party ticket. Back in 1987, he took out full page newspaper ads that suggested he might get involved in politics. \u201cThe world is laughing at America\u2019s politicians,\u201d Trump wrote in one of those ads. He never ran for public office.\n\nOfficially Trump was speaking at the National Press Club to talk about the power of branding\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s all about winning\u201d\u2014and to plug The Old Postal Office, a luxury hotel renovation project which his daughter Ivanka said would open in, you guessed it, 2016. After feasting on a lunch of Caesar salad, seared Atlantic codfish and Trump cookies\u2014a sugar cookie with symbols of his various real estate properties\u2014the billionaire gave a wide-ranging, seemingly extemporaneous, nearly hour-long speech that riffed on everyone from Cher to President George W. Bush.\n\nTrump talked about how he vanquishes celebrity foes through Twitter, including Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Cher. \u201cI hit [Cher] so hard she still doesn\u2019t know what happened,\u201d said Trump, who had feuded with the superstar singer over issues of politics, plastic surgery, hair implants and his line of products at Macy\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s the last I heard of her.\u201d\n\nTrump has 2.6 million followers, or as he put it, \u201cmany, many millions.\u201d\n\nTrump also fielded a few personal questions, including one on how he relaxes. \u201cI build buildings,\u201d replied Trump to laughter.\n\nTrump briefly flickered at the top of the GOP polls at the beginning of the last presidential cycle, and said that the next round of candidates will have a particularly difficult time governing with most of the aspects of Obamacare in place. Trump even claimed that 2016 will be a \u201ccatastrophic year for the economy\u201d because of delays in the President\u2019s health care law.\n\n\u201cRepublicans better get smart because they are going to inherit a mess that has never been inherited before,\u201d said Trump. He also said he heard that HealthCare.gov cost $5 billion, which is not true, and joked he builds websites for $3. He ripped the Obama Administration for, among other things, creating a \u201cred line\u201d on Syria, saying America should not be involved in the brutal civil war, not approving the Keystone XL pipeline, and for yielding power to China.\n\nHe even threw in a knock on the previous occupant of the White House. \u201cWhat positive thing has happened to this country in the last 10 years?\u201d asked Trump at one point, apparently forgetting the success of his NBC reality show The Apprentice. \u201cI\u2019m not a Bush fan, believe me. He got us into Iraq.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The billionaire real estate developer and brand builder is still using the threat of a presidential campaign to get publicity for his business ventures.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The billionaire real estate developer and brand builder is still using the threat of a presidential campaign to get publicity for his business ventures.", "title": "Donald Trump: \"It's Actually My Hair\" And I May Still Run For President", "url": "http://time.com/120325/trump-hair-is-real-2016/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/494048401.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/494048401.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The billionaire real estate developer and brand builder is still using the threat of a presidential campaign to get publicity for his business ventures.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Donald Trump: \"It's Actually My Hair\" And I May Still Run For President"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "donald trump, obamacare, 2016 presidential election, syria,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "donald trump, president, campaign, 2016, hair, barack obama"}, "article_summary": "+ READ ARTICLEShortly after raising the possibility of a Trump for President campaign in 2016, Donald Trump tugged at his hair Tuesday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually my hair,\u201d he said, during a lunchtime address at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.\nHis presidential ambitions, however, may be less substantive, though he did not hold back in teasing the gathered reporters.\n\u201cRepublicans better get smart because they are going to inherit a mess that has never been inherited before,\u201d said Trump.\nTrump even claimed that 2016 will be a \u201ccatastrophic year for the economy\u201d because of delays in the President\u2019s health care law."}
