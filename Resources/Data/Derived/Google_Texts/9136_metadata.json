But on Tuesday night, President Barack Obama (D) reaffirmed his commitment to immigration reform, promising that he would pressure Congress to bring up the issue the morning after a deal to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling is passed.\n\nDuring an interview with Univision affiliate reporter Claudia Botero, the President touched on a variety of topics that affect Latinos, including the federal shutdown that has hurt more than 3 million Latino businesses. He argued that immigration reform will make the economy grow faster and bring down the deficit, since legalized immigrants would pay more in taxes than they currently do.\n\nOnce [the fiscal crisis] is done, you know, the day after I\u2019m going to be pushing to say, call a vote on immigration reform,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019m going to do so because I think it\u2019s really important for the country.\u201d\n\nHe also challenged House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) to call a floor vote on the Senate\u2019s immigration bill. \u201cWe had a very strong Democratic and Republican vote in the Senate. The only thing right now that\u2019s holding it back is again, Speaker Boehner not willing to call the bill on the floor of the House of Representatives. So we\u2019re going to have to get through this crisis that was unnecessary \u2026 if I have to join with other advocates and continue to speak out on that, and keep pushing, I\u2019m going to do so.\u201d\n\nObama also emphasized the importance of the Affordable Care Act for Latinos, declaring, \u201cWhat I\u2019m not going to do is to leave millions of people, including millions of Latinos, without the possibility of getting affordable health insurance simply because a small group in the Republican party has decided to make this their cause and they\u2019re threatening the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nLatinos have the lowest rates of health coverage in the country. If the Senate immigration reform bill debates are any indication, that Republicans will continue to prevent healthcare coverage for newly legalized immigrants. And contrary to what some Republicans may shout, undocumented immigrants do not qualify for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDuring his 2012 reelection campaign, Obama swore to make immigration reform a top priority\u2013 a promise that may have helped him to cinch 71 percent of the Latino vote (also partially thanks to Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201cself-deportation\u201d gaffe).\n\nIn June, the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform bill that some House Republicans immediately rejected as \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the Senate bill would actually help to reduce the federal budget deficit by $158 billion in the first ten years of its enactment, and then an additional $685 billion in the second decade.\n\nIn early October, House Democrats introduced an immigration bill that draws from the Senate bill, as well as House Republican-approved border security provisions. A spokesperson for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) said that the bill had \u201czero chance\u201d on the House floor.\n\nObama has also committed to detaining and deporting only the most serious immigrant offenders. Still, his administration is on track to deport two million immigrants by 2014 \u2014 more deportations in six years than the total number of immigrants deported before 1997. The vast majority of those deportees committed non-serious offenses, in some cases as minor as a traffic offense.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "President Barack Obama (D) affirmed his commitment to immigration reform, promising to pressure Congress to bring up the issue the morning after a deal is reached to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "President Barack Obama (D) affirmed his commitment to immigration reform, promising to pressure Congress to bring up the issue the morning after a deal is reached to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling.", "title": "President Obama Promises To Push For Immigration Reform \u2018The Day After\u2019 Government Shutdown Ends", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2013/10/16/2787021/obama-immigration-shutdown/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/President-Barack-Obama-Univision-Interview-10-15-2013-e1381927377388.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama (D) affirmed his commitment to immigration reform, promising to pressure Congress to bring up the issue the morning after a deal is reached to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling.", "title": "President Obama Promises To Push For Immigration Reform \u2018The Day After\u2019 Government Shutdown Ends", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/President-Barack-Obama-Univision-Interview-10-15-2013-e1381927377388-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@EstherYuHsiLee", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-immigration", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/President-Barack-Obama-Univision-Interview-10-15-2013-e1381927377388.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/President-Barack-Obama-Univision-Interview-10-15-2013-e1381927377388.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-16T10:18:16+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/estheryuhsilee"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b22\"", "article_summary": "Immigration President Obama Promises To Push For Immigration Reform \u2018The Day After\u2019 Government Shutdown Ends CREDIT: losangeles.univision.comDespite nationwide rallies in early October that led to the arrest of eight House Democrats, immigration reform has been relegated to Congress\u2019s back burner during the shutdown and debt ceiling crises.\nOnce [the fiscal crisis] is done, you know, the day after I\u2019m going to be pushing to say, call a vote on immigration reform,\u201d Obama said.\nIf the Senate immigration reform bill debates are any indication, that Republicans will continue to prevent healthcare coverage for newly legalized immigrants.\nIn early October, House Democrats introduced an immigration bill that draws from the Senate bill, as well as House Republican-approved border security provisions.\nHe argued that immigration reform will make the economy grow faster and bring down the deficit, since legalized immigrants would pay more in taxes than they currently do."}
