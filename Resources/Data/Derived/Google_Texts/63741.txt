As 2014 draws to a close, we sat down with Douglas Brooks, Director of the White House Office of National AIDS Policy (ONAP), to talk about his reflections on the White House’s World AIDS Day 2014 event and his thoughts about the work ahead in 2015 to move closer to an AIDS-free generation.

In his review of World AIDS Day, Mr. Brooks discusses the three key actions that will help move toward zero new HIV infections that NIH’s Dr. Anthony Fauci recommended during the White House World AIDS Day event. He also talks about the need for partners in the HIV/AIDS community to work with ONAP in the coming year to develop a new implementation timeline for the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.

We hope you will watch the video and/or listen to the interview, and share your own insights about priorities for 2015.
