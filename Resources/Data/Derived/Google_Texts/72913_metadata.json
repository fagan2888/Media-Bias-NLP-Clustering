Can Donald Trump really win his party\u2019s nomination? (Yes.) Can Bernie Sanders? (No.) But the primaries aren\u2019t the only things being polled; we\u2019re still getting updates on President Obama\u2019s overall approval. And something striking has happened on that front.\n\nAt the end of 2015 Mr. Obama was still underwater, with significantly more Americans disapproving than approving. Since then, however, his approval has risen sharply while disapproval has plunged. He\u2019s still only in modestly positive territory, but the net movement in polling averages has been about 11 percentage points, which is a lot.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on?\n\nWell, one answer is that voters have lately been given a taste of what really bad leaders look like. But I\u2019d like to think that the public is also starting to realize just how successful the Obama administration has been in addressing America\u2019s problems. And there are lessons from that success for those willing to learn.\n\nI know that it\u2019s hard for many people on both sides to wrap their minds around the notion of Obama-as-success. On the left, those caught up in the enthusiasms of 2008 feel let down by the prosaic reality of governing in a deeply polarized political system. Meanwhile, conservative ideology predicts disaster from any attempt to tax the rich, help the less fortunate and rein in the excesses of the market; and what are you going to believe, the ideology or your own lying eyes?\n\nBut the successes are there for all to see.\n\nStart with the economy. You might argue that presidents don\u2019t have as much effect on economic performance as voters seem to imagine \u2014 especially presidents facing scorched-earth opposition from Congress for most of their time in office. But that misses the point: Republicans have spent the past seven years claiming incessantly that Mr. Obama\u2019s policies are a \u201cjob killing\u201d disaster, destroying business incentives, so it\u2019s important news if the economy has performed well.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd it has: We\u2019ve gained 10 million private-sector jobs since Mr. Obama took office, and unemployment is below 5 percent. True, there are still some areas of disappointment \u2014 low labor force participation, weak wage growth. But just imagine the boasting we\u2019d be hearing if Mitt Romney occupied the White House.\n\nThen there\u2019s health reform, which has (don\u2019t tell anyone) been meeting its goals.\n\nBack in 2012, just after the Supreme Court made it possible for states to reject the Medicaid expansion, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that by now 89 percent of the nonelderly population would be covered; the actual number is 90 percent.\n\nThe details have been something of a surprise: fewer people than expected signing up on the exchanges, but fewer employers than expected dropping coverage, and more people signing up for Medicaid \u2014 which means, incidentally, that Obamacare is looking much more like a single-payer system than anyone seems to realize. But the point is that reform has indeed delivered the big improvements in coverage it promised, and has done so at lower cost than expected.\n\nThen there\u2019s financial reform, which the left considers toothless and the right considers destructive. In fact, while the big banks haven\u2019t been broken up, excessive leverage \u2014 the real threat to financial stability \u2014 has been greatly reduced. And as for the economic effects, have I mentioned how well we\u2019ve done on job creation?\n\nLast but one hopes not least, the Obama administration has used executive authority to take steps on the environment that, if not canceled by a Republican president and upheld by future Supreme Courts, will amount to very significant action on climate change.\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s quite a record. Assuming Democrats hold the presidency, Mr. Obama will emerge as a hugely consequential president \u2014 more than Reagan. And I\u2019m sure Republicans will learn a lot from his achievements.\n\nApril fools!\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nSeriously, there is essentially no chance that conservatives, whose ideas haven\u2019t changed in decades, will reconsider their dogma. But maybe progressives will be more open-minded.\n\nThe 2008 election didn\u2019t bring the political transformation Obama enthusiasts expected, nor did it destroy the power of the vested interests: Wall Street, the medical-industrial complex and the fossil fuel lobby are all still out there, using their money to buy influence. But they have been pushed back in ways that have made American lives better and more secure.\n\nThe lesson of the Obama years, in other words, is that success doesn\u2019t have to be complete to be very real. You say you want a revolution? Well, you can\u2019t always get what you want \u2014 but if you try sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160401032103, "twitter": {"description": "The president has had a lot of success addressing America\u2019s problems, which may surprise many on the left and the right.", "creator": "PaulKrugman", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/opinion/learning-from-obama.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004302950"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Learning From Obama", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/opinion/learning-from-obama.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004302950", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/opinion/learning-from-obama.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Learning  From  Obama", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 1, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-04-01", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Labor and Jobs", "published": "2016-04-01", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "keywords": "Obama  Barack,Presidents and Presidency (US),Presidential Election of 2016,United States Politics and Government,United States Economy,Environment,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Democratic Party,Republican Party,Labor and Jobs", "description": "The president has had a lot of success addressing America\u2019s problems, which may surprise many on the left and the right.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Paul Krugman", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "slug": "01krugman", "byl": "By PAUL KRUGMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The president has had a lot of success addressing America\u2019s problems, which may surprise many on the left and the right.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "utime": 20160401131102, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbStandard-v5.jpg", "news_keywords": "Environment", "CN": "conversation-starters", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 1, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "org": "Republican Party", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "CT": "spotlight", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/opinion/learning-from-obama.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The president has had a lot of success addressing America\u2019s problems, which may surprise many on the left and the right.", "title": "Learning From Obama"}, "pdate": 20160401, "des": "Labor and Jobs", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "feature", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/conversation-starters", "tagline": "Provocative looks at pressing issues.", "uri": "/spotlight/conversation-starters", "display-name": "Conversation Starters", "identifier": "conversation-starters", "type": "spotlight"}, "articleid": 100000004302950, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Learning From Obama", "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "At the end of 2015 Mr. Obama was still underwater, with significantly more Americans disapproving than approving.\nAssuming Democrats hold the presidency, Mr. Obama will emerge as a hugely consequential president \u2014 more than Reagan.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyAnd it has: We\u2019ve gained 10 million private-sector jobs since Mr. Obama took office, and unemployment is below 5 percent.\nThe lesson of the Obama years, in other words, is that success doesn\u2019t have to be complete to be very real.\nBut I\u2019d like to think that the public is also starting to realize just how successful the Obama administration has been in addressing America\u2019s problems."}
