Unfortunately, it became immediately apparent that Mr. Bush was not a good fit for that position.\n\nHe was terminated on May 9.\n\nBaker did not return phone calls for this story. Personnel Director Barbara DeSimone said Baker acted swiftly so he wouldn\u2019t incur any additional moving expenses. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to drag it out, and she thought it would be best before he moved his entire family down here,\u201d she said.\n\nDeSimone said the county owes Bush $1,615.39 (before taxes) for his four workdays.\n\nBush was the chief financial officer for a school district in Normal, Illinois, for four years. Before that, he held a similar position with Peoria County and had worked as a city manager for the town of Flora, Ill. He has a masters of public administration from Northern Illinois University.\n\nHe said he was shocked by Baker\u2019s decision \u2014 that he\u2019d never been through something like that before.\n\n\u201cAfter a few days we got to know each other, and she told me she was letting me go,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess she expected me to hit the ground running a little differently. I was surprised, but I respect her decision.\u201d\n\nBush said he wishes Catherine Pearson, Baker\u2019s second choice, better success.\n\n\u201cYou know, getting a new job is difficult,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThere were 2,000 miles between us and different cultures. I would hope the county would make me whole. I still spent $1,500 on gas and hotels, and I made a good faith effort to work there.\u201d\n\nPearson has worked for Citrus County since 2003, serving as assistant county administrator and community services director. She has supervised many of the same departments \u2014 community development, libraries, animal services, public transportation \u2014 that are under the public services division.\n\nCommissioners are scheduled to vote Tuesday to confirm Pearson\u2019s appointment and her $110,000 salary.\n\nlkinsler@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 371-1852\n\nTwitter @LKinslerTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 17 May 2014 16:34:07 -0400", "Description": "NEW PORT RICHEY \u2014 Pasco County Administrator Michele Baker realized she had made a mistake almost immediately after Erik Bush, her pick to replace Assistant County Administrator Suzanne Salich", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "NEW PORT RICHEY \u2014 Pasco County Administrator Michele Baker realized she had made a mistake almost immediately after Erik Bush, her pick to replace Assistant County Administrator Suzanne Salich", "title": "Pasco administrator fires new aide after 4 days", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/pasco-county/pasco-administrator-fires-new-aide-after-4-days-20140517/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2014-05-17T16:34:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Pasco administrator fires new aide after 4 days"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-05-17T16:34:07Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-05-17T16:34:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd38ec\"", "article_summary": "She has supervised many of the same departments \u2014 community development, libraries, animal services, public transportation \u2014 that are under the public services division.\n\u2014 Pasco County Administrator Michele Baker realized she had made a mistake almost immediately after Erik Bush, her pick to replace Assistant County Administrator Suzanne Salichs, started.\n\u201cAfter a few days we got to know each other, and she told me she was letting me go,\u201d he said.\nIn a memo to county commissioners, she wrote: Erik Bush was originally selected and started on May 6, 2014.\nUnfortunately, it became immediately apparent that Mr. Bush was not a good fit for that position."}
