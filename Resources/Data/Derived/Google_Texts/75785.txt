KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) â€” Pascal Siakam scored 17 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and his free throw with 10 seconds left in the game proved to be the winner as New Mexico clinched a share of back-to-back Western Athletic Conference championships by holding off Missouri-Kansas City 62-61 Saturday afternoon.

LaVell Boyd's 3-pointer pulled the Kangaroos within three, 59-56 with 20 seconds left.
