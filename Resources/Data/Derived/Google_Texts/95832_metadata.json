Moffit, Ph.D. Senior Fellow\n\nCenter for Health Policy Studies\n\nThe Obama Administration\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has announced that it will not finalize controversial elements of its proposed Medicare rule. The proposed rule would have undercut patient choice and reduced the competition that controls costs in the Medicare drug program (Part D).[1] Many key stakeholders and Members of Congress expressed concern with the proposed rules, and in response, Representative Renee Ellmers (R\u2013NC) introduced H.R. 4160, the Keep the Promise to Seniors Act, to block the regulation.\n\nUnder its original plan, the Administration\u2019s proposed changes would have inflicted serious damage on seniors\u2019 Medicare Part D benefits.\n\nRestricting Plan Choice\n\nThe proposed rules would have restricted plans in two major ways.\n\n1. Limiting \u201cParent Company\u201d to One Contract per PDP Region. CMS proposed to limit an insurer to one prescription drug plan (PDP) sponsor contract per region. According to CMS, in contract year 2013, there were 57 parent organizations that held more than one PDP sponsor contract through subsidiary contracting organizations. CMS argues that duplicate contracts create inefficiencies and do not reflect true competition: \u201cTwo subsidiaries of the same parent organizations offering plans in the same PDP region are not truly competitors as decisions concerning their operations are ultimately controlled by a single entity, or parent organization.\u201d\n\nWhile the truest form of competition among plans is at the insurer level, this rule would still have reduced the number of plans and thus decreased the plan choices available to seniors.\n\n2. Limiting Plans per Sponsor to Two. The rule proposed to limit an insurer to offer only two plans, one standard plan and one enhanced plan. CMS justified this by arguing that it \u201cmay \u2026 help ensure that beneficiaries can choose from a less confusing number of plans that represent the best value each sponsor can offer.\u201d\n\nRestricting the number of plans an insurer can offer would hamper seniors\u2019 choice and cause significant disruption in the Part D market.\n\nAvalere Health, a health care consulting firm, estimates that \u201cthe change would require 214 of the current 552 enhanced PDPs to be terminated or consolidated with an existing plan.\u201d Those 214 plans are sold by carriers that currently offer two enhanced PDPs in the same region and account for 39 percent of total enhanced plans. The study goes on:\n\nThe anticipated change in policy would impact 7.4 million of the 7.9 million (94 percent) Medicare beneficiaries who are currently enrolled in an enhanced plan\u2014including both beneficiaries whose plan will be terminated or consolidated and those whose plan will remain but may see changes in benefits or premiums as plan options and enrollees are consolidated.[2]\n\nChange in Drug Coverage Mandates\n\nObamacare granted the Secretary of Health and Human Services authority to establish new criteria to identify categories or classes of Part D drugs that must be included in every Part D plan formulary. Based on the criteria established in the proposed rule, three of the six existing classes of protected drugs would not meet the newly established criteria and therefore would not be required to be covered in each plan\u2019s drug formulary (though they propose to allow one to maintain its status through 2015).\n\nThe effect of this rule would have been a reduction in the drug mandates that a plan formulary must abide by. Thus, this would have had a positive impact on a plan\u2019s ability to compete. A plan could still include these drugs if that is what the market dictates, or it could exclude them from coverage, which could potentially reduce the cost of that plan, which would benefit both seniors and taxpayers. However, it is also critical that seniors have a broad scope of coverage options to ensure that they have a choice, something that this rule begins to limit.\n\nInterpretation of Non-Interference Clause\n\nThe noninterference clause in Part D excludes the government from participating in negotiations. It states:\n\n(i) NONINTERFERENCE.\u2014In order to promote competition under this part and in carrying out this part, the Secretary\u2014 (1) may not interfere with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and PDP sponsors; and (2) may not require a particular formulary or institute a price structure for the reimbursement of covered part D drugs.\n\nDespite the clear text of the law, CMS\u2019s proposed rule aimed to \u201cformally interpret\u201d the clause in a way that outlined more specifically what CMS can and cannot do. For example, CMS clarified that it cannot set a price formula or benchmark and cannot establish the parameters of any price concession (e.g., Medicaid-style rebates that are often proposed, including in the President\u2019s fiscal year 2015 budget proposal)\u2014even though this is already understood to be what the non-interference clause means.\n\nHowever, CMS\u2019s interpretation also stated that \u201cthe prohibition on interference in negotiations\u2026would not pertain to negotiations between Part D sponsors and pharmacies.\u201d\n\nThe legality of CMS\u2019s ability to interpret the clause in such a way is highly questionable.[3]\n\nPatient Satisfaction\n\nAlthough the Medicare prescription drug benefit adds to the insolvency of the Medicare program, using private-run plans rather than a government-run plan in Medicare Part D has exceeded all expectations. The program offers seniors a wide choice of drug therapies at competitive prices, and its dramatic achievement in controlling costs for both seniors and taxpayers is beyond dispute.[4]\n\nConcerning Part D and CMS\u2019s proposed rules, seniors understood that it would have a negative impact on them. According to a recent survey conducted by the Morning Consult, 88 percent of all seniors\u2014in different age, gender, and income categories\u2014are very or somewhat satisfied with the program, and three out of four prefer less expensive plans with smaller preferred networks rather than more expensive plans with broader networks. Significantly, eight out of 10 seniors opposed limiting the number of plans a company can offer to two in any geographic area.[5]\n\nBottom line: The Administration\u2019s effort to cancel or reduce Part D plans was no more popular than its policy to cancel plans or reduce competition in the commercial health insurance markets.[6] As the Administration reevaluates the rules, it would be wise to avoid the same mistakes as the original plan.\n\nAbout the Author Alyene Senger Research Associate\n\nCenter for Health Policy Studies Robert E.
