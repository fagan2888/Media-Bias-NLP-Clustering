Coakley, Baker out for redemption\n\nMartha Coakley is one weekend away from permanent infamy as a political choke artist or an electoral redemption that would be considered a mild surprise.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial nominee faces Republican rival Charlie Baker, who, like Coakley, lost a winnable race four years ago when he was defeated by Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick. Both candidates last week said that if they lose this time, they\u2019ll never run for office again.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt\u2019s added a personal dimension to the race as the clock winds down: Only one candidate will have a second act in politics.\n\n( POLITICO's polling center)\n\n\u201cAmerica loves redemption, so the redemption story in politics is an easy one to write,\u201d said Jane Swift, a Republican who served as interim governor of Massachusetts from 2001 to 2003. \u201cOnly one of them is going to be redeemed.\u201d\n\nCoakley\u2019s loss to Republican Scott Brown in a January 2010 special Senate election, which cost Democrats a supermajority in the chamber early in President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, turned her into a political pariah and the butt of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketches. She\u2019s worked quietly since to rebuild her brand, and operatives on both sides of the aisle say they see an improved campaigner with a competitive zeal that she lacked against Brown.\n\n\u201cThis campaign has been a good campaign for Martha Coakley,\u201d said William Weld, a former Republican governor who led the state in the 1990s and appointed Baker to senior positions. \u201cShe\u2019s, in my opinion, definitely picked up her game in the last month.\u201d\n\n( POLITICO's 2014 race ratings)\n\nBut it may not be enough. Baker has led in recent polls \u2014 telephone surveys from the Boston Globe and Western New England College out on Friday showed the Republican up mid-single digits \u2014 and the race is expected to be close.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a heavier burden for Martha to carry. Some Democrats still won\u2019t forgive her for having lost Ted Kennedy\u2019s seat. The media keeps reinforcing that,\u201d said Phil Johnston, former chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party.\n\nYet Baker, too, is seeking to overcome a negative narrative and revive his reputation after losing to Patrick in 2010, a banner year for Republicans around the country. Democrats savaged Baker at the time as a wealthy, out-of-touch health insurance executive with thin skin.\n\n\u201cHe was widely criticized last time for appearing to be without empathy for vulnerable people.\u201d Johnston said.\n\nWeld, Baker\u2019s political mentor, said his protege can barely conceal how badly he wants to win and reverse that perception. He\u2019s been campaigning in minority communities and closing the gap in Boston by appealing to moderate Democrats, hallmarks of previous victorious Republican campaigns.\n\n\u201cHis closing ad all but says, \u2018I want it; I want it; I want it,\u2019\u201d Weld said. \u201cI think this race means more to Charlie personally than it does to [Coakley]. She\u2019s had two terms in statewide office as the attorney general. She\u2019s had a fair amount of glory. Charlie, he\u2019s a page still waiting to be writ.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Baker downplays significance of a second failed bid for the governorship.\n\n\u201cIf we win, that\u2019s a dream come true, an opportunity to do something I really want to do for the people of Massachusetts, who I have great affection for,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cMassachusetts has been really good to me and my family. I want other people to have the same kind of opportunities I had.\n\nAnd if he loses? \u201cI\u2019ve been there before,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll get a job, and life goes on.\u201d\n\nCoakley\u2019s camp didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome political operatives see personality politics taking on outsize importance in this race, in part, because Massachusetts is largely insulated from the crises afflicting the nation. The overwhelmingly Democratic state has seen modest economic progress and largely approves of the job of Patrick, Obama and other elected leaders are doing. Unemployment is relatively low, and its Obamacare-style health care system predated the national health law and is still popular.\n\nThat\u2019s led to a somewhat aimless governor\u2019s race, with no single issue driving the debate and a heavy focus on each candidate\u2019s resume and personality. In the last two debates, voters learned that Baker considers himself a \u201cbook nerd\u201d and that Coakley can name the backup quarterback for the New England Patriots. She thinks Liam Neeson would play Baker in a movie, and both say they\u2019d rather win the election than the Mega Millions jackpot.\n\nBaker, who\u2019s been accused of being wooden and numbers-driven, cried openly in the closing minutes of the last debate as he recounted the story of a fisherman he met who fell on hard times, a moment that got more attention than the substance of the debate. Democrats have since criticized Baker\u2019s emotional outburst as contrived, noting that his exchange with the fisherman occurred in 2010, during his last run for office.\n\n\u201cI actually burst out laughing because I said, \u2018This is just so over the top it\u2019s beyond belief,\u2019\u201d Johnston said. \u201cHe metamorphosed into someone who cries like John Boehner.\u201d\n\nSteven Baddour, a former Democratic state senator who has worked closely with Coakley and Baker, said he\u2019s surprised the candidates aren\u2019t swinging even harder at each other, given the personal stakes.\n\n\u201cI think both of them have been extremely cautious in terms of not making mistakes, not sort of throwing it all out there,\u201d said Baddour, now an attorney in Boston. \u201cThey\u2019re being carefully guarded, carefully handled.\u201d\n\nBut Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic consultant, said the duo\u2019s most recent debates showcased sharper exchanges and proof that the contest is likely to be a photo finish.\n\n\u201cThese are two people who know this is it for them,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cThey know they have to take some risks if they\u2019re going to win. They don\u2019t want to say, \u2018I coulda; I shoulda; I woulda.\u201d\n\nSwift, the former Republican governor, said even if the candidates didn\u2019t commit themselves to giving up elective politics if they lose, their political careers would probably be cooked.\n\n\u201cWhether fair or unfair, the public generally believes that if you\u2019ve lost twice, you\u2019re done,\u201d she said. \u201cMoney follows that; support follows that. I think, realistically, \u2026 whichever one of them loses next Tuesday is likely out of electoral politics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Both candidates say that if they lose this time, they\u2019ll never run for office again.", "title": "Coakley, Baker out for redemption", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/martha-coakley-charlie-baker-out-for-redemption-in-massachusetts-112418.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/02/coakley_baker_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,2014 Elections,Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Martha Coakley", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Both candidates say that if they lose this time, they\u2019ll never run for office again.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf705\"", "article_summary": "Coakley, Baker out for redemptionMartha Coakley is one weekend away from permanent infamy as a political choke artist or an electoral redemption that would be considered a mild surprise.\nOn Tuesday, the Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial nominee faces Republican rival Charlie Baker, who, like Coakley, lost a winnable race four years ago when he was defeated by Democratic Gov.\nThe media keeps reinforcing that,\u201d said Phil Johnston, former chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party.\nDemocrats savaged Baker at the time as a wealthy, out-of-touch health insurance executive with thin skin.\nCharlie, he\u2019s a page still waiting to be writ.\u201dFor his part, Baker downplays significance of a second failed bid for the governorship."}
