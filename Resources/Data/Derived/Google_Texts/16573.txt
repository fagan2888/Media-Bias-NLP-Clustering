Buffaloes dominant defense

CU linebacker Kenneth Olugbode intercepted a tipped pass and took it to 60 yards to the house and a 24-17 lead. Ken Crawley’s second- quarter interception led to the Buffaloes’ first touchdown. He added two pass breakups.

Gunslinger

CU quarterback Sefo Liufau made big momentum throws when the Buffaloes needed them the most. Trailing 14-3, Liufau hit wide receiver Shay Fields in stride for a 65-yard touchdown strike. In the third quarter, Liufau threw a 24-yard TD pass to wide receiver Devin Ross for a 17-14 lead.

Young phenom

CSU running back Dalyn Dawkins, right, totaled 177 yards and a touchdown carrying the Rams’ offense in the second half.

Worsts

Both teams failed to master the kicking game

CSU kicker Wyatt Bryan went 1-for-4, missing field goals from 47 and 52 yards and getting his kick blocked in OT. CU kicker Diego Gonzalez had a 36-yard field goal blocked and missed the potential game-winner — a 48-yarder — in the final seconds of regulation.

It’s how you finish

CSU quarterback Nick Stevens started the game 8-of-9 passing with a TD, but struggled the rest of the way, finishing 25-of-39 and two later interceptions.

Pounding the ground

CU’s run game was a near nonfactor. They were one-dimensional and got outrushed by CSU by nearly 100 yards.
