He quit his job and testified before a Senate committee in 2009 regarding the ills of the HMO system.\n\nHe\u2019s written a book about the corporate climate in health insurance. A second book, detailing the effects of lobbying groups on democracy, is set to debut later this year.\n\n\u201cEven with the reforms that we\u2019ve gained, we\u2019re all still vulnerable,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody in this country can have peace of mind when it comes to health care.\u201d\n\nPotter was invited to the Elizabethton church, and an appearance later Thursday at Kingsport\u2019s Waverly Presbyterian Church, by grassroots groups supporting Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s Insure Tennessee proposal to expand Medicaid coverage to more than 250,000 residents. The proposal, after months of negotiating between the governor\u2019s office and the federal Health Department for a more conservative approach than the standard expansion enacted in other states, was killed early in the state General Assembly\u2019s session without making it to the full floor for a vote.\n\nHe said part of his job before 2008 was to convince the public socialized health care systems, particularly Canada\u2019s \u201cwas the worst in the world,\u201d but he\u2019s since \u201cspent a lot of time in Canada, and they love it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were able to influence public opinion in ways people aren\u2019t aware of,\u201d he said, speaking of his days in public relations. \u201cYou can see it in Tennessee, for instance, where so many people oppose expanding Medicaid, when it actually would be in their best interests.\u201d\n\nPotter said the ultimate goal for the country should be a single-payer system, in which the government pays for all citizens\u2019 health care costs. The Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, was a first phase in overhauling the health care system, he said.\n\nThat health care law, and the state\u2019s refusal of federal dollars to expand its Medicaid program, has pushed hospitals and hospital systems to merge, providing more administrative efficiencies and more bargaining power to leverage better rates from health insurance companies, he said, a phenomenon seen locally.\n\nAs Mountain States Health Alliance, based in Johnson City, and Wellmont Health System, based in Kingsport, prepare to merge, residents can expect to pay more to insurance companies, as the new system uses its power as a \u201cmust-have\u201d system, Potter said.\n\n\u201cHospitals need to do what they can to reduce costs, which means some people will lose their jobs as you get administrative efficiencies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a challenge keeping insurance rates lower, because so many Tennessee hospitals have been making due with less money because of the reductions from the Affordable Care Act and the state\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Wendell Potter&rsquo;s decades of work inside two of the nation&rsquo;s largest health insurance companies gave him rare insight into the workings of the health care system.", "og": {"url": "http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/Local/2015/11/19/Former-health-care-insider-speaks-about-insurance-ills", "site_name": "Johnson City Press", "image": "http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/image/2015/11/19/x720_q60/Wendell-Potter-2.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Former health care insider speaks about insurance ills"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.johnsoncitypress.com", "creator": "JCPress", "image": {"src": "http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/image/2015/11/19/x720_q60/Wendell-Potter-2.jpg"}, "title": "Former health care insider speaks about insurance ills", "site": "@JCPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 848454308559958}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 201511190082}}, "keywords": "Johnson City Press,Local,health care,Business,Wendell Potter,Elizabethton,Kingsport,First Presbyterian Church", "google-site-verification": "UTYidLMnIyXFs261jI5BgFnyem2HTUSm6Q0pwAiJnAk", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "health care,Business,Wendell Potter,Elizabethton,Kingsport,First Presbyterian Church"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb832\"", "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, was a first phase in overhauling the health care system, he said.\nHe\u2019s written a book about the corporate climate in health insurance.\n\u201cI realized I could have been in one of those lines if my circumstances had been different.\u201dAfter having the epiphany, he set out to challenge and change the country\u2019s health care system, from one run by for-profit insurance companies focused on the investors\u2019 interests to one in which all citizens have access to quality health care.\nAs Mountain States Health Alliance, based in Johnson City, and Wellmont Health System, based in Kingsport, prepare to merge, residents can expect to pay more to insurance companies, as the new system uses its power as a \u201cmust-have\u201d system, Potter said.\nThat health care law, and the state\u2019s refusal of federal dollars to expand its Medicaid program, has pushed hospitals and hospital systems to merge, providing more administrative efficiencies and more bargaining power to leverage better rates from health insurance companies, he said, a phenomenon seen locally."}
