DENVER—Colorado’s governor used to brew beer for a living, and now he has new beer taps in his home.

State officials announced Friday that private donors have paid for a new “draft beer system” in the governor’s mansion.

The mansion now has three taps that will feature changing Colorado-made brews.

The Colorado Craft Brewers Guild helped pay for the taps, along with the Governor’s Mansion Preservation Fund. The price of the taps was not disclosed.

Gov. John Hickenlooper co-founded a downtown Denver brewpub in the late 1980s and frequently espouses his love for Colorado beers.

Marijuana legalization activists blasted the installation, saying Hickenlooper promotes beer but is skeptical of adult marijuana use.
