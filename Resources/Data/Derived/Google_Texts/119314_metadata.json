President Obama delivers a special edition of \u201cThe Word\u201d \u2013 or in this case, \u201cThe Decree\u201d \u2013 proving that he is perfectly capable of doing Stephen Colbert\u2019s job.\n\nIn a previous report by the Inquisitr, and on a more serious note, President Obama may decide to take on Vladimir Putin. Lethal aid to Ukraine has been authorized by recently passed United States House Resolution 758, which calls for President Barack Obama to send both lethal and non-lethal aid to the Ukrainian military. If the U.S. Senate passes similar legislation, it\u2019s possible Obama may choose to escalate the confrontation with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn the middle of the The Colbert Report, President Obama jumped onto the show and interrupted Stephen Colbert, playfully shooing him from the stage. \u201cYou\u2019ve been taking a lot of shots at my job,\u201d the president said. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to take a shot at yours.\u201d After taking a seat he joked, \u201cHow hard can this be? I am just going to say whatever you were about to say.\u201d\n\nObama took over the anchor chair offering a presidential take on the Colbert segment, The Word, given a new name The Decree for the night by the President. The Word is a segment where Colbert, in this case Obama, says a line or two before a witty word or phrases flashes to the right.\n\n\u201cNation,\u201d Obama said, referring to his audience like Colbert does, \u201cas you know, I, Stephen Colbert, have never cared for our President. That guy is so arrogant. I bet he talks about himself in the third person.\u201d\n\nAfter talking about Obamacare, the President asked, \u201cHow do you stop something that more and more people are starting to like?\u201d\n\nNext to Obama flashed \u201cMove it to CBS,\u201d a nod to the fact that in two weeks Colbert will be stepping down from his Comedy Central show to take over for David Letterman at the The Late Show on CBS.\n\nThe President went on to detail how Republicans could stop Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThey could pass a bill repealing Obamacare. But the President still has the veto and if I know that guy, he is willing to use it,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd let\u2019s face it, even if Republicans somehow did repeal it, they would have to replace it with their own health care plan. Once they touch it, they own it, and then if anything goes wrong, suddenly everybody will be complaining about Mitch McConnell-care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWalk It Off.gov\u201d then flashed next to the President.\n\nNear the close of the segment Obama joked, noting that last year\u2019s Obamacare rollout was \u201ca little bumpy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that is where Disney got the idea for Frozen,\u201d the President said to laughs.\n\nObama stayed in character for the end of the segment, too.\n\n\u201cWe will be right back with the leader of the free world,\u201d the President said, looking at his page like he couldn\u2019t remember his own name before adding, \u201cBarack Obama.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama took over a segment of The Colbert Report, guest hosting as, well, Stephen Colbert.
