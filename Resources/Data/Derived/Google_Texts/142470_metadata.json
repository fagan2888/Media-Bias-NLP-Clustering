Kevin Brady, sponsored the bill.\n\nCongress created the Federal Reserve in 1913, but has never comprehensively assessed its effectiveness.\n\nEconomists are divided on how efficient the Federal Reserve has been.\n\nOne side argues the Federal Reserve serves the economy best when using its authority to create monetary policy, which is how the bank has operated since it began.\n\nThe other side argues the economy would expand and job creation would grow if the Federal Reserve were constrained by rules.\n\n\u201cWithout a binding rule, a discretionary central bank will always give us higher inflation without any gain in employment,\u201d said Norbert Michel, a research fellow in financial regulations for The Heritage Foundation. \u201cRules-based monetary policy would also help to prevent short-term political considerations from interfering with the Fed\u2019s long-term goals.\u201d\n\nThe commission would deploy bipartisan review of the Federal Reserve\u2019s performance over its 100 years of operation, empirically evaluating the legitimacy of the two arguments and provide Congress with impartial, non-binding recommendations on how best to continue with Fed policies.\n\nMichel said this is important because it allows Congress to assess whether or not the Federal Reserve\u2019s policies have worked in the past.\n\n\u201cThe conventional wisdom is that the Fed\u2019s done a great job, especially since the 1980s, but there\u2019s a lot of high quality research that shows that the pure discretionary monetary policy at the Fed hasn\u2019t been that terrific,\u201d Michel said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to get people in Congress to listen to that, so the commission would be a great vehicle for that.\u201d\n\nThe bill, named the Centennial Monetary Commission Act of 2015, passed the committee 35-22. Only one Democrat voted for the legislation.\n\nHensarling spearheaded similar legislation in 2013, saying the committee would \u201creexamine all conventional wisdom dealing with the Federal Reserve\u201d without \u201cpreordaining the conclusion.\u201d His legislation failed in committee, but Hensarling and several other key members\u2014including Reps. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., and Bill Huizenga, R-Mich.\u2014have made Federal Reserve reform a priority.\n\nThe bill is expected to move to the House floor for a vote in September once the Congress returns from August recess.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House Financial Services committee passed legislation that would create a bipartisan commission to evaluate the Federal Reserve\u2019s impact on the economy.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The House Financial Services committee passed legislation that would create a bipartisan commission to evaluate the Federal Reserve\u2019s impact on the economy.", "title": "Is the Fed Worth It?
