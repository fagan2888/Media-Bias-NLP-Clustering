President Obama’s 2012 deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter cited Jonathan Gruber as an “architect” of Obamacare in a memo the campaign released ahead of a presidential debate with Mitt Romney.

Obama recently called Gruber “some adviser who never worked on our staff” after Gruber’s comments on the “stupidity of the American voter” were published. (RELATED: Gruber: The Affordable Care Act Will Not Be Affordable).

“So, what’s the net impact of Romney’s plans? According to a report prepared by Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects of both Romney’s Massachusetts plan and Obamacare, it would nearly double premiums and out-of-pocket costs in the individual market – raising them by 92 percent, or an extra $5,496 – as compared to the President’s plan. At the same time, an additional 51 million Americans would be uninsured,” Cutter wrote in a memo to “Interested Parties”, including the media, on October 3, 2012.
