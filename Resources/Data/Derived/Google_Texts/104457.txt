TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Georgia ex-President Eduard Shevardnadze was buried Sunday in Tbilisi after his death at age 86.

Shevardnadze, also a Soviet ex-foreign minister, died July 7 and was buried next to his wife in the Krtsanisi Presidential Residence of Tbilisi. The country’s current president, Giorgi Margvelashvili, and a handful of foreign dignitaries attended the ceremony.

As the Soviet Union’s foreign minister, Shevardnadze was the diplomatic face of Mikhail Gorbachev’s liberalizing policies of glasnost and perestroika.

As the leader of post-Soviet Georgia, he became the victim of revolution at home, and his career in the public eye ended in humiliation when he was chased out of parliament and forced into retirement in 2003.
