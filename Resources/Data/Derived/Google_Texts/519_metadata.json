My time spent in both states was a wonderful and enlightening experience for me. I learned a lot, and that knowledge will be put to good use towards the creation of businesses, jobs, and the strengthening and revival of their economies. I look forward to returning to West Virginia and Nebraska soon, and hope to win both states in the general election. Likewise, my time spent last week with the great people of Oregon will hopefully lead to another victory next Tuesday.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n- Donald J. Trump\n\n\n\n\n\n******************************\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthcare Reform to Make America Great Again\n\n\n\nSince March of 2010, the American people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care Act\u2014Obamacare. This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don\u2019t work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices.

We will work with Congress to make sure we have a series of reforms ready for implementation that follow free market principles and that will restore economic freedom and certainty to everyone in this country. By following free market principles and working together to create sound public policy that will broaden healthcare access, make healthcare more affordable and improve the quality of the care available to all Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny reform effort must begin with Congress. Since Obamacare became law, conservative Republicans have been offering reforms that can be delivered individually or as part of more comprehensive reform efforts. In the remaining sections of this policy paper, several reforms will be offered that should be considered by Congress so that on the first day of the Trump Administration, we can start the process of restoring faith in government and economic liberty to the people.\n\n\n\n\n\nCongress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must:\n\n\n\n1.Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to.\n\n2.Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines.
