JoePa was a popular nickname for the most famous college football coach Joe Paterno. Even if you did not like football, the main campus has an entire community of shops, restaurants, a creamery, and other businesses within.\n\nThis was all until November, 2011, when the world found out about Penn State\u2019s dirty secret. The Jerry Sandusky scandal rocked Penn state with the discovery of an ever-expanding child sex abuse scandal. Last year, The Inquisitr reported on the scandal.\n\n\u201cSandusky was convicted last year of 45 counts of sexual abuse stemming from his time at Penn State. He never took the stand during his trial, but he publicly insisted both before and after the trial that he is innocent of all charges.\u201d\n\nPenn state hit another snag, and while it has not risen to the level of scandal, it certainly seems to be a big setback to the healing process and reformation of the tainted university. This past Wednesday was Constitution Day, and a group called Young Americans For Freedom had set up a table for the event.\n\nAt this table, in one of Penn State University\u2019s \u201cfree speech zones,\u201d the group handed out pocket constitutions. It seemed like a typical day, until they were confronted by school officials about their table. The result, as Breitbart News reported, was the demand that the table be taken down.\n\n\u201cAfter an hour or so of tabling, the YAF table was approached by campus security personnel, who told Jolie to take the table down. Jolie pressed the official with questions, asking why she had to take down her table.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the campus security told them they could \u201cpass out flyers,\u201d but could not \u201chave a table.\u201d The Penn State student group captured the majority of the dispute on video.\n\nThey were told it would \u201cnot help their cause to put this on video.\u201d The irony of the Penn State officials\u2019 comment was that the table had a banner reading \u201cFree Speech Banned At Penn State,\u201d with literature about their \u201cspeech code.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pennsylvania Independent, Penn State senior director of students and activities Judy Albin told the student group that it was violating the \u201cpre-approve structure\u201d policy by using an unapproved table.\n\n(Writer\u2019s note: A review by this writer of the Penn State University policy manual made no mention of the words \u201cstructure,\u201d \u201cpre-approve,\u201d \u201ctable,\u201d and other variations. Any other documentation was not viewable by anyone without a student login.)\n\nJolie Stuart-Davis, who was one of the members of Young Americans For Freedom, thought she was joking when the group was approached about the table. When Mrs. Stuart-Davis challenged Ms. Albin\u2019s request, she was told that the student\u2019s \u201crights were not violated at all.\u201d Ms. Albin went as far in the confrontation as to threaten that she could be forced to \u201ccall campus police, but why do that.\u201d\n\nMrs. Stuart-Davis was given the opportunity to review the Penn State policy that was invoked, but upon her entrance to do so, Ms. Albin was nowhere to be found. Pennsylvania Independent reports that Stuart-Davis questioned the point of the \u201cfree speech zones.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you have to reserve free speech, it\u2019s not really free.\u201d\n\nWhat are your thoughts on \u201cfree speech zones,\u201d and was Penn state\u2019s actions appropriate?\n\n[Images Via Wikimedia Commons]", "article_metadata": {"description": "This past Wednesday was Constitution Day, and a Penn state university student group had set up a table for the event.
