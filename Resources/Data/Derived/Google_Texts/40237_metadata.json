For reasons unknown (and they're always unknown, aren't they?) Hopper has decided that it's great fun to jump up on the second-story bannister and walk around. We can't think of any way to stop her from doing this, but one of these days she's going to set a paw wrong and go flying off the wrong side. Being a cat, maybe it won't hurt her. But it's a twelve-foot drop, and some of it is onto a hardwood floor. We have visions of splat going through our heads.\n\nWhat do we do? Put up a net, like those ones they have on the Golden Gate Bridge to catch jumpers? Get rid of the quilts and install razor wire? Put cat-size exercise weights on Hopper's feet so she can't jump so high? There's got to be an answer.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/06/friday-cat-blogging-19-june-2015", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Friday cat blogging - 19 June 2015"}, "twitter": {"title": "Friday cat blogging - 19 June 2015", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/06/friday-cat-blogging-19-june-2015", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcee8\"", "article_summary": "Put cat-size exercise weights on Hopper's feet so she can't jump so high?\nHopper has decided that it's great fun to jump up on the second-story bannister and walk around.\nFor reasons unknown (and they're always unknown, aren't they?)\nBeing a cat, maybe it won't hurt her.\nPut up a net, like those ones they have on the Golden Gate Bridge to catch jumpers?"}
