In this study, we found that customers perceive restaurants to be socially responsible when they are provided with nutrition facts and healthful options and, therefore, are more likely to patronize those restaurants.\"\n\nTo conduct their study, the researchers presented participants with various scenarios, including the presence or absence of nutrition information and the presence or absence of healthful foods. They asked the participants to read example menus presenting these scenarios and to answer questions about their perception of the restaurant's corporate social responsibility, their attitude, their willingness to select the restaurants and their health-consciousness. The team collected responses from 277 participants.\n\nThe researchers found that when participants were presented with a scenario in which a restaurant presented nutrition information and served healthful food options, the participants were significantly more likely to perceive that the restaurant was socially responsible.\n\n\"In other words, the participants developed a favorable attitude toward the restaurant and wanted to visit it more frequently,\" Cranage says.\n\nIn addition, the team found that participants who were highly health-conscious were more likely than low health-conscious people to think that the restaurant was socially responsible when it provided healthful food options. However, when exposed to nutrition information, participants perceived the restaurant to be socially responsible, regardless of their level of health-consciousness.\n\n\"These results suggest that highly health-conscious people are more sensitive to being able to obtain healthful foods at restaurants than less health-conscious people, regardless of whether or not nutrition information is provided,\" Cranage says.\n\nThe results appeared the International Journal of Hospitality Management.\n\n\"We believe that providing healthful foods and nutrition information can improve a restaurant's image,\" Cranage says. \"Often, managers must choose between profitability and social responsibility when making decisions. However, results of this study indicate that deciding to provide nutrition information and healthful food items yields benefits from both perspectives. Based on results of this study, restaurateurs may make an easy decision to increase more healthful items on their menu while simultaneously increasing the image of their business.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Laboratory Equipment", "description": "When participants in a study were presented with a scenario where a restaurant gave nutrition information and served healthful food options, they were significantly more likely to perceive the restaurant as being socially responsible.", "title": "Customers Prefer Restaurants Offering Nutrition Facts", "url": "http://www.laboratoryequipment.com/news/2014/04/customers-prefer-restaurants-offering-nutrition-facts", "image": "http://www.laboratoryequipment.com/sites/laboratoryequipment.com/files/040214_restaurants.gif", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "laboratory equipment, science, news, Customers Prefer Restaurants Offering Nutrition Facts", "abstract": "When participants in a study were presented with a scenario where a restaurant gave nutrition information and served healthful food options, they were significantly more likely to perceive the restaurant as being socially responsible.", "description": "When participants in a study were presented with a scenario where a restaurant gave nutrition information and served healthful food options, they were significantly more likely to perceive the restaurant as being socially responsible.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced1d\"", "article_summary": "\"The Affordable Care Act has mandated that chain restaurants \u2014 those with more than 20 restaurants \u2014 provide nutrition information to customers,\" says David Cranage, associate professor of hospitality management.\nCustomers are more likely to frequent restaurants that provide both healthful foods and nutrition information, according to researchers at Penn State and the Univ.\nHowever, when exposed to nutrition information, participants perceived the restaurant to be socially responsible, regardless of their level of health-consciousness.\nIn this study, we found that customers perceive restaurants to be socially responsible when they are provided with nutrition facts and healthful options and, therefore, are more likely to patronize those restaurants.\"\n\"We believe that providing healthful foods and nutrition information can improve a restaurant's image,\" Cranage says."}
