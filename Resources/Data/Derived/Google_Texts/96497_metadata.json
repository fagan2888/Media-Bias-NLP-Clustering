In a fast-paced environment, many clinicians allow instinct to take over, which brings these unconscious prejudices to the surface, especially combined with training that teaches doctors to stand by their initial decisions.\n\n\"You're dealing with people who are frightened, they're reactive,\" Howard Ross, founder of management consulting firm Cook Ross, told NPR. \"If you're doing triage in the emergency room, for example, you don't have time to sit back and contemplate, 'Why am I thinking about this?' You have to instantaneously react.\"\n\nRecognizing this phenomenon, many medical schools now train students in checking these instincts. The University of Massachusetts, University of Texas Medical School at Houston and the University of California, San Francisco have all implemented formal curricula on unconscious bias. For example, UCSF's program requires all first-year medical students to take a workshop in which they interrogate their own preconceived notions and their origins.\n\nAlthough it's too early to analyze the results of this approach, providers hope they will prove more effective than traditional workplace diversity initiatives, which research shows are often counterproductive because they engender guilt or resentment in participants, according to the article.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWhy the next generation of nurses must look at social determinants of health\n\nWhy health infrastructure is key to improving Baltimore's socioeconomic problems\n\nEmployment status top socioeconomic factor in readmissions\n\nHow healthcare leaders can make it clear that black lives matter\n\nThe future of population health management\n\nRacial disparities in coverage, care persist despite ACA", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even as the nation's overall healthcare outcomes improve, racial disparities in both treatment and outcomes persist, and healthcare professionals must consider the role their unconscious behavior may play in the situation, according to National Public Radio.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Even as the nation's overall healthcare outcomes improve, racial disparities in both treatment and outcomes persist, and healthcare professionals must consider the role their unconscious behavior may play in the situation, according to National Public Radio.", "title": "To tackle racial disparities, healthcare must examine unconscious bias", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/tackle-racial-disparities-healthcare-must-examine-unconscious-bias/2015-08-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "bias,Care Delivery,Healthcare Training,high-stress environments,Medical School,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Population Health Management,Racial Disparities", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "For example, UCSF's program requires all first-year medical students to take a workshop in which they interrogate their own preconceived notions and their origins.\nEven as the nation's overall healthcare outcomes improve, racial disparities in both treatment and outcomes persist, and healthcare professionals must consider the role their unconscious behavior may play in the situation, according to National Public Radio.\nThe University of Massachusetts, University of Texas Medical School at Houston and the University of California, San Francisco have all implemented formal curricula on unconscious bias.\nThese disparities don't come from conscious ill intent, but rather unconscious bias, which is more likely to surface in high-stress environments and situations such as a hospital setting, according to the article.\n\"You're dealing with people who are frightened, they're reactive,\" Howard Ross, founder of management consulting firm Cook Ross, told NPR."}
