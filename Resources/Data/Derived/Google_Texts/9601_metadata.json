While organizers worried about a repeat of last year\u2019s Confederations Cup, a tournament marred by violent protests, the level of visible vitriol over the past month was relatively low. Even after Brazil\u2019s national team was embarrassed in the semifinal \u2014 and lost again in the third-place game Saturday \u2014 forecasts of widespread tumult were never realized.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat does not mean there was not unrest. Hundreds of protesters gathered at their usual spot in the city center Sunday afternoon and marched through the streets in an anti-FIFA demonstration. They were met by a large cadre of Brazilian police officers, and there were instances of tear gas, as well as batons, being used on protesters, according to reports.\n\nThe city was also filled with traveling fans, many of them from Argentina. It was estimated that as many as 100,000 Argentines traveled across the border, and a vast majority seemed to settle in Copacabana or other neighborhoods along the water. That most did not have tickets to the final was irrelevant; they were here to eat, drink, dance and, once kickoff finally arrived, watch the match among the masses.\n\nOne Argentine who was not in Brazil, however, was the country\u2019s president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. Kirchner declined an invitation from President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, citing a lingering illness and a desire to celebrate her grandson\u2019s first birthday with her family. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany did make the trans-Atlantic trip, as did Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, which will host the World Cup in 2018.\n\nThey saw a match that began with a surging pace and featured a bit of controversy, too, as Christoph Kramer, a young German midfielder, became at least the third player in this tournament to return to the field shortly after sustaining an obvious head injury. Kramer was ultimately replaced about 10 minutes after colliding with an Argentine opponent and was clearly dazed, adding more fuel to a debate about soccer\u2019s lack of a comprehensive protocol for dealing with head injuries.\n\nArgentina will ultimately rue missed opportunities that could have \u2014 and perhaps should have \u2014 changed the tenor of the game. The first came after about 20 minutes, when Gonzalo Higua\u00edn somehow missed the net completely after Toni Kroos inexplicably headed the ball back toward his own goal, leaving Higua\u00edn with a gift of an opening. Soon after, Higua\u00edn scored but was ruled offside.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat was followed by Messi, just after halftime, yanking a shot wide as he tried for the far post on a break into the penalty area. Then, in extra time, Rodrigo Palacio, in alone with Neuer, chipped his shot over the goalkeeper but wide of the frame.\n\nArgentina finished the game with 10 shots but only two shots on goal.\n\n\u201cWe are gutted,\u201d said Javier Mascherano, who grabbed his head in disbelief after seeing Higua\u00edn\u2019s first miss. \u201cThe pain will be for life because this was our opportunity.\u201d\n\nGermany was more efficient. The Germans came close just before halftime when Benedikt H\u00f6wedes blasted a header off the goal post, and Germany kept pressure on Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero, putting seven of its 10 shots on goal.\n\nThe extra time was slower \u2014 understandably as the players slogged through the end of their seventh game of the tournament \u2014 and Germany finally seized its moment seven minutes before the end. Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle powered down the left side of the field and floated a tantalizing ball toward the side of the six-yard box. G\u00f6tze, who had come on as a substitute for Miroslav Klose, showed good speed to arrive under the ball and chest it down. He lashed it past Romero and into the net, prompting an all-out sprint from his teammates on the German bench as they poured onto the field in delight.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely sensational,\u201d G\u00f6tze said. \u201cA dream became reality.\u201d\n\nArgentina had a few last-ditch rushes upfield but struggled to penetrate Neuer\u2019s penalty area, and the team was left with a final opportunity when Messi lined up a free kick from about 20 yards.\n\nThe Argentine fans craned their necks, and Coach Alejandro Sabella crouched down in expectation. But there was no magic as Messi\u2019s shot flew over the net. It was over. Sabella shook his head with frustration. Messi kicked the dirt. And up in the stands, the German fans \u2014 as well as the Brazilians \u2014 shouted out with glee.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140713173702, "twitter": {"description": "Mario
