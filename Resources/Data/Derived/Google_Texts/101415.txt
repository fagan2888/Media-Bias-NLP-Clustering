SOPOT, Poland (AP) — The United States set a world record in the 4×400 meters relay at the world indoor championships.

In the last event of the three-day championship, Kyle Clemons, David Verburg, Kind Butler III, and Calvin Smith Jr. got the baton around in a time of 3 minutes, 2.13 seconds, slashing .70 off the 15-year-old mark set by another U.S. relay team at the 1999 world indoors.

The U.S. team beat Britain into silver and Jamaica took bronze.

Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce kept the 60 meter world indoor title in Jamaica. With the fastest run by anyone in four years, Fraser-Pryce led from the start to finish in 6.98 seconds.
