The production he\u2019s worked on for three years takes the stage Monday, an unrivaled event that is sold out.\n\nBut if you managed to get a ticket to the 2 p.m. show, expect this: 10 mystery CEOs from around the country will listen to 10 \u201cwicked\u201d health problems. They\u2019ll pick one and spend 10 days creating a viable startup.\n\nThis aptly named event, called 10.10.10, is like a hackathon for CEOs. A high-speed incubator. A faster, more efficient way to tackle today\u2019s critical health crises, like diabetes, cancer and ALS. Not that these will be the wicked problems \u2014 Higley won\u2019t give us a clue before the big reveal. Nor will he spill the chosen CEOs, although each has started or successfully run a business.\n\n\u201cIf we succeed wildly, here\u2019s what happens: We\u2019ll solve a couple wicked problems. Not 10. Two would be really good. And at the end of a period of nine months, we hope there are at least a couple of fundable companies to take to market,\u201d said Higley, 60, whose calm demeanor belies any last-minute scramble. \u201cThat\u2019s the objective.\u201d\n\nThree years have sped by since Higley\u2019s epiphany. But it was a lifetime in the making.\n\nIn the past two decades, Higley started six tech companies. Not all were successful. But one sold for $280 million; two raised nearly $40 million. Another was an e-commerce site started a year after Amazon\u2019s debut. He has been CEO for a handful of others, invested in dozens and mentored startups at Techstars and, friends say, anyone who asks.\n\nExperience made him realize that successful people do not guarantee another success.\n\n\u201cIn their next big thing, they tend to make decisions that are subpar,\u201d Higley said. They approach their next venture as they did their first.\n\n\u201cBut in fact, they have to reinvent themselves as they pursue the next big thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they tend to be surrounded by people who think they walk on water. But they don\u2019t. They need authentic feedback. They need someone to say, \u2018Your idea is horrible,\u2019 if their idea is horrible.\u201d\n\nHigley got to thinking about how to help CEOs who were good at raising capital, attracting talent and scaling a business.\n\nAnd 10.10.10 creates an environment where the CEO takes ownership of a problem from the start. To move things along, each wicked problem was vetted for financial potential. And each will have serious support \u2014 advocates will try to convince CEOs to choose their problem and not one of the other nine. In fact, CEOs can pick the same one, which may leave some unclaimed.\n\nPublic and private ventures \u2014 such as Kaiser Permanente Colorado, U.S. Health and Human Services and the Colorado Health Foundation \u2014 are offering access to experts, advocates and other support. Some took convincing; others, like Kaiser, signed on immediately.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about entrepreneurs and the startup culture that has agility. It provides a co-learning opportunity for all of us,\u201d said Jandel Allen-Davis, a Kaiser vice president. Her wicked problem wasn\u2019t picked.\n\nCHF provided $200,000 for the event.\n\n\u201cSure it\u2019s risky because they\u2019ve never done it before. But it\u2019s a calculated risk worth taking,\u201d said Kelly Dunkin, CHF\u2019s vice president of philanthropy, which submitted 15 wicked problems and was chosen to pitch one related to childhood obesity. \u201cWhat 10 days does is, well, nothing focuses the mind like a time limit.\u201d\n\nLaw begets tech\n\nStep even farther back into Higley\u2019s life and you\u2019ll learn he graduated from Harvard Law School. In his mid-30s by then, he realized he relished learning.\n\nLaw brought him to Colorado in 1989, and he joined Holland & Hart and later Fischer, Brown, Huddleson & Gunn. He specialized in securities, licensing and bonds. He was also the firm\u2019s geek, thanks to his interest in technology after buying the first Apple Mac intosh in 1984.\n\nHigley began connecting to local businesses, handling the LLC papers for what is now Left Hand Brewery Co. and representing Colorado Memory Systems when Hewlett-Packard acquired the magnetic-tape maker in the early 1990s. And he helped Fort Collins set up FortNet, its first online community network.\n\nBut he noticed something at the time. Denver was in its early stages of investing in infrastructure with downtown developers such as Dana Crawford, who became the namesake for the new Union Station hotel, and Federico Pe\u00f1a, a former Denver mayor who served in former President Bill Clinton\u2019s Cabinet and is credited with spurring downtown revitalization.\n\nToday, a new breed of visionaries has taken over and is turning wasteland into a thriving community, like Sean Campbell, a co-founder of Industry in RiNo, and Mike Biselli, president of Stride, which opens this year to incubate digital health startups.\n\n\u201cThe folks we\u2019re seeing here is a reflection of forward thinking,\u201d he said.\n\nHigley should count himself in that group. He is \u201cvery much looked upon as one of the state\u2019s most successful technology entrepreneurs in Colorado,\u201d said Biselli.\n\n\u201cAnd when you have a claim like that attached to your name, some people will deem you unapproachable,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s 100 percent not true with Tom. He will go and hang out with somebody who just graduated from college.\u201d\n\nHis 10.10.10 intends to build on the notion of Denver as a major player in technology, startups and, now, health. Instead of going to where the action is perceived, Higley is bringing the action to Denver.\n\nAs one of Higley\u2019s mentors, Regis McKenna (who mentored Steve Jobs) once told him while working on his first startup, \u201cTom, if you were in the Bay Area, you\u2019d be there by now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I was stubborn,\u201d Hig ley said. \u201cBoulder is phenomenally connected throughout the country and the world. Denver, not so much. There\u2019s a gap. And this isn\u2019t about competing with Boulder at all but more about Denver realizing its potential; 10.10.10 is the precursor to that, but I hope that there are many things that will happen to make (Denver) go forward.\u201d\n\nA Steinway grand\n\nAnd then there was high school.\n\nHigley loved music, playing clarinet, sax and guitar. He almost didn\u2019t graduate from high school in Spring Lake, Mich.\n\n\u201cI hated high school. Just hated it. In fact, I barely went my senior year,\u201d Higley recalls. \u201cI had one teacher, a great intellectual. My English teacher. If he hadn\u2019t persuaded the principal to let me graduate, I wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nHigley later set up a scholarship to honor that teacher, Paul Wolbrink.\n\n\u201cHe did not persuade me to stay in school. Rather, he helped me to appreciate \u2014 and come to love \u2014 learning. A very different thing,\u201d Higley said in a follow-up e-mail.\n\nWhile Wolbrink put the seed of learning into Higley\u2019s head, the 17-year-old pursued a life in music. He must not have been too bad \u2014 he played guitar with the DeBarge family, which later recorded the 1985 hit \u201cRhythm of the Night.\u201d And he opened for Barry White as lead guitarist for Uhuru Unlimited.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the white kid in a band that\u2019s playing the Chitlin\u2019 Circuit,\u201d he said.\n\nMusic continued to shape his life.\n\nEven with the frenetic preparation for the 10-day event and working with hundreds of volunteers (\u201cThey are incredible!\u201d), Higley ends each night at his Steinway grand piano in his LoDo loft.\n\nHe composes. He plays for about an hour. It\u2019s how he winds down. And he expects that he\u2019ll do that tonight when really, there is not much else he can do to prepare for 10.10.10.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought about what entrepreneurs do is similar to musicians,\u201d Higley said. \u201cYou need an orchestra.\u201d\n\nTamara Chuang: 303-954-1209, tchuang@denverpost.com or twitter.com/Gadgetress\n\nMore on 10.10.10\n\n\u2022 The event was never intended to occur on October 10. The geek in Higley likes the binary translation, which is 42. That number has significant meaning if you\u2019ve read \u201cLife, the Universe and Everything,\u201d by Douglas Adams.\n\n\u2022 \u201cWicked\u201d comes from Higley\u2019s time in the Boston area for law school. But he also points to design theorists Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber, who used the term to note \u201cthe effort to solve one aspect of a wicked problem may reveal or create other problems,\u201d says Wikipedia.\n\n\u2022 To attend: 10.10.10\u2019s Big Reveal, 2-6 p.m. at the McNichols Civic Center Building, 144 W. Colfax Ave. in Denver. Details: 101010.net/schedule\n\nMore about Tom:\n\n\u2022 Married later in life to Nanette, who he met in 8th grade. Between them, they have four children and two grand kids.\n\n\u2022 Composes music nightly.
