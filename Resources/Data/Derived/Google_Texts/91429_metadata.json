The Aug. 5 disaster sent yellow-orange sludge through three states and two American Indian tribes, prompting emergency declarations and leaving communities along hundreds of river miles angry.\n\nDOCUMENTS: New photos and timeline of start of Gold King spill\n\nThe EPA says data, collected over the past two weeks, shows surface water metal levels at 24 sampling locations along the watershed below the spill are \u201ctrending toward pre-event conditions.\u201d Metal levels in the sediment, the EPA says, are below the agency\u2019s recreational screening level.\n\nHowever, the EPA says it is not certain there are no health risks from the sediment.\n\n\u201cRisks to humans from metals in the sediments are based upon the total exposure a person may have over a given period of time,\u201d David Gray, an EPA spokesman, said. \u201cExposure from sediments would be from hand-to-mouth exposures. We want to ensure that the concentration of metals in the sediments are sufficiently low enough to ensure that a recreational person will not be exposed to harmful levels of metals.\u201d\n\nThe EPA says it is establishing a longer term watershed monitoring strategy for surface water affected by the spill to identify potential extended impacts.\n\nThe effects of the Gold King spill on aquatic life still remain unknown, state wildlife officials say, but no immediate, widespread impacts have been observed. Joe Lewandowski, spokesman for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, says his agency is looking into two dead beavers found north of Durango after the disaster.\n\nTesting on the beavers, and fish placed in the river to study the impacts of the spill, have not been finished. A fish survey on the Animas River through Durango completed this week preliminarily indicated there were not any immediate problems, CPW said.\n\n\u201cBasically, the fish population doesn\u2019t look any different from what it was last summer,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing fish in distress or anything that would have been an acute effect.\u201d\n\nLewandowski noted, however, fish populations in the Animas through Durango have been declining for about a decade from what officials believe is the ongoing leaching of mine contaminants into the river\u2019s watershed. He said it won\u2019t be known in the short term if the Gold King spill will have any impact on that trend.\n\n\u201cThe effects or more long term,\u201d he said.\n\nExperts say metals lining the riverbed could continue impact agriculture, aquatic life and other life-forms along the Animas River for years.\n\nThe EPA specifically has been studying concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury in surface water. The acidic heavy metals that flooded into Cement Creek in Silverton and the Animas River through La Plata County after the spill initially broke state water quality limits.\n\nThe new data comes after the EPA on Wednesday released an internal review of the events leading up the Gold King spill showing crews underestimated waste pressure behind the mine\u2019s collapsed opening.\n\nThe report called the underestimation of the pressure the most significant factor leading to the spill.\n\nAccording to the report, had crews drilled into the mine\u2019s collapsed opening, as they had done at a nearby site, they \u201cmay have been able to discover the pressurized conditions that turned out to cause the blowout.\u201d\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JesseAPaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "EPA: Sediment a \u201clong term\u201d concern in Colorado mine spill\u2019s wake", "title": "EPA: Sediment a \u201clong term\u201d concern in Colorado mine spill\u2019s wake", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/27/epa-sediment-a-long-term-concern-in-colorado-mine-spills-wake/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150825__animas-river-mining-area-pollutionp1-5.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150825__animas-river-mining-area-pollutionp1-5.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-27T10:06:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T12:18:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Animas River-Spill"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf402\"", "article_summary": "DOCUMENT: Read the EPA\u2019s Gold King Mine investigation reportEnvironmental officials said Thursday their long-term concern after the 3 million-gallon Gold King Mine spill centers around the metallic sediment left in its wake.\nHe said it won\u2019t be known in the short term if the Gold King spill will have any impact on that trend.\nThe effects of the Gold King spill on aquatic life still remain unknown, state wildlife officials say, but no immediate, widespread impacts have been observed.\nExperts say metals lining the riverbed could continue impact agriculture, aquatic life and other life-forms along the Animas River for years.\nA fish survey on the Animas River through Durango completed this week preliminarily indicated there were not any immediate problems, CPW said."}
