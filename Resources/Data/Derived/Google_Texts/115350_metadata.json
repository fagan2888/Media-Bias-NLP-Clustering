Chanko's family was outraged to find that his treatment and death were recorded without their permission and shown on an episode of \"NY Med,\" a reality show starring Dr. Mehmet Oz. While Chanko's face was blurred, his family easily recognized him on TV, with his wife telling ProPublica that \"I saw my husband die before my eyes.\"\n\nWhile New York regulators did not impose any sanctions on the hospital for the incident, and the Chankos' lawsuit against ABC and NewYork-Presbyterian was dismissed in November, the story continues to resonate with industry leaders. One such example is that of Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey Flier, who tweeted about his indignation regarding the Chankos' story only to discover that ABC has also been filming at the facility he presides over, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), the Boston Globe reported.\n\nBoth MGH and Brigham and Women's, Boston's top two teaching hospitals, are set to be featured in ABC's upcoming documentary-style series called \"Golden Hour,\" which depicts patients in ERs, operating rooms and intensive care units, according to the Globe. Upon investigating the matter, Flier told the newspaper he was reassured that \"this [filming] could be done in a way that is entirely beneficial to health education and not violate anybody's rights.\"\n\nThe contract the Boston hospitals have with ABC states that patients must give consent before their stories are aired and have 30 days after the last filming of a patient to change their minds and opt out, the Globe reported.\n\nBut not everyone is as reassured that filming often-incapacitated patients in life-or-death situations, even with identity-concealing measures or consent, represents an ethical way to conduct care.\n\n\"This is just ethically inexcusable. You have people taping in ERs, and yeah, they blurred out the face \u2026 but they played the voice,\" Art Caplan, a medical ethicist, recently told Boston Public Radio in regard to the Chankos' story. \"I mean, really? This [is] voyeurism, and we feed it when we watch it.\"\n\nSimilarly, Mark Chanko's son, Eric Chanko, who himself is a physician, told ProPublica that the hospital and the \"NY Med\" producers \"basically did everything that you're taught in medical school not to do.\"\n\n\"NY Med\" has stirred up controversy regarding patient privacy rights before, with a NewYork-Presbyterian nurse fired in July after she reposted a doctor's Instagram photo of an empty trauma room with the caption with the caption \"#Man vs 6 train,\" after treating a man hit by a subway train, FierceHealthcare has reported. That incident spurred debate about hospitals' patient privacy policies, and highlighted the alarming frequency of healthcare professionals using social media to disclose patient information.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the ProPublica article\n\n- read the Boston Globe article\n\n- read/listen to the Boston Public Radio report\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNurse's firing over Instagram photo spurs social media debate\n\nSocial media abuse: Clinicians reveal patient info online\n\nBlurred lines: Physicians question patient-relationship boundaries\n\nOCR releases new guidance on HIPAA privacy rules for emergencies", "article_metadata": {"description": "The recent controversy surrounding a reality TV show's depiction of a man's death in a New York hospital has ignited a debate about the nature of\u00a0patients' privacy rights\u00a0while being treated in emergency departments.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The recent controversy surrounding a reality TV show's depiction of a man's death in a New York hospital has ignited a debate about the nature of\u00a0patients' privacy rights\u00a0while being treated in emergency departments.", "title": "Reality TV controversy reignites patient-privacy debate", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/reality-tv-controversy-reignites-patient-privacy-debate/2015-01-12", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,clinical ethics,ethics violation,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Privacy,Reality Tv", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "The recent controversy surrounding a reality TV show's depiction of a man's death in a New York hospital has sparked a debate about the nature of patients' privacy rights while being treated in emergency departments.\nThat incident spurred debate about hospitals' patient privacy policies, and highlighted the alarming frequency of healthcare professionals using social media to disclose patient information.\nWhile Chanko's face was blurred, his family easily recognized him on TV, with his wife telling ProPublica that \"I saw my husband die before my eyes.\"\nBut not everyone is as reassured that filming often-incapacitated patients in life-or-death situations, even with identity-concealing measures or consent, represents an ethical way to conduct care.\nChanko's family was outraged to find that his treatment and death were recorded without their permission and shown on an episode of \"NY Med,\" a reality show starring Dr. Mehmet Oz."}
