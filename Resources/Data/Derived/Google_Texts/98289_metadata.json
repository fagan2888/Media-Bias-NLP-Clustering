When it reopens, the pier will be longer.\n\nWork could begin as soon as today on the first phase of a $110 million project to protect Port Monmouth against coastal flooding like it experienced during superstorm Sandy.\n\nFederal officials, including Rep. Frank J. Pallone Jr., D-N.J., and Col. Paul Owen, commander of the New York District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, were at the site Friday morning to mark the beginning of the first leg of construction, which is expected to cost $17.7 million.\n\nDavid Gentile, project manager for the corps, told the Asbury Park Press on Thursday that the contractor could begin placing sand on the beach as soon as today, weather permitting. According to Pallone\u2019s office, an estimated 400,000 cubic yards of sand will be used in the beach replenishment, as well as the restoration and construction of protective dunes.\n\nThey expect sand placement to take 40 days, Gentile said, and during that time the beach will be closed off 500 feet in either direction of where work is taking place. The pumping of sand will begin near the Seabrook Wilson House and move east until reaching the Dunes at Shoal Creek condominium complex.\n\nThat will enable them to keep the fishing pier, which is being extended as part of this work, open for another three weeks, Gentile said. At that point, the fishing pier will be closed for seven to eight months, he added.\n\nThis is one of 11 coastal flood-mitigation projects that the Department of Environmental Protection and the Army corps are working on. The price tag could approach $1 billion, DEP commissioner Bob Martin said.\n\nTownship officials have said Sandy damaged 750 homes in the Port Monmouth section of the township, with 200 of those homes substantially damaged. The Port Monmouth Fire Company was flooded with more than 3 feet of water, though the volunteer department remained operational after the storm and served as a hub for donating and distributing food and supplies.\n\nRuss Zimmer: 732-557-5748, razimmer@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.app.com/story/news/local/monmouth-county/sandy-recovery/2014/06/13/sandy-port-monmouth-monmouth-county/10489249/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Sand pumping could begin this weekend, beach near work will be off limits and fishing pier to close in about three weeks", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Sand pumping could begin this weekend, beach near work will be off limits and fishing pier to close in about three weeks", "title": "Beach, pier closures part of Port Monmouth project", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/monmouth-county/sandy-recovery/2014/06/13/sandy-port-monmouth-monmouth-county/10489249/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sand pumping could begin this weekend, beach near work will be off limits and fishing pier to close in about three weeks", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eebd3d0c297a73b2761b5bbdfaddddfb657ea630/c=288-0-1440-1152&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/06/14/-asbbrd05-15-2014pressmon1a00320140514img-00000000.jpg11av7c31.jpg", "title": "Beach, pier closures part of Port Monmouth project", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/russ.zimmer.3"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Sandy, Port Monmouth, Monmouth County, beach replenishment"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1424\"", "article_summary": "Township officials have said Sandy damaged 750 homes in the Port Monmouth section of the township, with 200 of those homes substantially damaged.\nAt that point, the fishing pier will be closed for seven to eight months, he added.\nWork could begin as soon as today on the first phase of a $110 million project to protect Port Monmouth against coastal flooding like it experienced during superstorm Sandy.\nThe Port Monmouth Fire Company was flooded with more than 3 feet of water, though the volunteer department remained operational after the storm and served as a hub for donating and distributing food and supplies.\nThat will enable them to keep the fishing pier, which is being extended as part of this work, open for another three weeks, Gentile said."}
