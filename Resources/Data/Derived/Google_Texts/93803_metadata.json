Among them have been Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Barack Obama and, as seen here, John F. Kennedy.\n\nIn this photograph taken Oct. 17, 1953, then-Sen. Kennedy sits behind his wife, Jacqueline, and his sister, Eunice Shriver. The trio were at Notre Dame Stadium for a football game against Pittsburgh, which Notre Dame won 24-14.\n\nBorn on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, Mass., John was exposed to politics early on. His grandfather P.J. was a Massachusetts representative and senator in the late 1800s, and his father, Joseph, was the U.S. ambassador to Great Britain in the late 1930s.\n\nJohn, prior to embarking on his political career, graduated from Harvard University and served in the Naval Reserve during World War II. He was awarded a Purple Heart for the heroic rescue of his crew after the P.T. (patrol torpedo) boat he commanded was cut in half by a Japanese destroyer.\n\nIt was John\u2019s older brother, Joseph Jr., who originally was groomed for the presidency. When he was killed in action during the war, the family\u2019s great expectations fell to John.\n\nElected as a U.S. representative of Massachusetts in 1946, Kennedy served in Congress for six years. He then defeated Republican incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. in the 1952 U.S. senatorial election. Kennedy married Jacqueline Bouvier on Sept. 12, 1953, in Newport, R.I., and served from 1952 to 1960 as a senator for his home state.\n\nKennedy began his campaign for presidency in the 1960s, at a time when America faced increasing tensions abroad as well as at home. The race between him and Republican candidate Richard M. Nixon was uncomfortably close, with Nixon\u2019s experience facing off against Kennedy\u2019s youth and charisma. On Jan. 20, 1961, Kennedy was sworn in at the age of 43 as the 35th president of the United States.\n\nDue in part to his Irish Catholic roots, Kennedy maintained a longtime relationship with the University of Notre Dame. He spoke at the winter commencement ceremony and received an honorary degree from Notre Dame in 1950, and he received the university's Patriot of the Year Award in 1957.\n\nHe was given the Laetare Medal, the university\u2019s highest honor, in 1961. The Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh and the Rev. Edmund P. Joyce, then Notre Dame\u2019s president and vice president, respectively, were in attendance at the White House for the presentation of the medal.\n\nIn November 1963, on the day after Kennedy was assassinated, Notre Dame had been scheduled to play the University of Iowa in a football game. Out of respect and sadness, the game was canceled.\n\nThis information was provided by The History Museum.
