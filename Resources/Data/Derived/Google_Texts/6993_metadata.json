Mabank is about an hour southeast of Dallas. Cook\u2019s comments bounced around social media \u2013 and the Mabank Fire Department learned about the remarks. The department investigated, saying it took the allegations seriously. On Friday, the department announced on Facebook that Cook had been fired. The department wrote on Facebook: \u201cThe Mabank Fire Department does not condone nor promote these type of actions or thoughts. On behalf of all members, the Mabank Fire Department offers our deepest apologies to all that were offended by his actions and comments.\u201d Cook hasn't been talking with Tyler-area media. Here\u2019s more from KETK-TV. And here\u2019s a report from the Tyler Morning Telegraph. [KLTV]\n\nHighland Park is cleaning up its portable toilets. The Dallas Morning News reports: \u201cThey must be either located out of sight at the back of the property or hidden behind wood screening that shields three sides of the outhouse. The new rules are voluntary, but the city doesn\u2019t expect any issue with compliance. Wooden screens camouflaged potties at construction sites on Armstrong and Douglas avenues \u2026 They\u2019re a bit retro, given that early portable restrooms were made of wood and metal. That was in the 1940s during World War II when new military bases were quickly established, according to Portable Sanitation Association International. \u2026 Highland Park is not the first place to encourage creative design for public portable toilets. Karleen Kos, executive director of Portable Sanitation Association International, said some companies decorate their portables to blend with the area.\u201d [The Dallas Morning News]\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will soon rule on the Affordable Care Act. What will that mean for Texas? Shelley Kofler with Texas Public Radio in San Antonio reports: \u201cPlaintiffs in the case have argued that subsidies which help lower-income people pay for insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act should only be available in states that operate their own insurance markets. Texas is among 34 states that chose to have its residents use the federal government\u2019s exchange rather than set up its own. If the Supreme Court agrees with the plaintiffs, insurance subsidies would disappear for about 830,000 Texans who already receive them. Over 1 million Texans qualify for subsidies.\u201d [Texas Public Radio]\n\nAll of the rain falling on North Texas is causing problems with the roads. WFAA-TV reports: \u201cCountless \u2026 roads in North Texas have either buckled, given way or washed away, thanks to standing water or floods. Civil engineer Travis Attanasio said we are starting to see what happens when rain saturates our roadways, and it doesn't look good. \u2018The road surface is designed to generally be dry,\u2019 he explained. \u2018When you introduce water for a long period of time, it can break down some of the pavement.\u2019 And the longer the water stands on roads, Attanasio said, the worse it will get.\u201d [WFAA-TV]\n\nForget all of the important, serious legislation approved in Austin this spring. The Texas Legislature also voted on the official state hat and state crustacean. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports: \u201cDuring the 84th Legislature, which wrapped up June 1, they made sure that the cowboy hat is the official state hat of Texas, the western honeybee is the official state pollinator of Texas and \u2018Lone Star State\u2019 is the official nickname for Texas. Gov. Greg Abbott has signed into law many of the proposals and [had] until the end of Sunday to sign or veto proposals or they officially become law without his signature.\u201d Dripping Springs is the Wedding Capital of Texas. Jasper is the official Butterfly of Texas. And lawmakers voted the Texas Gulf Shrimp as the official state crustacean of Texas. Read more here.
