While Gibson got out of her apartment safely, she lost everything inside the building, including her musical equipment. She\u2019s currently in the middle of making a new record and attending grad school at Hunter College, and while her family and friends have offered clothes, toothbrushes, and couches to crash on, Gibson\u2019s still going to need a good chunk of change to re-start her life. Fundraisers are using Go Fund Me to hopefully raise about $10,000 for Gibson, though more would surely be appreciated. As of press time about two hours into the campaign, donors have drummed up about $3,000, which is a pretty substantial amount for such a short period of time.\n\nSend your Newswire tips to tips@avclub.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "", "og": {"url": "http://www.avclub.com/article/get-involved-internet-help-laura-gibson-after-her--217195", "image": "http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/5380/67/16x9/1200.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Friends and admirers of Laura Gibson are raising money for the folk singer-songwriter after she lost her home in a building explosion in New York City\u2019s East Village yesterday.
