From the real unemployment rate, for how many people are out of work. The labor participation rate is at record lows. People don\u2019t feel better off than they were five years ago, and obviously whether it\u2019s the GSA, the IRS, Syria, Ebola, the Secret Service, I means what\u2019s going well in regard to this administration and those senators who have followed him in lockstep?\u201d\n\nPriebus can\u2019t discuss the fact that the economy is doing better, so he had to change the subject by blaming President Obama for Ebola. Republicans, obviously, do not understand how crazy they sound. The leader of the Republican National Committee is blaming the President for a fake IRS scandal that Republicans created, a Secret Service scandal that is based on the agency\u2019s repeated failures to keep the president safe, and Ebola.\n\nOut of the roughly 320 million people in this country, two people got Ebola. In the Republican mindset, this means that Obama is now responsible for unleashing Ebola on the American people. Republicans never seemed too concerned about the real unemployment rate when George W. Bush was president, but under Obama falling unemployment rates no longer count.\n\nThe Republican Party would rather not discuss the improving economy. Another thing that Priebus never mentioned was Obamacare. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that Republicans believed that Obamacare would help them win back the Senate, now it is something that they don\u2019t discuss beyond a vague promise to \u201creform health care.\u201d\n\nRepublicans really will blame President Obama for anything, including Ebola.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Faced with the fact that the economy is getting better under this president, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus blamed Obama for Ebola on Meet The Press.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Faced with the fact that the economy is getting better under this president, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus blamed Obama for Ebola on Meet The Press.", "title": "RNC Chairman Reince Priebus Flips Out and Blames President Obama For Ebola", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/10/05/rnc-chairman-reince-priebus-flips-blames-president-obama-ebola.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/priebus-obama-ebola-meet-the-press.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-06T11:18:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,ebola in the United States,meet the press,obama blamed for ebola,Reince Priebus,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2014-10-05T12:17:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-06T11:18:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ebola in the United States, meet the press, obama blamed for ebola, Reince Priebus"}, "article_summary": "Faced with the fact that the economy is getting better under this president, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus blamed Obama for Ebola on Meet The Press.\nPriebus answered by blaming Obama for Ebola, \u201cI think you guys spelled it out pretty well when you had Mr. Pfeiffer on.\nFrom the real unemployment rate, for how many people are out of work.\nRepublicans never seemed too concerned about the real unemployment rate when George W.
