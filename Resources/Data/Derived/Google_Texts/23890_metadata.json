The makeup of the ObamaCare risk pools has been sicker and costlier than insurers hoped.\n\nThe clearest remedy for the losses is for insurers to raise premiums, perhaps by large amounts \u2014 something Republicans have long warned would happen under the healthcare law, known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\n\u201cThe industry is clearly setting the stage for bigger premium increases in 2017,\u201d said Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nInsurers will begin filing their proposed premium increases for 2017 soon. State regulators will review those proposals and then can either accept or reject them.\n\nMichael Taggart, a consultant with S&P Dow Jones Indices, pointed to data from his firm showing per capita costs for insurers are spiking in the ObamaCare marketplaces.\n\n\u201cWe made a significant change in the rules with the ACA, and we're still working through the process to see how that market stabilizes,\u201d Taggart said at a panel on Wednesday. \u201cIs [a death spiral] a possibility? Sure it's a possibility. I wouldn't attempt to put a probability on it, because I think there are a lot of things going on.\u201d\n\nOne factor helping to prevent a death spiral is ObamaCare's tax credits, which cushion the impact of premium increases on consumers.\n\n\u201cWhat we're likely to see is more of a market correction than any kind of death spiral,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cThere are enough people enrolled at this point that the market is sustainable. The premiums were just too low.\u201d\n\nDr. Mandy Cohen, the chief operating officer of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), said in an interview that there is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d a risk of a death spiral or collapse in the ObamaCare marketplaces.\n\nWhile acknowledging that \u201ccompanies are needing to adjust\u201d to the new system, she pointed to the 12.7 million people who signed up this year, 5 million of whom were new customers, as a sign of success.\n\n\u201cWhat brings us the most confidence about the long term stability and health of the marketplace is its growth,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nAnother risk, should regulators reject large premium increases, is that insurers could simply decide to cut their losses and drop off the exchanges altogether.\n\n\u201cGiven that most carriers have experienced losses in the exchanges, often large losses, it only makes sense that most exchange insurers will request significant rate increases for 2017,\u201d said Michael Adelberg, a former CMS official under President Obama and now a consultant at FaegreBD.\n\n\u201cMarket exits are not out of the question if an insurer is looking at consecutive years of losses and regulators are unable to approve rates that get the insurer to break-even.\u201d\n\nThe most prominent insurer eyeing the exits is UnitedHealth, which made waves in November by saying it was considering whether to leave ObamaCare in 2017 because of financial losses. The company last week announced that it is dropping its ObamaCare plans in Arkansas and Georgia, and more states could follow.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services argues that the attention on UnitedHealth is overblown, given that the insurer is actually a fairly small player in the marketplaces.\n\nIt\u2019s more important to watch what happens with Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, which are the backbone of the ObamaCare marketplaces.\n\nThere have been some rumblings of discontent from Blue Cross plans. The plan in New Mexico already dropped off the marketplace there last year after it lost money and state regulators rejected a proposed 51.6 percent premium increase. Now, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina says that it might drop out of the marketplace because of its losses.\n\nBlue Cross of North Carolina CEO Brad Wilson said in an interview that the company had lost $400 million due to its ObamaCare business.\n\n\u201cWe're not alone, and I think that that also is evidence to suggest that there are systemic and fundamental challenges that we all need to have a civilized conversation about,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nHe said a key factor in the decision on whether to stay in the market next year will be whether regulators approve whatever premium increase the company ends up proposing so as to try to make up for its losses.\n\nAsked about the risk of a death spiral, Wilson said he is not worried about that happening \u201ctomorrow,\u201d but has concerns if the situation does not change over time.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be something magical happen that will cause this to turn around,\u201d Wilson said. He is pressing for changes like further tightening up extra sign up periods that insurers say people use to game the system and repealing the Health Insurance Tax, which could help lower premiums.\n\nCohen of the CMS said that her agency is in close touch with insurers and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina in particular. But she pushed back on talk of Blue Cross of North Carolina dropping out of the marketplace, stating flatly, \u201cI have no concerns about them leaving the market.\u201d\n\nShe referred to problems the company has had with its computer systems that have led to some people being enrolled in the wrong plan, along with other issues that have added to the company\u2019s administrative costs.\n\n\u201cI know that they have struggled with some of their internal operations \u2026 but that is not related to anything to the health of the market itself or the risk pool,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nOverall, while the system set up by ObamaCare itself might be resilient, premium increases are sure to fuel Republican arguments that the law simply isn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cThere's more political risk here than anything else,\u201d Levitt said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cEither insurers will drop out or insurers will raise premiums,\u201d said one expert.", "description": "\u201cEither insurers will drop out or insurers will raise premiums,\u201d said one expert.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\u201cEither insurers will drop out or insurers will raise premiums,\u201d said one expert.", "title": "Insurers warn losses from ObamaCare are unsustainable", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/276366-insurers-warn-losses-from-obamacare-are-unsustainable", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamabaracktwo04142016getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-15T10:55:25-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-04-15T10:55-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/276366-insurers-warn-losses-from-obamacare-are-unsustainable", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-04-15T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Dustin Weaver", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-15T06:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T10:55:25-04:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/276366-insurers-warn-losses-from-obamacare-are-unsustainable", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\u201cEither insurers will drop out or insurers will raise premiums,\u201d said one expert.", "card": "summary", "title": "Insurers warn losses from ObamaCare are unsustainable"}, "dcterms.title": "Insurers warn losses from ObamaCare are unsustainable"}, "article_summary": "Cohen of the CMS said that her agency is in close touch with insurers and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina in particular.\nIt\u2019s more important to watch what happens with Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, which are the backbone of the ObamaCare marketplaces.\nNow, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina says that it might drop out of the marketplace because of its losses.\nThe makeup of the ObamaCare risk pools has been sicker and costlier than insurers hoped.\n\u201cThe industry is clearly setting the stage for bigger premium increases in 2017,\u201d said Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation."}
