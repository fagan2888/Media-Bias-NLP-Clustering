The company knows those overage charges could limit the amount of Netflix video people watch per month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about striking a balance that ensures a good streaming experience while avoiding unplanned fines from mobile providers,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Netflix has used the method for the past five years. The company also told the newspaper that it does not limit video speeds at two carriers \u2014 T-Mobile and Sprint \u2014 because they \u201chave had more consumer-friendly policies.\u201d\n\nThe limited download speed \u2014 and reduced quality \u2014 has occurred with the largest providers in the United States, Verizon and AT&T.\n\n\"We're outraged to learn that Netflix is apparently throttling video for their AT&T customers without their knowledge or consent,\u201d said AT&T Vice President Jim Cicconi.\n\nNetflix is sure to face more criticism for not disclosing the practice to its customers. It has been a strong champion of net neutrality rules, which are meant to bar Internet service providers from blocking or throttling Internet traffic. And it has battled providers over throttling in the past.\n\nNet neutrality rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission last year, however, only apply to Internet service providers like Comcast, which haul Internet traffic between users. The rules do not govern so-called edge providers \u2014 Web companies like Netflix that create content.\n\nIn the blog, Thursday night, Netflix said it is coming up with a \u201cdata saver feature\u201d in the next few months that will give customers more control of their video quality when watching on a mobile device.\n\nCurrently, Netflix says it caps its streaming video on mobile networks to 600 Kilobits per second. On its website, the company recommends 1.5 Megabits per second and at least 3 Megabits per second for SD quality.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The company is likely to face criticism for not disclosing the throttling to customers.", "description": "The company is likely to face criticism for not disclosing the throttling to customers.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The company is likely to face criticism for not disclosing the throttling to customers.", "title": "Netflix reveals that it throttles video over mobile networks", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/274289-netflix-throttles-its-video-over-mobile-networks", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/netflix_012214getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-25T11:54:54-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-25T11:54-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/274289-netflix-throttles-its-video-over-mobile-networks", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-25T09:58-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Netflix, AT&T, Verizon, throttle, streaming video, Mobile phone,,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-25T09:58:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-25T11:54:54-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/274289-netflix-throttles-its-video-over-mobile-networks", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The company is likely to face criticism for not disclosing the throttling to customers.", "card": "summary", "title": "Netflix reveals that it throttles video over mobile networks"}, "dcterms.title": "Netflix reveals that it throttles video over mobile networks"}, "article_summary": "Currently, Netflix says it caps its streaming video on mobile networks to 600 Kilobits per second.\nNetflix on Thursday disclosed that it throttles its own streaming video speeds when customers are watching through their smartphone data plan.\nThe company knows those overage charges could limit the amount of Netflix video people watch per month.\nThe result is that by the company\u2019s own standards it would be impossible to watch Netflix video in standard quality or high definition when on a mobile network.\nADVERTISEMENTThe company said the throttling helps protect customers from extra charges when people go over their phone provider's mobile data cap."}
