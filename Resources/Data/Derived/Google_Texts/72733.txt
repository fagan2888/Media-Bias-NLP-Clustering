With more than 20 years of coaching experience on the Division-I level, including two prior stints at Colonial Athletic Association-member schools, Milan Brown has been hired as assistant men’s basketball coach at the College of Charleston.

Brown, 44, joins head coach Earl Grant’s staff after serving five years as head men’s basketball coach from 2010-15 at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. He replaces former assistant coach Antonio Reynolds Dean, who accepted a position at his alma mater Rhode Island in May.

His previous ties to the CAA were assistant coaching stops at former league member Old Dominion (1995-97) and William & Mary (2000-02).

“We are excited about the addition of Milan Brown to our basketball family,” Grant said. “Milan has been very successful throughout his career as an assistant and most recently as a head coach.

“He is a man of character, a great recruiter, is very energetic and has a phenomenal basketball mind. Milan will strengthen our recruiting presence in the mid-Atlantic regions, as well as assist in recruiting the South.”

Last season, Holy Cross upset No. 25- ranked Harvard to mark the program’s first win over a ranked team since 1977.

“I am extremely blessed to have this opportunity to join the College of Charleston basketball program,” Brown said. “I understand the rich basketball tradition that Charleston has and I feel lucky to be a part of it. Coach Grant is a high-character person who brings a tremendous amount of positive energy and passion to this program. I look forward to working with Coach Grant, his staff and the players.”

Last season, Brown led Holy Cross to a 20-14 overall record en route to its first 20-win season since 2007. The Crusaders placed third in the Patriot League at 12-6 and received an invitation to the College-Insider.com Tournament.

Holy Cross’ 68-65 victory at Brown in the first round of the 2014 CIT was its first in a national postseason tournament since 2005.
