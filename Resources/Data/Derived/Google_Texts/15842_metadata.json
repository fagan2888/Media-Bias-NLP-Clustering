Chaffetz said the inquiry would not focus only on Clinton.\n\n\"If they want to have public exposure of all the records,\" Pelosi said, \"I would like to expose the records associated with their going into Iraq. Because at the time, as many of you know, I said the intelligence does not support the threat.\"\n\nShe reminded reporters how coverage often focused on the superficial issues, rather than the deep flaws in intelligence gathering.\n\n\"Isn't it shocking that your colleague, Brian Williams, more attention was paid to how he covered the war, than the war?\" Pelosi said at the weekly press briefing.\n\nThe former NBC Nightly News anchor, who has been leading breaking news coverage for MSNBC lately, was suspended from the network for six months amid controversy about fabricated stories from his time in Iraq.\n\nPelosi on Hillary Clinton, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Steny Hoyer and \u2018abortion on demand\u2019\n\nIn raising Iraq, Pelosi made a point that Democratic presidential candidate and Sen. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., might actually be able to use to his advantage.\n\nOn the campaign trail in Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders has regularly pointed how he was among the lawmakers to oppose the authorization for war in Iraq during the George W. Bush administration, while Clinton supported it.\n\nPelosi did, however, say that Clinton is a \"progressive,\" rebutting what Sanders has said on the campaign trail about the former first ladies bona fides with those on the left.\n\nContact Lesniewski at nielslesniewski@cqrollcall.com and follow him on Twitter at @nielslesniewski.\n\nRelated: A Long Primary is Good for Hillary Clinton", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday defended Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton from attacks on her record from Republicans, but stopped short of an endorsement.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday defended Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton from attacks on her record from Republicans, but stopped short of an endorsement.", "title": "Pelosi Defends Clinton, Does Not Yet Endorse", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/pelosi-defends-clinton-not-yet-endorse", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/2/2015/12/pelosi_07_121715_drago-445x297.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2016-02-05T15:32:23Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday defended Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton from attacks on her record from Republicans, but stopped short of an endorsement.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,category,category,category,author,RC-Tags,CQToday Topic,benghazi,democrats,nancy-pelosi,Benghazi,Hillary Clinton,poli", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2016-02-05T15:32:23Z", "modified_time": "2016-02-05T15:32:23Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday defended Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton from attacks on her record from Republicans, but stopped short of an endorsement.", "title": "Pelosi Defends Clinton, Does Not Yet Endorse", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/pelosi-defends-clinton-not-yet-endorse", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/2/2015/12/pelosi_07_121715_drago-445x297.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Related: A Long Primary is Good for Hillary Clinton\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday defended Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton from attacks on her record from Republicans, but stopped short of an endorsement.\n\"Are they so afraid of Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail that they have to have some subterfuge to change the subject, pull the conversation over here,\" Pelosi said.\nPelosi on Hillary Clinton, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Steny Hoyer and \u2018abortion on demand\u2019In raising Iraq, Pelosi made a point that Democratic presidential candidate and Sen.
