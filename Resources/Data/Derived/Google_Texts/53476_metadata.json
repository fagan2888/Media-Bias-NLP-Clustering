Deal volume for the first month of the year was half that of the same month in the previous year. Total deal value generated in January 2016 was at the lowest point since 2009. (See related chart, showing 10 years of January data.)\n\nThe month followed a down year and a dismal fourth quarter for the middle market, which Mergers & Acquisitions defines as deals valued between $10 million on the low end and $1 billion on the high end. The 2015 tally of completed deals fell 200 transactions short of the previous year, a decline of 8 percent. The fourth quarter showed a dramatic dip, with 167 fewer deals closed than the same period a year earlier, representing a 26 percent drop.\n\nIn January, for the second month in a row, the Composite score on Mergers & Acquisitions\u2019 Mid-Market M&A Conditions Index (MACI) indicated a contraction. December was the first time the Composite score moved into negative territory since Mergers & Acquisitions began our monthly surveys in the fall of 2013. The component scores for Leads, Signed Letters and Availability of Financing were all at their lowest recorded levels in January, suggesting we will see a prolonged slowdown in the first half of 2016. Participants cited a wide range of concerns, including stock market volatility, declining energy prices, rising interest rates, the slowing of China\u2019s economy and uncertainty in an election year. For more, see Mid-Market M&A Come to a Dead Stop, or is This a Momentary Pause. Having seen many economic cycles come and go, they may be motivated to get out while the going is good. Take Mergers & Acquisitions\u2019 monthly survey.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: To measure activity in the middle market, Mergers & Acquisitions looks at transactions that fulfill several requirements: Deals must have a value of roughly $1 billion or less; they must be completed (not just announced) within the timeframe designated; and they must include at least one U.S. company in the role of buyer and/or seller. Excluded from our charts are: recapitalizations; self tenders; exchange offers; repurchases; stake purchases; and transactions with undisclosed values, buyers or sellers. Our data provider is Thomson Reuters, which updates its databases continuously. We use the data available at press time. For the accompanying chart, data was collected on Feb. 1, 2016. For this article, we also analyzed data going back to 1978 that was collected on Feb. 8, 2016.\n\nDate Acquirer Target Target Industry Value ($mil) 01/22/16 DSV A/S UTi Worldwide Inc Transportation and Shipping (except air) 970.8 01/15/16 Pinnacle Foods Inc Boulder Brands Inc Wholesale Trade-Nondurable Goods 962.5 01/26/16 Amadeus IT Group SA Navitaire Inc Prepackaged Software 830.0 01/15/16 Protective Life Corp Genworth Life & Annuity-In-for Insurance 661.0 01/11/16 Kinross Gold Corp Barrick Gold Corp-Bald Mtain & Mining 610.0 01/01/16 Treasury Wine Estates Ltd Diageo PLC-US & UK Wine Op Food and Kindred Products 600.0 01/21/16 Svenska Cellulosa AB SCA Wausau Paper Corp Paper and Allied Products 514.5 01/14/16 Horizon Pharma PLC Crealta Pharmaceuticals LLC Drugs 510.0 01/07/16 Dover Corp Tokheim-Dispenser & System Bus Machinery 474.3 01/07/16 Lamar Advertising Co Clear Channel Outdoor Hldg-Ass Advertising Services 458.5 01/15/16 PulteGroup Inc JW Homes LLC-Certain Assets Construction Firms 450.0 01/07/16 Symrise AG Pinova Holdings Inc Chemicals and Allied Products 417.0 01/15/16 Zayo Group Holdings Inc MTS Allstream Holdings Inc Telecommunications 348.5 01/11/16 Liberty Utilities Corp Park Water Co Electric, Gas, and Water Distribution 327.0 01/05/16 Omnicell Inc Aesynt Inc Prepackaged Software 275.0 01/14/16 FireEye Inc iSIGHT Partners Inc Business Services 275.0 01/07/16 Sinocare Inc Nipro Diagnostics Inc Measuring, Medical, Photo Equipment;
