The technology is expected to be ready and available to Epic's EHR clients by year's end.\n\nLongtime Epic customer Kaiser Permanente will roll out the tool at its facilities across the country and will also make its evidence-based falls prevention program widely available to other health systems and health plans.\n\nThe technology is called STEADI, an acronym for Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths & Injuries. The tool is being designed based on CDC's guidelines for falls assessment. The goal is to make it easier for healthcare providers to screen for falls, intervene to reduce risk and provide follow-up care.\n\nThe announcement came at the end of a White House Fact Sheet released this morning regarding The White House Conference on Aging, which President Barack Obama is hosting today.\n\nThe sweeping conference agenda focuses on issues facing Americans as they plan for retirement. Many of the measures proposed build on the Affordable Care Act and on efforts to improve Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\"In a year that marks the 50th anniversary of Medicare, Medicaid and the Older Americans Act, as well as the 80th anniversary of Social Security, the White House Conference on Aging is an opportunity to recognize the importance of these programs, highlight new actions to support Americans as we age and focus on the powerful role that technology can play in the lives of older Americans in the decade ahead,\" the White House announced.\n\nFederal data to be released\n\nThe Administration announced that by September 2015, federal data sets relevant to aging and to elderly Americans would be made easily available on Data.gov, the repository for the U.S. government's open data. This resource will continuously be updated with datasets on aging, much like it is for other important Administration priorities such as climate, public safety and education.\n\n[See also: 16 healthcare data-driven geeks to watch.]\n\nHealth IT efforts\n\nLike Epic's several of the planned initiatives surrounding the aging initiative have healthcare IT underpinnings. These are put forward by the private sector:\n\nAs part of its annual HackFest, LeadingAge , an association of 6,000 not-for-profit organizations and businesses representing a broad field of aging services, will partner with Hewlett-Packard using HP's 3D immersive computing platform and Federal open data to challenge innovators to create technology-driven tools to improve the lives of older adults and their families.\n\n, an association of 6,000 not-for-profit organizations and businesses representing a broad field of aging services, will partner with Hewlett-Packard using HP's 3D immersive computing platform and Federal open data to challenge innovators to create technology-driven tools to improve the lives of older adults and their families.
