NEW YORK (MainStreet) – If you're even considering traveling abroad without at least looking into whether your health insurance will cover you in another country, just tack a few thousand dollars onto the cost of your excursion.

You'll need it.

"It's actually very important to consider, because most people will spend months planning for a trip, but they never plan for the unforeseen, and it's very difficult to do so. You may get sick overseas, you may get involved a car accident overseas — which is very common — or some sort of severe weather or natural disaster causes a flight cancellation, you lose your luggage, you miss a flight, your gear gets stolen. Any of these things can have a real impact on your travel, and if you're not insured you can have real financial hardship," says Ed Perkins, consumer advocate and insurance expert for online travel pricing and advice site SmarterTravel.

Many U.S. citizens have health programs that include charges outside the country, Perkins says, and typically, these folks do not need special travel coverage for ordinary medical expenses.



"Nevertheless, they might want to buy some insurance,” he says.

Both the Centers for Disease Control and the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs strongly agree. The CDC's Theresa E. Sommers suggests, at some length , preparing for a trip abroad by looking into travel insurance, travel health insurance and medical evacuation insurance.

The State Department takes it a step further by supplementing the CDC's suggestions for coverage from International SOS, Medex and the International Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers with a full list of U.S. and foreign insurance providers, calling medical and travel evacuation insurance “absolutely necessary.” The U.S. embassy or consulate can help find medical services, tell family and friends and assist in transfer of funds from home, but they can't pay for expenses.
