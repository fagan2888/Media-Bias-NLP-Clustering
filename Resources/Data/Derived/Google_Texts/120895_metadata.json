He said he\u2019s not the same person he was when he was convicted of burglary and residential burglary for incidents that happened in May 2005, when he was 28 years old.\n\nNow 36, he started a home computer-repair business called Computer Problems in 2010, has an associate degree in computer technology from the University of Phoenix, and is working with a local employment center to obtain grants to further his education. He said he just wants employers to give him a chance after many have turned him down because of his record.\n\n\u201cI feel a felony background automatically eliminates me from a good job that involves brain work,\u201d Clanin said. \u201cI regret the foolish choices I was making. When I was going through bad times growing up, I didn\u2019t have a good perspective on who I am or what I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nRobert Brame, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, led a January study published in the Crime and Delinquency journal, which showed 49 percent of black men and 40 percent of white men have been arrested by the time they turn 23. These arrests can hurt their ability to find work, go to school and participate fully in their communities.\n\nBrame has also done research that shows the older someone\u2019s criminal history is, the less predictive it is of future behavior.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to use it to screen people, if the rationale behind that is people might commit crimes in the future,\u201d Brame said, \u201cour research shows the older the criminal history is, the less valid it is to exclude people.\u201d\n\nUnlike some states, Illinois does allow convicted felons the right to vote, or to serve on a jury, once they have served their sentence. Convicted felons, with the exception of some people convicted of drug crimes, are eligible to receive federal student aid for college. The expansion of the Affordable Care Act this year even gave more recently released prisoners access to Medicaid.\n\nHowever, those searching for jobs find many employers are not willing to give them a chance, and make no distinction if a felony conviction came 2 years or 10 years ago.\n\nTax credits of up to $1,500 an employee are available to employers who hire felons, and the Illinois WorkNet Center, 1701 E Lincoln Highway, DeKalb, works with people who have criminal records.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 Daily Chronicle", "og": {"url": "http://www.daily-chronicle.com/2014/02/13/criminal-record-difficult-to-overcome-when-searching-for-jobs/ao27uyq/", "image": "http://www.daily-chronicle.com/_internal/cimg!0/ic7g2ywf6i4geby6xj1v8pkombluw5n", "site_name": "Daily Chronicle", "description": "DeKALB \u2013 Brandon Clanin knows his criminal record is keeping him from having the career he wants.", "title": "Criminal record difficult to overcome when searching for jobs"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.daily-chronicle.com/_internal/cimg!0/ic7g2ywf6i4geby6xj1v8pkombluw5n", "title": "Criminal record difficult to overcome when searching for jobs", "description": "DeKALB \u2013 Brandon Clanin knows his criminal record is keeping him from having the career he wants.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@daily_chronicle"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1109104291", "tout": {"article": {"id": "8160918c-f0bf-4277-aa7a-712c12edd01e"}}, "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde48b\"", "article_summary": "Convicted felons, with the exception of some people convicted of drug crimes, are eligible to receive federal student aid for college.\nDeKALB \u2013 Brandon Clanin knows his criminal record is keeping him from having the career he wants.\nBrame has also done research that shows the older someone\u2019s criminal history is, the less predictive it is of future behavior.\nHe said he just wants employers to give him a chance after many have turned him down because of his record.\nClanin, of DeKalb, was released from prison in 2009 and completed a year of parole."}
