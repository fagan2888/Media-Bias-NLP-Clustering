And the whole family did. Nobody really knew how to deal with it all, because it's the loss of three brothers,\" says Gibb, referencing fellow Bee Gee's and twin brothers Maurice Gibb and Robin Gibb, who died in 2003 and 2012 respectively, as well as Andy Gibb, a solo performer who passed away unexpectedly in 1988.\n\n\"He was only 30 years old,\" explains Barry Gibb, speaking of Andy, whose death followed years of alcohol and drug use. \"So it was all of that. And then we had to go through that valley, you know, the whole family. Even now, my mother is still, um, uh, one way or the other, she goes up and she goes down.\"\n\nThe Gibb matriarch is still alive, well into her 10th decade, as is the oldest sibling, a sister, named Leslie.\n\n\"[She] lives in Australia and, uh, I think, the last count, [had] eight children. So she's keeping it all going in her way,\" notes Wednesday's guest, before offering a final sobering thought on the topic.\n\n\"Leslie, me and mum. And, uh, we have the memories now. We have the memories.\"\n\nWatch the clip for more of Gibb's familial insights, and for the full interview with the Bee Gee superstar, watch CNN at 9p.\n\n-\n\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter\n\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram", "article_metadata": {"description": "Coming up tonight at 9, Piers Morgan opens his New York studio to entertainment icon and fellow countryman Barry Gibb, as the former Bee Gees star joins the program for a face to face, primetime interview.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Barry Gibb on the passing of his three younger brothers: \"Nobody really knew how to deal with it all\"", "og": {"url": "http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/29/barry-gibb-on-the-passing-of-his-three-younger-brothers-nobody-really-knew-how-to-deal-with-it-all/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140128164833-pmt-barry-gibb-on-surviving-his-brothers-00004627-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Coming up tonight at 9, Piers Morgan opens his New York studio to entertainment icon and fellow countryman Barry Gibb, as the former Bee Gees star joins the program for a face to face, primetime interview.", "title": "Barry Gibb on the passing of his three younger brothers: \"Nobody really knew how to deal with it all\""}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "Piers Morgan", "keywords": "in the chair, jason kurtz", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/169bdd3c913ad32d5e743b1d82ca1052?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00ed\"", "article_summary": "-\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram\nNobody really knew how to deal with it all, because it's the loss of three brothers,\" says Gibb, referencing fellow Bee Gee's and twin brothers Maurice Gibb and Robin Gibb, who died in 2003 and 2012 respectively, as well as Andy Gibb, a solo performer who passed away unexpectedly in 1988.\nComing up tonight at 9, Piers Morgan opens his New York studio to entertainment icon and fellow countryman Barry Gibb, as the former Bee Gees star joins the program for a face to face, primetime interview.\nEven now, my mother is still, um, uh, one way or the other, she goes up and she goes down.\"\n\"He was only 30 years old,\" explains Barry Gibb, speaking of Andy, whose death followed years of alcohol and drug use."}
