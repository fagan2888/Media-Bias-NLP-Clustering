I don\u2019t know if he was in the business, but he had marijuana growing at his home,\u201d Satur said.\n\nThe suspects also stole a 2001 red Jeep Cherokee, Colorado license, 917 YYH, and a 1997 Ford Econoline van. Police found the van in the 1700 block of Antero Drive Sunday afternoon, Satur said.\n\nThe victim went to the emergency room at Longmont United Hospital where he was treated for serious bodily injuries. He had facial fractures and lacerations to his head.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think this was random,\u201d Satur said.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or @dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Home invasion robbers beat Longmont man, steal marijuana and vehicles", "title": "Home invasion robbers beat Longmont man, steal marijuana and vehicles", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/03/home-invasion-robbers-beat-longmont-man-steal-marijuana-and-vehicles/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-03T14:36:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-03T14:36:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A 19-year-old Longmont man was hospitalized after thieves broke into his home early Sunday and beat him with a fire poker.\nTwo men wearing ski masks and dressed entirely in black entered the home and \u201cbeat him and stole some money and marijuana.\nThe home invasion assault and robbery happened at about 5 a.m. in the 1200 block of Atwood Street, said Longmont Police spokesman Jeff Satur.\nI don\u2019t know if he was in the business, but he had marijuana growing at his home,\u201d Satur said.\nThe victim went to the emergency room at Longmont United Hospital where he was treated for serious bodily injuries."}
