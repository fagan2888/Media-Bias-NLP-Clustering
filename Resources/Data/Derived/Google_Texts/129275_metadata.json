Four are Republicans and two are Democrats.\n\nCongressman John Fleming touts his experience in medicine and the military. He says he wants to protect gun and religious rights and support strong national defense.\n\n\"I plan to bring Louisiana conservative values to Washington,\" said Congressman Fleming (R), candidate for U.S. Senate.\n\nAlso with a background in medicine, Congressman Charles Boustany says he's the problem-solver and stands for energy production.\n\n\"I'm a conservative who's actually gotten results,\" said Congressman Boustany (R), candidate for U.S. Senate.\n\nRetired Colonel Rob Maness says he has the most experience in the military. He wants limited government with less executive overreach and more border control.\n\n\"Our country is weaker than it's ever been in my lifetime and I served for 32 years in the United States Air Force and we're not leading in the world,\" said Col. Maness (R), candidate for U.S. Senate.\n\nState Treasurer John Kennedy says he can fix the budget by cracking down on consulting contracts and overturning the Affordable Health Care Act.\n\n\"I see too many undeserving people at the top getting bailouts and too many undeserving people at the bottom getting handouts,\" said State Treasurer Kennedy (R), candidate for U.S. Senate.\n\nPublic Service Commissioner Foster Campbell has decades of experience working in the State Senate. He says he supports the working class and will focus on poverty.\n\n\"We need someone who is fighting for the people rather than the companies,\" said PSC Campbell (D), candidate for U.S. Senate.\n\nCaroline Fayard says her experience in law and travels across the world gives her insight into helping Louisiana. She says she's not a career politician and that's a good thing.\n\n\"I really just want to do what I can to bring good change and good jobs and good investment to Louisiana. I can do that by working with people in Washington D.C.\" said Fayard (D), candidate for U.S. Senate.\n\nThe forum was apart of the three day, 92nd annual Police Jury Conference that had more one-thousand attendees including city leaders and the Mayor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Louisiana candidates look to fill the United States Senate seat left by David&nbsp;Vitter.", "author": "Alex Meachum", "og": {"site_name": "ARKLATEXHOMEPAGE", "description": "Louisiana candidates look to fill the United States Senate seat left by David\u00a0Vitter.", "title": "Candidates for LA U.S. Senate speak before Police Jury Association", "url": "http://www.arklatexhomepage.com/news/local-news/candidates-for-la-us-senate-speak-before-police-jury-association", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/arklatexhomepage/photo/2016/03/05/congress-republican-democrat-generic_1457225754126_7370322_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 396619940517982}, "google-site-verification": "55B5QIQ_G08wzuww0ixMoJRHby1FuX41U2_nYzs4nfk", "keywords": "Local News,News,Top Stories,Local", "article": {"section": "Local News", "published_time": "2016-03-06T00:56:10+0000", "modified_time": "2016-03-06T00:56:10+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b7d\"", "article_summary": "Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell has decades of experience working in the State Senate.\n\"I'm a conservative who's actually gotten results,\" said Congressman Boustany (R), candidate for U.S. Senate.\n\"I plan to bring Louisiana conservative values to Washington,\" said Congressman Fleming (R), candidate for U.S. Senate.\n\"I see too many undeserving people at the top getting bailouts and too many undeserving people at the bottom getting handouts,\" said State Treasurer Kennedy (R), candidate for U.S. Senate.\nIn preparation of the November election the Police Jury Association held a forum to hear from the candidates."}
