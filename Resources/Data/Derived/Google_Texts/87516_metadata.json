At issue is whether the government can force, through mandates and \u201ccrippling fines,\u201d the owners of two family businesses, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood, to violate their personal religious convictions as regards the health care plans they make available to their employees.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Catholic contraception controversy.]\n\n\u201cClearly, whether it\u2019s Little Sisters of the Poor [an order of nuns that is fighting the same Obamacare mandate] or it\u2019s Hobby Lobby or a variety of other cases,\u201d Gingrich said, \u201cyou have a coercive government that is on certain grounds trying to create a totalitarian society in which you do what they say, whatever your beliefs are. And that\u2019s a fundamental denial of being American.\u201d\n\nGingrich is, of course, right. The issues raised by what is before the nation\u2019s highest court are only the latest in an ongoing struggle between those who believe the right to religious liberty is virtually sacrosanct and those who want any discussion of God or a universal creator driven from the public square. The predominance of the \u201cestablishment\u201d clause as the gauge for whether a policy passes constitutional muster at the expense of any consideration of the \u201cfree exercise\u201d where matters of religious liberty are concerned is bringing the nation closer and closer to a crisis point.\n\nRemember how the insertion of \u201cGod\u201d into the Democratic Party platform at its 2012 national convention in Charlotte, N.C., was voted down thrice before the chairman shoehorned it in over concerns about the message that would be sent to middle America if the author of the universe went unmentioned in the party\u2019s philosophical statement? The delegates on the floor of that convention were not only speaking for themselves but for a movement that regards the very idea of a Supreme Being as a not very cute, antiquated notion that is holding back the progress of mankind. Their position, apparently, is simple: They are not prepared to allow superstitious notions that have been discredited by the advent of science to prevent them from achieving their objectives.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Democratic Party.]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "peter-roff/blogentries", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Newt Gingrich Says Religious Liberty Is in 'Grave Danger'", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Newt Gingrich is right to warn us of the threat to religious freedom in America.", "title": "The End of Religious Liberty?", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2014/03/21/newt-gingrich-says-religious-liberty-is-in-grave-danger", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/9e/daabde69918f8260bc56ccd94313cf/3730FE_PR_080225religion.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Newt Gingrich is right to warn us of the threat to religious freedom in America.", "card": "summary", "title": "Newt Gingrich Says Religious Liberty Is in 'Grave Danger'"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "March 21, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Roff,religion,Gingrich, Newt,politics,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Newt Gingrich is right to warn us of the threat to religious freedom in America."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd051a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think we\u2019re in grave danger of losing our liberty and losing our religious liberty,\u201d the former speaker of the House told The Foundry, published by The Heritage Foundation.\nNever one to mince words, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said recently that Americans may soon find their ability to exercise the religious liberties they have long enjoyed severely curtailed.\nThe predominance of the \u201cestablishment\u201d clause as the gauge for whether a policy passes constitutional muster at the expense of any consideration of the \u201cfree exercise\u201d where matters of religious liberty are concerned is bringing the nation closer and closer to a crisis point.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s inconceivable that you could argue that the First Amendment doesn\u2019t mean what the First Amendment says.\"\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Democratic Party.]"}
