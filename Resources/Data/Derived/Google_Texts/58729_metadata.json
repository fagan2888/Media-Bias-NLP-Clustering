Although 48 years old at the time and over the traditional childbearing age, the unexpected organ removal immediately sent Jill Jacobs into menopause. A jury ruled in her favor, but according to the dancer, the $142,000 reward was \u201cshockingly low.\u201d\n\nWhen Jacobs was admitted to NYU Langone Hospital for surgery on her uterus, she signed a consent form under the impression that a total hysterectomy would only be done in the case of emergency, the NY Daily News reported. To Jacobs, an emergency was specifically cancer, something which blood tests clearly showed she did not have. Despite this fact, the doctors proceeded with removing Jacob\u2019s uterus, seeing it as \u201cthe best way to deal with the fibroids.\u201d\n\nJacobs has already sued the hospital for malpractice and won her lawsuit so the question is no longer who was right or wrong. What is up for debate is whether or not the amount that NYU Langone was forced to give the former ballerina in damages was just or shocking low. A jury decided that NYU Langone owed Jacobs a payout of $142,000. Of this, $132,000 is for damages for pain and suffering, and another $10,000 is for five years of future suffering.\n\nThis raises the question concerning how much a woman\u2019s reproductive organ is worth. In a recent case in Canada, a man sued a hospital for $150,000 for shortening his penis, an injury which caused him to not be able to perform sexually for two years. According to Jacobs, the removal of her uterus is worth far more. \u201cI\u2019m shocked\u201d Jacobs, now 54, told the NY Daily News, as she tried to hold back her tears. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very long road to bring your case to trial. You do it because what\u2019s done was wrong,\u201d the former ballerina added.\n\nTo Jacobs, it\u2019s not exactly the removal of her uterus that has her upset, but the \u201cbutchering\u201d of her body, done without her full knowledge. \u201cThis was a violation of a woman's body like none other,\" Jacobs\u2019 lawyer explained, as reported by Jezebel. The dancer describes how the surgery reminded her of the traumatic kidnapping and rape ordeal she went through when she was 20 years old.\n\nToday, Jacobs claims to be suffering from depression, various physical problems, and feels that her self-image has been severely damaged. What\u2019s even more appalling is the questioning that Jacobs endured at the hands of the defense lawyer. \u201cI urge you to award zero damages. There are no damages,\" Austa Devlin told the jury as she downplayed Jacob\u2019s physical and emotional injuries.\n\nSurprisingly, this removal of an organ without the patient\u2019s full knowledge isn\u2019t an isolated incidence. In England this April, a pregnant woman who entered the hospital to have her appendix removed had her ovary removed by accident. The woman later had a miscarriage and later died 19 years later from her injuries, AOL reported.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "jury, awards, woman, only, 142000, after, doctors, unexpectedly, removed, her, uterus, during", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A woman was awarded $142,000 for \"physical and emotional\" damages after her uterus was removed without her full knowledge, but she claims this amount is \"shockingly low.\"", "title": "The Jury\u2019s In And Apparently A Uterus Is Only Worth $142,000", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/jury-awards-woman-only-142000-after-doctors-unexpectedly-removed-her-uterus-during-surgery-290248", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/money.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A woman was awarded $142,000 for \"physical and emotional\" damages after her uterus was removed without her full knowledge, but she claims this amount is \"shockingly low.\"", "title": "The Jury\u2019s In And Apparently A Uterus Is Only Worth $142,000", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/jury-awards-woman-only-142000-after-doctors-unexpectedly-removed-her-uterus-during-surgery-290248", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/money.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/money.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-26T18:03:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-26T18:03:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A woman was awarded $142,000 for \"physical and emotional\" damages after her uterus was removed without her full knowledge, but she claims this amount is \"shockingly low.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc7da\"", "article_summary": "Although 48 years old at the time and over the traditional childbearing age, the unexpected organ removal immediately sent Jill Jacobs into menopause.\nIn England this April, a pregnant woman who entered the hospital to have her appendix removed had her ovary removed by accident.\nThe woman later had a miscarriage and later died 19 years later from her injuries, AOL reported.\nA New York University dance instructor was appalled when surgery to remove a uterine fibroid turned into a surprise hysterectomy.\nA jury decided that NYU Langone owed Jacobs a payout of $142,000."}
