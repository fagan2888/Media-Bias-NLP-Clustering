At a GCA training session last weekend, volunteers and staff told ThinkProgress that some of the biggest challenges to getting those who would benefit most from Obamacare to sign up for plans include widespread misunderstandings, a lack of knowledge about financial assistance available through the ACA, and pervasive skepticism about the law.\n\nAs the Hill notes, insurers may have an advantage over groups like GCA thanks to their brand name \u2014 something that may appeal to uninsured people who don\u2019t understand or trust health reform.\n\nInsurance companies have a major financial incentive to enroll as many people as possible \u2014 particularly healthier and younger Americans \u2014 before the March 31 enrollment deadline. A wider and more diversified risk pool is expected to push down costs in the marketplaces while bringing insurers more business.\n\nAt a health care conference sponsored by JP Morgan last month, insurance company executives described themselves as being \u201call-in\u201d on the ACA.\n\n\u201cDespite the near-term uncertainty, we believe exchanges will be growing as a big part of the market over time,\u201d WellPoint Inc. CEO Joseph Swedish told conference attendees. \u201cWe are more focused on the end game of exchanges than the twists and turns in the near term.\u201d\n\nOver four million Americans have enrolled in private health plans through Obamacare\u2019s marketplaces to date. An estimated six million Americans are projected to sign up this year \u2014 a number that balloons to 24 million over the next 10 years.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Big names like Blue Cross Blue Shield are ramping up their efforts to enroll the uninsured in private plans sold through the ACA's marketplaces.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Big names like Blue Cross Blue Shield are ramping up their efforts to enroll the uninsured in private plans sold through the ACA's marketplaces.", "title": "Insurance Companies Join The Final Push For Obamacare Enrollment", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/02/27/3337771/insurance-companies-final-obamacare-push/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/apimages_blue-cross-blue-shield-BCBS-obamacare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Big names like Blue Cross Blue Shield are ramping up their efforts to enroll the uninsured in private plans sold through the ACA's marketplaces.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/apimages_blue-cross-blue-shield-BCBS-obamacare-321x214.jpg", "title": "Insurance Companies Join The Final Push For Obamacare Enrollment", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/apimages_blue-cross-blue-shield-BCBS-obamacare.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/apimages_blue-cross-blue-shield-BCBS-obamacare.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-27T08:53:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1890\"", "article_summary": "Insurance companies have a major financial incentive to enroll as many people as possible \u2014 particularly healthier and younger Americans \u2014 before the March 31 enrollment deadline.\nA wider and more diversified risk pool is expected to push down costs in the marketplaces while bringing insurers more business.\nAt a health care conference sponsored by JP Morgan last month, insurance company executives described themselves as being \u201call-in\u201d on the ACA.\nHealth Insurance Companies Join The Final Push For Obamacare Enrollment CREDIT: AP Photo/Gerry Broome Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina holds a promotional event to pitch plans to consumersWith less than five weeks left before the deadline to sign up for health plans during the Affordable Care Act\u2019s first open enrollment season, insurance companies are ramping up their advertising and outreach efforts in an attempt to boost consumer demand and sell more of their policies through Obamacare\u2019s marketplaces.\n\u201cWe are more focused on the end game of exchanges than the twists and turns in the near term.\u201dOver four million Americans have enrolled in private health plans through Obamacare\u2019s marketplaces to date."}
