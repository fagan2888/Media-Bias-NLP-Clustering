In June, the Walmart rival Target Corp. agreed to sell its loss-making pharmacy division to CVS Health Corp. in a deal that will see CVS operate the pharmacies in 1,600 Target stores.\n\n\"We feel the decision we've made to run our own pharmacies is right for our business and shareholders,\" spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Tuesday.\n\nWalmart said its margins were being pinched by two factors: reduced reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which administer drug plans for employers and insurers, as well as a drop in high-margin cash transactions.\n\nWalmart lowered its full-year earnings-per-share forecast to a range of $4.40 to $4.70 from $4.70 to $5.05. The new forecast includes an 11-cent hit from lower pharmacy margins and other \"unplanned headwinds\" such as an increase in in-store theft.\n\nOn an earnings call, CFO Charles Holley said the pharmacy margins were falling because of lower reimbursement on \"some of the main drugs,\" without offering further details.\n\nRoss Muken, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said it was likely that Walmart just concluded contract negotiations with a major PBM, such as Express Scripts Holding Corp. or CVS, that resulted in lower rates. The trend was for lower rates, reflecting pressure on the healthcare industry overall to lower costs, he said. No one at CVS could be immediately reached for comment. A spokesman for Express Scripts declined to comment.\n\nThe drop-off in cash transactions most likely was due to more Walmart customers being insured on the back of the Affordable Care Act, Muken said. That hurts margins because managed plans can negotiate lower prices than an individual who pays cash.\n\nPBMs, which manage pharmacy benefits on behalf of employers and healthcare plans, over the past decade or so have consolidated into three main players \u2014 Express Scripts, CVS, and UnitedHealth Group. The government has blessed these mergers as one way to help rein in healthcare costs, since the big companies have tremendous negotiating power, Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj said.\n\nWalmart's pharmacy generates $19 billion a year in annual revenue, according to Evercore. That ranks as one of the largest drugstores in the US, but Walmart is still no match for the clout held by the top three PBMs, which collectively process about 70% of all prescriptions in the US, Lekraj said.\n\n\"With that kind of power they have in hand, they can dictate what pricing is going to be for the most part,\" Lekraj said.\n\n(Additional reporting By Peter Henderson; Editing by Ken Wills)\n\nRead the original article on Reuters.
