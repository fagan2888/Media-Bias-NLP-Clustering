A heat alert has been declared for parts of Southern California as possible record temperatures hit in the coming days.

The scorching heat wave, fueled by Santa Ana-wind conditions were increasing the fire danger in the parched region.

The alert, warning residents to stay indoors and hydrated, was expected to remain in effect Friday to Monday for the San Gabriel, San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys and the Los Angeles Basin.

Valley Residents Seeking Relief From Heat

"When temperatures are high, even a few hours of exertion may cause severe dehydration, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke," said Jeffery Gunzenhauser, the interim health officer for LA County. "Others who are frail or have chronic health conditions may develop serious health problems leading to death if they are exposed to high temperatures over several days."

Between Friday and Monday, temperatures are expected to reach above 100 in some areas of Southern California, according to the National Weather Service.

"High pressure building into California, so weâ€™re going to see some intense heat the next few days," said NBC4 meteorologist Crystal Egger. "That dome of hot air means it could get dangerously hot."

Weather officials expect the peak of the heat wave to be Saturday, when temperatures could surpass 105 degrees in the valleys, lower mountains and the Antelope Valley. Inland areas such as downtown LA could see temperatures "well into the 90s," according to a statement from the NWS.

If Los Angeles hits 95 degrees or warmer, it will be the hottest day since mid-May, Egger said.

Pedestrians in downtown LA were feeling the effects of the heat wave Friday.

"Today is pretty hot," said Manuel Bartl, who is visiting from Australia. "I should have used sun cream, but I will see that later when my skin is red."

"Stay hydrated, seek air conditioning, never leave kids of pets in a hot car," Egger said.
