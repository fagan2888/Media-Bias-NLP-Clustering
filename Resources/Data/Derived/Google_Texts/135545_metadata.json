Where you find one, the other typically follows. For many of the top players, their fathers were the ones who breathed life into their golf dreams. That was certainly the case for Ryan Palmer, a Texan who was 9 when his father, Butch, introduced him to the game.\n\nGolf helped cement the bond between Palmer and his father, who once played to a 6 handicap. It was the tool by which Palmer\u2019s father instilled in his son lasting lessons about sportsmanship and self-respect.\n\nIn an instant, a parent-child tie almost 39 years in the knotting unraveled horribly on a highway outside Palmer\u2019s hometown, Amarillo. On Aug. 19, Palmer\u2019s father was killed in a sport-utility-vehicle rollover. He was 71.\n\nTen days later, Palmer shot his third consecutive sub-70 score, a five-under-par 65, for a 54-hole total of nine under at the Barclays, the first event in the FedEx Cup playoffs. He was tied for fourth with Zach Johnson, the reigning British Open champion, and Henrik Stenson, two strokes behind the leaders, Sang-Moon Bae and Jason Day, who carded 63s.\n\nPalmer\u2019s serenity in the face of all the resistance that Plainfield Country Club has presented suggests that the father-son connection survived the crash on Loop 335, near the State Highway 136 exit.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhen I get inside the ropes, I get those four hours to not think a whole lot about it and really try to play golf with some peace and comfort,\u201d he said.\n\nThe difference this week, compared with the others in this season in which Palmer has recorded four top-10 finishes, is his concentration. He said he had never been so keenly focused on each shot and so quick to refocus on the next.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always hard on myself, but I\u2019ve not made one comment on one shot all week,\u201d Palmer said, \u201cand I\u2019m able to move on to the next hole and start the next hole with a good shot, and I think that\u2019s been key for this week.\u201d\n\nA perfect example was the 16th hole. Palmer\u2019s second shot on the par 5 found a greenside bunker, leaving him with a difficult stance for his next shot. With his left foot in the sand and his right leg bent as if he were a jogger limbering up in the goatee of grass above the bunker lip, Palmer swiped at the ball, but it rolled back into the sand. He hit his next shot fat and two-putted for a bogey 6.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling myself, \u2018O.K., it\u2019s O.K., got a little bad break there,\u2019 but I\u2019m not letting those breaks or shots affect me,\u201d said Palmer, who rebounded with two solid pars to keep himself in contention for a fourth PGA Tour title and his first since the 2010 Sony Open.\n\nSports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\n\nThe fingerprints of fathers were all over Plainfield Country Club. Bubba Watson, who ended the round in third, one stroke off the pace, talked Friday about how his father, Gerry, had showed him how to grip a golf club and then let him play, never to bestow or suggest another lesson.\n\nDay, who won the P.G.A. Championship in his last start, said his golf career was made possible by his father\u2019s death. After his father died of cancer, Day said, golf became the vehicle that steered him clear of the trouble he was finding around every corner in his native Australia.\n\nTwo volunteers whose fathers imbued them with a love for golf walked with Palmer\u2019s group. Ron Vincek, the scorekeeper, said his father, who is 90, played once a week and called him every weekend from Florida to go over his round.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat he shot and the whole deal,\u201d Vincek said. His father\u2019s goal, Vincek added, is to have four generations of Vincek men, including Vincek\u2019s 9-year-old grandson, play a round together. Vincek and the standard-bearer, Nick Rogus, could not help putting themselves in Palmer\u2019s position and imagining trying to battle both their grief and the course.\n\n\u201cWe were marveling the whole time at what a great round it was,\u201d Vincek said.\n\nThe fans in the gallery were supportive, yelling, \u201cGo, Aggies,\u201d as Palmer, who went to Texas A&M, made his way around the course. On the 18th hole, Rogus said, somebody yelled, \u201cGod bless your father.\u201d Palmer responded with a thumbs-up sign.\n\n\u201cHe was very, very appreciative to everybody,\u201d Rogus said. \u201cJust a great guy.\u201d\n\nPalmer\u2019s caddie, James Edmondson, has spent the last few nights eating dinner with Palmer and coaxing him to talk about his father.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the elephant in the room; I\u2019m not going to ignore it,\u201d Edmondson said. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool what he\u2019s doing right now under the circumstances.\u201d\n\nEdmondson said he worried that the time between Saturday\u2019s finish and Sunday\u2019s start, roughly 20 hours, \u201cwas going to be the hardest part.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday night, Palmer\u2019s wife, Jennifer, was scheduled to join them from Texas. After she watches her husband\u2019s final round, she is dragging Palmer to the first two days of tennis\u2019s United States Open so she can see Roger Federer play.\n\nThat drive to Queens will be scarier than any blind tee shot this week. Every time Palmer gets behind the wheel, he thinks of his father.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crept into my mind, for sure,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it. I mean, it can happen fast. But unfortunate that it happened, and obviously we\u2019re dealing with the pain as best we can.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150829204219, "twitter": {"description": "Palmer, whose father recently died, shot a five-under-par 65 and was tied for fourth at the Barclays, the first event in the FedEx Cup playoffs.", "title": "Ryan Palmer Plays On Despite a Painful Loss", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/sports/golf/ryan-palmer-plays-on-despite-a-painful-loss.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003881511"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/30/sports/30GOLF/30GOLF-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/sports/golf/ryan-palmer-plays-on-despite-a-painful-loss.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003881511", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/sports/golf/ryan-palmer-plays-on-despite-a-painful-loss.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "sports/golf", "hdl_p": "American Plays On Despite a Painful Loss", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/golf/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 29, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Golf,Palmer  Ryan,Barclays", "news_keywords": "Golf", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Karen Crouse", "SCG": "golf", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Palmer, Ryan", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By KAREN CROUSE", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Palmer, whose father recently died, shot a five-under-par 65 and was tied for fourth at the Barclays, the first event in the FedEx Cup playoffs.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/30/sports/30GOLF/30GOLF-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Palmer, whose father recently died, shot a five-under-par 65 and was tied for fourth at the Barclays, the first event in the FedEx Cup playoffs.", "CG": "sports", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 29, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/karen_crouse/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/sports/index.html", "section": "Golf", "modified": "2015-10-13", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/golf/index.jsonp", "tag": "Palmer, Ryan", "published": "2015-08-29", "section-taxonomy-id": "DE2B278B-2783-4506-AAD5-C15A5BB6DA1A"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "30golf", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151013160553, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/sports/golf/ryan-palmer-plays-on-despite-a-painful-loss.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/30/sports/30GOLF/30GOLF-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Palmer, whose father recently died, shot a five-under-par 65 and was tied for fourth at the Barclays, the first event in the FedEx Cup playoffs.", "title": "Ryan Palmer Plays On Despite a Painful Loss"}, "pdate": 20150829, "des": "Golf", "articleid": 100000003881511, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Ryan Palmer Plays On Despite a Painful Loss", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/30/sports/30GOLF/30GOLF-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "It was the tool by which Palmer\u2019s father instilled in his son lasting lessons about sportsmanship and self-respect.\nOn the 18th hole, Rogus said, somebody yelled, \u201cGod bless your father.\u201d Palmer responded with a thumbs-up sign.\nOn Aug. 19, Palmer\u2019s father was killed in a sport-utility-vehicle rollover.\nTen days later, Palmer shot his third consecutive sub-70 score, a five-under-par 65, for a 54-hole total of nine under at the Barclays, the first event in the FedEx Cup playoffs.\nThat was certainly the case for Ryan Palmer, a Texan who was 9 when his father, Butch, introduced him to the game."}
