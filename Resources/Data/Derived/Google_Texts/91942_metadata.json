While most can live with some anxiety about dental visits, others like 48-year-old Angie Barlow in the UK, find it terrifying. Barlow\u2019s dental phobia is so severe that a decade ago she performed do-it-yourself dentistry by supergluing her broken teeth, according to the BBC documentary \u201cThe Truth About Your Teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've always been scared of the dentist because my mum died at 34 from throat cancer,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cShe had a tooth out, and that's how they found she had cancer. That fear has always been in the back of my mind. You just get your mindset and you think, you \u2018don't go.\u2019 You don't make that phone call.\u201d\n\nDental anxiety and phobia are extremely common, with nine to 15 percent of Americans (30 to 40 million people) admitting they avoid visiting the dentist because of fear and anxiety. However, anxiety and phobia should not be used interchangeably. Dental phobia is a more serious condition that\u2019s associated with an intense fear or dread, similar to Barlow\u2019s experience.\n\nWhile her dental phobia contributed to her poor oral health, smoking ruined Barlow\u2019s teeth, damaging them and leading them to fall out often. \u201cWhen the tooth comes out, I just put a little bit of glue and try and hold it in place to keep it\u2026so I don't have a gap in my teeth. I used glue on the top of the tooth, and then I put it back in place until the glue is set,\u201d said Barlow before the surgery.\n\nOver the course of a decade, the toxic chemicals in the superglue led her to lose 90 percent of the bone supporting her teeth in the upper jaw. Barlow used her life\u2019s savings to receive emergency dental surgery, where 11 of her top teeth were extracted and six titanium screws were inserted into her jaw with 12 new teeth permanently attached. This helped restore her smile.\n\nDr. Kalesh Salenki, Barlow\u2019s dental surgeon, was surprised to see Barlow pull out her front teeth completed with a superglue filler. \u201cReally that\u2019s a denture. She\u2019s made herself a denture out of superglue, calculus \u2026 just having that out her mouth is going to make her mouth feel so much better,\u201d he said, The Mirror reported.\n\nOthers like Serpil Djemal, a dental consultant at King\u2019s College Hospital, share the same sentiment. Djemal said the case of DIY dentistry was one of the worst she had ever seen. \u201cWe certainly have our fair share of problems with teeth in the UK,\u201d Djemal said in the video.\n\nBarlow says she's gained a new sense of self-confidence and no longer feels ashamed of her appearance. \u201cWonderful isn\u2019t it, I feel amazing, and there\u2019s no hands over my mouth or embarrassment, and the difference people have said in me, noticed in me, my friends, things like that, they\u2019re just like, oh my God, you\u2019re more outgoing,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "diy, dental, care, british, woman, superglues, broken, teeth, 10, years, over, fear, dentist", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A British woman gets six titanium screws inserted into her jaw with 12 new teeth permanently attached after supergluing her broken teeth for a decade.", "title": "Woman 'Fixes' Broken Teeth With Superglue For 10 Years [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/diy-dental-care-british-woman-superglues-broken-teeth-10-years-over-fear-dentist-336092", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/06/02/dental-woes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A British woman gets six titanium screws inserted into her jaw with 12 new teeth permanently attached after supergluing her broken teeth for a decade.", "title": "Woman 'Fixes' Broken Teeth With Superglue For 10 Years [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/diy-dental-care-british-woman-superglues-broken-teeth-10-years-over-fear-dentist-336092", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/06/02/dental-woes.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/02/dental-woes.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2015-06-02T12:22:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-02T12:21:57-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A British woman gets six titanium screws inserted into her jaw with 12 new teeth permanently attached after supergluing her broken teeth for a decade."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0aa0\"", "article_summary": "While her dental phobia contributed to her poor oral health, smoking ruined Barlow\u2019s teeth, damaging them and leading them to fall out often.\nDental phobia is a more serious condition that\u2019s associated with an intense fear or dread, similar to Barlow\u2019s experience.\nDr. Kalesh Salenki, Barlow\u2019s dental surgeon, was surprised to see Barlow pull out her front teeth completed with a superglue filler.\nWhile most can live with some anxiety about dental visits, others like 48-year-old Angie Barlow in the UK, find it terrifying.\n\u201cWe certainly have our fair share of problems with teeth in the UK,\u201d Djemal said in the video."}
