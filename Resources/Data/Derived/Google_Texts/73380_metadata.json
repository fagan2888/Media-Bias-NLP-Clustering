His two-game suspension was too weak and the Ravens could no longer keep him on the team. Within days, Rice was cut and the NFL had extended Rice\u2019s suspension indefinitely.\n\nA similar progression of events has unfolded in the past week after Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson was arrested for hitting his 4-year-old son with a switch. Peterson missed the Vikings\u2019 game Sunday before the team reinstated him on Monday. Facing a public backlash, the Vikings admitted they made a mistake and placed Peterson on the exempt list Wednesday, meaning he is banned from all team activities until the completion of his case.\n\nBut while virtually nobody defended Rice\u2019s actions, many have offered quasi-defenses for Peterson. Yes, Peterson went too far, they say, but he was simply disciplining his kid\u2014something parents do all the time. \u201cWhipping\u2014we do that all the time,\u201d former NBA star Charles Barkley said Sunday. \u201cEvery black parent in the South is going to be in jail under those circumstances.\u201d Peterson offered a similar defense. \u201cI am not a perfect parent, but I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser,\u201d he said. \u201cI am someone that disciplined his child and did not intend to cause him any injury\u2026My goal is always to teach my son right from wrong and that's what I tried to do that day.\" Many other NFL players reacted similarly.\n\nThis is a big problem. More than 60 percent of Americans still believe that corporal punishment is an acceptable way to discipline children. But as Stacy Drury, a professor at Tulane and expert on early childhood development, explained to me, that\u2019s simply not true. Among the psychiatric profession, there is widespread agreement that not only does corporal punishment have long-term negative consequences on kids, it also isn\u2019t effective as a form of modifying behavior\u2014which is what discipline is ultimately supposed to do.
