Last week, the principal of Trumbull High School canceled a student production of \"Rent\" scheduled for next March. \"Rent\" is Jonathan Larson's 1994 rock musical about a group of colorful young people living and loving in a colorful wreck of a brownstone on New York's Lower East Side - when struggling young artists could afford the rent there.\n\nIt's not \"Mary Poppins.\" Life is messy, tender and intense. A couple of characters have gotten mixed up with drugs. Some are gay, in a day when that was often disdained; and a few have AIDS, in the days it was a death sentence. \"Rent\" was inspired by Puccini's \"La Boheme,\" set in Paris during the 1840s scourge of tuberculosis, when a lot of young people loved deeply, drank too much and hurt themselves, too.\n\n\"Rent\" won the Tony and the Pulitzer, and has been performed all over the world since 1994.
