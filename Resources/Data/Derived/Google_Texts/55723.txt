10 percent drop in Hoosiers selecting insurance through HealthCare.gov is due to new Medicaid options, officials say.

WASHINGTON — Fewer Hoosiers used the federal health exchange to get insurance this year than did last year, the federal government reported Thursday.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said 196,242 Hoosiers selected a 2016 plan through the open enrollment period that ended Jan. 31.

That compares with 219,185 Hoosiers who selected a 2015 plan during last year’s open enrollment period.

Nationally, 4 million more people selected a 2016 plan in the 38 states using HealthCare.gov.

The drop in Indiana is because some switched their coverage to Medicaid after Indiana expanded eligibility last year, according to federal and local officials.

But more than 200,000 Hoosiers estimated to be eligible for exchange coverage still haven’t signed up, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

Nearly half of this year’s plan selections were made by people living in the Indianapolis area.

Those without coverage could be upset when they face the increased penalty for not having insurance.

The penalty, which kicks in when 2016 federal income taxes are paid next year, is $695 per adult, or 2.5 percent of annual household income — whichever is higher.

Federal officials said that, based on what they heard from local enrollment sites and the response they tracked from enrollment reminders that mentioned the penalty, it was a large motivating factor.

“A lot of young people were used to getting that $500 (tax) refund … (and) didn’t want to lose it,” said Kevin Counihan, CEO of HealthCare.gov.

Julia Holloway, who ran the outreach and assistance program for Affiliated Service Providers of Indiana to enroll Hoosiers, said that reaction was particularly evident in the final few weeks.

“We've had more people talk about the penalty when they’ve called,” she said.

Subsidies to help purchase insurance are available to people earning from 100 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.

Indiana started allowing Hoosiers earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level into its new Medicaid program, HIP 2.0, about a month into 2015. About 65,000 Hoosiers already covered by Healthcare.gov qualified for HIP 2.0, according to the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration.

Spokesman Jim Gavin said last month it was too early to tell how this year’s Medicaid enrollment would be affected.

But Holloway and Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the drop in exchange enrollment from 2015 to 2016 is due to the shift to Medicaid for some enrollees.

Premiums for the 2016 plans available in Indiana through HealthCare.gov dropped an average 13 percent from 2015, the largest decline in the nation. But one reason is likely that Indiana's rates started out on the high side when plans were first available for 2014.

“I think people had a lot of choices,” Holloway said of 2016 coverage. “They were able to find some more affordable plans this time.”

Enrollment is up nearly 50 percent from the first year of coverage. But the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that eligible Hoosiers who lack coverage outnumber those who have chosen a plan.

Critics say that’s a sign of failure for the Affordable Care Act, which created the exchange and expanded Medicaid.

But Holloway said there are still many people who don’t know about the coverage options.

“I’m always repeating our phone number — 877-313-7215 — in hopes that people know who to call,” she said.
