RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella has defended World Cup referees, saying they have a tough and thankless job.

Match officials have already faced fierce criticism over a series of disputed decisions, including a penalty for host Brazil and two disallowed goals for Mexico.

Sabella said Saturday that “these are mistakes that are part of being human,” adding that “some situations were very subtle; you have to watch them several times.”

Being a referee is a hard job, the Argentina coach insisted.

He said “they are the only ones who don’t have any fans,” adding that “I trust the referees. You have to think positively, and maintain trust.”

It remains to be seen whether his trust is still high after Argentina’s World Cup opener against Bosnia-Herzegovina on Sunday.
