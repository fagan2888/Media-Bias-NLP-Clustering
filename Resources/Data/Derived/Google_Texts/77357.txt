BOULDER — One afternoon in March, a van rolled into the parking lot of the Humane Society of Boulder Valley, carrying five dogs who spent the previous weeks unadopted in Adams County.

The idea behind adding this group of transfer dogs was simple: They weren’t getting adopted at the public Adams County Animal Shelter, but maybe they’d have a better shot at Boulder’s privately run and resource-flush branch, so effective in pairing pets with owners that dogs spend an average of just six days in the kennel before finding homes.

Within two days of being placed on the adoption floor, a silky terrier named Ryder and two mixed breeds named Happy and Casper all found owners. The remaining pair, Pee Wee and Princess, followed shortly thereafter.

In Boulder County communities, where animal welfare is a priority, these scenarios play out daily.
