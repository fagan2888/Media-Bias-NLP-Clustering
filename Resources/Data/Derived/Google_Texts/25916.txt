Kobi Simmons, a combo guard from Alpharetta, Ga., committed to Arizona on Saturday and got good news on Sunday.

Simmons was selected as a McDonald's All-American, putting him in line to be the 22nd such honoree to play for the Wildcats.

Simmons will become the seventh McDonald's All-American to sign with Arizona in the past five years after the school went through a five-year drought without any at all.

Arizona head coach Sean Miller and assistant coach Book Richardson, fresh off Saturday night's home win over Washington State, flew east to visit Sunday with Simmons, who tweeted a picture with his arms around both coaches.

"My relationship with Coach Miller is very strong, and he is going to put the ball in my hands and allow me to make plays on and off the ball," Simmons told ESPN. "Also I think the Arizona style of play and the Pac-12 Conference's style of play best fits my game."

This year's McDonald's All-American Game will be played March 30 in Chicago.

Arizona could add to its McDonald's stock as the Cats are still pursuing wing Josh Jackson, the nation's No. 1 recruit. Jackson is expected to decide between Arizona and Michigan State.

Here is a list of all the McDonald's All-Americans to play for Arizona, and note that two other such players signed with the Wildcats but went directly into the pro ranks -- Ndudi Ebi (2002) and Brandon Jennings (2008):
