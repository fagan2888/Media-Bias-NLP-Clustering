The Chicago Sun-Times is reporting that private detectives hired by the Illinois Republican Party have been intimidating people gathering signatures to get the Libertarian Party on the state ballot for November. Check it out, from columnist Dan Mihalopouls:\n\nA couple of months after Julieus Hooks signed [the Libertarian Party's] nominating petitions, a man with a gun walked up to Hooks as he left his home in Oak Park.\n\nThe man said he was a private investigator. He told Hooks the petition that he had signed was fraudulent and asked him to sign something. Hooks hastily agreed to sign the paper.\n\n\u201cI did not have time to fully review this document because the man with the gun instructed me to sign it, and I was afraid of him and what he may do to me if I refused,\u201d Hooks says....\n\nHooks had signed a petition for the Libertarians in May. He recanted his story in the affidavit that the man with the gun got him to sign. But then Hooks swore a second affidavit saying he did not mean what he said in the affidavit for the armed man.\n\nAccording to the most recent version of his story, Hooks said, \u201cOn or about July 20, 2014, I was exiting my house when a tall Caucasian man and a woman approached and startled me. The man had a gun, which was visible. They told me that the woman who had circulated the petition sheet that I had signed had violated the law because she had obtained too many signatures and committed fraud. I was then given a piece of paper and told to sign.\u201d\n\nSarah Dart, who was paid to circulate petitions for the Libertarians and obtained Hooks\u2019 signature, told me a similar story. Dart says a private investigator named Carlos Rodriguez contacted her, asking about a missing girl who knew someone she supposedly knew.\n\nShe believes the story about the missing girl was a ruse. When she met with Rodriguez, Dart says he confronted her with a stack of petitions and asked her to admit that the signatures for the Libertarians were obtained fraudulently. She refused, and the state\u2019s hearing officer later found that her signatures were legitimately gathered.\n\nDart says Rodriguez displayed a holstered gun when he met her. He gave her a business card showing he works for Morrison Security in Alsip. The company\u2019s owner is the Palos Township Republican leader, Sean Morrison.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "File this under incredibly creepy.
