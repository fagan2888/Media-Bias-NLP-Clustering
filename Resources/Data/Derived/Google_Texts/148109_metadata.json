Here\u2019s his take on Obamacare, homosexuality and more, in his own words. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nBen Carson is a renowned pediatric neurosurgeon and possible Republican contender for the White House in 2016. Here\u2019s his take on Obamacare, homosexuality and more, in his own words. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nThe black man courting crowds of white conservatives doesn\u2019t seem like the same guy that H. Westley Phillips once idolized. Phillips still relishes the day he heard Ben Carson inspire minority students at Yale University with his story of persistence. He can still feel the nervous anticipation he had while waiting in line to shake Carson\u2019s hand.\n\nAfter the speech, Phillips followed Carson\u2019s path and began to study neurosurgery.\n\n\u201cI had come from a public school in Tulsa and came from a single-parent household and thought I was the admissions mistake,\u201d said Phillips, now 27. \u201cBut he gave me the comfort to know that if I did struggle \u2014 and I thought I would \u2014 that I wouldn\u2019t have been the first, and there are ways to handle it. The message he gave was this backup artillery when times were hard.\u201d\n\nFor many young African Americans who grew up seeing Carson as the embodiment of black achievement \u2014 a poor inner-city boy who became one of the world\u2019s most accomplished neurosurgeons \u2014 his emergence as a conservative hero and unabashed critic of the United States\u2019 first black president has been jarring.\n\nCarson has been a black icon since 1987, when he became the first person to successfully separate twins conjoined at the backs of their heads. He was a rare and much-desired role model: a black man who became known for his intellect, not for telling jokes or shooting basketballs.\n\nCarson poses for a photo with Page High School students Lizabeth Schaede, Anna Bateman and Atie Thomas while signing his book after a speech at the Carolina Theatre in Greensboro, N.C. (Jerry Wolford/For The Washington Post)\n\nPosters of Carson hung on bulletin boards in classrooms. Reading \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d his 1992 autobiography, was practically a rite of passage.\n\nBut now retired from his medical career, Carson, 63, has become known more widely since using his speech at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast to offer a conservative critique of U.S. health-care and spending policies, while standing a few feet from President Obama.\n\n[That time Ben Carson called President Obama a \u2018psychopath\u2019]\n\nIn the ensuing months and years, Carson\u2019s attacks grew sharper \u2014 deriding Obama\u2019s signature health-care law as the \u201cworst thing to have happened in this nation since slavery\u201d and, in the pages of GQ, likening Obama to a \u201cpsychopath.\u201d Carson\u2019s 2014 book, \u201cOne Nation,\u201d assails a decline of moral values in America and its government.\n\nAs Carson prepares to announce his candidacy for president on Monday in his home town of Detroit, his political base is now whiter and more rural.\n\nCarson\u2019s personal accomplishments \u2014 and the work he has done to help black communities \u2014 still garner respect and pride among African Americans. Yet, while he has been a conservative for as long as he has been famous, many worry that he risks eroding his legacy in their community and transforming himself into a fringe political figure.\n\nSome black pastors who were Carson\u2019s biggest promoters have stopped recommending his book. Members of minority medical organizations that long boasted of their affiliations with him say he is called an \u201cembarrassment\u201d on private online discussion groups.\n\nCarson, a retired neurosurgeon, delivers his speech at the Carolina Theatre in Greensboro, N.C. (Jerry Wolford/For The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cHas he lost his sense of who he is?\u201d said the Rev. Jamal Bryant, a prominent black pastor in Baltimore, where Carson lived for decades when he was director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital. \u201cHe does not see he is the next Herman Cain.\u201d\n\nMark Terrelonge, 26, who is in his final year at Stanford University School of Medicine, said he feels his heart sink every time another clip of Carson shows up on his Facebook feed.\n\nReading \u201cGifted Hands\u201d as a teenager, Terrelonge said he saw Carson\u2019s story as an affirmation of his own ambitions to become a doctor. Never before had he heard of a black man in the upper echelons of medicine. But Terrelonge, who is gay, was stung when he heard Carson say that homosexuality was a choice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say it exactly,\u201d Terrelonge said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to attack him because he\u2019s done great things in medicine, but the role-model aspect of him has kind of diminished in my life.\u201d\n\nCarson, too, is trying to fully understand his new place in black America. He spoke recently at the National Action Network, the civil rights group headed by the Rev. Al Sharpton, who once ran for president as a Democrat. Carson also issued a statement criticizing Baltimore demonstrators protesting after the death of Freddie Gray \u2014 urging parents to \u201cplease take control of your children and do not allow them to be exposed to the dangers of uncontrolled agitators on the streets.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Carson said he laments that many in the black community \u201cdrank the Kool-Aid and think I have forsaken them.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople write things. They say things. It saddens me,\u201d Carson said. \u201cThere are forces in this country that really like to foster division and conflict, particularly in the black community, because they don\u2019t want the synergy of them working together. Because that would advance them.\u201d\n\nThe admiration many blacks have long felt for Carson differentiates him from past black conservative presidential candidates such as Cain, the former pizza executive who briefly rose in the polls during the 2012 primary season, Carson\u2019s political supporters say. He has won the Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded by Republican President George W. Bush, and the Spingarn Medal, the top honor given by the traditionally liberal NAACP.\n\nHis stature, Carson supporters say, helps him combat the perception that the far right is exclusive and out of touch. Critics, these supporters say, underestimate Carson\u2019s potential impact on the race at their own peril.\n\n[He\u2019s already a famous surgeon and author, so why is Ben Carson toying with a long shot presidential bid?]\n\n\u201cI would be elated if the left felt this too shall pass and he is just the chocolate flavor of the election cycle,\u201d said Vernon Robinson, a fellow black conservative and chairman of the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee. So far, Robinson said, the group has raised $16 million.\n\n\u201cDespite everything so far,\u201d Robinson said, \u201che still has a reservoir of residual admiration.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s renown \u2014 and his stature in black America \u2014 dates to his early years as a pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins. Even then, Carson said, he always felt a sense of duty to help advance his race.\n\nWhen the hospital started to receive publicity in the late 1980s for its attempt to separate German twins conjoined at the back of the head, Carson took the unusual step of asking not to be initially identified as the lead surgeon.\n\nHe said he worried that the procedure might not be treated as groundbreaking or important if the media and the broader public saw a black man in charge.\n\n\u201cHistorically, when black people had done things of a scientific nature, many times either it wasn\u2019t appropriately covered or someone else received most of the credit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd I was thinking what more of a tremendous thing it would be for young black kids to know something of this magnitude and this complexity was done by someone who looked like them,\u201d Carson said.\n\nAfter the surgery, Carson \u2014 young and soft-spoken \u2014 stepped forward. Intrigued journalists became \u201cmore interested in me than they were in the twins,\u201d Carson recalled with a chuckle.\n\nSomeone suggested he write an autobiography. Agents kept calling for him, Carson said, \u201cand then I thought to myself, \u2018I should write a book.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cGifted Hands\u201d chronicles his unlikely journey into medicine. His mother, a devout Seventh-day Adventist, raised Carson and his brother alone. She taught them that they could be anything they wanted to be. Carson was the worst student in his class and suffered a debilitating anger after his father walked out on his family, he wrote.\n\nThe autobiography described how Carson\u2019s mother barred television from the house and mandated her children read two books a week. He wrote that he prayed to God to cleanse him from his angry feelings. His grades soared, and he went on to graduate from Yale and then the University of Michigan Medical School.\n\nHe became the youngest director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins and the first black person to hold the position.\n\nCarson said his agent expected the memoir to sell about 14,000 copies. According to its publisher Zondervan, the Christian arm of HarperCollins, it has sold 1.7 million.\n\nReligious leaders in the black community emphasized the spiritual overtones and recommended the book to their youth groups. Teachers saw the narrative of achievement and social mobility and taught the book in their schools.\n\nThe legend of Ben Carson took flight. He became a regular speaker at graduations and churches, encouraging parents to find positive role models for their children \u2014 particularly black men. He asked them to instill pride by teaching minorities about the many inventions of black people, including the traffic light, the gas mask and the hair products of entrepreneur Madam C.J. Walker.\n\nHe founded a nonprofit called the Carson Scholars Fund. The group has distributed nearly $700,000 for scholarships to middle- and high-schoolers, awarding them with big trophies so academic success could be put on the same plane as athletic success.\n\nCarson has also raised money to refurbish libraries in nearly 150 of the country\u2019s poorest schools. A Detroit public school was named for him, as was a medical school in Nigeria. By 2009, \u201cGifted Hands\u201d was adapted to a made-for-TV movie.\n\nMatt Dean Campbell, 25, remembers being tucked into bed growing up in South Florida as his mother read \u201cGifted Hands\u201d to him. His mother, a domestic worker, struggled to pay the bills, but she wanted to imbue her son with stories of uplift, he said.\n\nCampbell, now a high school teacher near Miami, said he has drawn on that message any time he has faced adversity. He was one of the slowest sprinters on his track team at the University of Michigan, Campbell said. He graduated as the captain. He continued pushing himself, because \u201cthat\u2019s what Ben Carson would do.\u201d\n\n[Ben Carson: New AP U.S. history course will make kids want to \u2018sign up for ISIS\u2019]\n\nSara McLaughlin, a teacher in Virginia Beach who works with troubled middle-schoolers, thought the book would be perfect for her class. Students wrote essays about Carson\u2019s resilience and got queasy when they watched the surgery scenes from the movie.\n\n\u201cIs this the same Ben Carson who is running for president?\u201d she recalled a student asking.\n\nThen came more questions: But he\u2019s not a politician, he\u2019s a doctor. Why would he run? A reading assignment became a civics lesson.\n\nMcLaughlin said she could offer no answer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people are asking the same thing.\u201d\n\nPresidential politics was not originally in Carson\u2019s plans, he said.\n\nRetirement, he said, meant relaxing in his Florida home, playing golf, maybe a television appearance here or there.\n\nThat all changed after his appearance at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast. It was the second time Carson was invited to speak at the event. The first time, in 1997, he made quips about the unfairness of HMOs. But this time, he went further. With repeated references to his tendency to be politically incorrect and offend the \u201cPC police,\u201d he offered an alternative view of health-care reform in which people would simply have private accounts to pay for their own care with pre-tax income. He railed against the debt and tax policies that seek to force the wealthy to pay a higher share than others \u2014 endorsing a flat tax, similar to tithing.\n\nCarson, who does not often speak with notes, insisted that this was not a political speech but an exhale of frustration of the state of the country. But then new admirers started suggesting he run for president. Within days, the Wall Street Journal published an editorial proclaiming \u201cBen Carson for President.\u201d He began thinking maybe he should.\n\nThe political turn was unexpected for many who knew him. The Rev. Frank Reid of Bethel AME Church in Baltimore found it \u201castounding.\u201d When they were at Yale together, Reid said, Carson was universally regarded as brilliant and hard-working. Reid could not recall Carson participating in student activism because he was too busy studying with his future wife, Candy, in the library.\n\nWhen Carson first promoted \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d Reid invited him to his church so his congregation could hear the story. But if Carson were to speak today, Reid said he would ask him to come in for a \u201cfamily session, with our leaders, behind closed doors, to find out what is really going on.\n\n\u201cI am hedging about what to say, because you cannot take away the impact that he\u2019s had,\u201d Reid said. \u201cBut before we turn on the brother, we have to hear him out. As shocking as some of the things he\u2019s said are, I would rather have a discussion than attack someone who has done respectful work.\u201d\n\n[The worst thing Ben Carson could do for \u2018Ben Carson\u2019 is run for president]\n\nCarson says he is willing to put his legacy aside to do what he thinks is best for the country. Still, it matters to him.\n\nSitting at the Sheraton Hotel in New York last month, Carson seemed anxious as he prepared to address the National Action Network a few hours later. This audience, a mostly black group seeking the advancement of black people, used to be an easy crowd for Carson. But times had changed.\n\n\u201cI have no idea how they are going to receive me,\u201d Carson said.\n\nAs Carson waited to go on stage, Sharpton pleaded with the crowd to give him a fair hearing. Carson got some applause when he reiterated his belief that marriage was between a man and a woman. He said it was \u201ca bunch of crap\u201d for critics to say he doesn\u2019t like black people anymore.\n\n\u201cI love black people. My wife is a black woman,\u201d he said.\n\nThen came the Carson of old, borrowing parts of the speeches he used to give in the 1990s.\n\nHe talked about the need for black role models and the importance of teaching young people about those black inventors. His voice shook as he described the horrors of growing up in neighborhoods crippled by drugs and overrun by rodents, and of losing families members to gun violence. He asserted that hard work and faith were able to lift him \u2014 and anyone else \u2014 out of poverty.\n\nThe crowd rose to their feet.\n\nThe next week, Carson returned to more comfortable terrain for a prospective GOP presidential candidate: the convention of the National Rifle Association. There, he spoke of how he thinks the need to control gun violence on the streets does not outweigh the need to combat \u201cradical Islamic terrorists.\u201d\n\nDays later, he appeared at a fundraiser for a faith-based medical clinic in the lush upstate South Carolina city of Greenville. He talked about the importance of putting God first and speaking honestly. The emcee of the event said Carson would help fill in the gap of having \u201cgood, godly leaders to stand up for what is right.\u201d The neurosurgeon received another standing ovation.\n\nCarson then sat at a table to sign copies of his books. A line of mostly white attendees formed. Near the end was Landry Assinesi, a 19-year-old student at Piedmont College in Georgia who came back home to listen to Carson speak.\n\nAssinesi said he never read \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d but he devoured \u201cOne Nation.\u201d Reading Carson\u2019s words, Assinesi said he found a new political hero.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The longtime role model for blacks now appeals to white conservatives as he embarks on a presidential bid.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/robertrsamuels", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The longtime role model for blacks now appeals to white conservatives as he embarks on a presidential bid.", "title": "As Ben Carson bashes Obama, many blacks see a hero\u2019s legacy fade", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-ben-carson-bashes-obama-many-blacks-see-a-heros-legacy-fade/2015/05/02/b9ce53c8-e850-11e4-9767-6276fc9b0ada_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/04/17/Others/Images/2015-04-16/09_jw_Ben_Carson_BC8U85451429230066.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@newsbysamuels"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-ben-carson-bashes-obama-many-blacks-see-a-heros-legacy-fade/2015/05/02/b9ce53c8-e850-11e4-9767-6276fc9b0ada_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/robertrsamuels"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "b9ce53c8-e850-11e4-9767-6276fc9b0ada"}, "article_summary": "Phillips still relishes the day he heard Ben Carson inspire minority students at Yale University with his story of persistence.\nBen Carson is a renowned pediatric neurosurgeon and possible Republican contender for the White House in 2016.\n[He\u2019s already a famous surgeon and author, so why is Ben Carson toying with a long shot presidential bid?]\nWithin days, the Wall Street Journal published an editorial proclaiming \u201cBen Carson for President.\u201d He began thinking maybe he should.\nBut Terrelonge, who is gay, was stung when he heard Carson say that homosexuality was a choice."}
