A Las Vegas woman has worked tirelessly for 115 days to obtain insurance through the Nevada Health Link- the state’s Obamacare website.

KVVU reports Donna Ehlen paid $283 for coverage in November, shortly after the launch of Obamacare, but her carrier, Nevada Health Co-Op, has only issued her a temporary insurance card.

The insurer has given temporary insurance cards to around 600 other Nevada residents facing similar problems.

Ehlen and the other 600 Nevada residents have tried to enroll in Obamacare, but their information is not reaching insurance carriers.

Tom Zumtobel, Nevada Health Co-Op CEO, admitted that “The complexity of the system to get the data to us has certainly been a challenge.” One part of the problem is that there is misinformation on the Nevada Health Link.

Most often, Xerox is the third-party that holds onto the data. Zumtobel explained that Nevada Health Co-Op has been actively working with the state and Xerox to fix problems.

Exasperated and growing weary, Ehlen is considering filing a fraud claim against the state of Nevada over her $283 payment.

“At this point I feel like I’ve given up my life. I’m on hold. I’ve been on hold for something like nine hours since the first of the year,” she said.
