Marco Rubio as the Republican establishment\u2019s presidential nomination Plan B, now that Jeb Bush has fizzled. One Miami-based conservative activist dismisses Rubio as a \u201cwhite Republican Obama.\u201d\n\nHow absurd. Rubio is not Bob Dole with palm trees. And, if Rubio is a \u201cmoderate,\u201d as rival candidate Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas claims, then Sen. John McCain is Ho Chi Minh.\n\nHow soon we forget: Marco Rubio was a 2010 Tea Party pinup. He was endorsed by the devoutly anti-establishment Club for Growth. Rather than grow a RINO horn, Rubio reliably votes with the Right. The American Conservative Union gave Rubio a 96 rating (out of 100) for 2014 and a 98 across his Senate career. Heritage Action handed Rubio a score of 94 last year and 91 lifetime. The equivalent Club for Growth numbers are 92 and 93.\n\nThese sparkling right-wing credentials notwithstanding, Rubio works and plays well enough with others to enact conservative legislation \u2013 sometimes with Democratic support.\n\n\u2022 Rubio and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., co-sponsored the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act. This law limits the Iranian-backed terrorist group\u2019s access to global financial markets and punishes banks that serve this band of killers.\n\n\u2022 Rubio torpedoed President Obama\u2019s planned bailout of his health insurance cronies who lose money on Obamacare. So far, Rubio has saved taxpayers some $2.5 billion and prevented insurers from socializing their Obamacare losses. Rubio\u2019s low-key amendment to the 2014 omnibus spending bill looks like the thumbtack that slowly will give Obamacare a flat tire.\n\n\u2022 In light of the Department of Veteran Affairs\u2019 appalling and deadly neglect of America\u2019s vets, Rubio sponsored legislation to make it easier for the VA secretary to fire incompetent and corrupt bureaucrats whose sloth actually has killed sick veterans as they awaited medical care.\n\n\u2022 Rubio and Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Bill Nelson of Florida were original sponsors of a December 2014 law that condemns and tightens sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s Castroite tyranny.\n\nTed Cruz is also an approved hero of the Tea Party and Club for Growth with sky-high conservative scores. Alas, Cruz\u2019s go-it-alone style has limited his effectiveness in passing legislation. Cruz\u2019s Senate website cites just one piece of legislation that he has guided into law: a 2014 statute barring entry visas to U.N. ambassadors who have committed espionage or terrorism against America or who threaten U.S. national security.\n\nAlso telling: Among those who work closely with both of these men, three Republican senators have endorsed Rubio \u2013 Montana\u2019s Steve Daines, Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner and Idaho\u2019s James Risch. In contrast, none of Cruz\u2019s Senate colleagues recommends him for president.\n\nRubio has raised suspicions for initially co-sponsoring comprehensive immigration reform, nicknamed \u201camnesty.\u201d However, Rubio abandoned the bill once it metastasized into a 1,198-page monstrosity.\n\nThe affable Marco Rubio votes with conservatives more than 90 percent of the time and even gets Democrats to back his reforms.
