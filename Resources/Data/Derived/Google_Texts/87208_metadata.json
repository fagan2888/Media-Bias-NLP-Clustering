Global greenhouse gas emissions are projected to rise by around 2.5 percent in 2015, an increase over 2013 levels but lower than the average increase during the past decade, according to a recent analysis by the PricewaterhouseCoopers consultancy firm.\n\nRelated: How Climate Change Costs Could Soar to the Billions\n\nWhile the Obama administration was celebrating the president\u2019s latest initiative, Republican leaders on Capitol Hill declined to comment on the new program, according to The Washington Post. Instead, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) made it clear that he hopes to block a key part of the Obama\u2019s climate control agenda.\n\nMcConnell campaigned for reelection vowing to block new administration regulations limiting carbon emissions from the nation\u2019s coal-fired power plants. He recently sent a letter to all 50 governors urging them not to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s proposed carbon limits on existing power plants \u2013 the nation\u2019s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nOnce enacted, those new EPA rules could close hundreds of coal-fired power plants, including many in McConnell\u2019s coal-rich home state.\n\nRelated: GOP Leaders Fume over Obama\u2019s Climate Deal with China\n\nWhile McConnell is limited to what he can do as majority leader to thwart the new EPA policy, The New York Times reported yesterday that he has taken the unusual step of providing governors with a legal blue print for them to follow in attempting to stop the rules in their state. The well-research letter asserted that Obama was \u201callowing the E.P.A to wrest control of a state\u2019s energy policy.\u201d\n\nIronically, McConnell and a network of foes of the EPA policy have structured their arguments in part on a legal brief written for a major coal company by Laurence H. Tribe, a renowned scholar of constitutional law at Harvard and a former mentor to Obama when he attended Harvard.\n\nIn that brief for Peabody Energy, the world's largest private-sector coal company, Tribe argued that the president\u2019s use of the existing Clean Air Act to promulgate the climate change regulations was unconstitutional, the New York Times reported.\n\nRelated: Obama Fights Global Warming, One Hot Spot at a Time\n\nMcConnell launched his campaign against the EPA rules on March 3 with an article published in the Lexington Herald-Leader in Kentucky citing Tribe in urging governors to refuse to submit climate change compliance plans to the EPA.\n\n\u201cIn reality, this proposed regulation would have a negligible effect on global climate but a profoundly negative impact on countless American families already struggling,\u201d McConnell wrote. \u201cThe regulation is unfair. It's probably illegal. And state officials can do something about it; in fact, many are already fighting back.\n\nIn some way, the majority leader\u2019s tactics are reminiscent of the Republicans\u2019 political and legal crusade to challenge Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and discourage states from expanding their Medicaid coverage.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama is stepping up his drive to combat greenhouse gas emissions that contr", "title": "\u2018King Coal\u2019 McConnell Wants to Scrap Obama\u2019s Carbon Plan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/20/King-Coal-McConnell-Wants-Scrap-Obama-s-Carbon-Plan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Mitch%20McConnell.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/20/King-Coal-McConnell-Wants-Scrap-Obama-s-Carbon-Plan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Mitch%20McConnell.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "President Obama is stepping up his drive to combat greenhouse gas emissions that contr", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd04c4\"", "article_summary": "McConnell campaigned for reelection vowing to block new administration regulations limiting carbon emissions from the nation\u2019s coal-fired power plants.\nInstead, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) made it clear that he hopes to block a key part of the Obama\u2019s climate control agenda.\nWhile many environmentalists and climate experts warn that climate change is approaching crisis levels, efforts by the U.S. and other major international polluters to reduce carbon emissions appears to be having some impact.\nIn that brief for Peabody Energy, the world's largest private-sector coal company, Tribe argued that the president\u2019s use of the existing Clean Air Act to promulgate the climate change regulations was unconstitutional, the New York Times reported.\nOnce enacted, those new EPA rules could close hundreds of coal-fired power plants, including many in McConnell\u2019s coal-rich home state."}
