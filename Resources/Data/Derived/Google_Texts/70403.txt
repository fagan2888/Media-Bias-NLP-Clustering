Marco Rubio’s general rule of thumb has been to stay out of contested GOP Senate primaries.

His first two 2014 Senate endorsements went to Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., a pair of promising, fresh-faced GOP challengers with no primary opposition.

Then he broke his own rule, perhaps seeing an opportunity that could pay dividends down the road.

The Florida Republican senator got behind Iowa state Sen. Joni Ernst on May 5, just days after a poll came out of the field showing Ernst with a double-digit lead for the first time in the five-way fight for the nomination.

Harper Polling, the GOP firm, finished its work in the field on a Friday; the Rubio endorsement leaked to the conservative Breitbart media outlet the following Monday. Ernst hasn’t let go of her lead since.

For Rubio, whose status as a presidential contender has diminished in Iowa over the last year, picking a side makes sense.

Rubio needs the equivalent of jumper cables to get back in the mix of Iowa GOP primary voters. He registered just 4 percent there in the latest caucus poll. Ernst, an Iraqi veteran who is the establishment’s pick for the seat, could be his vehicle to redemption.

Eleven days from the primary, Ernst is now the candidate to beat for the shot at the open Iowa Senate seat.

So Rubio doubled down on Friday, producing an ad for Ernst that will begin running in the state Saturday, according to The Des Moines Register.

It’s a $121,000 statewide buy that hails Ernst as a “mother, grandmother and Sunday school teacher” and will help her offset the financial disparity she’s confronting against businessman Mark Jacobs.
