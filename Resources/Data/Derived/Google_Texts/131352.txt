Sioux Falls, SD

Just next door to the Summit League Tournament, the 56th Home Show is also better than ever.

More than 250 local vendors set up inside the Sioux Falls Arena and Convention Center. Everything from kitchens to hot tubs were on display today. With the tournament moving out of the arena, that allows more flat floor space for vendors.

"It just allows us to expand just to give us more room, more space for our consumers to walk around so we're not quite so crowded," Co-Chairman for the Sioux Empire Home Show Tim Forsch said.

Forsch says the Summit League being close also helps bring in some extra foot traffic.

The Home Show will be going on Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
