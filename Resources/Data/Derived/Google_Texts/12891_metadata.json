Goudy. \u201cIt would destroy traditional Yakama fishing areas along the Columbia River and directly threaten the livelihood of tribal fishermen.\u201d\n\nThe Yakama were joined by Lummi Nation tribal members in taking to the river waters that would be touched by the terminal in Oregon to protest the proposal on May 20. They fished and scattered wild rose in the water to ceremonially affirm their commitment to protecting future generations. Closer to home, the Lummi are fighting to stop a proposed coal-train terminal at Cherry Point in Washington State.\n\n\u201cThe Lummi Nation has come here to support the Yakama Nation in the fight against coal in the Pacific Northwest,\u201d said Lummi Nation tribal council member Jay Julius, who spearheaded the Lummi\u2019s fight against the Gateway Pacific Terminal at Cherry Point.\n\nRELATED: Lummi Nation Officially Opposes Coal Export Terminal in Letter to Army Corps of Engineers\n\nQuinault Nation Passes Resolution to Oppose Coal Exports\n\nAccording to the East Oregonian the project would create between 25 and 30 permanent jobs, 2,000 construction jobs and inject about $250 million into the local economy.\n\nThe Oregon State Department of State Lands will make a decision by May 31, 2014, on whether to approve the proposal, which would entail the annual transport of nine million tons of coal aboard trains a mile and half long\u2014much more than local ecological systems can bear, the Yakama Nation said.\n\n\u201cThese coal terminals, whether in Boardman or at Cherry Point, put our livelihoods and our health in danger, and are a violation of treaty rights that were negotiated by our ancestors and agreed to by the American government,\u201d Julius told the East Oregonian.\n\nRELATED: Railroad to Disaster? Inland Tribes Fight to Avert Coal-Train Destruction\n\nBut, as Yakama Nation environmental manager Elizabeth Sanchey pointed out to the East Oregonian, there is no Yakama word for mitigation, and certainly not in regard to what is sacred to them.\n\n\u201cThe river runs through our veins,\u201d Sanchey told the East Oregonian. \u201cIt\u2019s who we are as a people, and it\u2019s our duty to protect it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation have joined the chorus of opposition to coal-rail terminals in the Northwest, adding their voice to those of the Lummi, Qu", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/21/yakama-come-out-swinging-against-coal-train-terminals-154970", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/coal_terminals_yakama_protest-yakima_herald.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Yakama Fight to Protect Fishing Sites From Coal Train Terminals"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-05-21T16:10-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/21/yakama-come-out-swinging-against-coal-train-terminals-154970", "dc": {"title": "Yakama Fight to Protect Fishing Sites From Coal Train Terminals"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Yakama Fight to Protect Fishing Sites From Coal Train Terminals"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis proposed coal terminal represents an attack on Yakama Nation treaty rights, civil rights and human rights,\u201d said Yakama Nation Chair JoDe L.
