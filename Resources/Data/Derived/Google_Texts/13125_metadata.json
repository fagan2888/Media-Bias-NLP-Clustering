Andre told the crowd that \u201cone of his idols\u201d \u2014 the Purple One, Prince \u2014 was backstage watching as they also ran through \u201cSpottieOttieDopaliscious,\u201d \u201cRoses\u201d and \u201cElevators.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of the set, Big Boi and Andre both took time to showcase some of their solo work from their double album, \u201cSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below,\u201d before rapper Future and Janelle Monae also made appearances.\n\n\u201cThis is my favorite group in the entire world,\u201d proclaimed Monae. \u201cAnd what we\u2019re witnessing tonight is history.\u201d\n\nOutkast\u2019s run of mainstream hits came at the end of their set as they went from \u201cMs. Jackson\u201d to \u201cSo Fresh, So Clean,\u201d \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d and \u201cHey Ya!\u201d They then tried to squeeze in an encore song with Killer Mike, but weren\u2019t able to perform it before the festival\u2019s 1 a.m. cutoff.\n\nEarlier in the day, Grouplove, Ellie Goulding, Chromeo and Girl Talk were among the acts that prepped the main stage before Outkast. Grouplove got the crowd dancing to tracks off their latest album \u201cSpreading Rumours,\u201d before Ellie Goulding really got fans fired up with her sunset set, drawing celebrities including Selena Gomez, Kendall and Kylie Jenner and Joe Jonas to the front for the Brit\u2019s high-energy performance. The Top-40 mainstay powered through her list of electro-pop hits like \u201cLights\u201d and \u201cI Need Your Love,\u201d before getting everyone to their feet with closer \u201cBurn.\u201d\n\nChromeo got the masses moving with their disco-flavored electro-funk. Although they are Coachella vets, this weekend brought them a few festival firsts \u2014 playing on a Friday and performing on the main stage, which they told CNN they found to be more challenging to connect with the crowd.\n\n\u201cOn the big stage, they\u2019re 50 feet away, so I could barely hear them,\u201d said guitarist and lead singer Dave 1 after their set. The duo ran through a mixture of familiar hits, including \u201cFancy Footwork\u201d and \u201cMomma\u2019s Boy,\u201d as well as tracks from their forthcoming album, \u201cWhite Women.\u201d Toro Y Moi made a guest appearance for recent single, \u201cCome Alive.\u201d\n\nOther Day 1 crowd-pleasers included Aloe Blacc, Bastille (who garnered a crowd that waited through their entire set to hear the familiar hit song \u201cPompeii\u201d), Broken Bells and HAIM. The sister act performed on the Outdoor Theatre during the peak of the heat in the afternoon. In between her now-notable \u201cbassface\u201d expressions, Este Haim told the crowd that she has been coming to Coachella since 2004, but that this is the first year she hasn\u2019t had to run through a rose bush or hop a fence to get inside.\n\nMeanwhile in the Sahara tent, newcomer Martin Garrix attracted a crowd that extended past the tent walls as he opened his set with his notable track \u201cAnimals.\u201d His mix included samples from other Coachella weekend acts like Kid Cudi and Krewella, which had the crowd yelling along to the lyrics. But the most impressive part of the 17-year-old\u2019s hour-set was the striking laser-light show that prompted the majority of the tent to take out their cell phones and capture it on video.\n\nMainstream DJ/producer Zedd continued the fist-pumping/sing-along combination next as he played his radio hits like \u201cStay the Night\u201d and \u201cClarity.\u201d The 24-year-old\u2019s set got the stamp of approval from Oscar winner Jared Leto who Instagrammed a photo from the stage writing \u201cMy friend @Zedd destroying #coachella.\u201d\n\nWith two more days ahead in Indio, California, Chromeo\u2019s Dave 1 summed up the festival\u2019s continued attraction calling it \u201cthe most indie-centric music curation\u201d with mainstream appeal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the festival where you have the coolest bands that get the biggest looks,\u201d he said. \u201cCoachella\u2019s got a sexiness to it that no other festival in the world has.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Are ya'll alive?\" Andre 3000 probed the first-day Coachella goers as he took the stage with Big Boi in the first of their reunion shows.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "93c0125b6e5dd793b0f306c174977ff3"}, "og": {"site_name": "WQAD.com", "description": "\u201cAre ya\u2019ll alive?\u201d Andre 3000 probed the first-day Coachella goers as he took the stage with Big Boi in the first of their reunion shows.", "title": "Coachella Day 1: Outkast reunite, celebs rock out", "url": "http://wqad.com/2014/04/12/coachella-day-1-outkast-reunite-celebs-rock-out/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/microphone.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/microphone.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@mytwitterhandle", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mytwitterhandle"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=339570924", "fb": {"pages": 32869603490}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wqad.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2882036417f6cd8ccaa6f6a7d2c6eaae?s=16", "application-name": "WQAD.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8", "published_time": "2014-04-12T21:48:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-12T21:49:13+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8"}, "keywords": "entertainment, coachella", "google-site-verification": "oCyrEMhIYdAYe44exrSiY6lwtVx417KNhwh2t4d9nwM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8704\"", "article_summary": "Earlier in the day, Grouplove, Ellie Goulding, Chromeo and Girl Talk were among the acts that prepped the main stage before Outkast.\n(CNN) \u2014 \u201cAre ya\u2019ll alive?\u201d Andre 3000 probed the first-day Coachella goers as he took the stage with Big Boi in the first of their reunion shows.\n\u201cAnd what we\u2019re witnessing tonight is history.\u201dOutkast\u2019s run of mainstream hits came at the end of their set as they went from \u201cMs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the festival where you have the coolest bands that get the biggest looks,\u201d he said.\nA notable legend was there to witness the first of their many reunion shows."}
