There is new work from major directors such as Peter Greenaway (\u201cEisenstein in Guanajuato\u201d) and Mika Kaurism\u00e4ki (\u201cThe Girl King\u201d), and discoveries to be made, such as the coming-of-age ensemble pieces \u201cHenry Gamble\u2019s Birthday Party\u201d and \u201cTake Me to the River.\u201d Documentaries include \u201cGazelle: The Love Issue,\u201d about the struggles of an HIV positive New York scenester, and \u201cWhen Bette Met Mae,\u201d which captures an encounter between Hollywood icons.\n\nMargaret Mead Film FestivalAmerican Museum of Natural History\n\nCentral Park West at West 79th Street; (212) 769-5100\n\nThursday\u2013Sunday\n\nFounded in honor of anthropologist Margaret Mead, the annual festival surveys the best in recent ethnographic documentaries and beyond. Among this year\u2019s subjects are Hungarian punks under communism (\u201cEast Punk Memories\u201d), the folk traditions of a Lithuanian village (\u201cLand of Songs\u201d) and the plight of state workers caught up in changing times in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (\u201cElephant\u2019s Dream\u201d). Closer to home, \u201cKilling Time\u201d considers the spiritual limbo of a Marine Corps base in Southern California.\n\nENLARGE A scene from Spike Lee\u2019s \u2018Bamboozled\u2019 (2000) Photo: New Line Cinema/Photofest\n\nBehind the Mask: \u2018Bamboozled\u2019 in Focus\n\nBAMcinematek\n\n30 Lafayette Ave., Brooklyn; (718) 636-4100\n\nOct. 28\u2013Nov. 3\n\nSpike Lee\u2019s satire of media, race and latter-day minstrelsy hit screens 15 years ago with a resounding thud. \u201cIt was unfairly dismissed,\u201d argues critic Ashley Clark, who explains why in his new book \u201cFacing Blackness.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very feel-bad movie, a film that ends with the murder of the lead character and a five-minute montage of Hollywood\u2019s racial history. That\u2019s not an invitation to go out on the town.\u201d Mr. Clark explores the movie\u2019s discomfiting but prescient truths with Mr. Lee in a post-screening Q&A that opens this series, which also includes key inspirations (\u201cA Face in the Crowd,\u201d \u201cNetwork\u201d), as well as Marlon Riggs\u2019s documentary \u201cEthnic Notions,\u201d a history of African-American stereotypes on screen.\n\n\u2018Les Vampires\u2019 & Musidora\n\nAnthology Film Archives\n\n32 Second Ave. (212) 505-5181\n\nThursday\u2013Sunday\n\nA tribute to the artist and French silent-cinema icon Musidora includes a centennial revival of \u201cLes Vampires,\u201d the classic Louis Feuillade serial that made the performer famous as Irma Vep. It was the start of a movie career that led to the actress directing and producing her own films, most of them now lost. Programs include the Olivier Assayas homage \u201cIrma Vep\u201d and series curator Michelle Handelman\u2019s study \u201cIrma Vep, the Last Breath.\u201d\n\nENLARGE The Marinelli Glacier as seen in Patricio Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s new documentary The Pearl Button Photo: Kino Lorber\n\n\u2018The Pearl Button\u2019\n\nIFC Center\n\n323 Sixth Ave.; (212) 924-7771\n\nFriday\u2013Oct. 29\n\nThe Chilean coastline runs more than 2,500 miles along the Pacific Ocean, as evident a geographical fact as its mountainous terrain. Filmmaker Patricio Guzm\u00e1n explores the land\u2019s relationship with water in his new, essay-like documentary, which poetically uses natural science to explore Chile\u2019s history of genocide. The saga of indigenous Fuegian tribes wiped out by 19th-century European settlers dovetails with the mass torture and killings executed by the Pinochet regime. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s captivating way with images and elegant narrative illuminate the darkest corners of his country\u2019s history, much as in this film\u2019s companion piece, \u201cNostalgia for the Light.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2015-10-21T20:28:00.000Z", "article.section": "US", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "The NewFest at Bow Tie Chelsea Cinemas, the Margaret Mead Film Festival at the American Museum of Natural History and more in this week\u2019s Repertory Film.", "title": "Festivals Celebrate Anthropology and LGBT Themes", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KW288_NYFILM_G_20151021120311.jpg", "alt": "The NewFest, the Margaret Mead Film Festival and more in this week\u2019s Repertory Film", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KW288_NYFILM_D_20151021120311.jpg"}, "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB11630658994359203567004581307392623696126&headline=The%20NewFest%2C%20the%20Margaret%20Mead%20Film%20Festival%20and%20more%20in%20this%20week%u2019s%20Repertory%20Film&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB11630658994359203567004581307392623696126"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "american museum of natural history,anthology film archives,bamcinematek,behind the mask: \u2018bamboozled\u2019 in focus,bow tie chelsea cinemas,ifc center,les vampires & musidora,margaret mead film festival,movies nyc,\u2018the pearl button\u2019,American Museum of Natural History,political,general news,arts,entertainment,festivals,movies", "news_keywords": "american museum of natural history,anthology film archives,bamcinematek,behind the mask: \u2018bamboozled\u2019 in focus,bow tie chelsea cinemas,ifc center,les vampires & musidora,margaret mead film festival,movies nyc,\u2018the pearl button\u2019", "article.headline": "The NewFest, the Margaret Mead Film Festival and more in this week\u2019s Repertory Film", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KW288_NYFILM_E_20151021120311.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KW288_NYFILM_D_20151021120311.jpg"}}, "description": "The NewFest at Bow Tie Chelsea Cinemas, the Margaret Mead Film Festival at the American Museum of Natural History and more in this week\u2019s Repertory Film.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB11630658994359203567004581307392623696126&headline=The%20NewFest%2C%20the%20Margaret%20Mead%20Film%20Festival%20and%20more%20in%20this%20week%u2019s%20Repertory%20Film&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB11630658994359203567004581307392623696126", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "New York", "article.summary": "The NewFest at Bow Tie Chelsea Cinemas, the Margaret Mead Film Festival at the American Museum of Natural History and more in this week\u2019s Repertory Film.", "page.site": "wsj", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-10-21T20:28:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-c64c", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj", "image_count": 3, "word_count": 530}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The NewFest at Bow Tie Chelsea Cinemas, the Margaret Mead Film Festival at the American Museum of Natural History and more in this week\u2019s Repertory Film.", "title": "Festivals Celebrate Anthropology and LGBT Themes", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/festivals-celebrate-anthropology-and-lgbt-themes-1445459333", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KW288_NYFILM_G_20151021120311.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Steve Dollar", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "Festivals Celebrate Anthropology and LGBT Themes", "article.type": "NY Culture", "article.id": "SB11630658994359203567004581307392623696126", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-10-21T20:28:00.000Z"}, "article_summary": "29The Chilean coastline runs more than 2,500 miles along the Pacific Ocean, as evident a geographical fact as its mountainous terrain.\nENLARGE A scene from Spike Lee\u2019s \u2018Bamboozled\u2019 (2000) Photo: New Line Cinema/PhotofestBehind the Mask: \u2018Bamboozled\u2019 in FocusBAMcinematek30 Lafayette Ave., Brooklyn;
