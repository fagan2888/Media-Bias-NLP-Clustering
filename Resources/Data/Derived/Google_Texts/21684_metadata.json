I did so because I put considerable effort into tracking down the current enrollment data and feel that it\u2019s important to have an idea of where things stand before #OE2 kicks off. You have to have an accurate baseline in order to understand what to expect in the next phase.\n\nAs I mentioned in my previous post, conservative pundits and right-slanted media immediately pounced on my \u201cdipped below 7M\u201d post from Thursday as evidence that \u201cObamacare is falling apart at the seams!\u201d\n\nThe good news is that yesterday, HHS released the encouraging news that the number was still at 7.1 million as of October. (And as I noted at my site, this means that there was a bit of a drop, but not nearly as significant one as limited state-level data was indicating.)\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that yes, there has been some attrition. And here\u2019s why that doesn\u2019t mean Obamacare is \u201cfalling apart at the seams.\u201d\n\nAttrition happens\n\nFirst: The main causes of the drop-off appear to mainly be one-time issues.\n\nAs you can see from my updated Graph, current enrollments were actually steadily rising up until August. In addition to the 12 percent or so of enrollees who simply never paid their first premium, there appear to be three main reasons why it\u2019s dropped off since April:\n\nEnrollees with immigration/citizenship data issues being dropped; enrollees with income data issues having their tax credits rescinded; and the expiration of the three-month \u201cgrace period\u201d for non-payers before insurers are allowed to drop them.\n\nThe first two of these should be reduced considerably this year as the enrollment/data verification process is streamlined and improved. (That is, fewer people with data issues should make it through the verification process in the first place). The last issue will probably be a continuing one year to year, but even so doesn\u2019t appear to be massive \u2026 perhaps 3 to 4 percent of the grand total.\n\nSo, going forward, it might be a good rule of thumb to simply assume that around 10 to 12 percent of the total won\u2019t pay the first month, and the number remaining will gradually drop by another 2 to 4 percent over the course of the year \u2026 until the following open enrollment period starts up again. Lesson learned.\n\nThere are valid reasons to drop a policy\n\nSecond, there\u2019s nothing necessarily \u201cwrong\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d about some people dropping their exchange policy.\n\nWhat if they turned 65 and have moved to Medicare? (As I\u2019ve noted before, roughly 2.5 percent of the original 8 million enrollees were 64 at the time, which means that somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 have likely turned 65 since last winter/spring.) What if they got a job with employer-sponsored coverage? What if they married someone who has coverage through their job? What if they fell on hard times and had to move to Medicaid? What if they moved out of the country? What if they happened to die? (Hey, it does happen to all of us.)\n\nAll of the above scenarios are either good (getting married, getting a job with ESI) or, at worst, neither good nor bad, they just \u2026 are. The whole point of insurance is to provide a safety net for however long you need it before moving on to something else (hopefully something better).\n\nThe fact that we already had a mish-mash of different types of healthcare coverage before the ACA means that very few people have kept the same type of coverage from birth to death anyway. As you age, as you change jobs, as you go through other life changes, you\u2019re going to naturally switch from your parents\u2019 plan, to your own through a job, or through your spouse, or through public programs, and then eventually to Medicare.\n\nAttrition will likely be negated\n\nThird: I\u2019m pretty confident that #OE2 enrollment will far more than cancel out any #OE1 attrition anyway.\n\nThe three points above being stated, I still suspect that the drop of a few hundred thousand people this fall is about to be more than overwhelmed during the second open enrollment period. By how much, I can\u2019t say yet (partly because I obviously don\u2019t know for sure; partly because I\u2019m saving my personal prediction for a separate post this week), but I think it\u2019s safe to say that the number of enrollees (yes, even paying enrollees) will be considerably higher by next February than it is today.\n\nNo magic number\n\nAnd fourth: As I mentioned in my column yesterday, there never was a \u201cmagic number\u201d in the first place. The 7 million mark was a CBO estimate of people who were likely to enroll in the first year.\n\nEven the \u2018drop-off\u2019 screams success\n\nFinally, focusing on the fact that natural and expected attrition has reduced to around 7 million the number of individuals who have gained marketplace coverage is a really great reminder that exchange enrollment numbers have far exceeded naysayers\u2019 predictions. I quoted this ASPE Issue Brief in a column Monday, but it bears repeating here:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is achieving its central aim: millions of Americans who were uninsured before now have access to affordable, high-quality health care. The number of uninsured people in the U.S. has decreased by nearly 26 percent over the past year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Focusing on the fact that natural and expected attrition has reduced to around 7 million the number of individuals who have gained marketplace coverage is a really great reminder that exchange enrollment numbers have far exceeded naysayers' predictions.", "og": {"site_name": "Health Insurance Resource Center", "description": "Focusing on the fact that natural and expected attrition has reduced to around 7 million the number of individuals who have gained marketplace coverage is a really great reminder that exchange enrollment numbers have far exceeded naysayers' predictions.", "title": "Over 7 million customers served", "url": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2014/11/11/over-7-million-customers-served/", "image": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/assets/2014/11/obamacare-attrition-coverage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1007310172}, "keywords": "attrition, Obamacare, Obamacare enrollment, OE2, open enrollment", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-11T18:15:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4af5\"", "article_summary": "(As I\u2019ve noted before, roughly 2.5 percent of the original 8 million enrollees were 64 at the time, which means that somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 have likely turned 65 since last winter/spring.)\nThe 7 million mark was a CBO estimate of people who were likely to enroll in the first year.\nI did so because I put considerable effort into tracking down the current enrollment data and feel that it\u2019s important to have an idea of where things stand before #OE2 kicks off.\nAnyone who knows me knows that I wasn\u2019t hyping this point in order to bash the success of the exchanges.\nYou have to have an accurate baseline in order to understand what to expect in the next phase."}
