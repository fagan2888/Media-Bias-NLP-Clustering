Vern Buchanan, R-Longboat Key.\n\n\u201cEighty-seven \u2014 that's the number of Republican traitors, including Speaker Boehner, who collapsed once again under Obama's lame duck presidency. Help us fund primaries to oust those who caved,\u201d the group says on its web site touting their effort.\n\nThe group is not just blowing off steam either, said Dan Backer, treasurer and general counsel for the Virginia-based group.\n\n\u201cWe are very serious about this,\u201d Backer said.\n\nEven though people such as Buchanan and U.S. Rep. Dan Webster, R-Orlando, have regularly voted against funding ObamaCare, Backer said neither gets a pass this time because they essentially voted to raise the debt ceiling with no spending cuts to right the nation's financial problems.\n\nBacker said there are people on the list his group has backed before and generally are well received by conservatives. But the vote to re-open the government was so egregious, he said, that voters deserve a chance to vote for someone else.\n\n\u201cWe want to give voters a credible choice in each of the districts,\u201d Backer said.\n\nIn mid-October, six Republicans in Florida joined with 81 other Republicans in Congress in voting to re-open the government and raise the nation's borrowing limit.\n\nBuchanan, first elected in 2006, said in an interview on Friday that he's not going to let any groups on the right or left bully him into making votes. He said there was no way he was going to let the U.S. default on its debts.\n\n\u201cI do what I think is right for out district,\u201d Buchanan said.\n\nNo Republicans had filed to challenge Buchanan in 2014 as of Friday. Bradenton's Mitch Mallett is the only Democrat so far to file to challenge Buchanan.\n\nBacker would not name any specific Republican candidates in any of the Florida districts, but assured his group is working through a \u201cstack of candidates\u201d that they could support.\n\nBacker said the group has four priority seats in Florida they are aiming for. Besides Buchanan and Webster, Backer said he wants opponents against Reps. Gus Bilirakis, R-Palm Harbor, and Ander Crenshaw, R-Jacksonville.\n\nThe Tea Party Leadership Fund has a history of supporting conservative candidates. In 2012, the group spent nearly $1 million supporting candidates, including Tea Party favorites Michele Bachmann in Minnesota, Paul Ryan in Wisconsin and Allen West in Florida, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending in Congress.\n\nRamirez files\n\nSiesta Key neighborhood activist Lourdes Ramirez has made official what most local GOP officials have been expecting for months.\n\nShe's running for the County Commission.\n\n\u201cSarasota County has a lot to offer, but it will take the style of leadership that is forward thinking to maximize opportunities while ensuring taxpayer dollars are invested and spent wisely,\u201d Ramirez said.\n\nRamirez said she wants to bring more balance to the development and environmental needs in the community. She said she's for reasonable development, but worries about Sarasota County allowing too much urban sprawl.\n\nRamirez, a New York native, has lived in Sarasota for 14 years. Ramirez was a marketer and consultant in the semi-conductor industry and believes that background will help give her insights into how to lure more high-tech jobs to Sarasota.\n\nRamirez, a Republican, is seeking to replace current commissioner Nora Patterson, who is not running for re-election.\n\nRamirez is the second candidate to enter the race. Earlier this year Alan Maio, vice president of design and engineering firm Kimley-Horn, filed to run for the seat.\n\nMore politics\n\nLooking for more political information.
