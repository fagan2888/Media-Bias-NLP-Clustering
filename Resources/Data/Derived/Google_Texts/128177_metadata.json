At Historic Low\n\nThe birth rate among teens in Massachusetts is at its lowest recorded level in the state\u2019s history, a report out Friday says.\n\nThe birth rate of teens ages 15-19 fell 14 percent last year, from 14 births per 1,000 women in 2012 to 12 births per 1,000 women in 2013, the Massachusetts Department of Health reported.\n\n\u201cThis is terrific news for all Massachusetts families, and a dramatic indication that our decisions to invest in our young people \u2014 through education, support and resources \u2014 can have a real and lasting impact on their lives and in their communities,\u201d Gov. Deval Patrick said in a statement.\n\nAccording to the report, there were 2,732 babies born to teen mothers between 15 and 19 years old in 2013, down from 3,219 the previous year. The number of children born to teen mothers in that age bracket is significantly lower than the 7,258 births reported in 1990.\n\nMunicipalities with more than 50 teen births in 2013: Boston (318), Brockton (96), Chelsea (55), Fall River (89), Holyoke (70), Lawrence (139), Lowell (106), Lynn (106), New Bedford (126), Springfield (289), Worcester (179). All of the above municipalities \u2014 with the exception of Chelsea, Holyoke and Leominster \u2014 are among the state\u2019s 30 most populated.\n\nThere are 276 municipalities in the state that saw four or fewer teen births in 2013. (Click to see a complete list of these municipalities.)\n\nHowever, the report does note that exact numbers could change to reflect updated information. It is also important to note that the exact figures above \u201care based upon the number of births and not on the number of mothers giving birth,\u201d the report says.\n\nAs of its release Friday, the report says there were 71,618 births to mothers living in Massachusetts in 2013, down from 72,457 births in 2012. Its findings show that of those babies, 32,069 were born to mothers under the age of 30.\n\nMore on this year\u2019s report:\n\nThis year\u2019s report has an updated format that contains a \u201cbrief summary of birth data, comparisons to recent years in order to note emerging trends, and six special topic areas created to stir more thorough discussion on a variety of health issues related to pregnancy.\u201d\n\nThe department statement added that other key data points in the document included:\n\n\u201cIn 2013, the percentage of pregnant women who had their teeth cleaned by a dentist or dental hygienist rose to 46 percent. Pregnancy can alter or complicate oral health in women, which can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and poor oral health in their children.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2013, the prevalence of gestational diabetes (GDM) was 5.3 percent, which is comparable to the 2012 prevalence of 5.6 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2013, more than half of mothers (53.1 percent) had a normal body mass index (BMI) prior to becoming pregnant.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, the cesarean delivery rate was 31.5 percebt compared to 31.7 percent in 2012. This figure was 4 percent lower than the percentage for the entire United States (32.7 percent).\n\nAccording to the report, data on births is based on information obtained from the Massachusetts Standard Certificate of Live Birth filed with the Registry of Vital Records and Statistics.\n\nRelated:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The birth rate of teens ages 15-19 fell 14 percent last year, from 14 births per 1,000 women in 2012 to 12 births per 1,000 women in 2013.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "The birth rate of teens ages 15-19 fell 14 percent last year, from 14 births per 1,000 women in 2012 to 12 births per 1,000 women in 2013.", "title": "Teen Birth Rate In Mass.
