Smokers may find themselves paying as much as 50 percent higher than non-smokers under the Affordable Care Act, according to a Bloomberg/Businessweek report.

The ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, prohibits insurers from charging people higher premiums for preexisting conditions such as diabetes or cancer. There's no such provision, however, preventing insurance companies from charging higher premiums to the 19 percent of Americans who smoke.

Some states - including California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts - prohibit charging smokers higher premiums. The surcharge isn't banned in Alabama, however, and will vary state-to-state. The average surcharge, according to Businessweek, is 20 percent.

At its highest, the penalty fora 55-year-old smoker could reach nearly $4,250 a year. A 60-year-old could wind up paying nearly $5,100 on top of premiums, Fox Business reports.

The ACA also prohibits people from using government healthcare subsidies to pay for the additional costs related to tobacco usage.

The American Lung Association and American Cancer Society have both spoken out against the surcharge, saying the benefits from encouraging people to kick the habit will be outweighed if they opt not to seek healthcare due to the higher costs.

Smoking claims about 443,000 Americans each year and costs the nation more than $193 billion in medical care and lost productivity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
