That\u2019s something we didn\u2019t do early in the season. Early in the season, we\u2019d open it up and get frustrated. But now we\u2019re finding ways to win hockey games.\u201d\n\nVarlamov faced 19 shots in the second period alone. Jason Demers had a power-play goal for the Stars in the period, tying it 1-1, but the Stars ultimately went 1-of-5 on the power play and gave up the two short-handed goals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty tired after back-to- back games,\u201d Varlamov said. \u201cWe played last night and got here late, and it was a very short night. This was a tough one as well, and I almost died after the second period. We took too many penalties, and they were all over us in the second period. Thank God that we scored. Those two (short-handed) goals helped a lot.\u201d\n\nSaid Avalanche coach Patrick Roy: \u201cI thought our penalty killing was really good, and we scored two short-handed goals. That gave us a chance to win this game, and Varly was phenomenal out there.\u201d\n\nVarlamov\u2019s fellow Russian, Mikhail Grigorenko, gave the Avs breathing room, making it 3-1 with 5:51 left, and that \u201cended\u201d Colorado\u2019s chances of winning all four by the same 2-1 score.\n\nThe Avalanche, at 26-21-3 and 55 points, leapfrogged the Minnesota Wild and moved into the Western Conference\u2019s first wild-card playoff spot.\n\nThe Avalanche played most of the game down a forward after winger Jack Skille fell, slid hard into the end boards and suffered a back injury in the first period.\n\nAlthough it was the second game in two nights, after losing Skille, Roy still additionally shortened his bench, with defensemen Chris Bigras (7:21) and Andrew Bodnaruck (7:13), plus Grigorenko (9:50) and Andreas Martinsen (7:04) getting limited ice time, especially under the back-to-back circumstances.\n\n\u201cI tried to roll 3\u00bd lines,\u201d said Roy. \u201cObviously, we have to find ways to win. Now we have two days before the next game (at San Jose). The way we have been playing, we were in that game, we had a chance to win. I just had to make decisions who going was the best for the team in order to try to win that thing.\u201d\n\nIt worked.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Semyon Varlamov makes 42 saves in Avalanche\u2019s 3-1 victory at Dallas", "title": "Semyon Varlamov makes 42 saves in Avalanche\u2019s 3-1 victory at Dallas", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/23/semyon-varlamov-makes-42-saves-in-avalanches-3-1-victory-at-dallas/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160123__Colorado-Avalanchep1.jpg", "height": 467}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160123__Colorado-Avalanchep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-23T20:48:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T02:07:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "This was a tough one as well, and I almost died after the second period.\n\u2026 It\u2019s important to win these ugly games, these 2-1 games, 1-0 games, and I think that shows maturity.\nBut now we\u2019re finding ways to win hockey games.\u201dVarlamov faced 19 shots in the second period alone.\nWe took too many penalties, and they were all over us in the second period.\nSemyon Varlamov again was strong in the Colorado net, making 42 saves and, not so coincidentally, allowing only one goal for the fourth consecutive time during the streak."}
