Cruz has come under attack for his stances on gay marriage and trans children.\n\nThe URL also once took people to HealthCare.gov, a site that provides information on the Affordable Care Act, which he has pledged to repeal.\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidates Donald Trump (R) and Ted Cruz (L) argue during the CBS News Republican Presidential Debate in Greenville, S.C. on Feb. 13, 2016.

But experts disagree that it's been resolved.\n\nA commentary in the Harvard Law Review last year argued as follows: \"Despite the happenstance of a birth across the border, there is no question that Senator Cruz has been a citizen from birth and is thus a 'natural born citizen' within the meaning of the Constitution.\"\n\nBut constitutional law professor Mary Brigid McManamon disagreed in an op-ed for The Washington Post.\n\n\"The law is clear,\" she wrote. \"The framers of the Constitution required the president of the United States to be born in the United States.\"\n\nLike Us On Facebook\n\n\n\nAlso on HuffPost:", "article_metadata": {"category": "Canada Politics", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4016594/images/s-TED-CRUZ-FOR-AMERICA-small.jpg", "description": "Has Canada ever mattered so much in a U.S. presidential election?", "sailthru.expire_date": "Fri, 19 Feb 2016 13:38:21 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Has Canada ever mattered so much in a U.S. presidential election?", "title": "Look Where 'TedCruzForAmerica.com' Takes You", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/02/18/ted-cruz-for-america-canadian-website_n_9266008.html", "see_also": "http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/05/26/tories-convention-harper-speech-leadership_n_10144194.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4016594/images/o-TED-CRUZ-FOR-AMERICA-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_CA", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostCanada", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Has Canada ever mattered so much in a U.S. presidential election?"}, "sailthru.date": "Thu, 18 Feb 2016 13:38:21 -0500", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "taboola.category": "canada-politics", "keywords": "video,Ted Cruz,ted cruz eligibility,ted cruz president eligible,ted cruz eligible,Ted Cruz Canadian,ted cruz canada,Ted Cruz Calgary,ted cruz birthplace,Ted Cruz birth,ted cruz for america,ted cruz for america canadian website", "fb": {"app_id": 100792273348438}, "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4016594/images/s-TED-CRUZ-FOR-AMERICA-small.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "video,Ted Cruz,ted cruz eligibility,ted cruz president eligible,ted cruz eligible,Ted Cruz Canadian,ted cruz canada,Ted Cruz Calgary,ted cruz birthplace,Ted Cruz birth,ted cruz for america,ted cruz for america canadian website", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/huffpostcapolitics", "section": "Canada Politics"}, "thumbnail": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4016594/images/o-TED-CRUZ-FOR-AMERICA-facebook.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump (R) and Ted Cruz (L) argue during the CBS News Republican Presidential Debate in Greenville, S.C. on Feb. 13, 2016.\n\"The framers of the Constitution required the president of the United States to be born in the United States.\"\nAt issue is whether Cruz can be president because he wasn't born in the United States.\nCruz has said the matter is settled \u2014 he renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014.\nADVERTISEMENTTed Cruz may have renounced his Canadian citizenship."}
