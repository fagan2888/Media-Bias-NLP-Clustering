Aurora Q2 operating margin soars to 9.8%

Milwaukee-based Aurora Health Care has reported an operating margin of 9.8 percent for the three months ended June 30, up from a 3.2 percent margin in the second quarter of 2013.

Aurora's operating income totaled $113.4 million in the second quarter of this year, compared with just $33.6 million during the second quarter of 2013. Patient service revenue increased by 5.6 percent year-over-year to $56.8 million.

The increase in patient service revenue was partly driven by increased Medicaid provider attestation reimbursement and additional reimbursement for previously uninsured and underinsured patients who gained coverage from Medicaid expansion or the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act health insurance exchanges. Adult inpatient days and physician clinic, hospital outpatient and other visits were both up 5 percent year-over-year. Total revenue for the three months ended June 30 was $1.16 billion, up from $1.03 billion in the second quarter of 2013.

For the six months ended June 30, Aurora reported operating income of $200.4 million and an operating margin of 8.9 percent, up from operating income of $64.6 million and a margin of 3.2 percent for the first half of 2013. Patient service revenue increased by 3.9 percent year-over-year to $77.5 million during the first six months of 2014, driven by the same factors that led to increased revenue in the second quarter. Adult average length of stay increased 6 percent year-over-year, while observation and bedded outpatient visits increased by 22 percent. Physician clinic, hospital outpatient and other visits were also up year-over-year by 4 percent. Total revenue was $2.24 billion for the first half of this year, compared with $2.05 billion in the first half of 2013.
