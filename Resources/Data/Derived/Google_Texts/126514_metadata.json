According to a new study published in Annals of Emergency Medicine, young adults who had a history of dangerous binge-drinking were able to reduce their alcohol consumption by 50 percent after receiving text messages following an ER visit.\n\n\u201cEach day in the U.S., more than 50,000 adults ages 18 to 24 visit ERs and up to half have hazardous alcohol use patterns,\u201d said Dr. Brian Suffoletto of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, in a press release. \u201cMore than a third of them report alcohol abuse or dependence. The emergency department provides a unique setting to screen young adults for drinking problems and to engage with them via their preferred mode of communication to reduce future use.\u201d\n\nThe study involved 765 young people who had a history of binge drinking. One-third of them received questions about their alcohol consumption via text, and also received feedback based on their answers. The ER\u2019s feedback aimed to boost the young adults\u2019 \u201clow-risk drinking plans\u201d and to help them cut back on drinking. Another third of the participants received only text message questions, and the last third didn\u2019t receive any text messages. The group that received both questions and feedback was able to reduce its binge drinking by 51 percent, and lower their daily drinks by 31 percent (binge drinking in women is considered to be four or more drinks per day; in men, it\u2019s five or more).\n\n\u201cIllicit drugs and opiates grab all the headlines, but alcohol remains the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the U.S.,\u201d Suffoletto said in the press release. \u201cIf we can intervene in a meaningful way in the health and habits of people when they are young, we could make a real dent in that tragic statistic. Alcohol may bring them to the ER, but we can do our part to keep them from becoming repeat visitors.\u201d\n\nThough most people assume that college students are the most likely to binge drink, 70 percent of binge drinking episodes involve adults aged 26 and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But perhaps more concerning, 90 percent of all drinking episodes in underage drinkers takes the form of binge drinking. Moderating alcohol consumption across all age groups is obviously an important public health issue.\n\nSource: Suffoletto B, Kristan J, Callaway C, Kim K, Chung T, Monti P. \u201cA Text Message Alcohol Intervention for Young Adult Emergency Department Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial.\u201d Annals of Emergency Medicine, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "binge, drinkers, who, get, texts, er, are, less, likely, drink, helps, prevent, alcohol, related", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Young people who are heavy drinkers were able to reduce their alcohol consumption after receiving feedback texts from the emergency room.", "title": "Binge Drinkers Who Get Friendly Texts From The ER Drink 50% Less", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/binge-drinkers-who-get-texts-er-are-less-likely-drink-helps-prevent-alcohol-related-deaths-292744", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/12/binge.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Young people who are heavy drinkers were able to reduce their alcohol consumption after receiving feedback texts from the emergency room.", "title": "Binge Drinkers Who Get Friendly Texts From The ER Drink 50% Less", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/binge-drinkers-who-get-texts-er-are-less-likely-drink-helps-prevent-alcohol-related-deaths-292744", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/12/binge.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/12/binge.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-12T17:32:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-13T11:03:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Young people who are heavy drinkers were able to reduce their alcohol consumption after receiving feedback texts from the emergency room."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbbe5\"", "article_summary": "But perhaps more concerning, 90 percent of all drinking episodes in underage drinkers takes the form of binge drinking.\nThe ER\u2019s feedback aimed to boost the young adults\u2019 \u201clow-risk drinking plans\u201d and to help them cut back on drinking.\nReceiving a friendly text from the emergency room (ER) might be the best way to keep you from going overboard on alcohol.\nAnother third of the participants received only text message questions, and the last third didn\u2019t receive any text messages.\nOne-third of them received questions about their alcohol consumption via text, and also received feedback based on their answers."}
