Goins Administrative Building at Pellissippi State on Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this battle since 1994,\u201d she said after sitting through a two-hour meeting of the 3-Star Healthy Project, a controversial task force empaneled by state House Speaker Beth Harwell to seek ways to help close the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d facing 300,000 Tennesseans frozen out of both the state Medicaid program and coverage available through the federal Affordable Care Act. They make too much for state coverage and too little to receive tax credits for ACA coverage. One presumption in planning the ACA was the expansion of state Medicaid to provide coverage for the poor. But in Tennessee and other states, that did not occur.\n\nMcKown didn\u2019t much like what she\u2019d just heard. The panel\u2014which on Thursday included Knoxville Republican Rep. Roger Kane, Crossville Republican Rep. Cameron Sexton, and Memphis Democrat Rep. Karen Camper\u2014refereed discussion ranging from the importance of smoking cessation to obesity and substance abuse prevention and the need for more primary care providers in the state. One option discussed: The use of health savings accounts for the poor, which one medical provider dismissed as largely unworkable.\n\nMcKown thinks the panel, in its apparent emphasis on preventative care, also missed a crucial chronic-care point: Sometimes catastrophe strikes. In her case it was a progressive neurological disease called olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) she was diagnosed with in 1989.\n\n\u201cYou know what? I\u2019m not overweight. I didn\u2019t smoke, I didn\u2019t do drugs\u2026 Please. Enough is enough,\u201d said McKown, 66, who first took on the mantle of health care reform when she went without care for a few months after her COBRA coverage expired in 1994 and she had to desperately search for a willing insurer. Medicare now provides the health-care coverage she relies on to this day. She advocates a single-payer system, and \u201cwe\u2019ll get over this business of funding the gap.\u201d\n\nMcKown and dozens of others at the committee meeting sported \u201cClose the Gap\u201d stickers. That same simple message was communicated to lawmakers by silent protesters standing at the rear of an auditorium holding a banner.\n\nA wealth of Knoxville-area health care providers and executives offered testimony to the panel. Most of them shared a similar theme: East Tennessee health care is in a world of hurt.\n\nWhile recent figures based upon University of Tennessee research suggest only 8.2 percent of the state population is now without health insurance, \u201cevery county in East Tennessee is far above 8 percent in uninsured (adults),\u201d said Ben Harrington, executive director of the Mental Health Association of Tennessee. He said the number of uninsured is about 14 percent in Knox County, and is higher in nearby, more rural counties.\n\n\u201cStarting a pilot program and trying to chip away at 5-10 percent [of the uninsured population] isn\u2019t going to help these folks one bit,\u201d Harrington said.\n\nKane said the initial pilot program would include about 150,000 people, and could ultimately expand to cover 500,000. \u201cWe understand that the working poor, there\u2019s really no other option for them,\u201d he said. He noted \u201cat this point there are a lot of variables we are working with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to have a phased-in approach,\u201d Sexton said in response to Bo Carey, a small-business owner and member of the National Federation of Independent Business who told the panel other members were \u201cwary\u201d of an expansion of government-subsidized health-care in Tennessee.\n\n\u201cI think anything we come up with there will be measurable outcomes,\u201d Sexton said.\n\nExecutives and health-care providers from the University of Tennessee Medical Center, Covenant, Tennova Health Care, and Cherokee Health System stated their cases before the panel, and most were in agreement on the need to expand health services, bolster primary care networks, and adopt, in many cases, a case-management system for more vulnerable patients. This would likely limit visits to the ER for nonemergency ailments\u2014a major source of monetary hemorrhage for hospitals.\n\n\u201cI think we all agree that the problem is not access to care,\u201d said David Hall, chief operating officer of UT Medical Center. \u201cIt\u2019s where and when people receive that care.\u201d Often those lacking a primary care physician will wait for treatment \u201cuntil they\u2019re really, really sick.\u201d\n\nHe said more than 13,000 annual patient \u201cencounters\u201d at UTMC were with the uninsured, and 85 percent of those originated in the emergency department. This cost the medical system $19 million a year, money that otherwise would \u201cbe able to be invested back in our community.\u201d\n\nThis prompted a discussion of expanding access to urgent care centers, where acute problems can be identified before they progress. Other ideas revolved around \u201cTelenet\u201d remote diagnostic opportunities and other technology, expanding payment and fee-waiver options, and reducing the overall cost of health-care services.\n\nThis applies to both medical and mental-health needs\u2014which were a prominent part of the discussion. Knoxville Police Department Deputy Police Chief Gary Holliday told the panel about more money needed to fund a successful program in behavioral-health-based judicial diversions. The Knoxville Early Diversion Program is a $398,000 grant-funded collaboration with Helen Ross McNabb Center. Those charged with misdemeanor public order crimes are evaluated for behavioral health issues, including substance abuse, and are given the option to receive treatment in exchange for diversion of the case and ultimate dismissal of charges, Holliday said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to keep folks out of jail,\u201d he said, and the program has yielded a cost savings of $110,000 over three years. But the grant money \u201cleft us quickly,\u201d largely because of the cost of providing health services to those in the program.\n\nThere were many numbers bandied about during Thursday\u2019s latest installment of the traveling 3-Star Healthy Project\u2014the legislative committee has also met in Johnson City, Nashville, and Memphis\u2014but one doctor who provided testimony said raw statistics should not cast a shadow over the real purpose of trying to close the health-care gap.\n\nDr. Eboni Winford, a Cherokee Health System psychologist, relayed the story of a man who finally received TennCare coverage two weeks before he died.\n\n\u201cWe really want to emphasize that we are talking about people,\u201d she told the panel.\n\nLater, out in the hallway, as people walked by and greeted her by name and she kept a smile affixed to her face, Louise McKowan gripped her walker and reflected how quickly everything, including one\u2019s health, can fall apart.\n\nShe remembers when she was diagnosed with OPCA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d just turned 40,\u201d said McKowan, now 66, of Oak Ridge. \u201cAnd they said life begins at 40. The whole world tumbled, and I moved back here to live with my parents.\u201d\n\nRep. Camper said after the meeting that failure to close the public insurance gap means \u201cwe\u2019ll lose some of our rural hospitals,\u201d and that common themes heard throughout the state include issues of \u201cco-morbidity\u201d\u2014when a person has multiple health problems at once\u2014worries from businesses about health-insurance costs and the need for better mental-health coverage.\n\nKnoxville\u2019s committee meeting, she said, \u201creally just continued stories we\u2019ve heard from the working poor.\u201d\n\nShe urged those in attendance to \u201cbe positive. We\u2019re not doing this just for show.\u201d\n\nSexton, the committee chairman, urged patience as the panel works on a solution: \u201cWe know how high the mountain is; we\u2019re willing to climb it, we just need a little time to get it right.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 5.2.4.1 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface.", "og": {"site_name": "The Knoxville Mercury", "description": "by Thomas Fraser Louise McKown and her flower-adorned walker moved slowly down the hall of the J.L.
