In it he targets Cruz as unprepared for the presidency and mocks the Texas senator for his reading of \"Green Eggs and Ham\" from the Senate floor.\n\nOn Tuesday, Santorum defended the ad and again went after Cruz.\n\nIn an interview with TheBlaze, Santorum noted that Cruz's reading of the book, part of a filibuster in an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, ultimately failed.\n\n\"It was a failure.
