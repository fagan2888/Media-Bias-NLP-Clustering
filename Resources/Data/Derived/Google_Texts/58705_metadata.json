Given Republican control of the state House, Senate and governor\u2019s office, the move surprised many. Two years earlier, referring to another ACA provision (the insurance exchange), Chuck Moss, then the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said GOP lawmakers would \u201crather be caught sacrificing to Satan than voting for Obamacare.\u201d\n\nLost in the hubbub surrounding the expansion bill was a section requiring hospitals that were contracted by the state to provide managed care services under Medicaid to offer \u201chealthy behavior\u201d incentives for new enrollees. The idea was to mimic the cost-saving incentives inherent in private Health Savings Account insurance plans, which use high deductibles and copays to encourage health care consumers to shop around and avoid paying excessive prices.\n\nBut the Obama administration had refused to permit states to impose any meaningful deductible or copay requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries, so Michigan policymakers sought other incentives. Since the state couldn\u2019t use a stick, it would try a carrot.\n\nRecent news reports have focused on one of these carrots, $50 Wal-Mart gift cards for Medicaid clients who, in essence, \u201cfollow the doctor\u2019s orders.\u201d\n\nStay Engaged\n\nWho Pays?\n\nThe law leaves the exact form of an incentive up to the discretion of the officials who negotiate the managed care contracts between the state and the hospitals that provide almost all Medicaid services in Michigan. While the state doesn\u2019t itself purchase or give out any Wal-Mart gift cards, their cost is baked into the Medicaid managed care contracts.\n\nJennifer Smith, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, explained that the hospitals must \u201cprovide a $50.00 gift card to \u2026 beneficiaries who earn less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, have met with a primary care provider, and have agreed to address or maintain healthy behaviors.\u201d She said, \u201cWe want to see the newly insured connecting with primary care providers and understanding how to use their benefits so they can take steps to improve their overall health and wellness.\u201d\n\nEnforcement and Nanny Statism\n\nState Sen. Patrick Colbeck (R-Canton) was perhaps the most vocal critic of Medicaid expansion in the state Senate. Colbeck said about the gift cards, \u201cThis really is an incentive to expand participation in the program.\u201d\n\nHe referred to the \u201cdouble loss\u201d this incentive incurs, one to the taxpayers who pay the bills and the other to the individuals who become dependent on a government welfare program. Colbeck is also concerned with the implications of the state involving itself so deeply in the personal affairs of private citizens.\n\nIn addition, he believes that what participants are really rewarded for is the information they give to the government rather than their medical lifestyle. He points to a provision of the expansion statute that requires clients to \u201cdemonstrate improved health outcomes or maintain healthy behaviors as identified in a health risk assessment. \u2026\u201d (emphasis added).\n\nIn other words, the state may not be incentivizing healthy behaviors as much as filling in the right answers on a form.\n\nLonger Term Impacts on Freedom and Finances\n\nThe bill authorizing the expansion extended medical welfare to two new populations: able-bodied childless adults under 100 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) and people between 100 and 138 percent of FPL. It also brought into the program many individuals who were already eligible for Medicaid but were not enrolled (the \u201cwoodwork effect.\u201d)\n\nInitially the federal government is paying for the expansion, but starting in 2020 Michigan taxpayers will be responsible for 10 percent of the cost. This was originally projected to be around $300 million annually, but could be much higher because enrollment has already far exceeded original estimates.\n\nThe Wal-Mart gift card incentives bring into focus three of the many concerns raised about the Obamacare Medicaid expansion: Increased dependency, deeper intrusions by the state into the deeply personal affairs of private citizens, and the potential for beneficiaries to \u201cgame\u201d the system in ways that undermine its intentions.\n\nSee Also: Mackinac Center Medicaid Expansion Coverage\n\n~~~~~\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRaising the Minimum Wage\n\nFriedman Legacy Day\n\nPlanning for Life Workshop \u2013 Suttons Bay, MI\n\nPlanning for Life Workshop \u2013 Grand Rapids, MI\n\nThe Boundaries of Educational Choice: Surveying Michigan's Private School Landscape\n\nTransparency Bills A \u201cSignificant Step Forward\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "An article on liberty and free markets as sound public policy for Michigan.", "title": "Michigan\u2019s Obamacare Medicaid Expansion", "url": "http://www.mackinac.org/21653", "image": "http://www.mackinac.org/media/images/2015/obamaexchange01.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 626369250725043}, "description": "An article on liberty and free markets as sound public policy for Michigan.", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.mackinac.org/media/images/2015/obamaexchange01.jpg", "description": "An article on liberty and free markets as sound public policy for Michigan.", "site": "@MackinacCenter", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Michigan\u2019s Obamacare Medicaid Expansion"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce23a\"", "article_summary": "See Also: Mackinac Center Medicaid Expansion Coverage~~~~~Related Articles:Raising the Minimum WageFriedman Legacy DayPlanning for Life Workshop \u2013 Suttons Bay, MIPlanning for Life Workshop \u2013 Grand Rapids, MIThe Boundaries of Educational Choice: Surveying Michigan's Private School LandscapeTransparency Bills A \u201cSignificant Step Forward\u201d\nIn 2013, the Michigan Legislature passed a bill expanding Medicaid, a core component of the federal Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.\nWhile the state doesn\u2019t itself purchase or give out any Wal-Mart gift cards, their cost is baked into the Medicaid managed care contracts.\nThe idea was to mimic the cost-saving incentives inherent in private Health Savings Account insurance plans, which use high deductibles and copays to encourage health care consumers to shop around and avoid paying excessive prices.\nBut the Obama administration had refused to permit states to impose any meaningful deductible or copay requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries, so Michigan policymakers sought other incentives."}
