At the Kaiserhof Restaurant and Wunderbar in Montgomery, Texas, you can get knackwurst served with sauerkraut, pan fried potatoes and German mustard for $11.95, the huhnerfrakasse (a creamed chicken dish with mushrooms, asparagus and rice) for $13.50, or the special of the day: the entire restaurant for $1.3 million.

Yes, Montgomery’s only true German restaurant is up for sale, in part because the owner wants to help one of his employees to get medical help she and her family can’t afford.
