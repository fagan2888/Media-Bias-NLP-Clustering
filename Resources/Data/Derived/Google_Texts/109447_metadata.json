After the meetings, this older and more experienced worker would charge into my office and continue his diatribe about whatever point he had disagreed with earlier.\n\nRelated: Why Men and Women Still Can't Get Along at Work\n\nA manager finally took me aside and urged me to stand up to the guy \u2013 though she herself wouldn\u2019t. This was my moment of truth. Was there a difference between being bullied at work \u2013 and intimidated? Was this person testing me as a young 24-year-old professional to see just how tough I was?\n\nIn the end, I learned how to stop the intimidation \u2013 a sign that this wasn\u2019t bullying, since I had the power to change the behavior. An executive coach helped me develop specific techniques to combat the guy\u2019s morale-damaging actions, which finally made him back off and helped me preserve both my job and my peace of mind.\n\nWhile none of that was easy, today people claim \u201cworkplace bullying\u201d at the drop of a hat \u2013 at a tremendous cost to business. Real bullying on the job, however, is a huge issue and something to take very seriously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in letting bullies know when they\u2019re bullying,\u201d says Jon Gordon, a workplace strategist and author of The Carpenter: A Story About the Greatest Success Strategies of All. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a co-worker or a boss, you can confront that person in a constructive way. When you\u2019re strong but positive, you create healthy boundaries that protect you.\u201d\n\nRelated: One Terrible Boss, 10 Great Workplace Tips\n\nWorkplace bullying is defined very specifically. The Workplace Bullying Institute says it is behavior that:\n\nIs driven by the perpetrator\u2019s need to control others.\n\nHas specific targets, timing, location, and methods.\n\nUndermines legitimate business interests.\n\nIncludes acts of commission or omission (in the latter case it includes withholding key resources so the victim can\u2019t do his job well).\n\nHas real consequences for those being bullied, including physical, psychological and emotional reactions.\n\nEscalates to involve others, who often end up siding with the bully either voluntarily or through coercion.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoughly a third of workers say they\u2019ve experienced bullying on the job, according to a 2014 Zogby poll by the Workplace Bullying Institute \u2013 but 56 percent of employers say they have no formal procedures in place for combating workplace bullies.\n\nThe issue is now so widely acknowledged that many state legislatures have introduced bills to push employers to take action against bullies \u2013 or face consequences. Fifteen states now have active bills against workplace bullying, The Boston Globe reported.\n\nRelated: Why Getting Ahead Means Getting a Career Coach\n\n\u201cIn 2005, Massachusetts became the sixth state to introduce the Healthy Workplace Bill, which allows a victim to sue a fellow employee, the employer, or both,\u201d says The Globe. \u201cIf the offending party is found liable, a court may mandate reinstatement, back pay, medical expenses, and compensation for pain and suffering, among other damages. The bill exempts employers if they can prove they acted promptly to correct any abusive behavior. The bill also attempts to distinguish between frivolous claims and legitimate abuse.\u201d\n\nActually suing a bully and a workplace can be an ordeal. What can employees do when they think they\u2019re being bullied at work? Experts say that while bullying takes many forms, there are specific steps employees can take to at least identify the problem. Michele Woodward, an executive coach in the D.C. area, offered these pointers:\n\nStep 1: Determine if you\u2019re really being bullied or \u201cif the other person is just a jerk. It\u2019s bullying when that person\u2019s behavior prevents you from fully doing your job, such as denying you information or support, or excluding you from key meetings, or when there is a threat of violence,\u201d says Woodward.\n\nStep 2: If it is bullying, do as much as you can to distance yourself from the bully, both physically and emotionally. \u201cRather than dwell on how the bully operates, focus on other aspects of your job. What you focus on grows bigger in your life.\u201d\n\nRelated: You\u2019ve Quit Your Job. Here\u2019s What to Do Next.\n\nStep 3: Understand you cannot change a bully. \u201cToo many people believe that the bully will eventually stop bullying them,\u201d says Woodward. \u201cSo they continue in a relationship with someone whose entire motivation is to dominate and belittle. This is not good for anyone\u2019s health. You can\u2019t change a bully, so don\u2019t try.\u201d\n\nStep 4: \u201cIf you ever feel physically threatened with violence, go to an HR executive immediately,\u201d says Woodward.\n\nStep 5: If you cannot distance yourself from the bully and you\u2019ve gone up the chain of command or to HR without luck, \u201cit\u2019s time to start looking for a new job, either internally in a different department, or outside the organization,\u201d says Woodward.\n\nThe bottom line is that workplace bullies \u201care stressors, and when stress goes unabated, it compromises your physical and mental health,\u201d says the Workplace Bullying Institute. Remember that if you are being bullied, you didn\u2019t cause it, you\u2019re not alone \u2013 and you don\u2019t have to take it.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Every time I opened my mouth to speak during staff meetings, this guy at work would cu", "title": "5 Smart Steps to Combat Workplace Bullying", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/22/5-Smart-Steps-Combat-Workplace-Bullying", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07172013_Workplace_Megaphone_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/22/5-Smart-Steps-Combat-Workplace-Bullying", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07172013_Workplace_Megaphone_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@maurmack"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Every time I opened my mouth to speak during staff meetings, this guy at work would cu", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1103\"", "article_summary": "The bottom line is that workplace bullies \u201care stressors, and when stress goes unabated, it compromises your physical and mental health,\u201d says the Workplace Bullying Institute.\nWhile none of that was easy, today people claim \u201cworkplace bullying\u201d at the drop of a hat \u2013 at a tremendous cost to business.\nFifteen states now have active bills against workplace bullying, The Boston Globe reported.\nThe Workplace Bullying Institute says it is behavior that:Is driven by the perpetrator\u2019s need to control others.\nRoughly a third of workers say they\u2019ve experienced bullying on the job, according to a 2014 Zogby poll by the Workplace Bullying Institute \u2013 but 56 percent of employers say they have no formal procedures in place for combating workplace bullies."}
