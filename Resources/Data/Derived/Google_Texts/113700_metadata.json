But he had tried to play.\n\nFaried tested the ankle during pre-game warmups in order to make a final determination. The pain persisted and he chose to sit.\n\nFaried is listed as day-to-day, with his next chance to play on Tuesday against the L.A. Clippers.\n\nThe night off also gave Faried a chance to rest a nagging sore lower back.\n\nHe has been dealing with myriad ailments all season.\n\nLittle surprise. Nuggets coach Michael Malone, a former assistant for Golden State, got to witness Stephen Curry\u2019s brilliance up close.\n\nAs well as the Warriors played when he was there and as much as they improved in the couple of seasons after he left, he still marvels at what Curry and the NBA champions have been doing.\n\n\u201cHaving the privilege of coaching Steph and a few other guys for two years while I was there, to see his development, I\u2019d be lying if I said I saw this happening. Did not see it,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHere\u2019s a 6-foot-2, 180-pound non-athlete who\u2019s dominating. All the credit goes to him, for how hard he works. He\u2019s fun to watch. No lead is ever safe \u2014 we saw that against the Clippers the other night. They share the ball. They defend. They have toughness. They have a grit to them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kenneth Faried misses Nuggets game with ankle injury, sore back", "title": "Kenneth Faried misses Nuggets game with ankle injury, sore back", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/22/kenneth-faried-misses-nuggets-game-with-ankle-injury-sore-back/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151118__bkn-fariedp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151118__bkn-fariedp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-22T22:42:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T04:55:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2eca\"", "article_summary": "The Nuggets power forward missed Sunday night\u2019s game against Golden State due to a sprained left ankle.\nNuggets coach Michael Malone, a former assistant for Golden State, got to witness Stephen Curry\u2019s brilliance up close.\nThe night off also gave Faried a chance to rest a nagging sore lower back.\nFaried tested the ankle during pre-game warmups in order to make a final determination.\nThe injuries finally piled up to a point where even Kenneth Faried could no longer play."}
