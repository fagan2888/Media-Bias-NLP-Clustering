Last year, he was thrown out of Studio 54 for reportedly spitting on people and acting erratic. (Video via Paramount Pictures / \"Transformers: Dark of the Moon.\")\n\n\"He just walked up to the bar inside of Cabaret and grabbed this strawberry and fed it to some woman off of her plate, then tipped the bartender and ran out,\" a witness told TMZ.\n\nSince then, we've seen reports of \"Shia's downward spiral\" pop up constantly and yet, his strange antics haven't really seemed to hurt his professional career.\n\nHe's shot two movies just this year, and in 2014, he starred in two of the most talked-about music videos of the year.\n\nSo how has LaBeouf dodged the \"child actor curse?\" Well, he seems to have embraced his flaws.\n\nFrom wearing a paper bag over his head at a film festival to becoming an impressive meme telling us to \"just do it,\" LaBeouf seems to always be able to flip the weird into the viral and then just move on.\n\nAs for his latest arrest, police say they aren't releasing any more details.\n\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shia Labeouf's interesting antics don't seem to negatively impact his career.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Shia LaBeouf's interesting antics don't seem to negatively impact his career.", "title": "Shia LaBeouf's Antics Aren't Slowing Down His Career", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/shia-labeouf-s-antics-aren-t-slowing-down-his-career/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1444593597.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Shia LaBeouf's interesting antics don't seem to negatively impact his career.", "title": "Shia LaBeouf's Antics Aren't Slowing Down His Career", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/shia-labeouf-s-antics-aren-t-slowing-down-his-career/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1444593597.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=o2ZTE1eDpyyARZrFjBK2Um42ikmgBsYp&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://51940", "iphone": "newsy://51940", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://51940", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "shia labeouf,shia labeouf arrested,shia labeouf texas,shia labeouf studio 54,shia labeouf downward spiral,shia labeouf antics,shia labeouf movies,shia labeouf memes,newsy,newsy entertainment", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1444593597.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f9d\"", "article_summary": "Actor Shia LaBeouf has been arrested... again.\nA witness told TMZ, LaBeouf jaywalked in front of the police, and was clearly drunk or high when doing it.\nShia LaBeouf's interesting antics don't seem to negatively impact his career.\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.\nSince then, we've seen reports of \"Shia's downward spiral\" pop up constantly and yet, his strange antics haven't really seemed to hurt his professional career."}
