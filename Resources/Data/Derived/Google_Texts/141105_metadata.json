The company had just finished a special Veteran\u2019s Week campaign, donating $5-$10 to veteran and active duty charities for every pair of shorts sold, as well as telling the stories of Service members deployed abroad. \u201cThe main point of us celebrating Veteran\u2019s Week (in lieu of Veteran\u2019s Day) was to dedicate an entire week to honoring & giving back to our country\u2019s heroes \u2013 like Travis Mills and the men of the 9th Infantry Regiment \u2013 who are the reason we get out of bed and come to work every morning,\u201d said co-founder Kyle Hency. \u201cTo have President George W.
