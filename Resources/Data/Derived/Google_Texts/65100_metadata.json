They will be installed right here we\u2019ll have students working on these projects directly with the scientific community.\u201d\n\nThe Global Earthquake Forecasting System is a new international network under development by several partners in research, industry and education, including NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center, San Jose State University, Italy\u2019s Polytechnic di Milani, Switzerland\u2019s International Centre for Earth Simulation, India\u2019s Variable Energy Cyclotron Center, Turkey\u2019s Middle East Technical University, Quebec\u2019s Ministry of Natural Resources, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Silicon Valley\u2019s GeoCosmo Science Center, New Jersey\u2019s Trillium Learning and several Alaskan school districts - including Kodiak.\n\nRon Fortunato, director of Trillium Education, which is heading up the educational outreach for the project as part of his American Bridge program, explained how the system works.\n\nEvery time there is an earthquake, tectonic plates underground crush against each other. Some of those tectonic zones occur just south of Kodiak Island.\n\n\u201cWhen they push hard on each other, they actually create stresses that change the chemistry of some of the particles down there and create charged ions that form currents of electricity and different compounds,\u201d Fortunato said.\n\nThe chemicals rise to the earth\u2019s surface and, scientists postulate, observing the chemical reactions may significantly improve the predictive abilities of scientists.\n\nFortunato maintains that earthquake predictions could now be stretched to days before a quake instead of the current seconds.\n\nKodiak is the very first school district to participate in the program. The first two sensors in the country will be in Kodiak, with the data read by Kodiak High students.\n\n\u201cWhen these sensors get set up the students will be looking at the real-time data that\u2019s coming out of the earth and the same data that\u2019s being analyzed by NASA the students are going to be able to look at and actually be part of that process,\u201d he added.\n\nThis is significant for Kodiak because of its history with earthquakes, including the 9.2-magnitude Good Friday Quake of 1964, Experts have predicted that a smaller but more localized temblor could originate from near Kodiak and could wreak havoc on Kodiak City and adjacent parts of the Island.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing about it is as I work these projects and try and do the educational outreach part, the Kodiak Island Borough there was so far ahead in thinking about how it wanted students to be involved with that kind of research and science and technology,\u201d he added.\n\nFor McDonald, earthquake detection is part of the science, technology, engineering, and math curriculum that educators believe is so vital to student real-world preparedness.\n\nMcDonald reports that Kodiak schools add another component to STEM - the arts - changing the acronym to \u201cSTEAM.\u201d He added that this artistic component gels very nicely with the work that students will be doing on the earthquake prediction system.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it if you don\u2019t have kids who are well-versed in creative insight, it\u2019s tough for them to translate into the abstractions of science, technology, engineering and mathematics,\u201d McDonald said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Kodiak (Alaska) Daily Mirror, http://www.kodiakdailymirror.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A global initiative led by NASA to develop ways to better predict earthquakes will soon get legs in Kodiak.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/13/kodiak-high-works-with-nasa-on-temblor-project/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A global initiative led by NASA to develop ways to better predict earthquakes will soon get legs in Kodiak.", "title": "Kodiak High works with NASA on temblor project"}, "twitter": {"description": "A global initiative led by NASA to develop ways to better predict earthquakes will soon get legs in Kodiak.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Kodiak High works with NASA on temblor project"}, "Author": "PETER J MLADINEO", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd5ad\"", "article_summary": "The first two sensors in the country will be in Kodiak, with the data read by Kodiak High students.\nAnd some of its data crunchers will be Kodiak High School students.\nKODIAK, Alaska (AP) - A global initiative led by NASA to develop ways to better predict earthquakes will soon get legs in Kodiak.\n\u201cWe will have some NASA interns coming here this fall,\u201d Kodiak Island Borough School District Stewart McDonald told the Mirror.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be installing the earthquake sensors that talk to the satellites."}
