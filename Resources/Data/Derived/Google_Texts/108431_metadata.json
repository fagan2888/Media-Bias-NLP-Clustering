Wade.\n\nThe change was prompted by a study by the National Women\u2019s Law Center that cited illegal age discrimination in infertility coverage in Connecticut. The state had been operating under a state law, which preceded the ACA, that capped infertility coverage at age 40. The ACA supersedes state law, said Karen Davenport, the law center\u2019s director of health policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new mandate requires the coverage when medically necessary and includes women and men. More infertility procedures are available for women, Davenport said.\n\nCompanies will be permitted to impose a co-pay up to 50 percent, a deductible, or co-insurance, if they are consistent with terms and conditions of other benefits in a policy, but they can\u2019t vary by age, said Donna M. Tommelleo, insurance department spokesperson.\n\nThe ACA prohibits such cost sharing for a variety of women\u2019s preventive health services, such as birth control, mammograms, and pap smears, but infertility isn\u2019t one of them, Davenport said.\n\nMeanwhile, she said the law center still finds fault with coverage for breast-feeding services in Connecticut. She said there are ambiguities in federal rules governing the coverage and the law center is lobbying for changes on the federal level to clear them up. Until and if that happens, \u201cthat is something that we end up disagreeing on with the state,\u201d she said.\n\nThe state requires coverage for breast-feeding counseling and education for an undefined postpartum period, while the law center maintains that it should be covered for the entire time a woman is breast-feeding.\n\nThe law center is also pressing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to immediately issue regulations to implement the ACA\u2019s \u201cbroad prohibition against discrimination in health care,\u201d said Marcia Greenberger, co-president.\n\n\u201cWe still have more work to do,\u201d Greenberger said, calling the discrimination prohibition \u201ca critical provision\u201d of the law.\n\nThe state Insurance Department consulted with the law center and insurers before changing the infertility mandate, Wade said.\n\nGreenberger called Connecticut\u2019s action an \u201cimportant step forward towards eradicating discrimination in our health care system.\u201d She added, \u201cConnecticut has made a major part of the law\u2019s protections work for women and their families.\u201d\n\nSusan Lloyd Yolen, vice president of public policy and planning for Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, said, \u201cThere are an increasing number of women who choose parenthood later in their reproductive lives, only to experience infertility.\u201d She said it helps fulfill the promise of the ACA to provide women \u201cwith the tools to plan their families as they see fit.\u201d\n\nThis story was reported under a partnership with the Connecticut Health I-Team (www.c-hit.org).", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health, Health news, New Haven Health news, CT Health news, US Health news, world Health news.", "title": "Connecticut lifts age limit on infertility coverage", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20150925/NEWS/150929674", "image": {"width": "1170px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150925/NEWS/150929674/AR/0/AR-150929674.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "120px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Connecticut lifts age limit on infertility coverage"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "For the first time, all Connecticut health insurance companies will be required as of Jan. 1 to cover infertility treatment for people age 40 and older.", "title": "Connecticut lifts age limit on infertility coverage", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20150925/NEWS/150929674", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150925/NEWS/150929674/AR/0/AR-150929674.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "Health, Health news, New Haven Health news, CT Health news, US Health news, world Health news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "For the first time, all Connecticut health insurance companies will be required as of Jan. 1 to cover infertility treatment for people age 40 and older."}, "article_summary": "The state had been operating under a state law, which preceded the ACA, that capped infertility coverage at age 40.\nThe change was prompted by a study by the National Women\u2019s Law Center that cited illegal age discrimination in infertility coverage in Connecticut.\nFor the first time, all Connecticut health insurance companies will be required as of Jan. 1 to cover infertility treatment for people age 40 and older.\nThe state Insurance Department consulted with the law center and insurers before changing the infertility mandate, Wade said.\nMeanwhile, she said the law center still finds fault with coverage for breast-feeding services in Connecticut."}
