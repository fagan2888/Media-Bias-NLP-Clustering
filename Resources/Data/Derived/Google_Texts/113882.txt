Police are looking for two men who held up a Colorado Springs business Friday evening.

The robbery was reported at 5:18 p.m. at a shopping center on the 2900 block of Galley Road. The police department did not have the name of the business immediately available, but tell 11 News it was an income tax business.

The men ordered the employees to hand over cash, then ran away after their demand was met. One of the men carried a handgun, but never used it.

The suspects are described as either black or Hispanic men in their 20s, both 6 feet tall with medium builds, and both wearing dark clothing and bandanas.

If you have any information, call CSPD at 444-7000 or Crime Stoppers at 634-STOP.
