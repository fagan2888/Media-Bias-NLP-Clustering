Still, \"The driver is the master of his vehicle....He is the best judge of what is appropriate.\" And after all, \"Any object, be it a book, a toy or electronic device can be a potential danger when a young child drops it and gets up to go get it while the bus is in motion.\" Therefore, such personal effects should be kept in closed bags.
