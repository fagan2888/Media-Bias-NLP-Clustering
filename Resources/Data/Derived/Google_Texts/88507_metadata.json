Lately, that has included a quest to pin down cost surges in Denver International Airport\u2019s huge Hotel and Transit Center project and an audit questioning the effectiveness of programs to end homelessness.\n\nNevitt, 53, and O\u2019Brien, 65, say they would continue that independent streak, if in different ways.\n\n\u201cThe auditor is an independent position for a reason \u2014 to be the advocate for the people of Denver,\u201d Nevitt said. \u201cDennis and I don\u2019t agree on everything, but I think that he\u2019s right in that if the auditor sees the city\u2019s money moving in a direction that\u2019s not in its best interest, then he needs to stand up and say that\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien, who hasn\u2019t held elected office, said he wouldn\u2019t shirk from using the bully pulpit but would focus on sober oversight.\n\nHe served as state auditor for 11 years, through 1995. He now is a self-employed, certified public accountant and board chairman for a family of mutual funds. He sits on the city\u2019s Audit Committee, which receives and reviews reports from Gallagher\u2019s office.\n\nO\u2019Brien wants to expand the office\u2019s mission from performance auditing to also issuing financial audits zeroing in on taxes and areas of city spending. Currently, external auditors review city finances, but O\u2019Brien says they take a wide view without digging in deep.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any (CPAs in the office), which means that the current auditor isn\u2019t doing any financial audits. I think that\u2019s a mistake,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cPeople in Denver are concerned about oversight of their hard-earned money and we\u2019re not getting that.\u201d\n\nNevitt disputes that, noting that many of Gallagher\u2019s audits have had financial components.\n\nThe two-term councilman represents south Denver\u2019s District 7. Before winning his seat, Nevitt ran FRESC, or Front Range Economic Strategy Center. He helped found the labor think tank and community organizing group.\n\nIn his view, the city needs an auditor who is a savvy and experienced public leader.\n\nUnder Gallagher, Denver voters in 2006 approved changes that gave the office strong performance auditing power. He has shaped that influence.\n\nThe outgoing auditor is backing Nevitt \u2014 as is Mayor Michael Hancock and plenty of Denver\u2019s political establishment. Through Thursday, Nevitt raised nearly $294,000 in contributions, versus about $41,000 for O\u2019Brien. O\u2019Brien also has lent another $40,000 to his campaign.\n\nO\u2019Brien has questioned whether Nevitt can maintain independence.\n\nHe also suggests that Nevitt serving as auditor \u2014 after making policy on council for so long \u2014 would create a conflict of interest, putting him \u201cin the position of grading his own homework.\u201d\n\nNevitt calls that line of thinking \u201cthe weirdest argument of all.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing I\u2019ve done on the City Council is making me money,\u201d he said, \u201cand being auditor wouldn\u2019t be me burnishing my own reputation.\u201d\n\nBut Nevitt\u2019s ambitions have attracted plenty of speculation. Though the auditor\u2019s job may seem dry politically, it has a storied past, sometimes launching occupants to higher office.\n\n\u201cBill McNichols was auditor and he went on to become mayor, and Wellington Webb was the auditor and he went on to become mayor as well,\u201d Denver political analyst Eric Sondermann said. \u201cFor someone with ambitions, it\u2019s a job that can lead to greater things.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Race for Denver auditor crackles with sharp disagreements", "title": "Race for Denver auditor crackles with sharp disagreements", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/01/race-for-denver-auditor-crackles-with-sharp-disagreements/", "image": {"width": 523, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150501__20150502_A12_CDXXPELXAUDITORp2.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150501__20150502_A12_CDXXPELXAUDITORp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-01T11:54:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T01:20:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Election 2014"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe auditor is an independent position for a reason \u2014 to be the advocate for the people of Denver,\u201d Nevitt said.\nThe Denver city auditor\u2019s race boils down to a contest between a well-funded councilman with name recognition and an accountant with years of auditing oversight \u2014 but perhaps an outsider\u2019s chance of winning.\nCouncilman Chris Nevitt and former appointed state auditor Timothy O\u2019Brien are competing in Tuesday\u2019s election to succeed three-term auditor Dennis Gallagher.\n\u201cBill McNichols was auditor and he went on to become mayor, and Wellington Webb was the auditor and he went on to become mayor as well,\u201d Denver political analyst Eric Sondermann said.\nThe term-limited Denver political icon has marshaled his professional auditors to deliver fiery summations of waste or ineffectiveness in a wide range of investigations into local government."}
