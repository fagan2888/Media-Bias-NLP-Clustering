By choosing Lynch, Obama is bypassing a pair of candidates with more senior roles in his administration in favor of a prosecutor who could, potentially, be more easily confirmed by a Senate that Republicans will soon control.\n\n\"Ms. Lynch is a strong, independent prosecutor who has twice led one of the most important U.S. attorney\u2019s offices in the country,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement. Obama will announce her nomination in a Roosevelt Room ceremony on Saturday.\n\nBy choosing Lynch, President Obama is bypassing a pair of candidates with more senior roles in his administration.\n\nLynch is the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, which covers Brooklyn along with Queens, Staten Island, and parts of Long Island. She has served twice in that post\u2014initially during the end of the Clinton administration\u2014and was confirmed unanimously by the Senate both times. But a promotion from federal prosecutor to leading the entire Justice Department would be a big bureaucratic leap, one that according to The New York Times has not occurred in nearly 200 years.\n\nLatino lawmakers and advocates have pushed hard for Obama to nominate his Labor Secretary, Thomas Perez, who had previously led the Justice Department's civil rights division. But most Republicans opposed his nomination to the Labor Department, and his elevation to attorney general would likely have provoked another contentious confirmation fight. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, already smarting over the president's decision to delay executive action on immigration, formally endorsed Perez for attorney general last week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama will nominate Loretta Lynch, a U.S. attorney in New York, to replace Eric Holder at the Justice Department.", "author": "Russell Berman", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "President Obama will nominate Loretta Lynch, a U.S. attorney in New York, to replace Eric Holder at the Justice Department.", "title": "The Attorney General From Brooklyn", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/11/AP255446056058/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/Loretta-Lynch-Eric-Holder-Attorney-General/382507/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce124\"", "article_summary": "Updated 6:40 p.m.President Obama has settled on the chief federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, Loretta Lynch, as the nation's next attorney general.\nBy choosing Lynch, President Obama is bypassing a pair of candidates with more senior roles in his administration.\nThe White House said late Friday that Lynch was the president's pick to replace the departing Eric Holder, confirming a selection that CNN first reported earlier in the day.\nLynch is the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, which covers Brooklyn along with Queens, Staten Island, and parts of Long Island.\nThe Congressional Hispanic Caucus, already smarting over the president's decision to delay executive action on immigration, formally endorsed Perez for attorney general last week."}
