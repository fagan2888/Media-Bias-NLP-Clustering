You\u2019ve got the only quote you\u2019re going to get.\u201d\n\nThe White House declined to say who was at the meeting.\n\nHere\u2019s the full Treasury letter:\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nFeatured image Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Despite all the support, money, and tireless campaigning, it looks like organized labor will have to endure President Barack Obama\u2019s major health care overhaul like the rest of us.
