It intensified in 2009, after Swiss banking giant UBS AG admitted that it encouraged U.S. taxpayers to hide money abroad.\n\nSince then, the U.S. has collected more than $13.5 billion from individuals and financial firms in taxes and penalties due on such accounts.\n\nThis week, Swiss bank Julius Baer Group AG agreed to a $547 million settlement after it admitted it encouraged U.S. taxpayers to hide money abroad.\n\nThe tax collections have become a major burden for the estimated 7 million or more Americans living abroad, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nUnlike many other countries, the U.S. taxes nonresident citizens on income they earn abroad and U.S. laws provide only partial offsets for double taxations when taxes are owed to both the U.S. and a foreign country.\n\nThe penalties for noncompliance have also increased dramatically \u2014 in some cases from as little as $2,000 to $70,000 annually since 1995.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A record 4,279 people renounced their U.S. citizenship or long-term residency in 2015, according to new data released by the Treasury Department.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A record 4,279 people renounced their U.S. citizenship or long-term residency in 2015, according to new data released by the Treasury Department.", "title": "Record number of non-resident Americans, green-card holders renounced U.S. citizenship in 2015", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/6/record-number-non-resident-americans-green-card-ho/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2009/03/14/20090313-222046-pic-273696598.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2009/03/14/20090313-222046-pic-273696598.jpg", "description": "A record 4,279 people renounced their U.S. citizenship or long-term residency in 2015, according to new data released by the Treasury Department.", "card": "summary", "title": "Record number of non-resident Americans, green-card holders renounced"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance"}, "article_summary": "A record 4,279 people renounced their U.S. citizenship or long-term residency in 2015, according to new data released by the Treasury Department.\nThe tax collections have become a major burden for the estimated 7 million or more Americans living abroad, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nExperts say the growing number of renunciations is related to an enforcement campaign by U.S. officials against undeclared offshore accounts.\nIt intensified in 2009, after Swiss banking giant UBS AG admitted that it encouraged U.S. taxpayers to hide money abroad.\nThe penalties for noncompliance have also increased dramatically \u2014 in some cases from as little as $2,000 to $70,000 annually since 1995."}
