The initiative will be led by the Center for Care Innovations, a California nonprofit that designs programs that transform the health care safety net, the foundation said in a news release.\n\nParticipants in the initiative will receive training on patient-centered design techniques, an approach to care that solves problems while keeping the patient\u2019s needs foremost in mind. It will focus on three areas: improving access to care, increasing patient engagement and addressing social factors in health.\n\n\u201cAcross the country, the rate of funding for health care innovation is growing rapidly,\u201d Barbara Kang, senior health care program officer for the foundation, said in a statement. \u201cHowever, funding for projects to improve care for vulnerable populations has been underrepresented in this upsurge. This initiative will help address this imbalance by injecting energy, renewed excitement and funding to stimulate a culture of health care innovation in New Jersey.\u201d\n\nThe nine groups chosen for the initiative after what the foundation called a \u201crobust application process\u201d include:\n\nCompleteCare Health Network;\n\nHenry J. Austin Health Center;\n\nHospital Alliance of New Jersey;\n\nNew Jersey Primary Care Association;\n\nNewark Beth Israel Medical Center;\n\nRobert Wood Johnson University Hospital;\n\nSt. Joseph\u2019s Regional Medical Center;\n\nTrinitas Regional Medical Center;\n\nVisiting Nurse Association Health Group Inc.\n\nThe nine teams involved submitted challenges for which they hope to develop innovative solutions, such as vegetable prescription programs, group care sessions and the use of EMTs and paramedics in continuous contact with high-risk patients.\n\n\u201cIf we want to improve outcomes and reduce costs, organizations that care for vulnerable populations must be given the tools to take risks, think differently and be innovative as they seek to improve care delivery,\u201d Joan Randell, chief operating officer of the foundation, said in a prepared statement.\n\nMeanwhile, 18 health centers around the state received a combined $1.021 million in Affordable Care Act grant funding for providing high-quality care to vulnerable populations. They will be able to use the funds to grow their quality improvement systems and infrastructure, as well as improve primary care service delivery, the government said Tuesday in a news release.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s funding rewards those health centers that are achieving the highest levels of clinical quality performance and improvement,\u201d Jim Macrae, Health Resources and Services Administration acting administrator, said in a prepared statement. \u201cThe awards will help health centers continue to provide comprehensive primary care to the nation\u2019s most vulnerable communities.\u201d\n\nThe 18 include:\n\nAtlantiCare Health Services Inc., $24,832;\n\nCAMcare Health Corporation, $77,380;\n\nCommunity Health Care Inc., $53,546;\n\nHorizon Health Center Inc., $72,066;\n\nJewish Renaissance Medical Center, $16,591;\n\nLakewood Resource and Referral Center Inc., $127,999;\n\nMetropolitan Family Health Network Inc., $15,652;\n\nMonmouth Family Health Center, $14,888;\n\nNewark Community Health Centers Inc., $103,357;\n\nCity of Newark, $20,584;\n\nNorth Hudson Community Action Corporation, $174,469;\n\nOcean Health Initiatives Inc., $38,383;\n\nPaterson Community Health Center Inc., $42,445;\n\nProject Hope, $20,409;\n\nRutgers University, $36,698;\n\nSouthern Jersey Family Medical Centers Inc., $79,016;\n\nVisiting Nurse Association of Central Jersey Community Health Center, $20,672;\n\nZufall Health Center Inc., $82,919.\n\nNationwide, more than 1,150 health centers received more than $63.3 million in funding.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "A number of health care organizations in New Jersey are receiving an influx of cash, as two initiatives pump more than $2 million into the state to bolster treatment of so-called \u201cvulnerable", "title": "N.J. health care organizations get $2M in funding through two programs | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20150826/NJBIZ01/150829841/nj-health-care-organizations-get-2m-in-funding-through-two-programs", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20150826/NJBIZ01/150829841/AR/0/AR-150829841.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "A number of health care organizations in New Jersey are receiving an influx of cash, as two initiatives pump more than $2 million into the state to bolster treatment of so-called \u201cvulnerable", "title": "N.J. health care organizations get $2M in funding through two programs | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20150826/NJBIZ01/150829841/AR/0/AR-150829841.jpg"}, "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "A number of health care organizations in New Jersey are receiving an influx of cash, as two initiatives pump more than $2 million into the state to bolster treatment of so-called \u201cvulnerable\u201d populations.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAcross the country, the rate of funding for health care innovation is growing rapidly,\u201d Barbara Kang, senior health care program officer for the foundation, said in a statement.\nFirst, The Nicholson Foundation announced Tuesday that it is working with nine organizations on a nearly $1 million initiative aimed at bolstering health care innovation.\n\u201cThe awards will help health centers continue to provide comprehensive primary care to the nation\u2019s most vulnerable communities.\u201dThe 18 include:AtlantiCare Health Services Inc., $24,832;CAMcare Health Corporation, $77,380;Community Health Care Inc., $53,546;Horizon Health Center Inc., $72,066;Jewish Renaissance Medical Center, $16,591;Lakewood Resource and Referral Center Inc., $127,999;Metropolitan Family Health Network Inc., $15,652;Monmouth Family Health Center, $14,888;Newark Community Health Centers Inc., $103,357;City of Newark, $20,584;North Hudson Community Action Corporation, $174,469;Ocean Health Initiatives Inc., $38,383;Paterson Community Health Center Inc., $42,445;Project Hope, $20,409;Rutgers University, $36,698;Southern Jersey Family Medical Centers Inc., $79,016;Visiting Nurse Association of Central Jersey Community Health Center, $20,672;Zufall Health Center Inc., $82,919.\nMeanwhile, 18 health centers around the state received a combined $1.021 million in Affordable Care Act grant funding for providing high-quality care to vulnerable populations.\nThe initiative will be led by the Center for Care Innovations, a California nonprofit that designs programs that transform the health care safety net, the foundation said in a news release."}
