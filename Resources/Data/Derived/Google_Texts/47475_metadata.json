Members of the anti-vaccination movement, not so affectionately known as anti-vaxxers, heard Kimmel\u2019s pro-vaccination message loud and clear, so they decided to voice their own opinions via Twitter.\n\nSpoiler alert: Their reactions are not what you would call sensible.\n\n\u201cLast week on the show, we got a group of real doctors together to do a public service announcement urging parents to vaccinate their kids,\u201d the video description reads. \u201cWhile a lot of people enjoyed it, it also made a small group of people unbelievably angry. Jimmy believes strongly in vaccination, but in the interest of fairness, we gave our community activist team Jack and Becky some air time to express their anti-vaccination views.\u201d\n\nDespite a common belief held by anti-vaxxers that corporations are deliberately trying to poison their children and that pharmaceutical companies knowingly distribute vaccinations that can lead to autism development simply for financial gain, the safety and efficiency of vaccinations have been proven time and again. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that vaccines will prevent over 21 million hospitalizations and 732,000 deaths among children born in the past 20 years.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "jimmy, kimmel, reads, mean, tweets, anti, vaxxers, and, they, are, not, happy, his, pro", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel read some of the Tweets he received from anti-vaxxers following his pro-vaccination message, and the responses did not disappoint.", "title": "Anti-Vaxxers Are Not Happy With Jimmy Kimmel's Pro-Vaccination Stance [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/jimmy-kimmel-reads-mean-tweets-anti-vaxxers-and-they-are-not-happy-his-pro-324208", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/03/03/jimmy-kimmel-reads-mean-tweets-anti-vaxxers-and-they-are-not-happy-his-pro.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jimmy Kimmel read some of the Tweets he received from anti-vaxxers following his pro-vaccination message, and the responses did not disappoint.", "title": "Anti-Vaxxers Are Not Happy With Jimmy Kimmel's Pro-Vaccination Stance [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/jimmy-kimmel-reads-mean-tweets-anti-vaxxers-and-they-are-not-happy-his-pro-324208", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/03/03/jimmy-kimmel-reads-mean-tweets-anti-vaxxers-and-they-are-not-happy-his-pro.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/03/jimmy-kimmel-reads-mean-tweets-anti-vaxxers-and-they-are-not-happy-his-pro.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-03-03T13:52:49-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-03T13:52:48-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel read some of the Tweets he received from anti-vaxxers following his pro-vaccination message, and the responses did not disappoint."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd1f5\"", "article_summary": "Last week, TV host Jimmy Kimmel took a little time to share his opinion on childhood vaccination, which happens to be an opinion he shares with a majority of the health care community.\nMembers of the anti-vaccination movement, not so affectionately known as anti-vaxxers, heard Kimmel\u2019s pro-vaccination message loud and clear, so they decided to voice their own opinions via Twitter.\n\u201cWhile a lot of people enjoyed it, it also made a small group of people unbelievably angry.\n\u201cLast week on the show, we got a group of real doctors together to do a public service announcement urging parents to vaccinate their kids,\u201d the video description reads.\nIn fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that vaccines will prevent over 21 million hospitalizations and 732,000 deaths among children born in the past 20 years."}
