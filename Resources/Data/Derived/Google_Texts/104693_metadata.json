Donnelly filed the request just one day after Gov. Jerry Brown signed SB277 into law.\n\nDonnelly, a tea party conservative who hosts an Inland Empire talk radio show on KIXW-AM, posted his displeasure with the new law on Facebook Tuesday.\n\n\u201cGov. Jerry Brown signed away a parent\u2019s right to choose what\u2019s best for their child,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is a victory for leftists bent on absolute control. No more choice, no informed consent, only compliance or else!\u201d\n\nBackers of the law\u2019s repeal now have 90 days from its enactment Tuesday to gather 365,880 signatures, the number needed to qualify the referendum for the Nov. 1, 2016, ballot. Provided enough signatures are verified, the law would then be put on hold until after the election.\n\nThat would mean parents could at least temporarily slide by the July 1, 2016, implementation of the law, when any child entering preschool, kindergarten or seventh grade, or any student changing schools, is required to have the proper vaccinations if they have not already obtained a personal belief exemption by Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cEven if they don\u2019t have a chance of passing this, just getting it on the ballot box has a chance to throw a wrench in things,\u201d says KQED politics and government reporter Marisa Lagos.\n\nLagos said the success of the signature drive will depend \u2014 what else? \u2014 on money.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether they will have funding to send signature-gatherers out to do this work, enough boots on the ground to collect signatures,\u201d she said.\n\nChristina Hildebrand, founder of A Voice for Choice, a nonprofit group that worked against the vaccine bill, told KQED\u2019s April Dembosky that collecting the required signatures was doable.\n\n\u201cWe need 5 percent of what was cast in the governor\u2019s election, which was a very low turnout vote, so I do believe we can get that,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the Jim Carrey factor to consider.\n\nState Sen. Richard Pan, a co-author of the law, responded to the referendum filing in a statement. \u201cCalifornians overwhelmingly support requiring vaccinations for school,\u201d Pan said. \u201cOur bill was a reasonable, science-based approach to protecting children, and the most vulnerable among us, from dangerous diseases. Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools we have to prevent deadly communicable diseases.\u201d\n\nPan said he would fight \u201cany referendum that hurts Californians.\u201d\n\nA May poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 67 percent of Californians and 65 percent of public school parents think children should not be allowed to attend public school without getting vaccinated. Large majorities also said that childhood vaccines are generally safe.\n\nIf a referendum fails, opponents of the law could turn to the courts.\n\n\u201cThe California state constitution guarantees a free and public education for every child,\u201d said Hildebrand. Lawyers have been lining up to help with a lawsuit, she said. \u201cThey keep coming out of the woodwork.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Backers of the repeal have 90 days from law's enactment to gather 365,880 signatures.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Not Over Yet: Tim Donnelly Files for Referendum to Overturn California's New Vaccine Law\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/07\\/02\\/california-vaccine-debate-not-quite-over-tim-donnelly-files-referendum-to-overturn-new-law\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-02 12:20:36\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-07-02 15:55:38\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":43117,\"author_id\":\"80\",\"author_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"author_display_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"tags\":[\"SB277\",\"Vaccines\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/07\\/Donnelly-e1435864931546.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Backers of the repeal have 90 days from law's enactment to gather 365,880 signatures.", "title": "Not Over Yet: Tim Donnelly Files for Referendum to Overturn California\u2019s New Vaccine Law", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/07/02/california-vaccine-debate-not-quite-over-tim-donnelly-files-referendum-to-overturn-new-law/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/07/Donnelly-1440x964.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "sb277,vaccines", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1efa\"", "article_summary": "Former California Assemblyman and ex-gubernatorial candidate Tim Donnelly Wednesday filed paperwork with the Office of the Attorney General for a referendum that would overturn California\u2019s brand-new law ending personal belief exemptions for vaccines.\nState Sen.
