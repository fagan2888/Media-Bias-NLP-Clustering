Alan Williams embraces his failing grade from Americans for Prosperity. Williams earned an F grade for his votes on 59 issues AFP tracked during the 2016 Florida legislative session. It\u2019s the exclamation point on his eight-year legislative career. He said the things for which AFP advocates don\u2019t resonate with the people he represents.\n\n\u201cWe want pay raises for state employees and we want more funding for education. Whenever I vote for those types of items then I\u2019m going to get an F from Americans for Prosperity,\u201d said Williams. \u201cThey may have a great name, but when you look at what they stand for I am certain members of our community would give them an F if they even bothered to grade them.\u201d\n\nAmericans for Prosperity is a political advocacy group funded by the Koch family. It has organized opposition to Obamacare, environmental regulations, and labor unions. It supports right-to-work laws and is credited with helping the GOP win the House of Representatives in 2010 and the Senate in 2014.\n\nOn Tuesday, the group awarded 36 Florida lawmakers an A+ for their performance in 2016. Lawmakers earned a point for each vote in support of a \u201cpro-economic freedom issue,\u201d or against an \u201canti-economic freedom issue.\u201d\n\nIn Florida, the group supports expanding the charter school industry and tax cuts while opposing Medicaid expansion and a ban on fracking.\n\nRep. Halsey Beshears, R-Monticello, scored the highest among the Tallahassee area delegation. AFP gave Beshears an A. Next was Sen. Bill Montford, D-Tallahassee, who scored a B. Rep. Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda, D-Tallahassee, was given a C.\n\n\u201cA big part of our mission is to help Florida taxpayers hold their elected officials accountable,\u201d said Chris Hudson, the state director of AFP.\n\nVasilinda voted with the group 75 percent of the time, Montford 87 percent and Beshears 96 percent of the time. The top vote getter was Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, who posted a score of 114 percent.\n\nWilliams dismisses the grades as irrelevant.\n\n\u201cTheir philosophy is one that doesn\u2019t connect with this community,\u201d he said, noting that he lost points even when voting for Republican proposals. \u201cThey have no connection to our state other than to come here and spend millions of dollars attacking Republicans and Democrats whenever they start to work together.\u201d\n\nReporter James Call can be reached at jcall@tallahassee.com.
