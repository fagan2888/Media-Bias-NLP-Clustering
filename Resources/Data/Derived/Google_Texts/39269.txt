An East Mount Airy man was gunned down early Saturday inside a home in the city's Hunting Park section.

Police said Micah Fisher, 23, of Sydney Street near Woolston Avenue, was struck multiple times in the abdomen on Colwyn Street near Broad at about 4:30 a.m. He was rushed to Temple University Hospital and pronounced dead at 10:41 a.m.

Family members said Fisher was just staying at the house for the night when the landlord and several men got into a dispute with tenants of the home, NBC10 reported. Family members said the landlord and the men left, but returned in about 20 minutes and started shooting. Witnesses said Fisher was struck when he went to the door after he thought the shooting stopped.

No arrests have been reported.
