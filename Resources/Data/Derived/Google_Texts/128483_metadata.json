Running down a list of crumbling, outdated, and woefully inadequate facilities across the state, McCrory delivered a full-throated plea for fixing and upgrading North Carolina\u2019s public infrastructure.\n\nThe General Assembly voted to put the bond package on the ballot in the last days of the 2015 legislative session, leaving voters to decide whether to use bonds to fund a series of investment in the UNC system, community colleges, local water and sewer systems, state parks, and the National Guard. (See below for a top-level breakdown of how the bond proceeds would be allocated. For more detail, a post from last year provides a full breakdown of the projects to be funded and how the bill changed during its final stages of approval.)\n\nTo his credit, Governor McCrory has clearly taken the time to visit some facilities, and he did not mince words about how badly the funds are needed. McCrory called some of our National Guard facilities \u201cfrankly disrespectful\u201d, a science building at Western Carolina \u201can embarrassment\u201d, and joked about feeling somewhat apprehensive that the roof of the Engineering and Science building at UNC Charlotte would fall through while he and his team were inspecting it.\n\nIt is important to remember some of the context surrounding the bond proposal. After years of recession and dwindling public investment, the need far outstrips what the bond would raise. Even if North Carolina voters pass the bond, much more investment will be needed to build the public infrastructure the modern economy demands. In addition, several rounds of deep tax cuts in recent years will make it hard to properly use and maintain the public facilities the bond would finance. Unless we plan to leave these facilities dark once they\u2019re completed, state leaders are going to have to raise additional revenue or make painful cuts elsewhere.\n\nStill, it was refreshing to witness a cheerful bipartisan call for investing in North Carolina\u2019s economic future.\n\nAllocation of bond funds:", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Even if North Carolina voters pass the bond, much more investment will be needed to build the public infrastructure the modern economy demands.\nAfter years of recession and dwindling public investment, the need far outstrips what the bond would raise.\nIn addition, several rounds of deep tax cuts in recent years will make it hard to properly use and maintain the public facilities the bond would finance.\nGovernor McCrory pitched a packed room of elected representatives, business leaders, and academic dignitaries to support the bond package.\nRunning down a list of crumbling, outdated, and woefully inadequate facilities across the state, McCrory delivered a full-throated plea for fixing and upgrading North Carolina\u2019s public infrastructure."}
