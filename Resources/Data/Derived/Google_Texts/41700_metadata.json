The group has appealed to the Supreme Court, Yerushalmi said.\n\nThe group also has sued the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority for refusing an ad that included the winning entry of the \u201cDraw Mohammad Contest.\u201d\n\nYerushalmi criticized the 9th Circuit, saying it believes transit officials in Washington state may allow controversial speech and treat ad space as a limited public forum, \u201cwhich in effect allows the government to decide what is good speech and what is bad speech, as long as the government can muster up some reasonable explanation.\n\n\u201cThere is always some reason for government censorship - that doesn\u2019t make it right or constitutional,\u201d he said.\n\nThe court said nothing prevents the group from displaying its ad in other forums, such as a billboard, newspaper or television, finding that it failed to show \u201cextreme or very serious damage will result.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An anti-Muslim group cannot post ads on buses in Washington state showing photos of wanted terrorists and wrongly claiming the FBI offers a $25 million reward for their one of their captures, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "An anti-Muslim group cannot post ads on buses in Washington state showing photos of wanted terrorists and wrongly claiming the FBI offers a $25 million reward for their one of their captures, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday.", "title": "Pamela Geller\u2019s anti-Muslim group can\u2019t post ads on buses: federal court", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/12/pamela-geller-group-loses-federal-appeal/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/04/a646061af5f67318780f6a7067000054.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/04/a646061af5f67318780f6a7067000054.jpg", "description": "An anti-Muslim group cannot post ads on buses in Washington state showing photos of wanted terrorists and wrongly claiming the FBI offers a $25 million reward for their one of their captures, a federa", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Pamela Geller\u2019s anti-Muslim group can\u2019t post ads on buses:"}, "Author": "Martha Bellisle", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "US Supreme Court, David Yerushalmi, Federal Bureau of Investigation"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb20e\"", "article_summary": "SEATTLE - An anti-Muslim group cannot post ads on buses in Washington state showing photos of wanted terrorists and wrongly claiming the FBI offers a $25 million reward for their one of their captures, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday.\nBut a federal court and appeals court ruled in favor of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which refused to run two \u201cpro-Israel/anti-jihad\u201d ads on its buses, saying the ads were demeaning to Muslims.\nThe American Freedom Law Center has a mixed record on court fights over ads in other cities.\nDavid Yerushalmi, the group\u2019s lawyer, said the group will appeal Wednesday\u2019s ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nCircuit Court of Appeals rejected a claim by the American Freedom Defense Initiative that King County violated its First Amendment right to free speech by refusing to post the advertisements on buses."}
