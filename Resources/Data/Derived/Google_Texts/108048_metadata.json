Almost 1000 people are dead. Two Ebola patients, American missionaries, have come home for treatment. A patient in New York who just returned from West Africa is currently being tested for the deadly disease.\n\nThe response by some in the American mainstream media can be summed up in two words: \u201cStop panicking.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nI\u2019m not panicked over Ebola; nor am I alarmed or freaked out. I also believe it was the right decision to bring those two Americans suffering from this dreadful virus back to America. We\u2019re Americans. That\u2019s who we are.\n\nI am, though, concerned about Ebola. And for five perfectly rational reasons, I do not trust the What Me Worry Mainstream Media to tell us the full truth about a potential outbreak:\n\n1. The Mainstream Media Love to Lord Their Superiority Over Us \u2013 Accusing the hoi polloi of panicking and then calling for calm is the first knee-jerk reaction of anyone who gets off on puffing themselves up as Our Betters. And that is our media personified.\n\nI believe and worry that the need to preen their superiority over us could affect the media\u2019s judgment. That\u2019s why the bloodless, slide-rule, Big Government-worshipping Spocks at Business Insider are already accusing others of panic \u2026 even though no one is panicking.\n\n2. The Obama Administration Lies \u2013 In a situation where an Ebola outbreak could in some way hurt President Obama\u2019s popularity numbers or agenda, do I believe the Obama Administration is morally corrupt to the point where they would put politics above the safety of the public? I\u2019d tell you to ask our Libyan ambassador and three other foreign services workers that question, but they\u2019re all dead.\n\nWere Ebola to creep over the Southern border in the form of an illegal immigrant, that could hurt this Administration\u2019s push to legalize 11 million Democrats. There is no doubt in my mind, the Administration would cover this up for as long as it could.\n\nOn top of the Obama Administration\u2019s corruption, the White House has shown itself to be breathtakingly inept at all things. Should yet another fatal bungle occur by our federal government, you can bet it will be covered up.\n\nOur federal bureaucracy doesn\u2019t give a damn about our veterans, what makes you think they\u2019ll give a damn about you?\n\n3. The Media Lets The Obama Administration Lie \u2013 There is also no doubt in my mind that the same media that is actively engaged in covering up Benghazi and the IRS scandal would aid and abet the covering up of anything else the Obama Administration wanted covered up \u2014 even an outbreak of Ebola.\n\nThe media is also committed to seeing 11 million illegals legalized into voting Democrats and has already gone to extreme lengths to cover up the parade horribles happening on the Southern border. Covering up an Ebola outbreak is just one more moral compromise in an ocean of them.\n\n4. The Media Can\u2019t Be Trusted to Know What\u2019s Going On \u2013 We cannot trust the same media that didn\u2019t want to vet ObamaCare to dig into what could be another potentially inconvenient truth for the Obama Administration.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Benghazi, Fast and Furious, the IRS, or ObamaCare, the media just doesn\u2019t want to know.\n\n5. The Mainstream Media Lies \u2013 The mainstream media lies. It lies all the time. The mainstream media is a degenerate, habitual, serial liar that exists only to serve the government and the noxious little career-climbing bubble it exists in. I always assume the media is lying \u2014 that way I\u2019m right more than I\u2019m wrong. The mainstream media is a wretched institution populated with wretched people and only a handful of exceptions.\n\nIf you\u2019re foolish enough to believe the mainstream media will put what\u2019s morally good, right, and true above The Club Rules, you obviously haven\u2019t watched CNN\u2019s coverage of the war in Gaza.\n\nI\u2019m not trusting my life or the lives of my loved ones to arrogant, mercenary government bootlickers.\n\n\u2014\n\nSo what should we do\u2026\n\nI\u2019m watching ALL of the media, not just the mainstream media. New Media, local media\u2026. I\u2019m also reading up on Ebola from objective sources; how it spreads, how long the incubation process is; symptoms, etc.\n\nI\u2019m nowhere near hoarding water and canned goods or locking myself and my loved ones in the house with the doors and windows sealed with duct tape.\n\nBut I have stocked up on duct tape.\n\nDon\u2019t panic, but\u2026\n\nBe smart.\n\nBe aware.\n\nEducate yourself.\n\nSpread the word.\n\nThe threat is real.\n\nAnd the more the government and its media try to euthanize you with pats on the head, the more you need to worry.\n\nJohn Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "5 Reasons Not to Trust the 'What Me Worry' Media About Ebola", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "5 Reasons Not to Trust the 'What Me Worry' Media About Ebola", "title": "5 Reasons Not to Trust the 'What Me Worry' Media About Ebola - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2014/08/05/Ebola-real-sign-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2014/08/05/5-reasons-not-totrust-what-me-worry-media-about-ebola/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "5 Reasons Not to Trust the 'What Me Worry' Media About Ebola", "title": "5 Reasons Not to Trust the 'What Me Worry' Media About Ebola - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2014/08/05/Ebola-real-sign-ap.jpg", "creator": "@noltenc", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Benghazi, Mainstream Media, Twitter,Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Journalism", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-08-05T12:09:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24e3\"", "article_summary": "The Mainstream Media Lies \u2013 The mainstream media lies.\nAnd for five perfectly rational reasons, I do not trust the What Me Worry Mainstream Media to tell us the full truth about a potential outbreak:1.\n\u2014So what should we do\u2026I\u2019m watching ALL of the media, not just the mainstream media.\nThe mainstream media is a wretched institution populated with wretched people and only a handful of exceptions.\nCovering up an Ebola outbreak is just one more moral compromise in an ocean of them."}
