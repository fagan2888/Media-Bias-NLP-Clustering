Warsame and his supporters, however, allied with mayoral runner-up Mark Andrew.\n\nAbdirahman Muse, the liaison hired by Hodges, will also work with the labor community. The mayor\u2019s office said he worked for three years as an organizer with the Service Employees International Union Healthcare Minnesota, helping pass a bill granting collective-bargaining rights to home-care workers and organizing opposition to the proposed voter-ID amendment in November 2012. Muse and other union members were active in her campaign, and he introduced her to members of the Somali community.\n\nMuse has worked as an organizer for nearly a decade on labor, immigrant rights and economic justice, according to the mayor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cI will be a voice for all the minorities in the city,\u201d the 32 year-old Whittier resident said in an interview. He said he wants to work with them on creating more jobs and affordable housing, improving schools, and making the city safer.\n\n\u201cTo be a Somali is an asset,\u201d Muse said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll be working on the same agenda the mayor has when it comes to closing the gap\u201d between minorities and whites in jobs and education.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Mayor Betsy Hodges recently announced the hiring of a liaison to the Somali community in a nod to the group&rsquo;s growing importance in the city: the number of citizens born in East Africa has jumped 53 percent to 14,497 in the last decade.", "title": "As Hodges appoints Somali liaison, Latina council member laments \"missed opportunity\"", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/as-hodges-appoints-somali-liaison-latina-council-member-laments-missed-opportunity/243776441/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Mayor Betsy Hodges recently announced the hiring of a liaison to the Somali community in a nod to the group&rsquo;s growing importance in the city: the number of citizens born in East Africa has jumped 53 percent to 14,497 in the last decade.", "title": "As Hodges appoints Somali liaison, Latina council member laments \"missed opportunity\"", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/as-hodges-appoints-somali-liaison-latina-council-member-laments-missed-opportunity/243776441/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Mayor Betsy Hodges recently announced the hiring of a liaison to the Somali community in a nod to the group&rsquo;s growing importance in the city: the number of citizens born in East Africa has jumped 53 percent to 14,497 in the last decade."}, "article_summary": "Muse and other union members were active in her campaign, and he introduced her to members of the Somali community.\nMayoral spokeswoman Kate Brickman said Hodges promised during the campaign that she would hire a Somali liaison to address the community\u2019s particular needs on education, safety and housing.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit of a missed opportunity,\u201d said Alondra Cano, who was elected as the first Hispanic council member in November.\nAbdirahman Muse, the liaison hired by Hodges, will also work with the labor community.\nMuse has worked as an organizer for nearly a decade on labor, immigrant rights and economic justice, according to the mayor\u2019s office."}
