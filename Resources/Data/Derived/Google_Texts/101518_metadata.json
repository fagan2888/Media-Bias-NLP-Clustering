It was remarkable to see the real Boehner and the real Obama acting like best buddies in the White House movie theater. Boehner even tells Obama that he finally got a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d \u2014 only it was on a Chevy Tahoe, not the one they tried to negotiate on the economy.\n\nI watched that video with Chuck Todd, the host of \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d and he had the exact same reaction I had: \u201cWhere was that brotherly love when America needed it\u201d for a real grand bargain?\n\nThat scene plucked the deepest emotional chord in the country today: The nonstop fighting between our two political parties has left many Americans feeling like the children of two permanently divorcing parents. The country is starved to see its two major parties do big hard things together again. And getting a glimpse \u2014 even just a pretend one \u2014 of Obama and Boehner teaming up reminds you what\u2019s been lost.\n\nI think what\u2019s propelling Donald Trump\u2019s success more than anything is the feeling of many Americans that our politics are totally stuck. There is an overwhelming sense of \u201cstuckness\u201d \u2014 and the fantasy that Trump plays to, and plays up, is that he can pull the sword from the stone and do deals. No one was more responsible for this \u201cstuckness,\u201d though, than today\u2019s Republican Party. When Mitch McConnell, the GOP leader in the Senate, said in October 2010 that \u201cthe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president,\u201d he described the Republicans\u2019 dominant strategy since 2008. The party stopped thinking seriously about market-based alternatives. Into that emptiness entered Trump, like an invasive species.\n\nIn short, on the eve of Obama\u2019s presidency, something big happened: Everything started getting digitized and made mobile \u2014 work, commerce, billing, finance, education \u2014 reshaping the economy. A lot of things started to get very fast all at once. It was precisely when we needed to double down on our formula for success and update it for a new era.\n\nInstead, we had the 2008 economic meltdown, which set off more polarization, and way too much gridlock, given how much rethinking, reimagining and retooling we needed to do. In this vortex a lot of the public got unmoored and disoriented, opening the way for populists with simple answers. Get rid of immigrants, end trade with China or eliminate big banks and all will be fine. It\u2019s nonsense.\n\nWe got strong as a country through democracy and capitalism. We got rich as a country through trade. We got smart and powerful as a country through immigration. We got fair as a country through Social Security, Medicare and Obamacare. They all lead to vastly more winners than losers. This is no time to lose confidence in what got us here.\n\nBut if you\u2019re for these things only as they now exist, you\u2019re wrong. Each one needs retooling. It\u2019s clear: Free trade with China has hurt more people than originally thought. It\u2019s clear: Low-skilled illegal immigration has hurt more American workers than we\u2019ve fully understood. (And more high-skilled immigration in a knowledge age would enhance our economy more than most people understand.) It\u2019s clear: Social Security, Medicare and Obamacare all need fixes to remain sustainable. It\u2019s clear: Capitalism driven more by machines and robots poses new challenges for both white-collar and blue-collar workers.\n\nEvery one of these challenges can be met if we put our heads and hands together. For that to happen, though, this version of the Republican Party had to be destroyed, so a thinking center-right party can emerge. If that is what Trump has done, he\u2019s done the Lord\u2019s work. We also need Democrats to be a center-left party, though, and not let Bernie Sanders pull them to the far left. If both happen, maybe something good can actually emerge from this crazy election.\n\n\u2014 Thomas Friedman is a columnist for The New York Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Like many others, I watched the video that President Barack Obama showed at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner on Saturday of him inviting former House Speaker John Boehner over to solicit his advice on what Obama should do post-presidency.
