Daehnick said she supports the Affordable Care Act but is concerned that exchange staff can\u2019t provide her with basic facts and analysis.\n\n\u201cFeelings are no way to allocate funds; we need analysis,\u201d she said when reached by phone after the meeting. \u201cThe budget as presented to the board for evaluation doesn\u2019t have the analysis on the executive level based in fact and doesn\u2019t have good forecasting going forward. As a board member, I can\u2019t allocate public dollars based on that.\u201d\n\nDr. Mike Fallon, a board member who initially opposed the fee but in the end voted for it, said he wanted to put exchange staff on notice that he would be watching the budget closely. He decided to vote for the fee because it\u2019s a third of what insurers paid to Cover Colorado \u2014 a last-resort insurance pool that the state closed after the Affordable Care Act passed. The legislation allows the exchange to charge up to $1.80 for the assessment.\n\n\u201cI wanted to let them know the decision didn\u2019t come easy and with no strings attached,\u201d he said after the meeting.\n\nBut other board members feared the exchange would not have enough money to continue operations.\n\nMarguerite Salazar, the state insurance commissioner who is a nonvoting member of the board, said states like Oregon have moved to the problem-plagued federal exchange. She doesn\u2019t want that to happen in Colorado, which could be a result of insufficient funding.\n\n\u201cNow is not the time to go lean,\u201d Salazar said. \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult to increase than decrease\u201d the fee later.\n\nThe fee, which sunsets after 2016, will raise about $13 million a year. The exchange also collects 1.4 percent of the premiums sold in the exchange.\n\nThe exchange staff is analyzing the impact of people dropping policies and extension of noncompliant policies for another year on their budget.\n\nThe approved 2015 budget cuts customer service from $22.5 million to $13.6 million, marketing by more than half to $4.8 million, and technology by about 24 percent to $29.5 million. The remaining $15 million will pay for operations, general administration (like salaries) and money to assist people in buying insurance. There is also $3 million to potentially buy a building in Colorado Springs.\n\nThe cut in customer service will result in the call center answering 80 percent of calls in 90 seconds instead of 80 percent in 20 seconds, which was the case before open enrollment ended.\n\nExchange executive director Patty Fontneau said the staff heard \u201cloud and clear\u201d that the board wanted to keep expenses as low as possible and that the longer call center times are acceptable.\n\nMarc Reese, associate director for the Colorado Association of Health Plans, said there hasn\u2019t been a formal vote on the assessment but believes most of his members would support the fee. \u201cLower is better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the exchange needs (money) to do its job.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado health exchange board OKs fee", "title": "Colorado health exchange board OKs fee", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/09/colorado-health-exchange-board-oks-fee/", "image": {"width": 599, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140326__connectforhealthcoscreenshotp1p1-1.jpg", "height": 398}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140326__connectforhealthcoscreenshotp1p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-09T12:47:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:32:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff19\"", "article_summary": "Board member Ellen Daehnick, who called in to the meeting, was the only board member to vote against the budget and assessment.\nDaehnick said she supports the Affordable Care Act but is concerned that exchange staff can\u2019t provide her with basic facts and analysis.\nThe state health exchange board approved a $66 million budget and a $13 million funding stream Monday to run the nonprofit as the federal grant money runs out.\nThe exchange staff is analyzing the impact of people dropping policies and extension of noncompliant policies for another year on their budget.\nBut other board members feared the exchange would not have enough money to continue operations."}
