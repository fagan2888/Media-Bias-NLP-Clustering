Immediately after the attack, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif promised that Pakistan would no longer distinguish between the \u201cbad\u201d Pakistani Taliban, which is seeking to bring down the Pakistani state, and other \u201cgood\u201d Taliban groups that for years have been supported or exploited by Pakistan\u2019s Army and intelligence service to attack India and wield influence in Afghanistan. What his words should mean is that Pakistan will no longer tolerate any extremists. But initial indications are not promising.\n\nJust two days after the massacre, for instance, a Pakistani court granted bail to a militant commander accused of orchestrating the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, that killed 166 people. The suspect, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, is a member of Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of the \u201cgood\u201d Taliban groups that focuses on attacking India and has links to the Pakistani Army.\n\nThe decision does not mean that Mr. Lakhvi will be out of prison soon because the government can keep him in detention under a special legal provision, as it should. But it is a reminder of the absurdly slow pace of his trial, which began in 2009, and how Pakistan has failed to ensure justice for India, which it considers its chief enemy, and the victims and families of the Mumbai attacks.\n\nExperts say that even in detention Mr. Lakhvi has been given considerable freedom and has continued to direct militant operations. Pakistani authorities got tough with Lashkar after Mumbai but have since allowed the group to re-establish itself. Its leader, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, lives in the city of Lahore even though the United States has offered $10 million for his arrest. And, on Friday, according to The Times\u2019s Declan Walsh, Mr. Lakhvi\u2019s brother-in-law gave a sermon at a mosque in Hyderabad that accused NATO of sending \u201cterrorists disguised as Muslims\u201d into Pakistan and then linked the Peshawar attack to India.\n\nMany Indians expressed sympathy for the victims of the Peshawar massacre \u2014 a tragedy that should have been an opportunity for the two countries to find common cause against extremism. Instead, the granting of bail to Mr. Lakhvi drew shock and condemnation from India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, who said he has protested strongly to Islamabad.\n\nSince the massacre, the army has also intensified its bombing of militant strongholds in the lawless border near Afghanistan. While such action is necessary, it will never be enough to deal with the threat. Pakistanis cannot expect to fight some extremists and enable others, especially when there is considerable cooperation among the groups.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe country also needs a stronger civilian government, a credible judicial system and an end to religious schools that promote intolerance. In the aftermath of the massacre, many Pakistanis have spoken out against the militant threat. The question is whether the country can harness this outrage and grief into something positive.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20141222212831, "twitter": {"description": "Two days after a massacre at a school, a court granted bail to a militant accused of orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks.", "title": "Pakistan\u2019s Baffling Response to Extremism", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/23/opinion/pakistans-baffling-response-to-extremism.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003414110"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/23/opinion/pakistans-baffling-response-to-extremism.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003414110", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/23/opinion/pakistans-baffling-response-to-extremism.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Pakistan\u2019s Baffling Response to Extremism", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 22, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-12-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States", "published": "2014-12-22", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "keywords": "Pakistan,Taliban,Editorials,Terrorism,Peshawar (Pakistan),Sharif  Nawaz,Lashkar-e-Taiba,Lakhvi  Zaki-ur-Rehman,Saeed  Hafiz Muhammad,United States", "description": "Two days after a massacre at a school, a court granted bail to a militant accused of orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Saeed, Hafiz Muhammad", "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Two days after a massacre at a school, a court granted bail to a militant accused of orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "news_keywords": "Pakistan,Taliban,Editorial,Terrorism,Lashkar e Taiba", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Dec. 22, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "org": "Lashkar-e-Taiba", "geo": "United States", "slug": "23tue2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141224112418, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/23/opinion/pakistans-baffling-response-to-extremism.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Two days after a massacre at a school, a court granted bail to a militant accused of orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks.", "title": "Pakistan\u2019s Baffling Response to Extremism"}, "pdate": 20141222, "des": "Terrorism", "articleid": 100000003414110, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Pakistan\u2019s Baffling Response to Extremism", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8f8\"", "article_summary": "Many Indians expressed sympathy for the victims of the Peshawar massacre \u2014 a tragedy that should have been an opportunity for the two countries to find common cause against extremism.\nExperts say that even in detention Mr. Lakhvi has been given considerable freedom and has continued to direct militant operations.\nInstead, the granting of bail to Mr. Lakhvi drew shock and condemnation from India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, who said he has protested strongly to Islamabad.\nThe decision does not mean that Mr. Lakhvi will be out of prison soon because the government can keep him in detention under a special legal provision, as it should.\nSince the massacre, the army has also intensified its bombing of militant strongholds in the lawless border near Afghanistan."}
