I drove the Southern route and decided to conduct an informal survey, asking folks I met along the way a question relevant to the health care reporting I\u2019ve been doing for the past five years.\n\nThe question: What bugs you most about your medical care?\n\nFew people I talked with \u2014 at gas stations, coffee shops, grocery stores, parking lots, bars and everywhere in between \u2014 even mentioned the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare by name. But I heard again and again how health policy issues I\u2019ve been reporting on in Washington are affecting their lives.\n\nWhat did I find out?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom coast to coast, people told me that their health coverage and care are too expensive. \u201cI wish it would be cheaper mainly \u2014 more affordable,\u201d Ruben Irigoyen of Springerville, Arizona, told me. \u201cThat\u2019s mainly my concern. Everything is just very expensive, especially in these small communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess the high price of some my medications, even after insurance,\u201d said Kristie Galy of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\nA few people were able to buy more affordable insurance on the new marketplaces created by the health law. \u201cI\u2019m not really happy with how much things cost. But I did get a plan through healthcare.gov and that helped a lot,\u201d said Christa Sadler of Flagstaff, Arizona.\n\nBut the United States continues to spend more on health care than any other country in the world. And Angie Wilson of Nashville, Tennessee, had experienced that firsthand. \u201cOf course the cost\u201d is the big problem, she told me. \u201cThe cost! It\u2019s expensive. That\u2019s the main thing.\u201d\n\nHospitals across the country are seeking to improve medical care by getting primary care doctors, specialists, nurses and other providers to work together to coordinate the care of their patients. Under the health law, the government is penalizing hospitals if too many of their patients are return quickly after being discharged. Those readmissions are an expensive symptom of uncoordinated care.\n\nBut care coordination is still a work in progress. \u201cI am very upset because my wife had major surgery last Thursday, and they made her leave the hospital on Friday at 7 o\u2019clock at night, and now she\u2019s back in the hospital because she shouldn\u2019t have left so early,\u201d said Glenn Ferreri in Brandon, Mississippi. \u201cSo I\u2019m unhappy about the health care regulations going on that\u2019s pushing people out so that we have to take care of them at home where the care should be at the hospitals.\u201d\n\nRight now, there\u2019s a big push to get computers and electronic health records in hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices across the country. Karen Greig of Menlo Park, California, said there are drawbacks for patients.\n\n\u201cThe way the computer in the examining room has come between me and the doctor. Half the time they don\u2019t even look you in the eye because they\u2019re busy typing away, looking at the computer and you\u2019re wondering are they even hearing what I\u2019m saying?\u201d Greig told me in a Flagstaff coffee shop.\n\nPeople I talked with were worried about who would take care of them. Will there be enough primary care doctors to meet demand from patients, especially as more Americans get insurance coverage under the health law. Hart Fortenbery in Lafayette, Louisiana, was particularly concerned about having to see a nurse practitioner instead of a doctor as more mid-level providers are taking on a bigger role in primary care.\n\n\u201cWhat bugs me most about my medical care is the state of the doctors,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t see a doctor, and if you do they got to see 50 \u2026 people a day. They\u2019re stressed, overworked, underpaid, and you end up with a nurse practitioner who\u2019s able to write prescriptions.\u201d\n\nAt a gas station in Fenner, California, just miles from the Arizona border, I met Dudley Pratt of Huntington Beach. He was riding his dirt bike across the Mojave Preserve.\n\nHe\u2019s said he\u2019s a free spirit, and it\u2019s all the paperwork about health insurance that drives him nuts. \u201cI can remember back in the \u201970s, you would have, like, Blue Cross Blue Shield, you go in and you hand them a card. There was no paperwork or copays,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just went to the ER or whatever. Now it seems a lot more complicated.\u201d\n\nAnd then were even a few people who \u2013 lo and behold \u2013 were actually happy with their medical care. I met Don Chalmers of San Diego, at the same gas station in Fenner. \u201cI will tell you I have always had good luck with my medical care,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time I went to the hospital I came out better than when I went in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recently, I moved across the country, from Washington, D.C., to San Francisco.
