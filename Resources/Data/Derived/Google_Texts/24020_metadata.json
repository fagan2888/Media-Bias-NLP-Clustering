That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019ve always done, make women feel fantastic about themselves. A key component to that is what you\u2019re wearing, it affects how you feel the entire day. So if you can put something on that isn\u2019t a fortune \u2026\u201d\n\nWhile it might not be a fortune, it will be of fine quality because this fashion expert worked with Ralph Lauren.\n\n\u201cI was lucky to work directly with him and the first thing is that it\u2019s all about quality. If you have any Ralph Lauren products at home, you\u2019re always amazed with the quality. They last forever, always in perfect taste,\u201d said Kressley.\n\nThe quality of my experiences with Kressley also haven\u2019t changed. He has never started erecting those invisible walls that so many celebrities mentally install during an interview. We first met in 2007 when we were judges for a Spalon Montage hair competition, but have hung out on other occasions when he had business in Minneapolis. I told Kressley that when I met his \u201cQueer Eye\u201d co-star Thom Filicia, I noted that Carson was my favorite.\n\n\u201cStop it!\u201d said Kressley. \u201cPeople don\u2019t usually like that. I hope he was your second favorite?\u201d\n\nKressley is No. 1 because one time when we [there were lots of others in his local entourage] were together he kept telling incredibly entertaining stories to which I would just smile and nod, thinking, He doesn\u2019t want to see that in print. Reading the expression on my face, Kressley repeatedly remarked: \u201cWrite that down, C.J. That really happened!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bossy, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Kressley, who knows his style is dangerous with a reporter. \u201cYou can write whatever you want.\u201d\n\nI did two startribune.com/videos with Kressley. One is this Q & A, and the other involves making a game of the fashion expert examing t-shirts from my closet -- with his eyes closed -- to find one that meets his standards. We begin this version of my Kressley interviews at the point where he had said, \u201cI\u2019ll sleep in that [shirt] tonight. I\u2019ll roll around and say, \u2018C.J., where are you?\u2019 \u201d\n\nQ: Speaking of sleeping, why don\u2019t I ever hear anything about your sex life in the tabloids?\n\nA: My god, I don\u2019t ever have sex with other people. Yeah, it\u2019s been a bit of a dry spell but Minneapolis, catch me at the Gay 90s if I\u2019m here.\n\nQ: Who is your current celebrity crush?\n\nA: Humm. George Clooney is taken now. Darn. Ryan Gosling is pretty delicious. There are so many. They don\u2019t have to be a celebrity. I had a crush on my doorman, which was very awkward but he\u2019s super hot. We see each other every day. It\u2019s like having a boyfriend and I don\u2019t ever have to really do anything. And he holds the door for me. It\u2019s fantastic. Thank you, so much [he said after I adjusted his shirt collar.]\n\nQ: What did you learn from Ralph Lauren\u2019s aesthetic that you utilize?\n\nA: I worked for Ralph for about seven years. I was lucky to work directly with him, and the first thing is that it\u2019s all about quality. If you have any Ralph Lauren products at home, you\u2019re always amazed with the quality. They last forever, always in perfect taste. Quality was always job No. 1 there. The other thing is that he was very true to his aesthetic, a designer who wouldn\u2019t jump on the bandwagon for a trend just because it was trendy. He was very hands on and only put products on the market he really, really loved and believed in. That\u2019s a great place to get a fashion education. So many amazing designers have come out of Ralph Lauren from Vera Wang to a million different people, John Varvatos.\n\nQ: When you have been so influenced by Ralph Lauren, is it difficult not to copy him when you go off to do your own thing?\n\nA: I think you can be over-influenced by a designer you work for. Yes, I\u2019m over-influenced often. It\u2019s \u2018The World of Ralph Lauren\u2019 so you become immersed in it. When I first started designing my own collection sometimes it was very, very traditional and very, very classic. I thought the only way to dress a woman was in a tweed skirt and button-down blouse. As you gain more experience and see what other designers are doing and shopping the markets and researching trends you kind of find your own aesthetic. I think now, after doing this for 15 years, I think a real aesthetic of mine has emerged, where it\u2019s a lot of quality details, embellishments, a lot of beautiful trims. Fun, playful, easier to wear, celebratory style. A lot of bling, color and pattern. You\u2019re constantly jzuzhing me. I need to get some starch up in here. [Again, I was rearranging his collar.]\n\nQ: Is there ever a time when anyone would say you are shy?\n\nA: I\u2019m really not that shy. Sorry.\n\nQ: Similar question; Is there a time of day when you are more quiet?\n\nA: Oh, yeah. I don\u2019t really like anything between 6 in the morning to like noon. That\u2019s down time for me. I like to stay up late, get up late. I\u2019m good to go around 12:45. So if you\u2019re going to call me, don\u2019t call me until 1 p.m.\n\nQ: If you were a woman in your next life\u2026\n\nA: Yes. Next life?\n\nQ: ..would you want to be more like Sofia Vergara, Oprah or Amal Alamuddin?\n\nA: Oh, those are all good choices. I think I would probably want to be a little bit of all of them. Could I be Oprah Sophia Alamuddin?\n\nQ: Is there any celebrity you look at these days and say, Boy, if I could take him or her out for a haircut \u2026\n\nA: Oh, for a haircut? Humm. There are a lot of younger celebrities I do think look like they\u2019ve combed their hair with a pork chop in the morning. I know that\u2019s part of the messy look and grunge is sneaking back into the picture. I like to raise people\u2019s own style. If they are happy with it and it works for them and I can amp it up a notch, then that\u2019s what I like to do.\n\nQ: Is there a celebrity in whose home you\u2019d like to be the security camera?\n\nA: Maybe I could just be the security camera at Kim and Kanye\u2019s. It would always be exciting \u2014 and that baby! I can be the security camera and the baby monitor: HEY, NORTH\u2019S CRYING AGAIN. SHOULD I GET HER A CHANEL BINKY?\n\nQ: From which side of your family do you get those full lips?\n\nA: I got these from my brother and that sounds weird but when I was like 6 years old we decided to play homemade teeter totter. Don\u2019t ever do this at home. Basically took a giant board and put it on a cinder block and started teeter-tottering and he\u2019s like Oh, look a bunny and he left and the wood went bam. So I have 37 stitches right here. But it gave me great lips and it was much cheaper than all the filler. It didn\u2019t seem like a blessing at the time, but now, thank you!\n\nQ: What brand of underwear do you like?\n\nA: I\u2019m not wearing any. No. I usually wear Emporio Armani because it\u2019s kind of modal, stretchy. It\u2019s not even real cotton but it\u2019s amazing. They are the only ones I wear. But they are like $34, so I only have three or four pairs. I wash them often. I thought I was getting three in the box and I opened the box \u2014 \u201cWhere are the others?\u201d\n\nInterviews are edited.
