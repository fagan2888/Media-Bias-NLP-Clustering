I think it is time to take our country back,\u201d she said, adding that the federal bureaucracy has become an obstacle to the nation realizing its potential.\n\nThe IRS has more personnel than the FBI and CIA combined at a time when national security is in peril, she said.\n\nThe IRS enforces a 73,000-page tax code that Fiorina, a former CEO of computer giant Hewlett-Packard, said should be simplified to three pages. She called the Affordable Care Act an 80,000-page \u201cmonstrosity\u201d that has led to crony capitalism in the health care system and should be repealed.\n\n\u201cWe are crushing people with this complexity,\u201d she said.\n\nShe called for \u201czero-based budgeting\u201d of the federal government so that spending of every tax dollar would be justified.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board, Federal Communications Commission and Environmental Protection Agency are examples of a federal bureaucracy that is unaccountable to the people, she said.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer a nation of laws,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cWe are a nation of rules.\u201d\n\nFiorina pledged to restore America as a land of opportunity, citing her own rise from secretary to the head of Hewlett-Packard.\n\n\u201cThis nation was founded on an amazing idea. You had a right to see possibilities and pursue them. You had a right to fulfill you own potential,\u201d she said.\n\nBorder security is an ever-present issue that was a hot topic of the presidential races in 2008 and 2012. But nothing has been done about it, she said.\n\nShe pledged a cooperative effort to defeat ISIS.\n\n\u201cOur allies are not counting on us anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nShe criticized the Obama administration for its response to the attacks in Benghazi, Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. She said she would retaliate if the country is attacked.\n\nShe called for more collaboration between the tech sector and the government to thwart terrorism hatched in cyberspace.\n\nWhen asked about U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s decision to drop out of the presidential race, she said that he is a great patriot and a great American.\n\n\u201cI have great admiration for him,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope he will continue to speak out.\u201d\n\nFiorina addressed the East Cooper Republican Club at the Holiday Inn on Johnnie Dodds Boulevard. Before speaking, she posed for photos with students from Wando High School, Porter-Gaud and Ashley Hall.\n\nShe is scheduled to speak in Florence on Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Carly Fiorina calls for less government, more leadership, Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nNews, \r\nFederal Politics, \r\nElections, \r\nElections, Carly Fiorina,East Cooper Republicans,ISIS", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "MOUNT PLEASANT \u2014 Presidential candidate Carly Fiorina lambasted the federal bureaucracy, Obamacare and the response to terror attacks during a speech Monday to Lowcountry Republicans at the outset of a campaign swing through South Carolina.", "title": "Carly Fiorina calls for less government, more leadership", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151221/151229882/carly-fiorina-calls-for-less-government-more-leadership", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151221/PC1603/151229882/AR/0/AR-151229882.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151221/PC1603/151229882/AR/0/AR-151229882.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "MOUNT PLEASANT \u2014 Presidential candidate Carly Fiorina lambasted the federal bureaucracy, Obamacare and the response to terror attacks during a speech Monday to Lowcountry Republicans at the outset of a campaign swing through South Carolina.", "title": "Carly Fiorina calls for less government, more leadership", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Palmetto Politics", "iphone": "Palmetto Politics", "googleplay": "Palmetto Politics"}, "id": {"ipad": 897497885, "iphone": 897497885, "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.eveningpostpublishingcompany.palmettopolitics"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151221/PC1603/151229882/AR/0/AR-151229882.jpg?201512211617", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151229882}}, "keywords": "Carly Fiorina calls for less government, more leadership , Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nNews, \r\nFederal Politics, \r\nElections, \r\nElections, Carly Fiorina,East Cooper Republicans,ISIS", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-21T15:44:06Z", "modified_time": "2015-12-21T16:17:00Z", "author": "Prentiss Findlay"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "MOUNT PLEASANT \u2014 Presidential candidate Carly Fiorina lambasted the federal bureaucracy, Obamacare and the response to terror attacks during a speech Monday to Lowcountry Republicans at the outset of a campaign swing through South Carolina."}, "article_summary": "The National Labor Relations Board, Federal Communications Commission and Environmental Protection Agency are examples of a federal bureaucracy that is unaccountable to the people, she said.\nMOUNT PLEASANT \u2014 Presidential candidate Carly Fiorina lambasted the federal bureaucracy, Obamacare and the response to terror attacks during a speech Monday to Lowcountry Republicans at the outset of a campaign swing through South Carolina.\nThe IRS enforces a 73,000-page tax code that Fiorina, a former CEO of computer giant Hewlett-Packard, said should be simplified to three pages.\nI think it is time to take our country back,\u201d she said, adding that the federal bureaucracy has become an obstacle to the nation realizing its potential.\n\u201cWe are no longer a nation of laws,\u201d Fiorina said."}
