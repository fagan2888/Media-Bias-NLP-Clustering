Over the same period, California\u0092s population increased by 22.0 percent.\n\nHowever, after subtracting residents, fellows, physicians who provide care less than 20 hours a week and others, the number of doctors actively providing patient care in 2013 was 71,538, it says.\n\nThe federal government recommends 60-80 doctors per 100,000 residents and 85-100 specialists per 100,000 residents. Overall, California in 2011 had 64 physicians per 100,000 residents and 130 specialists per 100,000 residents \u0096 above the recommended ratios.\n\nBut not in parts of the Central Valley, where the ratios fell well below recommended levels.\n\nIn the San Joaquin Valley, the physician ratio was 48 per 100,000 residents, and the specialist ratio was 80 per 100,000 residents.\n\nContrasts that to the wealthier greater San Francisco Bay Area, where the ratios were 86 doctors per 100,000 people and 175 specialists per 100,000 people.\n\nThe supply-demand balance is expected to become an increasing problem, the report says. Demand will increase as the population gets older and more people obtain insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSupply will shrink as more California doctors get closer to retirement, says the report. California has the nation\u0092s second-oldest physician workforce, with 32 percent older than 60.
