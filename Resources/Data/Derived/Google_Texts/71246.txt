On today's Your Call, it’s our Friday media roundtable. This week, we’ll discuss the media coverage of the Affordable Care Act. As soon as the government shut down ended, the media’s attention tuned back to the rollout of the healthcare law and the website glitches. How are the media shaping the public perception about healthcare and the law? We’ll be joined by Columbia Journalism Review’s Trudy Lieberman and Propublica’s Charles Ornstein. Join the conversation and call in with your questions on the next Your Call, with Holly Kernan and you.

Guests:

Trudy Lieberman, contributing editor to the Columbia Journalism Review where she critiques press coverage of health care.

Charles Ornstein, senior reporter with ProPublica. He is board president of the Association of Health Care Journalists.
