Speaking at the Western Conservative Summit in Colorado, Palin said \u201cconsidering articles of impeachment is the check\u201d against a lawless executive branch.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nCiting Obama\u2019s \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d in enforcing the country\u2019s immigration laws and securing the border, Palin said, \u201cif that\u2019s not impeachable, then nothing is. And if he\u2019s not impeachable, no one is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt takes guts to hold them accountable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes political will.\u201d\n\nPalin told Republicans to \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid to raise\u201d the impeachment issue because Obama is making \u201chimself a ruler and not a president.\u201d Palin said America had a revolution because \u201cwe don\u2019t do kings.\u201d\n\nShe observed that \u201cthese days you hear a lot of politicians denouncing Barack Obama,\u201d saying he\u2019s a lawless and imperial president who ignores court orders, changes laws by executive fiat, and refuses to enforce laws that he just doesn\u2019t like. Palin asked the politicians who are complaining, \u201cwhat are ya gonna do about it?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s call their bluff,\u201d Palin said. \u201cI\u2019m calling their bluff because we need a little less talk and a lot more action.\u201d\n\nDeclaring that Obama\u2019s lawlessness is \u201crocking us to our core,\u201d Palin said that \u201cno serious person can deny that team Obama has not violated and abused the public trust and the Constitution.\u201d Palin listed Benghazi, Fast and Furious, NSA spying scandals, Obamacare lies, the IRS\u2019s targeting of conservatives, the administration\u2019s violation of religious rights, and the Department of Justice\u2019s wiretapping of reporters.\n\n\u201cThe list of abuses goes on and on,\u201d she said.\n\nPalin also mentioned that \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d does not refer to today\u2019s ordinary criminal charges. She reiterated that the Framers referred to \u201ca dereliction of duty,\u201d and \u201cthe first duty of the president is to enforce our laws and preserve and protect and defend our Constitution.\u201d She said Alexander Hamilton said impeachable offenses refer to \u201cthe abuse or violation of some public trust.\u201d Hamilton called them \u201cpolitical offenses\u201d because they relate \u201cchiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself,\u201d Palin said, noting that impeachment is a check against a lawless executive.\n\nPalin announced in an op-ed on Breitbart.com that Obama\u2019s \u201cmany impeachable offenses\u201d can no longer be ignored.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to impeach; and on behalf of American workers and legal immigrants of all backgrounds, we should vehemently oppose any politician on the left or right who would hesitate in voting for articles of impeachment,\u201d Palin wrote.\n\nAs Breitbart News noted, \u201cPalin specifically said Obama\u2019s lawlessness on illegal immigration was the tipping point because it impacted Americans \u2014 native-born and legal immigrants \u2014 of all backgrounds\u201d:\n\nThe federal government is trillions of dollars in debt; many cities are on the verge of insolvency; our overrun healthcare system, police forces, social services, schools, and our unsustainably generous welfare-state programs are stretched to the max. We average Americans know that. So why has this issue been allowed to be turned upside down with our \u201cleader\u201d creating such unsafe conditions while at the same time obstructing any economic recovery by creating more dependents than he allows producers? His friendly wealthy bipartisan elite, who want cheap foreign labor and can afford for themselves the best \u201cborder security\u201d money can buy in their own exclusive communities, do not care that Obama tapped us out. Have faith that average American workers \u2013 native-born and wonderful legal immigrants of all races, backgrounds, and political parties \u2013 do care because we\u2019re the ones getting screwed as we\u2019re forced to follow all our government\u2019s rules while others are not required to do so. Many now feel like strangers in their own land. It\u2019s the American worker who is forced to deal with Obama\u2019s latest crisis with our hard-earned tax dollars while middle class wages decrease, sustainable jobs get more scarce, and communities become unrecognizable and bankrupted due to Obama\u2019s flood of illegal immigration. Who\u2019s looking out for the American workers? Who has their backs? Who fights for them? We should.\n\nObama has also been reportedly concerned that his executive actions on immigration can lead to impeachment. He reportedly, in a half-joking manner, told pro-amnesty activists at the White House, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get me impeached, are you?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Saturday, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin said the impeachment threat is making a lawless President Barack Obama a bit", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "On Saturday, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin said the impeachment threat is making a lawless President Barack Obama a bit", "title": "Sarah Palin: Impeachment Threat Making Obama 'Nervous' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Palin/palin.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/07/19/sarah-palin-impeachment-threat-making-obama-nervous/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Saturday, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin said the impeachment threat is making a lawless President Barack Obama a bit", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Palin/palin.jpg", "title": "Sarah Palin: Impeachment Threat Making Obama 'Nervous' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Benghazi, Sarah Palin, White House,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-07-19T18:35:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Speaking at the Western Conservative Summit in Colorado, Palin said \u201cconsidering articles of impeachment is the check\u201d against a lawless executive branch.\nObama has also been reportedly concerned that his executive actions on immigration can lead to impeachment.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCiting Obama\u2019s \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d in enforcing the country\u2019s immigration laws and securing the border, Palin said, \u201cif that\u2019s not impeachable, then nothing is.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Saturday, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin said the impeachment threat is making a lawless President Barack Obama a bit \u201cnervous.\u201dA week after Palin called for Obama to be impeached over his lawlessness on immigration on the pages of Breitbart News, two-thirds of Republicans believed that impeachment is justified while a majority of independents felt that Obama has overstepped his Constitutional authority.\nPalin announced in an op-ed on Breitbart.com that Obama\u2019s \u201cmany impeachable offenses\u201d can no longer be ignored."}
