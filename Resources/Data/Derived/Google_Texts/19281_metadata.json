What would life be like without the delight of finding that perfect interaction for the right problem, or the high of shipping new stuff to the world? But then I realized that I was facing the ultimate design challenge: Designing a design team.\n\nDesign is a way of thinking. It\u2019s a process for solving problems. And these same concepts apply to the art of building your team.\n\nIdentify your ideal outcome\n\nTo create something of meaning, you must first define the opportunity.\n\nI asked my team to think about a time when they felt like they were doing their best work. What problems were they working on? Who were they working with? What helped them ship work they were proud of? We shared our stories and wrote down the common themes: Purpose, Humility, Trust, Unity, Autonomy, Humor, Openness, Creative Space, Diversity, Passion, Camaraderie and Play.\n\nWork collaboratively with your team to establish the core ideas you\u2019ll use to inform the future design of the team.\n\nStart with empathy\n\nDesign thinking is anchored around the idea of human empathy. It\u2019s about observing behavior, understanding unmet needs, and turning these insights into something that will help people achieve what they couldn\u2019t previously. Helping designers do their best work also starts with empathy and understanding.\n\nMia Blume\n\nDig deep to unearth what motivates each of your designers. Don\u2019t just help them find projects they work on, but really try to understand what makes them tick. (Hint: It isn\u2019t always the same thing!)\n\nFor example, one of my designers, is passionate about travel and foreign languages. So when we decided to launch Place Pins, it made sense to put him on the project. He took a vacation to Japan and used the product to plan, document and share his journey. He was able to incorporate his personal interests into making the product better \u2014 a win for all of us.\n\nAsk yourself and your team: What drives them to do great work? Are they motivated by solving hard problems? Shipping quality work? Some other kind of reward?\n\nDesign (for relationships)\n\nSome of the best products in the world help people connect, interact and learn from others. The best teams do, too. For instance, the more time designers spend with other designers, the better their work gets. Creating an environment that helps your designers collaborate, learn and ship their highest quality work is worth investing in from the start.\n\nCreate moments for inspiration and learning. Cultivate a creative community that makes it easy and comfortable for everyone to participate.\n\nLast year at Pinterest, I kicked off a fun program called Studio Nights. Pinterest employees have a lot of interesting hobbies. Why not create a moment to celebrate and share their interests? The aim was to unlock the creativity across the entire organization by encouraging people to teach short classes about their skills or passions. We\u2019ve had a variety of classes \u2014 building terrariums, making sushi, learning Photoshop, beekeeping \u2014 that exposed the talent and creativity of everyone that works at Pinterest.\n\nIdentify things that keep your team inspired and immersed in their craft, and then run with it.\n\nDevelop a culture of critique. Many creatives are familiar with critique, particularly if they went to art school. But it can be uncomfortable for some at first, so take heed.\n\n- Establish a regular cadence for formal critique.\n\n- Encourage your designers to own the responsibility of collecting feedback.\n\n- Keep the group small and focused.\n\n- Frame the goal of the work or the critique clearly at the beginning.\n\n- Facilitate constructive dialogue and critique.\n\n- Remove the person from the critique by using pronouns that focus on the work.\n\nPlay matchmaker. Take the time to observe where there\u2019s natural synergy and where there isn\u2019t. What types of relationships energize or deplete each individual?\n\nOnce you know what magnifies an individual\u2019s creativity or output, try sparking new relationships that provide opportunities for growth. Pair an experienced designer with a new grad. Or put someone who\u2019s strong on visuals with more of a system thinker.\n\nMia Blume\n\nMake room for collaboration and spontaneity.\n\nA sea of desks usually isn\u2019t suited for sharing and collectively creating. Instead create an environment that\u2019s comfortable, vibrant and reflects the values of the company. Give them places to go for hours of uninterrupted focus and different places for stimulating social time.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to hire someone to do it for you, just use your creativity. You\u2019d be surprised what a great couch, a few pillows and music can do.\n\nGather feedback\n\nThe best product development teams create feedback loops that help them rapidly experiment with new features and functionality. The same is true for your team.\n\nCreate regular feedback loops that help you gather input on how to improve both the work and the team environment. Personally, I prefer one-on-one time with each designer. Whether it\u2019s grabbing coffee or going for a walk, it provides an opportunity to check in on how things are going for both of us. Team debriefs can also be a really useful tool if you conduct them every few months or after significant shifts in the way you work.\n\nIterate. And then iterate again.\n\nDesigning a team is an ongoing project. And crafting an environment that nurtures and inspires your most talented creatives to ship their best work is a design challenge worth taking on. Don\u2019t be afraid to take risks and experiment, because the best solutions are the ones designed to fit your team and your culture the best.\n\nMs.Blume is a Product Design Manager at Pinterest.
