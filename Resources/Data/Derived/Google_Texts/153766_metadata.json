The sales tax on soft drinks is estimated to generate $7.9 million annually.\n\nOne especially unpopular provision in the new law is customers who use food stamps are exempt from the sales tax on soft drinks. Critics say the exemption for those who use food stamps removes the incentive to make healthier beverage choices, which the tax\u2019s proponents argued was the primary benefit of the soft drink tax.\n\nSoda Tax is a Money Grab\n\nThis measure is clearly nothing more than another tax grab in the guise of government discouraging use of a disfavored food product, says Dr. Gilbert Ross, executive director of the American Council on Science and Health.\n\n\u201cLook, if they\u2019re going to tax sugary sodas as well as nonalcoholic drinks with either natural or artificial sweeteners, then clearly the intent of the law is not to combat obesity, as artificial sweeteners have zero to do with promoting obesity,\u201d Ross said\n\nEven taxing actual sugary beverages does nothing to combat obesity, no matter what the sponsors of such laws say, Ross says. In addition to being a tax grab, the law will turn out to be a bureaucratic nightmare for many storeowners and shopkeepers in Vermont, he says.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for them,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThey should make their feelings known to the misguided lawmakers who instituted this inane measure.\u201d\n\nCompliance Nightmare Seen\n\nAnother big problem with this tax is it applies to everything with sugar or sweetener in it, making it difficult for small businessmen to comply with, says Seton Motley, president of the public policy organization Less Government.\n\n\u201cFor Vermont\u2019s legislators to come up with this tax on sodas is laughable and proves they don\u2019t have enough experience to even run a lemonade stand,\u201d Motley said.\n\n\u2018Will Do Nothing to Ease Obesity\u2019\n\nIn an attempt to punish soda drinkers, the government ends up punishing small-business owners and retailers, says Julie Kelly, a food writer and policy advisor to The Heartland Institute, which publishes Health Care News.\n\n\u201cOne can only imagine the amount of time used to research, debate, lobby, and implement this law that will do nothing to ease obesity or the state\u2019s budget gap,\u201d Kelly said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always funny to read how state legislators, whose lack of fiscal discipline has basically bankrupted their state government, like to \u2018tsk-tsk\u2019 people about \u2018bad\u2019 habits,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cDumb laws like this might make them feel better, but they\u2019re totally ineffective at accomplishing anything but frustrating consumers and business owners.\u201d\n\nSean Parnell (sean@impactpolicymanagment.com) is a policy advisor to The Heartland Institute and president of Impact Policy Management, LLC.\n\nInternet Info:\n\nJeff Reynolds, \u201cBerkeley Soda Tax Gives Government Revenue a Sugar High,\u201d Health Care News, July 13, 2015: http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2015/07/13/erkeley-soda-tax-gives-government-revenue-sugar-high\n\nGene Koprowski, \u201c\u2018Soda Tax\u2019 Plan Fizzling Out in Vermont,\u201d Somewhat Reasonable, April 16, 2015: http://blog.heartland.org/2015/04/soda-tax-plan-fizzling-out-in-vermont/", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Vermont residents now have to pay 6 percent more for soft drinks under a new sales tax that began in July.\nThe sales tax on soft drinks is estimated to generate $7.9 million annually.\nOne especially unpopular provision in the new law is customers who use food stamps are exempt from the sales tax on soft drinks.\nInternet Info:Jeff Reynolds, \u201cBerkeley Soda Tax Gives Government Revenue a Sugar High,\u201d Health Care News, July 13, 2015: http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2015/07/13/erkeley-soda-tax-gives-government-revenue-sugar-highGene Koprowski, \u201c\u2018Soda Tax\u2019 Plan Fizzling Out in Vermont,\u201d Somewhat Reasonable, April 16, 2015: http://blog.heartland.org/2015/04/soda-tax-plan-fizzling-out-in-vermont/\nThe tax is part of a $30 million package of tax increases intended to help close a $113 million gap between projected state spending and revenue."}
