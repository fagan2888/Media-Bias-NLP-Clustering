He followed that with another win two years later.\n\nSorlie said he's been working with dogs for 50 years, and \"everything has an end.\"\n\nAnother factor in his decision is the high costs involved with getting his team, including his 16 dogs and human handlers, to Alaska from Norway. Then there's the added costs of caring for everyone while in Alaska, including getting food dropped at checkpoints along the Iditarod trail for both him and the dogs.\n\n\"It costs a lot of money to get here, a lot of money,\" Sorlie said. \"It's difficult for me to raise all this money every year.\"\n\nHe estimated it costs him about $60,000 to run the race. By comparison, last year's champion, Dallas Seavey, netted about $70,000 and a new truck for winning the race.\n\nSorlie said he would still compete in races in Norway, and he'll likely be back as a spectator for the Iditarod.\n\nWith his championship in 2003, Sorlie also became the second non-Alaskan to win the Iditarod with five-time champion Doug Swingley of Lincoln, Mont. Martin Buser, a native of Switzerland who has lived in Alaska more than 30 years, became a U.S. citizen after winning his fourth Iditarod in 2002.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AP NewsBreak: 2-time Iditarod champ says '16 likely his last - AP News: BIG LAKE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Citing his age and the .05/27/2016 5:40:01AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "BIG LAKE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Citing his age and the costs associated with the race,", "title": "AP News - AP NewsBreak: 2-time Iditarod champ says '16 likely his last", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/us/2016/02/26/ap-newsbreak-2time-iditarod-champ-says-16-likely-his-last-n2125574", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\57\\55b261bf-ceba-47b1-b80d-1dc59db614c2.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "BIG LAKE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Citing his age and the costs associated with the race,", "title": "AP News - AP NewsBreak: 2-time Iditarod champ says '16 likely his last", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/us/2016/02/26/ap-newsbreak-2time-iditarod-champ-says-16-likely-his-last-n2125574", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/57/55b261bf-ceba-47b1-b80d-1dc59db614c2.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "AP NewsBreak: 2-time Iditarod champ says '16 likely his last, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\"It costs a lot of money to get here, a lot of money,\" Sorlie said.\nSorlie said he would still compete in races in Norway, and he'll likely be back as a spectator for the Iditarod.\nWith his championship in 2003, Sorlie also became the second non-Alaskan to win the Iditarod with five-time champion Doug Swingley of Lincoln, Mont.\nAnother factor in his decision is the high costs involved with getting his team, including his 16 dogs and human handlers, to Alaska from Norway.\nMartin Buser, a native of Switzerland who has lived in Alaska more than 30 years, became a U.S. citizen after winning his fourth Iditarod in 2002."}
