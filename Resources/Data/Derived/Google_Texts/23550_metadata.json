But if they are paying for it, they might opt for an urgent care clinic instead of a hospital emergency room.\n\nIn practice, consumers aren\u2019t getting the right signals. Some of them are avoiding doctors, skipping medications and setting themselves up for much bigger and more expensive health issues in the future.\n\nDr. Eric Bricker, chief medical officer of Compass Professional Health Services in Dallas, says these plans are fumbling because they don\u2019t have the incentives right.\n\n\u201cMisaligned incentives, historically, have been the Achilles\u2019 heel of health care,\u201d Bricker said.\n\nSkipping medications is particularly worrisome. A new paper by a team of physicians and economists for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that employees with high-deductible plans covering pharmaceuticals responded by taking less of the daily medicines needed to control high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\nThese are chronic conditions that, left untreated, can lead to heart attacks, strokes, blindness and other maladies. The drugs available to treat them, even in cheaper generic forms, are generally effective in keeping the diseases under control.\n\nConsumer behavior\n\nPeter Huckfeldt of the University of Minnesota\u2019s School of Public Health was the lead author of the new paper. He looked at two big firms of more than 1,000 employees each to see how new high-deductible plans affected consumer behavior.\n\nPeople responded by moving to cheaper generic drugs and stockpiling drug purchases once their deductibles had been met. But the largest change in behavior was taking less medicine.\n\nNinety percent of those taking cholesterol drugs curbed use to save money; 93 percent of the high-blood-pressure consumers did as well. With diabetes, it was 58 percent.\n\n\u201cHigh costs for drugs that control chronic diseases may be a disincentive to use them, and may not be a good thing,\u201d Huckfeldt said.\n\nIn high-deductible health plans, the first dollars spent on health care are the consumer\u2019s dollars. Amounts vary, but a high-deductible policy covering an individual generally starts at $1,300. A high-deductible family policy usually starts at $2,600.\n\nThese starting points are set under laws that allow consumers to set money aside in a tax-free savings account to pay for medical care. Many employers who offer high-deductible insurance policies put some of their own money into these accounts.\n\nThe employees studied by Huckfeldt\u2019s group had access to these savings accounts and used them. But it wasn\u2019t enough to keep them from shortchanging their own health.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nJohn Goodman, a Dallas health economist, is generally credited with inventing the health savings account that is paired with high-deductible health plans. He\u2019s dismayed with how high-deductible plans are causing people to skip care.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is terrible,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cFor young healthy people with limited incomes, having $5,000 or $6,000 deductible plans is little better than having no insurance at all. \u2026 And in some cases, insurers are forcing people with expensive-to-treat problems to pay thousands of dollars for their drugs.\u201d\n\nGoodman blames the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirements that every health insurance policy cover a minimum set of health issues, ranging from hospitalization to pregnancy care to mental health. That drives up insurance costs. He also blames insurers for using high drug deductibles to weed out people with chronic conditions while attracting healthier people.\n\nGoodman notes that individual insurance plans offered through public exchanges under the Affordable Care Act don\u2019t offer those tax-free health savings accounts that are more common in employer-sponsored insurance.\n\nBricker, Huckfeldt and Goodman all agree that high-deductible insurance policies have to get the incentives right to be successful.\n\nGetting consumers to take their medications \u2014 an issue known as medication adherence \u2014 is difficult even without raising their cost.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a lower cost for adherence,\u201d Bricker said. \u201cYou need to offer lower premiums, or gift cards and the like, for people to take their medicine.\u201d\n\nFollow Jim Landers on Twitter at @landersjim.", "article_metadata": {"description": "High deductibles are pushing consumers toward skipping medication, setting up more expensive health issues in the future.", "og": {"description": "High deductibles are pushing consumers toward skipping medication, setting up more expensive health issues in the future.", "title": "High-deductible plans shortchanging health", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20150216-high-deductible-plans-shortchanging-health.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-02-17T02:58:36Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-02-17T02:56:27Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"High-deductible plans shortchanging health\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20150216-high-deductible-plans-shortchanging-health.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2183176\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-02-17T02:56:27Z\", \"section\": \"Jim Landers\", \"author\": \"Jim Landers\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-02-17T02:56:27Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "John Goodman, a Dallas health economist, is generally credited with inventing the health savings account that is paired with high-deductible health plans.\nIn high-deductible health plans, the first dollars spent on health care are the consumer\u2019s dollars.\nHe looked at two big firms of more than 1,000 employees each to see how new high-deductible plans affected consumer behavior.\nBricker, Huckfeldt and Goodman all agree that high-deductible insurance policies have to get the incentives right to be successful.\n\u201cMisaligned incentives, historically, have been the Achilles\u2019 heel of health care,\u201d Bricker said."}
