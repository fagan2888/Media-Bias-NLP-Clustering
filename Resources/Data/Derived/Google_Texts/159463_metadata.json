We\u2019re one big happy family.\u201d\n\nHe makes at least one video a week, but sometimes can produce up to four a day, depending on how much free time he has. The videos range from 45 seconds to around two to three minutes in length.\n\nSometimes he will give an update on construction, other times he talks about the \u201cThirsty Thursdays\u201d and live music Lupita\u2019s hosts every week.\n\n\u201cI turned it around for Lupita\u2019s because with my videos, I started to ask for help and people actually listened,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, Munoz has a \u201cFernieVision\u201d Facebook and Twitter account, along with his YouTube page. He said some of his videos have gotten more than 80 shares on social media, which he said helps get the word out about the restaurant and other downtown businesses. He said he has had customers come from Elwood and St. Joseph, Mo., just because they saw his videos.\n\n\u201cI never planned for it to blow up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know what? I\u2019m very grateful because this is family-owned and family-operated and we did need help. I was being sincere in my videos. Not only does Lupita\u2019s need help, downtown needs help in this construction. There\u2019s shops talking about closing.\u201d\n\nOther downtown businesses have gotten more customers because Munoz has mentioned them in his videos or on Facebook posts.\n\n\u201cEverywhere I go, I like to give support,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, these places are important.\u201d\n\nSome of the videos include Spanish translations for Munoz\u2019s family and friends in Mexico, because he said they want to know about the updates with the restaurant.\n\nHe said he has never used a script for his videos, which he thinks makes them more personal.\n\nNow that the videos have grown in popularity, Munoz said it has become more neve-wracking to film them.\n\n\u201cI am very nervous now,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause before, it was just me being silly. Now, I feel like I have a level set that I have to reach. That\u2019s kind of why I\u2019ve had less videos the last few days. But, I\u2019m working on that.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he said making the videos are fun, even with the popularity.\n\n\u201cI always have fun, that\u2019s one thing I love to do,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Food, Local, Ellen Fike", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "\"Orale (Spanish for \"what's up?\"), homies,\" is how every \"FernieVision\" video begins.", "title": "Lupita's co-operator helps local businesses with 'FernieVision'", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2014-08-17/lupitas-co-operator-helps-local-businesses-fernievision", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/13617740.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "\u201cOrale (Spanish for \u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d), homies,\u201d is how every \u201cFernieVision\u201d video begins.Luis Fernando \u201cFernie\u201d Munoz, co-operator of Lupita\u2019s Mexican Restaurant, has been making short videos every week to give Kansas Avenue construction updates and remind people to check out the downtown businesses who are struggling to bring in customers.\u201cIt started out with crazy weather reports,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cAnd people liked my weather reports so much that they started liking them and requesting them.\u201d"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThen when the constuction started, that\u2019s when I kind of blew it up,\u201d he said.\nNot only does Lupita\u2019s need help, downtown needs help in this construction.\nThere\u2019s shops talking about closing.\u201dOther downtown businesses have gotten more customers because Munoz has mentioned them in his videos or on Facebook posts.\nHe said some of his videos have gotten more than 80 shares on social media, which he said helps get the word out about the restaurant and other downtown businesses.\n\u201cI turned it around for Lupita\u2019s because with my videos, I started to ask for help and people actually listened,\u201d he said."}
