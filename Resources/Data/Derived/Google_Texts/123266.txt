School will be back in session before you know it, meaning if parents have a young athlete in their life, it's time to get them in for a sports physical. Doctor Kevin Dahlman with Aurora Medical Center joined us live on the CBS 58 News at 4 to tell parents why sports physicals are required by the WIAA, what doctors look for in a sports physical, and what parents should know before they take their kids.

One of the benefits Dr. Dahlman noted about sports physicals is that young athletes get an education in the doctor's office. "We can teach them the importance of what to watch for when they get a head injury. Is it a concussion? When to seek medical care," Dahlman said.

Dr. Dahlman noted that under the Affordable Care Act, the cost of sports physicals are covered without a co-pay. He also said that parents should note "any change in family history" and have that information ready for the doctor.
