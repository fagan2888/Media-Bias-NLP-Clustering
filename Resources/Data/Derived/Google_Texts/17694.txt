The U.S. State Department warned Russia on Friday that its sending tanks and other heavy artillery to pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine is “unacceptable” and that there would be “additional costs” for the move.

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters that video posted online showed Russian tanks departing a site in southwest Russia and moving through multiple cities in east Ukraine. A convoy of three T-64 tanks, several MB-21 or “Grad” multiple rocket launchers and other military vehicles had crossed the border in the last three days.

“Russia will claim these tanks were taken from Ukrainian forces, but no Ukrainian tank unit has been operating in that area,” Harf said. “We are confident that these tanks came from Russia.”

“This is unacceptable,” Harf said. “A failure by Russia to de-escalate the situation will lead to additional costs.”

Harf added that newly-elected Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko had spoken to Russian president Vladimir Putin, and Secretary of State John Kerry had spoken to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, about the matter.
