Currently, there are over 1,600 people on the waiting list for lung transplants, and often the organs arrive too late. \u201cThe most exciting part is to shorten the time people have to wait for an organ transplant,\u201d Dr. Joaquin Cortiella, an author of the study, told ABC Local.\n\nLung transplants are one of the most risky and dangerous procedures, and though survival rates one year after the transplant are typically high \u2014 up to 90 or 94 percent \u2014 five years after transplants, the survival rate drops significantly. Chronic rejection is the source of complications for many patients five years after transplants, which causes lung airways to deteriorate; doctors are still struggling to prevent that.\n\n\u201cI started doing (lung transplants) in the early 90\u2019s, and it was really primitive then, and it\u2019s gotten a lot better,\u201d Dr. David Weill, director of Stanford\u2019s Center for Advanced Lung Disease, told the SF Gate. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t solved the mystery of that slow loss of lung function.\u201d Because lungs are always exposed to the outside environment through every breath of air, lung transplants are known to be extremely difficult due to the constant risk of infection. Meanwhile, lungs are also difficult to harvest for transplantation because they are vulnerable and easily damaged.\n\nThrough the use of pluripotent stem cells, scientists have, for years, been working on growing tissue and organs in the lab in hopes of speeding up and improving the transplant process. They have managed to grow hearts, a trachea, bones, and livers through stem cells, though growing lungs have remained difficult.\n\nAt UTMB, the scientists first took a damaged lung, and removed all the cells from it in a process called decellularization. Decellularization is a technique that was used to create implantable liver grafts for rats, for example. The UTMB scientists \u201cjust left the skeleton of the lung, or the scaffold, behind \u2014 the pieces of the lungs that are no cells,\u201d Dr. Joan Nichols, the lead author of the study, told ABC Local. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so white and pretty and there\u2019s no blood in it, it\u2019s very pretty looking. And then we added back cells from another lung that couldn\u2019t be used for transplant but still had some viable cells in it.\u201d\n\nA medical student, Michael Riddle, assisted by building equipment to improve the process. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who went home and actually built using \u2014 I\u2019m not kidding \u2014 a fish tank that he went and bought from a pet store, is what he built the first piece of equipment [from],\u201d Nichols said. Before the use of the new equipment, it took about four months to remove all the cells from the lung, whereas after Riddle\u2019s innovation, it only took about three days.\n\nThe scientists note that there is still quite a way to go before lab-grown lungs will be safe for human transplants. It may take up to 5 or 10 years before the first lungs may be transplanted, the scientists said. However, they are planning on transplanting the first lab-grown lungs within animals in the next year or two.\n\n\"It's taken us a year to prove to ourselves that we actually did a good job with it. You don't run out immediately and tell the world you have something wonderful until you've proved it to ourselves that we really did something amazing,\" Dr. Nichols said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lung grown in lab, utmb scientists, stem cells, organ transplants, lung transplants", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch have managed to grow a lung in the lab within three days, with the hopes of improving the transplantation process.", "title": "Human Lungs Grown In 3 Days; May Shorten Transplant Waiting Time", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/human-lungs-grown-3-days-may-shorten-transplant-waiting-time-269313", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/14/lungs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch have managed to grow a lung in the lab within three days, with the hopes of improving the transplantation process.", "title": "Human Lungs Grown In 3 Days; May Shorten Transplant Waiting Time", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/human-lungs-grown-3-days-may-shorten-transplant-waiting-time-269313", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/14/lungs.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/14/lungs.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-02-14T13:47:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-14T13:46:59-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch have managed to grow a lung in the lab within three days, with the hopes of improving the transplantation process."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde2fc\"", "article_summary": "Currently, there are over 1,600 people on the waiting list for lung transplants, and often the organs arrive too late.\n\u201cThe most exciting part is to shorten the time people have to wait for an organ transplant,\u201d Dr. Joaquin Cortiella, an author of the study, told ABC Local.\nThe scientists note that there is still quite a way to go before lab-grown lungs will be safe for human transplants.\nThrough the use of pluripotent stem cells, scientists have, for years, been working on growing tissue and organs in the lab in hopes of speeding up and improving the transplant process.\nThey have managed to grow hearts, a trachea, bones, and livers through stem cells, though growing lungs have remained difficult."}
