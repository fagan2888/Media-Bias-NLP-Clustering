Chuck Hufstetler (R- Rome) was awarded the Healthcare Access Champion at Georgia Watch\u2019s 2014 Consumer Champion Gala on Thursday, September 18th.\n\nWhile an opponent of the Affordable Care Act, Sen. Hufstetler nonetheless, supported studying Medicaid expansion in Georgia.\n\n\"Sending our tax dollars to other states is not in the best interest of Georgia,\u201d stated Sen. Hufstetler. \u201cThe true conservative approach is to treat issues such as diabetes and hypertension upstream where the cost is pennies on the dollar. States such as Arkansas and Kentucky have cut their uninsured population almost in half and also improved the overall health of their citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeorgia Watch is proud to recognize these four Consumer Champions for standing up for the interests of Georgia consumers and to help protect their legal rights,\u201d said acting Georgia Watch Executive Director Liz Coyle. Three additional Georgia legislators were recognized for their efforts during the legislative session.\n\nThe awards were presented at Georgia Watch\u2019s annual gala by nationally syndicated consumer expert and board member, Clark Howard.\n\nFounded in 2002, Georgia Watch is a statewide consumer advocacy organization working to empower and protect Georgia consumers on matters that impact their wallets and quality of life.
