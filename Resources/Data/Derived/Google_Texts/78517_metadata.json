It\u2019s not just some clever craftsmanship, although creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould\u2014also of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d\u2014 show off their technical abilities with every scene of their current show. It\u2019s an image that encapsulates the tragedy of \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d\u2019s protagonist, Jimmy McGill, played with virtuoso skill by Bob Odenkirk\u2014and, by extension, the theme of this drama, which is arcing toward not just \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d but a dim, black-and-white future beyond that.\n\nThe image is one of fear. In the first episode of this season, Jimmy\u2014who eventually cycles through the name Saul, before landing on Gene\u2014gets locked inside the trash room of the mall he works at. He reaches for the emergency exit to let himself out, and hesitates, hovering at the threshold, reading the torn printout taped to the door. The door is alarmed, it informs him; the police will be notified. He wavers for a moment more, and then turns, decisively, to walk in the other direction. A choice is offered, and he takes the other way; it is the Omaha-mall version of Robert Frost\u2019s two diverging roads in the woods.\n\nIn the season\u2019s third episode, Jimmy\u2014now, still Jimmy, before any other identities floated his way\u2014is faced with a similar choice. This season, as a well-heeled associate at an upscale law firm, Jimmy is trying to get by legitimately, for once. But he can\u2019t stop himself from rule-breaking and smooth-talking, driven by an unnamed desire to break bad, as the series\u2019 sequel would term it. In \u201cAmarillo,\u201d he\u2019s holding a proposed commercial he taped with a budget of $647, waiting outside the office of his boss, Cliff Main (Ed Begley Jr.), deciding whether he should go in and ask for approval. He tries to push himself across the threshold, and fails. He tries again. And when it doesn\u2019t work, he decisively turns around and goes back in the direction he came in, to take the completely different tack of running the ad without Cliff\u2019s permission.\n\nThe scenes intentionally mirror each other. Each shows Jimmy/Gene at the edge of an irrevocable decision, hovering on the edge of a law-abiding, rules-following life, and then turning one way or the other. But in both\u2014portrayed magnificently by Odenkirk\u2014the primary emotion is fear.\n\nThere are many ways in which Jimmy McGill\u2019s story in \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d is a lot like those antiheroes who created the landscape of prestige television. Like them, he\u2019s a troublemaker; like them, he\u2019s strangely lovable, anyway. Like \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cMad Men,\u201d \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d is about watching a flawed man do flawed things and hurt the people around him, but it\u2019s also about how struggling for one\u2019s humanity is a central part of living, as any person.\n\nAnd yet what Jimmy McGill isn\u2019t, and really never could be, is \u201ccool.\u201d Or badass, or suave, or powerfully icy. In conflict situations, Jimmy is hysterically nonconfrontational\u2014both in \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d He\u2019s definitely a talker\u2014smoothly articulate through both lies and tears, charming the pants off of old ladies at bingo and snotty stockbrokers at hotel bars. But his trickery is a compensation for the fundamental fact of Jimmy, which is that he is a coward. An earnest one; an emotionally authentic one. But not a risk-taker, not a game-changer. Just a guy.\n\nThe driving fear at the heart of Jimmy McGill is what has made \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d such a captivating and fundamental counterweight to \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d the AMC show that \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d is built off of. Pointing to the tone and the pacing, New York magazine\u2019s Matt Zoller Seitz argued that \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d is the anti-\u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d and I\u2019m inclined to agree. But it\u2019s more than just tone for me. It\u2019s that Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is a bold man who dies, while Jimmy is a craven one who lives. He is the cockroach of this universe; above all else, the shell of a man once known as Jimmy McGill always survives.\n\nOne of \u201cBreaking Bad\u2019s\u201d most famous lines is in a scene where Walter, shuddering with rage, tells his wife, Skyler (Anna Gunn), that she does not need to fear that he is in danger, because when a door opens and someone is there with a gun, \u201cI am the one who knocks.\u201d Doors, and thresholds, have significance for Gilligan and Gould; the Season 3 finale, for example, has Gale killed after answering his door. It\u2019s telling, I think, that Jimmy\u2019s recurring motif is one of hesitation at doors, instead of knocking, like Walter, or opening, like Gale. Walter White is the one who knocks; Jimmy McGill walks in the other direction.\n\nThe antihero drama is one that went from an isolated occurrence on a few risk-taking networks to become a symbol of a high-quality wave of television shows and then the embodiment of frustratingly derivative network imitations. Now that we appear to have gotten it out of our collective system, \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d appears to have shown up just to show us how silly the discussion was. The show\u2019s Jimmy is a much-needed note of dissonance: the actually pathetic antihero. Not the alpha male that made some bad decisions, but the omega male, the one the alpha male beats up to prove a point. Jimmy/Saul/Gene is not in the same hierarchy of dominance as the big dogs jockeying for power\u2014Walter and Gus (Giancarlo Esposito); he\u2019s not even one of the beta males, the willing sidekicks, like Jesse (Aaron Paul) and Gale (David Costabile), the ones who end up dead or damaged. Jimmy is a bottom-feeder. \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d especially in this brilliant second season, has made us love him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jimmy McGill is different\u2014his tale begins and ends not with a bang, like Walter White or Tony Soprano\u2014but a whimper", "title": "The best antihero now isn\u2019t a badass: \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d is the brilliant, pathetic counterpart to prestige TV\u2019s bold angry men", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Jimmy McGill is different\u2014his tale begins and ends not with a bang, like Walter White or Tony Soprano\u2014but a whimper", "title": "The best antihero now isn\u2019t a badass: \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d is the brilliant, pathetic counterpart to prestige TV\u2019s bold angry men", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/20/the_best_antihero_now_isnt_a_badass_better_call_saul_is_the_brilliant_pathetic_counterpart_to_prestige_tvs_bold_angry_men/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/white_saul_soprano.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jimmy McGill is different\u2014his tale begins and ends not with a bang, like Walter White or Tony Soprano\u2014but a whimper", "title": "The best antihero now isn\u2019t a badass: \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d is the brilliant, pathetic counterpart to prestige TV\u2019s bold angry men", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/white_saul_soprano.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, better call saul, bob odenkirk, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Sopranos, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And yet what Jimmy McGill isn\u2019t, and really never could be, is \u201ccool.\u201d Or badass, or suave, or powerfully icy.\nTopics: better call saul, bob odenkirk, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Sopranos, TV, Entertainment NewsIn this season of \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d AMC\u2019s prequel series to \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d a specific image has become motif.\nHe is the cockroach of this universe; above all else, the shell of a man once known as Jimmy McGill always survives.\nIt\u2019s not just some clever craftsmanship, although creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould\u2014also of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d\u2014 show off their technical abilities with every scene of their current show.\n\u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d especially in this brilliant second season, has made us love him."}
