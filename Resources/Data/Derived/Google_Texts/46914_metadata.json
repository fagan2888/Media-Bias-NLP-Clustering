Cover Oregon makes public or private health insurance available to individuals and families who do not have insurance, or who want to find less expensive insurance. Having health coverage protects individuals and families from large medical bills. It also makes it easier to get medical care at a clinic or hospital.\n\nPeople cannot be denied coverage because of pre-existing health conditions. There is no physical exam required to qualify for insurance.\n\nRecent immigrants and undocumented residents can still qualify for some health insurance (CAWEM).\n\nThere is no longer a lottery system for the Oregon Health Plan (OHP). Those eligible for OHP can enroll all year round through Cover Oregon.\n\nThose who do not qualify for OHP may qualify for financial assistance to pay for other health insurance plans.\n\nStarting this year, with a few exemptions, everyone is required to have health insurance.\n\nAbout the Coalition of Community Health Clinics\n\nThe Coalition of Community Health Clinics (CCHC) is a non-profit network of 14 safety-net clinic members across the Portland-metropolitan area. Coalition clinics provide high quality, culturally appropriate care to all patients, regardless of age, race/ethnicity, gender identification, or insurance status.
