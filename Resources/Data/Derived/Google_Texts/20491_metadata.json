In his op-ed, he claims Republicans need to repeal Obamacare, abolish the IRS, pass a balanced budget amendment, repeal Common Core, go to war with Iran, etc. You get the idea. Business as usual.\n\nCruz closed his op-ed by saying:\n\nWe should lead boldly. No Washington games. We will either pass a serious agenda to address the real priorities of the American people \u2014 protecting our constitutional rights and pulling us back from the fiscal and economic cliff \u2014 or the Democrats will filibuster or veto these bills. And, if they do so, we will have transparency and accountability for the very next election.\n\nJohn Feehery wrote yesterday in the Christian Science Monitor of Cruz\u2019s \u201cTen Points,\u201d saying that while he is a conservative himself, he believes the Texas Republican is \u201cnot being straight with voters.\u201d\n\nAnd this while Cruz is claiming he is all about transparency.\n\nA good idea is to go to USA Today and read Cruz\u2019s op-ed. Then go to CSMonitor and read Feehery\u2019s critique. I\u2019ll settle here for a quick recap here of Feehery\u2019s high points:\n\nTed Cruz says Republicans should be bold, should be fully transparent, shouldn\u2019t play any games, and should pass a serious agenda that resonates with the American people. I am all for that. But the agenda he lays out is not serious, not transparent, won\u2019t necessarily resonate with the everyday concerns of voters, and on many levels, is completely disingenuous.\n\nThe intent here of Cruz is to fire up the base, to stoke fears of the federal government, and of Obama in particular. These are Fox News-style talking points he is putting forward in USA Today, not realistic (or even helpful) proposals.\n\nFeehery makes this latter point rather well:\n\nRepublicans aren\u2019t going to get rid of the IRS. They aren\u2019t going to pass term limits. They aren\u2019t going to pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. They aren\u2019t going (nor should they) pass a life-time ban on lobbying for members of Congress. They aren\u2019t going to repeal Common Core. They aren\u2019t going to mess with the judicial branch. There\u2019s no such thing as illegal amnesty. They aren\u2019t going to prod the president into declaring war on Iran. They aren\u2019t going to get rid of Export-Import Bank.\n\nHow do you take seriously a politician who proposes to repeal something (Common Core) that is not even a federal, but rather a state, program? Surely Cruz knows he can\u2019t repeal Common Core. But he is counting on the voters \u2013 kept deliberately ignorant by Fox News \u2013 to not know this.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t all. A couple of other Cruz-related events went down this week which go further to show that Cruz is not fit to hold public office. Let\u2019s take these in reverse order:\n\nHis senior advisor and Deputy Chief of Staff, Nick Muzin, tweeted Thursday that Obamacare was to blame for Ebola\u2019s presence in the United States:\n\n\u201cBefore Obamacare, there had never been a confirmed case of Ebola in the U.S.\u201d\n\nMuzin later deleted the tweet and called it a \u201cbad joke.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t a bad joke. It was much worse than that.\n\nI could have easily have written here that before Bush was elected, a hurricane had never destroyed New Orleans. But I wouldn\u2019t. Because the two have nothing to do with each other. Bush didn\u2019t cause Katrina; Obama did not cause Ebola.\n\nWhat Muzin said is just more of this:\n\nAnd surely, at this point, you understand the reason for that.\n\nThe second event I\u2019d like to cite came last Sunday, in an interview on CNN, where Ted Cruz said,\n\nLook, of course we should have a surgeon general in place. And we don\u2019t have one because President Obama, instead of nominating a health professional, he nominated someone who is an anti-gun activist (for surgeon general).\n\nThe problem here is that Obama\u2019s nominee for surgeon general is a doctor. Dr. Vivek Murthy was nominated way back in November 2013 \u2013 an entire year ago.\n\nCNN\u2019s Candy Crowley got Cruz to admit Murthy is a doctor but even then Cruz seemed to think being a gun-control advocate somehow made his medical background irrelevant:\n\n\u201cHe is a doctor, but where he\u2019s made his name is as a crusader against Second Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nPolitifact was not having any of this, saying Thursday \u2013 the same day Muzin upped the dishonesty with his tweet,\n\nBut it\u2019s bogus for Cruz to imply that Murthy \u2014 a graduate of Yale School of Medicine \u2014 is not primarily a health professional. It\u2019s also a bit of a stretch to call Murthy an \u201canti-gun activist.\u201d\n\nSo apparently, Murthy is not a doctor because he supports Obama, like climate scientists aren\u2019t really scientists because they support science, and this despite his credentials, which Politifact gleaned from Murthy\u2019s handy LinkedIn profile:\n\nSounds like a doctor to me. Politifiact agreed, and rated Cruz\u2019s claim \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nWhat we need from holders of public office are people who want to serve the voters, not just piss them off by rattling off lists of lies and then following them up with lists of agenda-items you aren\u2019t serious about implementing.\n\nWhen Obama ran for office in 2008, he had a list of things he wanted to do. Some of them he was able to do, some he was not. But they were at least realistic goals. Even Republicans see that Cruz can\u2019t do most of the things he has put on his agenda for 2015.\n\nSo rather than being a list of things he seriously thinks Republicans can do in 2015, Cruz\u2019s op-ed is a list of things he thinks can get Republicans elected in 2014. There is a difference.\n\nCruz\u2019s op-ed is not a serious agenda, and because Cruz has lied about that, he has also made a mockery of his own claim to transparency.\n\nCruz is not a reformer. You can\u2019t be a reformer when you are a champion of the status quo. Cruz isn\u2019t even really a politician, but an anarchist demagogue. He doesn\u2019t want to create, but rather to destroy.\n\nHe has, like McCarthy in the 1950s, created an enemy \u2013 Obama \u2013 and turned himself into the \u201cremedy\u201d to the problem he created, casting himself as the ultimate anti-Obama crusader.\n\nBut to cite the Monty Python critique of Arthurian government, if \u201cstrange women lyin\u2019 in ponds distributin\u2019 swords is no basis for a system of government!\u201d neither is making a straw-man list of fake problems to oppose that you\u2019re not really serious about opposing, the basis of a political platform.\n\nIn the end, Ted Cruz isn\u2019t serious about trying to help anybody but himself \u2013 to power. And his unscrupulous abuse of facts is the ultimate proof of that agenda.\n\nAmerica can do better. America must do better.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A series of episodes of egregious dishonesty this past week have clearly demonstrated Ted Cruz's unsuitability for public office", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "A series of episodes of egregious dishonesty this past week have clearly demonstrated Ted Cruz's unsuitability for public office", "title": "Ted Cruz Has Disqualified Himself from Public Office", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/10/25/ted-cruz-disqualified-public-office.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ted_cruz.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-25T19:39:52+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Republican Party,Barack Obama,Christian Science Monitor,Congress,federal government,Internal Revenue Service,John Feehery,Presidency of Barack Obama,Ted Cruz,Ted Muzin,Texas,United States,USA Today,Vivek Murthy,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2014-10-25T08:17:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-25T19:39:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Christian Science Monitor, Congress, federal government, Internal Revenue Service, John Feehery, Presidency of Barack Obama, Ted Cruz, Ted Muzin, Texas, United States, USA Today, Vivek Murthy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9277\"", "article_summary": "Last Sunday, Ted Cruz wrote an op-ed for USA Today about \u201cten critical priorities for the 2015 Congress,\u201d that clearly disqualifies him from public office.\nIn the end, Ted Cruz isn\u2019t serious about trying to help anybody but himself \u2013 to power.\nFeehery makes this latter point rather well:Republicans aren\u2019t going to get rid of the IRS.\nA couple of other Cruz-related events went down this week which go further to show that Cruz is not fit to hold public office.\nThey aren\u2019t going to prod the president into declaring war on Iran."}
