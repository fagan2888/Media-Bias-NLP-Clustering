Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, the threat was clear: \u201cMr. Speaker, there is a war being waged on energy and on coal in this country. But it\u2019s not coming from another country, it is coming from our own government.\u201d Her colleague Mike Pompeo of Kansas agreed: \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s war on coal means fewer jobs and higher energy costs for Americans.\u201d Those who believed otherwise, West Virginia Rep. David McKinley warned, were \u201cin dangerous denial.\u201d\n\nIt was Sept. 20, 2012, two months before a presidential election that would pit incumbent Barack Obama against former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, and the U.S. House of Representatives was preparing to vote on the bluntly titled \u201cStop the War on Coal Act.\u201d Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee called the proposed legislation, which would strip the EPA of its power to regulate coal-mining operations and coal-fired power plants under a host of federal laws, \u201cthe single worst anti-environment bill to be considered in the House this Congress.\u201d But the bill\u2019s sponsors argued that significantly curtailing the EPA\u2019s authority over the coal industry was the only way to prevent the president\u2019s war from claiming \u201ceven more victims.\u201d\n\nThe Stop the War on Coal Act passed the House on Sept. 21, 2012, in a 233\u2013175 vote, with the support of 19 Democrats. No one thought it had any chance of moving in the Democrat-controlled Senate. Instead, the House\u2019s vote, which would be its last act before Election Day, was \u201conly meant to be an instrument to bludgeon Obama and other Democrats,\u201d as one commentator put it \u2014 a reminder to the coal-country electorate of the existential threat posed by the current president and his party.\n\nIt hadn\u2019t always been this way. On the contrary, four years earlier, Obama had enjoyed a brief, involuntary tenure as the coal industry\u2019s \u201cspokesperson-in-chief.\u201d About a month after Obama emerged victorious from the 2008 election, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE), a \u201cpartnership of the industries involved in producing electricity from coal,\u201d released an advertisement made up entirely of video excerpts from a speech he had given at a September 2008 campaign rally in Lebanon, Va. In the footage, Obama proclaimed that \u201cclean coal technology\u201d could make America \u201cenergy independent,\u201d and expressed confidence that the pollution generated by coal combustion could be dealt with: \u201cThis is America. We figured out how to put a man on the moon in 10 years. You can\u2019t tell me we can\u2019t figure out how to burn coal that we mine right here in the United States of America and make it work.\u201d The ad ran for months.\n\nAnd ACCCE wasn\u2019t alone in characterizing Obama as a coal supporter. During the 2008 campaign, coal-state Democrats had proven equally eager to brand their party\u2019s candidate as a \u201cfriend of coal.\u201d Longtime Congressman Nick Rahall of West Virginia, for instance, expressed certainty that Obama would be better for the industry than John McCain.\n\nOn the one hand, the portrayal of Obama as a cheerleader for coal wasn\u2019t entirely unfounded. He did, after all, hail from Illinois, a major coal producer. As a U.S. senator, he had cosponsored a bill with Republican Jim Bunning of Kentucky to provide up to $8 billion in subsidies for controversial coal-to-liquid fuel technologies. Earlier, while serving in the Illinois State Senate, he had publicly criticized a mercury regulation proposed by President George W. Bush that he felt unfairly favored Western coal over the variety produced in Illinois.\n\nAnd, as the ACCCE ads emphasized, Obama was an enthusiastic proponent of developing so-called \u201cclean coal\u201d plants \u2014 facilities equipped with technology that could capture at least some of their carbon dioxide emissions and then sequester the trapped gas underground where it wouldn\u2019t contribute to climate change. Indeed, the economic stimulus package Obama pushed through Congress in February 2009 included $3.4 billion in funding for pilot carbon-capture projects.\n\nBut there was a corollary to the president\u2019s support for \u201cclean coal\u201d technology that neither ACCCE nor Rahall cared to emphasize: a belief that the status quo of burning coal without capturing its CO2 emissions was environmentally unsustainable. Obama was bullish on clean coal but bearish on dirty coal. His support for coal-to-liquid fuel subsidies in the Senate, for instance, was ultimately conditioned on a requirement that the fuel\u2019s production and use generate at least 20 percent less CO2 than the production and use of conventional petroleum. More important, as a presidential candidate, he had publicly and repeatedly vowed to impose a cap-and-trade system that would cut American greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Under such a system, any power plant that burned fossil fuels would need to buy a permit \u2014 from either the government or a fellow polluter \u2014 for each ton of CO2 it emitted. This was a particularly onerous prospect for coal plants because they emit twice as much CO2 per kilowatt-hour of electricity as their natural gas\u2013fired counterparts. In other words, coal plant owners operating under a cap would likely have to spend a great deal on permits, invest a great deal in emission-reducing technologies like carbon capture, or simply close down.\n\nThe coal industry was happy to burnish its public image by broadcasting a then-very-popular new president\u2019s support for the idea of \u201cclean coal.\u201d It was happier still to accept taxpayer dollars for the testing of pollution-reducing technologies. But it had no interest in spending its own money on such reduction efforts. As a result, as soon as the new White House\u2019s focus shifted from doling out stim\u00adulus funds to following through on the president\u2019s cap-and-trade pledge, the coal PR machine undertook a shift of its own. With sur\u00adprising speed, Obama\u2019s public image went from that of coal\u2019s big\u00adgest fan to its No. 1 enemy.\n\nRise of the rhetoric\n\nThe first rumblings of conflict were heard in the spring of 2009, after the White House released a budget that anticipated significant revenue from cap-and-trade emissions auctions \u2014 almost $650 billion over a 10-year period. At the time, a staff writer for the Dayton Daily News in Ohio predicted that the president\u2019s plan would \u201cignite a new War Between the States in Congress, pitting the coal-dependent states against those that use other forms of energy.\u201d But coal country turned out to be less interested in blaming other states for cap-and-trade than in blaming the president. When the cap-and-trade legislation overcame its first congressional hurdle, a May 2009 vote of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Republican Rep. Bob Latta of Ohio told the press, \u201cIt almost looks like Obama and the Democrats declared war on Ohio and Indiana.\u201d By the time the bill passed the full House in late June, there was no \u201calmost\u201d about it, at least not for the editors of the Charleston Daily Mail in West Virginia, who declared that the \u201cwar on coal, and the accompanying cap-and-trade mumbo-jumbo, would clobber West Virginia and West Virginians.\u201d\n\nThe rhetoric snowballed from there. In October 2009, the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce deemed the \u201cwar on coal\u201d serious enough to justify taking a hostage: health-care reform. The Chamber demanded (without success) that its home-state senators block the Affordable Care Act until the Obama administration backed down on its \u201ccampaign against coal.\u201d The following spring, when the EPA tightened its Clean Water Act permitting standards for mountaintop mines, a spokesperson for the National Mining Association, Luke Popovich, suggested that the president was \u201cparking his tanks on [mining companies\u2019] front lawns.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cwar\u201d next emerged as a dominant theme in West Virginia\u2019s 2010 midterm elections, with Democrats and Republicans alike scrambling to prove they loved coal more. The state\u2019s popular Democratic governor, Joe Manchin, gained an edge in his Senate race only after producing an ad in which he literally shot a copy of the cap-and-trade bill. Rep. Rahall, too, was forced to distance himself from the White House, just two years after endorsing Obama as \u201ccommitted to coal.\u201d Rather than denying his Republican opponent\u2019s claims that \u201cPelosi and Obama have declared war on coal,\u201d Rahall argued that his seniority in the Democratic Party left him better positioned to fight the administration\u2019s environmental initiatives, going so far as to compare his unsung success at blocking committee votes on mining restrictions to the thwarting of terrorist attacks.\n\nConfined primarily to Appalachian media in 2010, the PR campaign for the \u201cwar on coal\u201d went national during the 2012 presidential election. Minutes into the first debate, Mitt Romney announced, \u201cI like coal,\u201d and suggested that people in the coal industry felt they were \u201cgetting crushed by [Obama\u2019s] policies.\u201d A Romney television ad accused Obama of \u201cattacking [the] livelihood\u201d of coal miners, and ACCCE piled on with ads of its own that criticized the EPA\u2019s \u201cheavy-handed regulations.\u201d Not surprisingly, \u201cwar on coal\u201d reached its most heavily searched period on Google in November 2012.\n\nBut for all the advertising dollars spent (ACCCE\u2019s efforts alone cost $35 million), the \u201cwar\u201d narrative ended up holding little sway with voters outside Appalachia. Romney won West Virginia and Kentucky by wide margins, but he lost coal-producing swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia \u2014 and, with them, the presidency.\n\nPeeling back the propaganda\n\nIf proponents of the \u201cwar on coal\u201d narrative were chastened by defeat in 2012, they didn\u2019t stay that way for long. Seven years into the Obama presidency, complaints about his supposed siege on the coal industry still make headlines. These days, with the failed cap-and-trade bill a distant political memory, the most commonly cited evidence of \u201cwar\u201d are three EPA restrictions on pollution from power plants: the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, commonly known as the Transport Rule, which prevents plants in upwind states from exporting dangerous soot- and smog-forming pollu\u00adtion to their downwind neighbors; the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which restrict plants\u2019 emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants; and the Clean Power Plan, which will limit plants\u2019 emissions of climate change\u2013driving carbon dioxide. Together, the rules are expected to prevent tens of thousands of premature deaths each year.\n\n\u201cWar\u201d critics, though, focus less on the benefits of the regulations than on the Obama administration\u2019s motives for issuing them. Rather than an earnest effort to protect public health, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) sees the EPA\u2019s initiatives as an \u201celitist\u201d and \u201cideological crusade,\u201d led by officials who simply \u201cdon\u2019t like\u201d coal.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem with this \u201cmalice of the elite\u201d theory: It\u2019s hard to condemn policies as products of presidential animus when they weren\u2019t the president\u2019s idea to begin with. And the truth is that not one of the rules mentioned above was entirely discretionary.\n\nThe Transport Rule, for example, was a necessary replacement for the George W. Bush EPA\u2019s Clean Air Interstate Rule, which had been struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and left in place only to give the EPA time to fashion a substitute. Bush\u2019s rule was itself a successor to a Clinton-era regulation, the \u201cNOx SIP Call.\u201d And, in issuing their respective rules, all three administrations \u2014 Clinton, Bush, and Obama \u2014 acted pursuant to the Clean Air Act\u2019s \u201cGood Neighbor Provision,\u201d which Congress first passed all the way back in 1977, under President Carter.\n\nThe Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, too, were crafted to replace a George W. Bush\u2013era rule that the D.C. Circuit had vacated, the Clean Air Mercury Rule. The Obama administration didn\u2019t have the option of not replacing the earlier regulation, thanks to a Clinton-era determination that it was \u201cappropriate and necessary\u201d to regulate power plants\u2019 mercury emissions. And the only reason the Clinton administration had considered that question in the first place was because the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 \u2014 passed at the urging of the first Bush administration \u2014 required it to do so.\n\nThe regulation of power plants\u2019 carbon dioxide emissions under the Clean Power Plan was similarly preordained. In 2007, the Supreme Court found in Massachusetts v. EPA that the agency could decline to regulate greenhouse gas pollution from cars and trucks only by making one of two findings: (1) that greenhouse gases did not contribute to climate change, or (2) that the uncertainty surrounding climate change was so \u201cprofound\u201d that the EPA could not make a \u201creasoned judgment\u201d as to whether greenhouse gases contributed to climate change. Given the existence of what EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson would later describe as \u201cdecades of sound, peer-reviewed, extensively evaluated scientific data\u201d linking greenhouse gas emissions to climate change, the agency could not defensibly reach either of those conclusions.\n\nAnd once the EPA took steps to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks, it didn\u2019t have a persuasive defense against a 2010 lawsuit brought by states and environmental organizations seeking to compel it to do the same for power plants. The legal triggers for regulating emissions of a particular pollutant from motor vehicles under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act and those from \u201cstationary sources\u201d under Section 111 are almost identical. In other words, having already found that greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks contributed to dangerous climate change, the agency was going to have a pretty difficult time convincing a court that emissions from power plants didn\u2019t pose a similar threat, especially considering that power plants were (and still are) the largest source of carbon dioxide in the United States. Accordingly, EPA settled the suit in December 2010 and agreed to craft greenhouse gas standards for power plants. Just shy of five years later, it fulfilled that obligation by issuing the Clean Power Plan.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the Obama administration has played a pivotal role in implementing the Transport Rule, the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, and the Clean Power Plan. Even though EPA had preexisting statutory and/or judicial obligations to promulgate each rule, a different White House might have tried to delay the day of reckoning. It is to Obama\u2019s credit that, under his watch, the EPA has embraced rather than evaded its legal responsibilities.\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s important to recognize that those legal responsibilities were not created by the current president. Instead, they are the product of five decades of legislative and regulatory efforts by prior administrations of both parties.\n\nIn the end, Obama\u2019s environmental policies may be components of a larger struggle, but that struggle is not an unprecedented, unilateral, and ideological \u201cwar on coal.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nCorrection, 17 Feb 2016: This post originally identified David McKinley as a U.S. representative from Virginia.
