But The Denver Post\u2019s Jon Murray said it appears the group plans to have only $25 million by year\u2019s end.\n\nDenver has a more difficult challenge because the city is home to fewer corporate headquarters than Dallas. And while the RNC has made no secret that it is mostly about money right now, the committee should also recognize Denver\u2019s distinct advantage in having been through this rodeo just six years ago.\n\nUltimately, a successful convention helps catapult a nominee to the White House. Denver did that.\n\nA well-run convention won\u2019t have distracting sideshows \u2014 riots in the streets, conventioneers not able to find their accommodations, transportation delays. It should be a smooth and well-run event to showcase the candidate and the party in the best light.\n\nDenver may be lagging Dallas in fund-raising, but it came through once before, and would very likely raise enough again. And because of its previous experience, the city is almost certain to be a highly successful host. The choice seems pretty clear. But we\u2019re biased.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Will flush Texans sway the RNC?", "title": "Will flush Texans sway the RNC?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/13/will-flush-texans-sway-the-rnc/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613__rnc-dallasp1.jpg", "height": 464}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613__rnc-dallasp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-13T18:38:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:30:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdebf8\"", "article_summary": "A well-run convention won\u2019t have distracting sideshows \u2014 riots in the streets, conventioneers not able to find their accommodations, transportation delays.\nRepublican Party officials are looking at four cities to host their $60 million convention.\nPete Coors, Denver\u2019s bid chair, said his group is determined to raise the necessary amount for a successful convention.\nUltimately, a successful convention helps catapult a nominee to the White House.\nDenver may be lagging Dallas in fund-raising, but it came through once before, and would very likely raise enough again."}
