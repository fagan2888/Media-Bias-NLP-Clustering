Sources have said regulators were beginning their own review of Toshiba's book-keeping, based on Monday's report.\n\nThe investigation came just as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has implemented new guidelines to improve the country's corporate governance.\n\nShares in Toshiba rose 6 percent on Tuesday on relief the report had few nasty surprises. But they are still down around 23 percent since Toshiba first disclosed cases of accounting irregularities in early April.\n\n\"Institutional investors and other long-term funds have already unloaded Toshiba shares, so currently the stock price is being driven by short-term investors,\" said Takatoshi Itoshima, chief portfolio manager at Commons Asset Management.\n\n\"The bad news is out. As long as Toshiba won't be delisted, such trade will continue.\"\n\n(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando, Chang-Ran Kim and Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Richard Pullin and Rachel Armstrong)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Toshiba Corp said its chief executive was stepping down on", "title": "Toshiba CEO to step down over accounting scandal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/07/21/Japan-finance-minister-warns-Toshiba-scandal-could-hit-investor-confidence", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/toshiba-accounting-minister_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/07/21/Japan-finance-minister-warns-Toshiba-scandal-could-hit-investor-confidence", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/toshiba-accounting-minister_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Toshiba Corp said its chief executive was stepping down on", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "But they are still down around 23 percent since Toshiba first disclosed cases of accounting irregularities in early April.\nThe report released on Monday said Toshiba had overstated its operating profit by 151.8 billion yen ($1.22 billion) over several years, roughly triple Toshiba's initial estimate.\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Toshiba Corp said its chief executive was stepping down on Tuesday after an independent investigation found he had been aware the company had been inflating its profits over a number of years.\nShares in Toshiba rose 6 percent on Tuesday on relief the report had few nasty surprises.\nAso declined to comment when asked if Toshiba would face any kind of financial penalty."}
