Both partners have decades of experience ensuring the maximum usability of homes and products.\n\nStay Informed: Sign up for the AARP Livable Communities Newsletter\n\nThe duo\u2019s shared goal is to promote, educate and encourage the wide adoption of \u201cbetter living design\u201d (BLD), which seeks to change the way homes and home products are designed, built and remodeled to better meet the needs of everyone at every life stage.\n\nBLD applies the principles of universal design, a set of common guidelines that help create homes that people can reside in regardless of their age or physical ability. For instance, a no-step entry and a front-loading washing machine are just two small features that can make a world of difference for many homeowners.\n\nEven just a few simple design innovations can create a home that is more comfortable than most housing that exists today and can serve people throughout their lives, Duncan explains, noting that \u201cthe appeal of a BLD home is that it works well for its current residents, allows for long-lasting ease of use and adds value upon resale. Our BLD homes look like the homes people are used to living in. Whether building new or remodeling an existing home, BLD features fit with any style.\u201d\n\nThe Better Living Design Institute is developing a certification program that will enable design and building professionals to submit their home plans to receive one of three approval levels (Essential, Select, Premium) that signify the design\u2019s conformance with the BLD criteria.\n\nFor consumers, the BLD Institute will provide lists of BLD-recommended home products and tools for locating a BLD-certified professional.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nJosh Perlman is a member of the AARP Livable Communities Team.\n\nSubscribe to the Livable Communities Great Places Blog by email or RSS feed\n\nFollow us on Twitter @LivableCmnty\n\nLearn more about age-friendly communities at AARP.org/livable\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nAlso of Interest\n\n>> Get travel discounts with your AARP Member Advantages", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "The Better Living Design Institute\u2018s new website\u00a0\u2013\u00a0betterlivingdesign.org\u00a0\u2013 launched this week as a resource for homeowners, designers, builders and remodelers looking to create age-friendly homes with appeal to residents of any age.
