The American Racing Pigeon Union has a lobbying firm to work on its behalf. So do the Interlocking Concrete Pavement Institute, the Owners of Ivory Miniatures, and the International Natural Sausage Casing Association. Within corporate America, food industry lobbyists represent particularly specific interests: Groups advocate for restaurants and frozen foods, franchise associations, and chains. Beef, dairy, corn, potatoes, and apples all have their champions. But there is nothing quite like the pizza lobby, a rare coalition of competitors who have banded together to advocate for a specific dish. There\u2019s no sandwich lobby, no burrito trade association. The macaroni-and-cheese people have yet to get their act together.\n\nPizza is special, says Lynn Liddle, executive vice president for communications, investor relations, and legislative affairs at Domino\u2019s Pizza and chair of the American Pizza Community \u2014 the APC, as it calls itself. \u201cYou can\u2019t make pizza in a minute. You can\u2019t drive through. We don\u2019t have fryers,\u201d Liddle says. At the same time, many pizza joints aren\u2019t sit-down restaurants, and sometimes, as the pizza folks have learned recently, the National Restaurant Association just doesn\u2019t get it. For decades, pizza makers have relied on the food\u2019s natural advantage: Everybody loves it. Some 41 million Americans \u2014 more than the population of California \u2014 eat a slice of pizza on any given day. If pizza were a country, its sales would put it in the top 100 of global gross domestic product. \u201cPizza is, without a doubt, the food of the gods,\u201d says a 2014 video produced by the American Chemical Society that explains the chemistry behind pizza\u2019s appeal. \u201cAll pizzas deliver divine, rich, cheesy, mouthwatering experiences that hustle your brain\u2019s pleasure centers into overdrive.\u201d Until recently the U.S. government was inclined to agree. Pizza is such an efficient cheese-delivery vehicle that a farmer-funded promotional agency, authorized and overseen by the federal government, pushed fast-food chains to load up pizzas with more cheese. That effort led to Pizza Hut\u2019s 2002 \u201cSummer of Cheese\u201d campaign and partially funded Domino\u2019s 2009 introduction of its \u201cAmerican Legends\u201d pizzas \u2014 pies topped with 40 percent more cheese. \u201cThese specialty pizzas are as American as apple pie,\u201d Domino\u2019s crowed, as part of its marketing campaign. More recently, though, pizza has become a target, lumped into a nutritional axis of evil along with French fries and soda. New federal nutrition standards for school lunches, part of a 2010 law, squarely targeted pizza\u2019s dominance in cafeterias. Menu-labeling rules, which take effect later this year, have seemed particularly onerous to pizzeria owners. And in the popular imagination, no less than First Lady Michelle Obama and Top Chef judge Tom Colicchio, though they claim to love the stuff, have emerged as enemies of pizza in their push for healthier school lunches. \u201cI hear people say, \u2018We would like to improve the school lunch program, but the kids, all they want to do is eat pizzas and burgers,\u2019\u201d Colicchio said in testimony to Congress in 2010. \u201cWe are adults here. It is up to us to do better.\u201d One by one, other purveyors of fast food have been convinced, nudged along by new laws or public shaming. McDonald\u2019s, for example, voluntarily took soda out of Happy Meals and added calorie counts to its menus long before the government required it. Wendy\u2019s also removed soda from its children\u2019s menu, and Darden Restaurants reduced calories and sodium in kids\u2019 meals at its restaurants, including Olive Garden and Red Lobster, and made vegetables and milk the default side options. Pizza advocates have taken a different, more combative tack. They\u2019ve separated themselves from other food groups in Washington to become their own lobbying force. They\u2019re not throwing money around \u2014 pizza\u2019s biggest spenders devoted less than $500,000 to lobbying last year and just $1.5 million in political contributions in the last two election cycles. But they have notched some successes, proving that under the right circumstances, firm resolve and a thin crust can still be persuasive in Congress.\n\nThe early rumblings of the war on pizza began more than two decades ago, when Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, began calling for chain restaurants to put calorie information front-and-center on their menus. At first, Wootan got little traction in Congress, so she directed her lobbying efforts at city councils and state legislatures instead. New York City was the first to sign on, in 2006, and more than a dozen similar laws were enacted in other cities and states. Even the National Restaurant Association eventually supported a national menu-labeling law, and in 2010 it passed as part of the Affordable Care Act. But when the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s draft regulations came out a year later, pizza makers were ticked. They said they, too, supported a national labeling law, but what they didn\u2019t like \u2014 and continue to oppose \u2014 were the specifics, which had been hashed out with help from the National Restaurant Association but not the pizza industry. (The association says that's not true.) Regardless, the APC\u2019s Liddle says that given the potential combinations of pizza toppings, posting accurate calorie information would be \u201cnear impossible.\u201d And chains that specialize in delivery have said it\u2019s ridiculous to install a menu board with calorie information when so few customers would see it. \u201cHaving to post that information on a menu board is a very costly exercise in humoring government bureaucrats,\u201d says Ron Berger, chief executive officer of Figaro\u2019s Pizza, an Oregon-based chain. What\u2019s more, the FDA\u2019s proposed regulations required pizzerias to post calories for a whole pie, rather than a single slice. \u201cIt is sticker shock,\u201d says Marla Topliff, president of Rosati\u2019s Pizza in suburban Chicago. \u201cWhen somebody looks at nutritionals on a large pizza and they see 10,000 calories, they may be reluctant to buy it.\u201d Most large pizzas don\u2019t typically top 4,000 calories, even fully loaded, but Topliff\u2019s point is well taken: While many people might eat more than a single slice in a sitting, few eat the whole pie. Domino\u2019s hired a lobbyist in Washington to fight against menu labeling, while Liddle and her counterparts sounded the alarm far and wide. They recruited franchise owners, suppliers, and other big chains such as Papa John\u2019s and Little Caesars, representing roughly 20,000 restaurants. Created in 2010, the American Pizza Community devoted itself to advocating for the pizza industry and fighting the aspects of menu labeling that they found most objectionable. The APC held weekly conference calls to discuss strategy, and in June 2012, members flew to Washington to schmooze members of Congress and their staff \u2014 \u201cthe first wave of an ongoing effort to inform leaders about the industry,\u201d according to an APC press release. Although Domino\u2019s plays a commanding role, the APC presented itself as a voice for local pizzerias, which it calls \u201cthe quintessential small business.\u201d Specifically, it encouraged legislators to support an alternative to the FDA\u2019s proposed regulations. Called the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act, that alternative would have eased some of the menu-labeling restrictions, like allowing primarily delivery-based pizzerias to provide calorie information online. That bill hasn\u2019t yet passed, but the FDA ultimately eased up on one of the regulations most irritating to the pizzeria owners: They can now post calorie information by the slice. (The FDA also says only standard menu items need to be labeled, not every possible combination.) It was a modified win for pizza. Still, Liddle wasn\u2019t happy. In response to the FDA\u2019s final regulations, released last fall, she put out a statement on behalf of the APC, complaining that the FDA had provided only \u201csmall concessions that don\u2019t solve many of the regulation\u2019s problems.\u201d She went on to promise that the pizza lobby would not give up this fight: \u201cThe APC will now enlist the help of allies to right this wrong.\u201d\n\nAt the same time pizzerias were fighting menu labeling, frozen-pizza makers were defending their own territory: the school cafeteria. Along with promoting menu labeling, Wootan, the nutrition activist, had also begun pushing for better nutrition standards for federally subsidized school lunches, where almost $500 million worth of pizza is served each year. For Wootan and her allies, the goal was to add more fruits and vegetables to school lunches while cutting back on junk food \u2014 specifically pizza and French fries \u2014 or at least making it healthier. In 2010, Congress approved a nutrition update for federally subsidized school lunch that\u2019s been championed by Michelle Obama. When the Department of Agriculture released the details the next year, they included a seemingly obscure provision that increased the minimum amount of tomato paste required to be counted as a vegetable serving \u2014 and lit a torch under the frozen-pizza lobby. (As of now it operates independently from the fresh-pizza lobby, perhaps because Domino\u2019s described frozen pizza as \u201cthe root of all evil\u201d on its pizza boxes a few years ago.)\n\n\u201cFor school lunch purposes, a slice of pizza was considered a serving of vegetables\u201d\n\nUnder the existing rules, tomato paste is given extra credit toward a vegetable serving because it's made of concentrated tomatoes. So 2 tablespoons of tomato paste \u2014 roughly the amount on a slice of pizza \u2014 is counted as a half a cup, or the equivalent of one vegetable serving. For school lunch purposes, a slice of pizza was considered a serving of vegetables, a point first made by Wootan in 2011 that became a late-night punchline. The Department of Agriculture\u2019s new rules, though, would have stopped giving tomato paste extra credit: From now on, 2 tablespoons would count as 2 tablespoons. Kraig Naasz, CEO of the American Frozen Food Institute, a trade group that lobbies for frozen pizza, says the tomato paste rule was simply a crafty way to get pizza out of schools: \u201cNone of our members wanted the federal government to say, \u2018Pizza is bad for you.\u2019 You would have been telling an entire generation that pizza is a food you shouldn\u2019t consume.\u201d In a 2011 letter to the USDA, the National Frozen Pizza Institute \u2014 frozen pizza\u2019s trade association and an arm of Naasz\u2019s organization \u2014 said the amount of tomato paste would need to be increased so dramatically that it would overwhelm pizza and make it \u201cincapable of holding cheese and other toppings.\u201d And in testimony before Congress in August of that year, Karen Wilder, chief nutritionist for Schwan Food, said many foods packed with nutrients, including pizza, risked elimination from school lunch by the proposed rules. A subsidiary of Schwan supplies 70 percent of school lunch pizza. In November 2011, Congress blocked the Department of Agriculture from making some of the proposed nutrition changes. Since then, reductions to sodium and increases in whole grains have been delayed \u2014 which the frozen-pizza lobby favored \u2014 and the USDA gave up on closing the tomato paste loophole altogether. Wootan conceded the round: \u201cWhen it comes to school food, pizza is king. It was the pizza industry that went to members of Congress to prevent USDA from implementing this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Andrew Martin", "twitter": {"description": "Other corners of the fast-food industry have folded against public pressure for healthier choices.
