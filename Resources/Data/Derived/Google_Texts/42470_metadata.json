And those slippers? Yeah, yuck. At some point today, you\u2019ll head out to return all those things and buy what you wish you had received.\n\nToo bad you can\u2019t return politicians and bureaucrats just as easily.\n\nHere\u2019s are Nos. 14-9 on Watchdog.org\u2019s Scariest People of 2013 list:\n\n14. FLORIDA: U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson\n\nAlan Grayson is quite possibly the scariest politician to disgrace the Sunshine State since, well, Alan Grayson\u2019s last congressional stint ended so painfully in 2010 \u2014 losing by 18 points to the guy he was calling \u201cTaliban Dan\u201d Webster. Amazingly, the Central Florida progressive returned to the U.S. big-House of Representatives this year, and he appeared to be making up for lost time. Already known for likening an election opponent to the Taliban and for calling a female Federal Reserve lobbyist a \u201cK-Street whore,\u201d Grayson took to excoriating \u201cTeahadist Republicans\u201d for their role in the government shutdown \u2013 an accomplishment too dark, Grayson said, even for \u201cBin Laden\u2019s wildest dreams.\u201d Florida Watchdog noted that the congressman did not find the shutdown too terrible to use it as a fundraising opportunity. But Grayson outdid himself in a subsequent cash-ask. The self-styled Occupy Wall Street populist \u2013 and sixth-richest House member \u2013 went on to compare his political opponents to the Ku Klux Klan, which of course is why he needs more donations. In case recipients of the fundraising appeal weren\u2019t sure that Grayson was serious, he used an image of a burning cross to illuminate the point. MITIGATING FACTOR: As support for Obamacare continues to unravel amid higher insurance prices and lost coverage options, Grayson tipped his hand, recently announcing his own one-size-fits-all health care solution: Medicare for everyone.\n\n13. EVERYWHERE: The Faceless Bureaucrat\n\nUsually found only in the bowels of city halls, state capitols and federal buildings across the county, this enforcer of government rules and regulations spring into action whenever there is a problem that only red tape can solve \u2013 even if he causes more problems in the process. The Faceless Bureaucrat enforces Minnesota\u2019s ban on selling cakes and cookies from one\u2019s own home. He enforces one Florida\u2019s city\u2019s ban on home vegetable gardens, and one New York town\u2019s ban on roommates. She will stop at nothing to shut down voluntary donations of food to homeless shelters, and won\u2019t allow a little girl to sell mistletoe to help pay for her own braces that her parents couldn\u2019t afford. It\u2019s been a good year for the Faceless Bureaucrat, who has flexed his political muscle at the IRS and assumed control of many Americans\u2019 health insurance decisions. And when the Faceless Bureaucrat isn\u2019t telling you what to eat, drink, smoke, or what you\u2019re allowed to sell and what you\u2019re required to buy, she is wrapping people and businesses in enough red tape to choke the world\u2019s largest economy. Since he has no political ideology, just a pathological desire to follow all the rules and make sure you do too, no election can cleanse our political system of the Faceless Bureaucrat. Democratic administration, Republican administration, they\u2019re here to stay. MITIGATING FACTOR: Faceless Bureaucrats don\u2019t write crazy laws, they just enforce them. With apologies to Hannah Arendt, they can excuse their behavior as part of \u201cthe banality of bureaucracy.\u201d (Eric Boehm)\n\n12. DELAWARE: State Treasurer Chip Flowers\n\nDon\u2019t worry, taxpayers of Delaware: your state treasurer made sure everyone knows he\u2019s on top of his breakfast expenses. In November, Delaware State Treasurer Chip Flowers boldly declared that, if he ordered three pancakes while traveling on official business and the state allows him to expense two, \u201cthe last flapjack is on me.\u201d That absurd assurance probably did little to assuage taxpayer concerns: Flowers made the statement in response to a series of stories from The News Journal that raised questions about expenses he and his deputy charged while attending a 2012 conference in Alaska. After insisting all charges were proper, Flowers announced he would repay more than $1,000 in travel expenses, including more than $450 connected to the Alaska conference. \u201cIt is truly worth paying to clear the integrity of this office,\u201d Flowers said, according to The News Journal. A reimbursement probably won\u2019t be enough. Flowers\u2019 office is in chaos after documents showed he often lost travel receipts, splurged for room service and had laundry done on the road. Flowers\u2019 deputy also resigned in August after charging personal purchases on her state credit card, including tickets to an NFL game. MITIGATING FACTOR: Flowers\u2019 photo of a grizzly in Alaska offered a chance for the public to joke about bear markets. (Andrew Staub)\n\n11. TEXAS: Guy Rankin IV\n\nIt\u2019s strange enough to draw a picture of an eight-foot-tall man \u2013 a man with ripped abs and wings sprouting from his back who is carrying a limp firefighter \u2013 but if there\u2019s a place for that sort of thing, it would be a high-schooler\u2019s sketchbook or a cult\u2019s iconography, or maybe in some sort of anime. But to take your drawing and then use the government agency you oversee to spend $100,000 turning it into a bronze statue? It\u2019s the sort of decision that suggests a questionable faculty for decision-making. Guy Rankin IV, the disgraced former CEO of the Harris County Housing Authority, made lots of bad spending decisions. There was the $5,000 in dental work for his own family, the $66,000 on shirts for his staff of a few dozen, the $1.8 million in apparently illegal bonuses for managers and staff, the $18,000 for letters signed by Abraham Lincoln, the $8,780 for five helicopter flights over the agency\u2019s failed housing developments, and so much more. Now the agency may have to come up with as much as $30 million to repay the feds for misspent funds, which will be difficult, seeing as almost all its money comes from the feds in the first place. MITIGATING FACTOR: Rankin continues to tweet about angels \u2013 specifically, 300 angels he asks to \u201ccompletely destroy those evil people in the world.\u201d The only folks on the Internet talking about 300 angels are followers of a New Age teacher with a fake British accent calling herself Almine, who offers courses in communing with 300 archangels based on \u201cancient Atlantean texts,\u201d which she claims to translate and interpret herself. \u201cTruth is the highest perception for any given expanded or contracted focus,\u201d Almine says. Can\u2019t we get another 299 statues wearing that quote? (Jon Cassidy)\n\n10. GEORGIA: Chad Henderson\n\nIn the days after the federal health insurance exchange went live on Oct. 1, the national media was scrambling to find somebody, anybody who had been able to navigate the glitch-ridden, error-filled website and purchase a health insurance plan. They found one guy: Chad Henderson. Henderson bragged on his Facebook page that he was interviewed by \u201cThe Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Chattanooga Times Free Press, The Huffington Post, Enroll America, and Politico,\u201d along with several local TV affiliates. His story supposedly was proof that for all their glitches and problems \u2013 and the ambivalence of young people \u2013 the new health insurance exchanges were working as intended. Except it was all a lie. Henderson was a former Barack Obama presidential campaign volunteer and a member of the president\u2019s Organizing for America, a nonprofit created after Obama\u2019s re-election to push for his policy objectives. After he was caught by Reason Magazine\u2019s Peter Suderman, Henderson said he told his fake story about signing up for health insurance because he wanted to see the Affordable Care Act succeed. After all, what\u2019s more important: telling the truth, or public opinion about the president\u2019s signature legislative accomplishment? MITIGATING FACTOR: Henderson shouldn\u2019t have lied, of course, but media outlets desperate for stories about anyone who signed up for health insurance through the exchanges really, really blew their fact-checking operations on this one. It almost makes you wonder what other lies \u2013 far more important ones from sources who are harder to double-check \u2013 make it into print and screen. (Eric Boehm)\n\n9. NEW JERSEY: Ex-cop Joe Derrico\n\nFormer Hamilton Township police officer Joe Derrico is the poster child for a New Jersey public pension system that faces a $41 billion shortfall. While collecting disability retirement checks for a leg injury he said he received on the job, Derrico starred on \u201cBear Swamp Recovery,\u201d a truTV cable network reality show on vehicle repossessions by the \u201cbaddest towing team in Jersey.\u201d During the \u201cMonster Truck Showdown\u201d episode, Derrico runs after a truck, pulls a man down from the driver\u2019s seat, throws him to the ground and climbs into the cab. In another scene, Derrico is wrestling with opponents. Following a New Jersey Watchdog investigation, a state board stripped Derrico of his $69,703 a year tax-free pension. MITIGATING FACTOR: Despite a clean bill of health from state doctors who watched Derrico on TV, the audience was less optimistic about Derrico\u2019s prognosis: truTV canceled the show after just one season. Maybe he could get his old job back at the department? \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned, he\u2019s no longer a Hamilton police officer and has no rights to be re-employed,\u201d said John Ricci, township administrator.
