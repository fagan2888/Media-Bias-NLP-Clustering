That win, a 3-2 Whale triumph at the old McNichols Sports Arena, came on Feb. 9, 1996. I recently actually went back and watched the entire VHS tape of that game and documented it all in one of my \u201cWatching Old Avs Games\u201d pieces on the blog. Give it a read for what life was like back in 1996.\n\nAnyway, I thought the Hurricanes would break the hex tonight. The precise moment I really thought that was in the second period of a 3-1 game and Alex Semin had just a tap-in to make to make it a 4-1 game. Even Semin, one of the biggest underachievers in the NHL right now, would make that one and nobody ever comes back from a three-goal deficit anymore. Game over, I thought. But Calvin Pickard did kind of a reverse, backhanded glove save and also with his stick to keep it still a two-goal game.\n\nThe Avs ended up pulling it out 4-3, with beleaguered veteran Jarome Iginla being the hero with the tying goal and setup pass to Zach Redmond to win it. Pickard, in relief an an awful Reto Berra (10 shots, seven saves, six goals allowed on last 36 shots), made 17 saves for his first career win.\n\nHere\u2019s how he described what it was like to come in suddenly, and on making that miracle save:\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see who gets the start Tuesday in Arizona, assuming Semyon Varlamov will still be out (and I think he will be out still). Does Patrick Roy come back with Berra, or reward the kid Pickard with the start? We\u2019ll find out Monday at practice.\n\nHere is Iginla on being the Jarome Iginla of old \u2013 not just an old Jarome Iginla.\n\n\n\nHere is Redmond, rocking the Movember stache, on his big game:\n\n\n\nI thought Erik Johnson showed a real leadership moment with that second-period goal. It came two seconds after a PP expired, and you could just sense the major frustration building at that point. He deked a defender down and found the corner with a shot that really got them back in the game in a serious way. Johnson told me after the game he used to make that move all the time as a Minnesota Golden Gopher, but stopped doing it in the NHL as much after some turnovers led to goals going the other way. I say he keeps doing it more again.\n\nAnd finally, here are more post-game notes and quotes from Avs PR staff:\n\n\u2022 Calvin Pickard stopped all 17 shots in relief to post his first NHL victory\u2026Pickard is the second goaltender in franchise history to earn his first career win in relief\u2026Quebec\u2019s Brian Ford also accomplished the feat on Dec. 27, 1983 vs. Hartford.\n\n\u2022 Zach Redmond scored a career-high two goals, including the game winner.\n\n\u2022 Nathan MacKinnon tallied a career-high three assists tonight\u2026The three points matched his career best for points in a single game (Feb. 1, 2014 vs. Buffalo).\n\n\u2022 Andrew Agozzino made his NHL debut tonight and picked up an assist for his first NHL point.\n\n\u2022 Andrej Nestrasil scored his first NHL goal.\n\n\u2022 Justin Faulk appeared in his 200th NHL game.\n\n\u2022 With a goal and an assist tonight, Jarome Iginla moved into a tie with Sergei Fedorov for 48th place on the NHL\u2019s all-time scoring list with 1,179 career points.\n\nMOST POINTS, ALL-TIME (No. 46-50)\n\n46. Dino Ciccarelli 1200\n\n47. Rod Brind\u2019Amour 1184\n\n48. Sergei Fedorov 1179\n\nJarome Iginla 1179\n\n50. Bobby Hull 1170\n\n\u2022 Tomas Vincour became the first player in Avalanche/Nordiques franchise history to wear #81 when he made his season debut tonight\u2026Vincour wore #24 in his previous stint with the Avs in 2012-13.\n\n\u2022 Vincour\u2019s assist tonight marked his first point in the NHL since April 26, 2013 at Phoenix.\n\n\u2022 John-Michael Liles scored his first goal of the season for the Hurricanes\u2026It was Liles\u2019 35th career goal here at Pepsi Center, second to only Hall-of-Famer Rob Blake (40) for the most goals by a defenseman in this building.\n\n\u2022 Tonight wrapped up a stretch of seven consecutive games versus Eastern Conference opponents (Avs finished 4-3-0)\u2026Colorado has already played 13 (or 41%) of its 32 \u2018non-conference\u2019 games this season.\n\nColorado LW Andrew Agozzino\n\nOn His First NHL Game And Point: \u201cIt was unbelievable. I mean, to have that start and get an assist early in the game was an unbelievable feeling. The way we came back in the second and third period and got that win, I can\u2019t even really describe it to be honest with you. It was unbelievable.\u201d\n\nOn The Success Of Their Line Tonight: \u201cWell, that\u2019s the thing, we have played together before so we are comfortable with one another. We just told each other, \u2018Let\u2019s go out and play like we have been down in Lake Erie.\u2019 You know, we were getting pucks deep and skating really well and I think that\u2019s just translating into success for us.\u201d\n\nColorado D Zach Redmond\n\nOn The Confidence Of Playing On The Power Play: \u201c[The] power play is something that I love to do. It\u2019s an opportunity that I need to take advantage of. Tonight was a good start. None of us have played together up until that point, so it was good to kind of find early chemistry.\u201d\n\nOn His Game-Winning Goal: \u201cIt\u2019s hard for forwards to read D-men coming down the backdoor, especially when everyone is gripping their stick tight with the last minute there. I was able to kind of time it and Iggy (Colorado RW Jarome Iginla) found me with a perfect pass so he made it easy for me.\u201d\n\nColorado G Calvin Pickard\n\nOn The Fourth Line\u2019s Success Tonight: \u201cIt looks so good. I mean, they were great all night. You know, they\u2019re a line down in Lake Erie and they come up here and it\u2019s the same way. They are buzzing and moving the puck and they have good chemistry. They are all great people too and that makes it that much better.\u201d\n\nOn Getting The Win Tonight: \u201cYeah, I mean it was nice. Coming in [replacing Colorado G Reto Berra] in Ottawa, I thought we deserved that game. I thought we played pretty well there. A couple bounces didn\u2019t go my way there and the team\u2019s way there but tonight, we stuck with it. It was so much fun to play behind that team and if we play like that going forward, we are going to win a lot of hockey games.\u201d\n\nCarolina C Andrej Nestrasil\n\nOn Scoring His First NHL Goal: \u201cYou know what, right now it means nothing. You score the first one and you lose, it doesn\u2019t count right? So, we obviously need to play better to win the game. On the other hand, it gives me more confidence because I went 13 games without a goal. So, it might help me a little bit and hopefully it\u2019s going to get better.\u201d\n\nOn His Line Quickly Forming Chemistry: \u201cObviously, (Carolina F Nathan) Gerbe is unbelievably fast, it\u2019s incredible. I think it was good because we were talking a lot on the bench and we knew where the other guy is going to be. We support each other really well and on my goal, Nasher (Carolina F Riley Nash) made a really nice play and it was kind of a lucky goal but I needed that.\u201d\n\nCarolina D John-Michael Liles\n\nOn Carolina\u2019s Quick Start Tonight: \u201cWe started how we wanted to. We took it to them, I think, early on in the game. I have to give them credit, they battled throughout and maybe we just let our foot off the gas a little bit.\u201d\n\nOn Scoring In His First Game Back In Colorado: \u201cIt was pretty emotional. I spent eight years here with a lot of great friends, made a lot of great memories and it\u2019s a different feeling being on the visiting side. It would\u2019ve been nice to get the win along with the goal, but it was still a nice feeling coming back to this building and getting the start from coach too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Carolina Hurricanes,Erik Johnson,Hartford Whalers,Jarome Iginla,John-Michael Liles,Nathan MacKinnon,Patrick Roy,Rob Blake,Semyon Varlamov,Sergei Fedorov,Zach Redmond", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Avalanche come back twice to beat Hurricanes", "title": "Jarome Iginla leads Avalanche comeback against Carolina", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/11/22/postgame-avs-carolina-hurricanes-analysis-iginla-comes-life/20155/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/11/johnson-495x340.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Avalanche come back twice to beat Hurricanes", "title": "Postgame Avalanche-Carolina Hurricanes: Jarome Iginla leads Avalanche comeback", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/11/22/postgame-avs-carolina-hurricanes-analysis-iginla-comes-life/20155/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/11/johnson-495x340.jpg", "creator": "@adater", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Avalanche come back twice to beat Hurricanes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8f8\"", "article_summary": "Here is Iginla on being the Jarome Iginla of old \u2013 not just an old Jarome Iginla.\nThey are all great people too and that makes it that much better.\u201dOn Getting The Win Tonight: \u201cYeah, I mean it was nice.\nColorado LW Andrew AgozzinoOn His First NHL Game And Point: \u201cIt was unbelievable.\n\u2022 Andrej Nestrasil scored his first NHL goal.\n\u2022 Justin Faulk appeared in his 200th NHL game."}
