After a dramatic drop in popularity in the late 1990s, the number of licensed anglers in the state has bounced back from a low of about 630,000 in 2000 to some 765,000 last year, and counting.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Olympic gold medalist and self-proclaimed \u201cfish whisperer\u201d Lindsey Vonn of Vail picking up a fly rod for the first time or the neighborhood kids dunking worms in a local pond, the allure is universal.\n\n\u201cPeople fish for different reasons,\u201d said Ronnie Precht of Denver, who caught the fly-fishing bug last year. \u201cMy friend Gary is a fish slayer \u2014 he just loves to catch any fish he can any way he can for the thrill of it. But my buddy Keith only fly-fishes, and he really only cares about the art of casting and the rhythm and the feel of it. I don\u2019t think he even wants to catch a fish. If you weren\u2019t watching, he probably wouldn\u2019t even tie on a fly.\n\n\u201cFor me, I like being outside with my dog. If we are in a raft catching trout, that\u2019s even better.\u201d\n\nConsidering the broad appeal, fishing\u2019s popularity in Colorado is easy to understand, especially when you examine trends nationally.\n\nAccording to the American Sportfishing Association and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the number of anglers in the U.S. grew 11 percent from 2006-11, and fishing tackle sales grew more than 16 percent during that span. With more than 50 million anglers nationwide, more Americans fish than play golf (21 million) and play tennis (13 million) combined.\n\nHere in Colorado, fishing is credited for contributing more than $1.9 billion each year to the economy. But, really, can you think of a more beautiful place to wet a line?\n\nNot if it\u2019s a fly-fishing line. According to a fly-fishing industry report published by Southwick and Associates in 2013, the Rocky Mountain region is responsible for nearly a third of the total U.S. market share of fly-fishing gear sales, the most by a long way. And since it\u2019s fish, not fishing tackle, that people mount on the wall, it\u2019s safe to assume all that fly-fishing gear is being put to good use.\n\n\u201cSome friends of mine took me fly-fishing for the first time, and I just fell in love with it,\u201d said Peggy Stevinson of Greenwood Village, who now shares her passion with other women through the Casting for Recovery program for cancer patients. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge, you\u2019re constantly learning, you\u2019re outside \u2014 it\u2019s just my favorite thing to do. I took the summer off just to fly-fish.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s still a relatively small segment of the overall market (about 6 million nationally), fly-fishing is the fastest-growing segment of the fishing population, with first-time participants making up 20.5 percent of the sport\u2019s growth in 2012. And the most recent statewide angling survey indicates it\u2019s the most popular method of fishing in Colorado.\n\n\u201cGetting into this dry-fly-fishing is like a whole new sport. It\u2019s so much different than any other fishing I\u2019ve ever done, but it\u2019s the most fun I can have without gathering the attention of the authorities,\u201d said Gary Bragg, a lifelong angler who recently took up fly-fishing. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty severe hankering. Once you do it a few times, you have to get back at it again.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, given Colorado\u2019s abundance of fishable waters. With more than 2,000 lakes and reservoirs and nearly 9,000 miles of streams, an angler is never far from his or her preferred habitat. Fishing is available at 37 of Colorado\u2019s 42 state parks, and about 25 percent of state park visitors report that fishing is their top reason for visiting a state park \u2014 just behind hiking and slightly ahead of camping.\n\nThat translates to about 3 million fishing \u201cvisitor days\u201d a year at various state parks alone, with the highest number of angler-visitors at Lake Pueblo, Chatfield, Eleven Mile, Steamboat Lake and State Forest state parks.\n\nMuch like the parks themselves, fishing serves as a gateway connecting people to the outdoors and a healthy lifestyle by introducing them to other outdoor activities. Without a doubt, fishing is a cornerstone of the American outdoor experience and Colorado remains at the frontier.\n\nScott Willoughby: swilloughby@denverpost.com or twitter.com/swilloughby", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Why fishing is making a comeback in Colorado", "title": "Why fishing is making a comeback in Colorado", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/21/why-fishing-is-making-a-comeback-in-colorado/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140621__20140622_C10_SP22OUTMAINp2-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140621__20140622_C10_SP22OUTMAINp2-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-21T16:44:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:38:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Fishing, hunting"}, "article_summary": "Here in Colorado, fishing is credited for contributing more than $1.9 billion each year to the economy.\nWith more than 50 million anglers nationwide, more Americans fish than play golf (21 million) and play tennis (13 million) combined.\nAnd the most recent statewide angling survey indicates it\u2019s the most popular method of fishing in Colorado.\nThat translates to about 3 million fishing \u201cvisitor days\u201d a year at various state parks alone, with the highest number of angler-visitors at Lake Pueblo, Chatfield, Eleven Mile, Steamboat Lake and State Forest state parks.\nWithout a doubt, fishing is a cornerstone of the American outdoor experience and Colorado remains at the frontier."}
