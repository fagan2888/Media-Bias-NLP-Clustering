Since it went live on Oct. 1, the site has suffered from a litany of computer problems that are keeping consumers from signing up and buying insurance on the health care exchanges.\n\nRepublican lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee questioned whether CGI and other contractors had hidden problems ahead of the launch, or whether the federal agencies responsible were \u201cincompetent,\u201d the Globe and Mail reported.\n\nHouse Democrats suggested the Republicans were simply trying another tack in their fight to stop Obamacare.\n\n\u201cTheir effort obviously isn\u2019t to make this better, but to use the website and the glitches as an excuse to defund or repeal Obamacare,\u201d New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone said.\n\nBut the Obamacare glitches have created problems for Democratic politicians facing re-election in 2014 who were hoping to run on the law's new benefits for millions of uninsured Americans.\n\nOne House Democrat says the president needs to \"man up\" and fire somebody, while others are calling for signup deadlines to be extended and a reconsideration of the penalties individuals will face next year if they remain uninsured.\n\nCheryl Campbell, senior vice-president of CGI Federal, the U.S. subsidiary that built the site, suggested in prepared testimony that Congress should look beyond the contractors.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services \"serves the important role of systems integrator or 'quarterback' on this project and is the ultimate responsible party for the end-to-end performance,\" she said.\n\nOverwhelming interest from consumers triggered the website problems, she said.\n\n\"No amount of testing within reasonable time limits can adequately replicate a live environment of this nature,\" she said.\n\nThe U.S. government has paid CGI at least $88 million U.S. to build and support the federal exchange.\n\nBut glitches plagued the CGI-built website from the moment it launched Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cBlank boxes where security questions are supposed to appear. Pleas to \u2018be patient.\u2019 Error messages galore. Notices that \u2018the system is busy right now.\u2019 Web pages timing out before they load. Garbled lines of text riddled with stray question marks,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nAnd the glitches had a substantial impact. According to an AP-GfK poll, three-quarters of visitors to the site reported problems signing up.\n\n\u2014 With earlier reporting and files from the Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"category": "Canada Business", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1424901/images/s-CGI-FEDERAL-OBAMACARE-small.jpg", "description": "The Canadian company that built the Obamacare website came under attack in the U.S. Congress on Thursday, as politicians from both sides of the aisle sought to lay blame for the site\u2019s glitch-ri", "sailthru.expire_date": "Fri, 25 Oct 2013 12:55:26 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The Canadian company that built the Obamacare website came under attack in the U.S. Congress on Thursday, as politicians from both sides of the aisle sought to lay blame for the site\u2019s glitch-ri", "title": "Why This Canadian Company Is Under Attack In Washington", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/10/24/cgi-group-obamacare-glitches_n_4157560.html", "see_also": "http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/05/21/millennial-anxiety-ruthless-comparison_n_10074894.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1424901/images/o-CGI-FEDERAL-OBAMACARE-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_CA", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostCanada", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Canadian company that built the Obamacare website came under attack in the U.S. Congress on Thursday, as politicians from both sides of the aisle sought to lay blame for the site\u2019s glitch-ri"}, "sailthru.date": "Thu, 24 Oct 2013 12:55:26 -0400", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "thumbnail": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1424901/images/o-CGI-FEDERAL-OBAMACARE-facebook.jpg", "taboola.category": "canada-business", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare glitches,cgi group,cgi federal,cgi federal obamacare,obamacare site glitches,obamacare website crash,cgi obamacare,healthcare.gov", "fb": {"app_id": 100792273348438}, "keywords": "obamacare glitches,cgi group,cgi federal,cgi federal obamacare,obamacare site glitches,obamacare website crash,cgi obamacare,healthcare.gov", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostCanada", "section": "Canada Business"}, "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1424901/images/s-CGI-FEDERAL-OBAMACARE-small.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd568\"", "article_summary": "According to an AP-GfK poll, three-quarters of visitors to the site reported problems signing up.\nCheryl Campbell, senior vice-president of CGI Federal, the U.S. subsidiary that built the site, suggested in prepared testimony that Congress should look beyond the contractors.\nMontreal-based CGI Group built HealthCare.gov, the website that hosts Obamacare insurance exchanges for 36 participating states.\nOverwhelming interest from consumers triggered the website problems, she said.\nADVERTISEMENT CPThe Canadian company that built the Obamacare website came under attack in the U.S. Congress on Thursday, as politicians from both sides of the aisle sought to lay blame for the site\u2019s glitch-ridden rollout."}
