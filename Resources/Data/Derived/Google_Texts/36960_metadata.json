The only question was which Republican would replace him in Louisiana\u2019s ruby-red 5th district.\n\nState Sen. Neil Riser (R) looked like he\u2019d win easily \u2013 he received endorsements from Alexander, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the NRA, and nearly all of Louisiana\u2019s Republican congressional delegation. But then the votes were tallied in Saturday\u2019s run-off election, and Vance McAllister (R), a first-time candidate, crushed Riser by nearly 20 points.\n\nIn terms of the national significance, there\u2019s one key takeaway from the results.\n\nWhile some thought the all-Republican runoff would be marked by each candidate running to the far right of every issue, McAllister took leave of the usual party line during a debate last week by coming out in support of optional Medicaid expansion offered under the Affordable Care Act. McAllister said he disagreed with Gov. Bobby Jindal\u2019s decision not to accept the expansion because of the economic make-up of the 5th District. [\u2026] Riser blasted McAllister for the admission, issuing an ad stating \u201ca vote for Vance McAllister is a vote for Obamacare.\u201d\n\nExactly. A vote for McAllister was a vote for Obamacare, and in this extremely Republican district, McAllister won in a landslide against the Republican establishment\u2019s hand-picked candidate.\n\nIn fairness, it\u2019s worth emphasizing that Rep.-elect McAllister didn\u2019t exactly run as a progressive on health care \u2013 the Republican said he\u2019d prefer to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But he nevertheless stuck to a fairly pragmatic line and told the far-right what it didn\u2019t want to hear \u2013 repealing the entirety of the law is unrealistic and Medicaid expansion in Louisiana is a sensible move, even if Bobby Jindal pretends otherwise.\n\nIn this district, that was a risky move, and it led Riser and his allies to make the race a referendum over health care. And then McAllister won by about 20 points anyway.\n\nNational Republicans would be wise to take note. For many in the party, grunting \u201cObamacare bad!\u201d is a sure-fire recipe for electoral success. Indeed, GOP leaders have started to think it\u2019ll be easy \u2013 tie rival candidates to the controversial health care law, watch voters recoil, and wait for the landslide victories to commence.\n\nReality seems to be pointing in a different direction. Two weeks ago, Republicans said Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial race would be \u201c a referendum on Obamacare ,\u201d and then Ken Cuccinelli lost. Over the weekend, Republicans said Obamacare would be the deciding factor in Louisiana\u2019s congressional special election, but the hardline candidate easily lost a race he was expected to easily win.\n\nAnd this, by the way, is when support for health care reform is at its nadir. As healthcare.gov improves, and support grows, these electoral referenda will be more difficult for the GOP, not less.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "For the second time this month, Republicans tried to turn a major election into a referendum on Obamacare.
