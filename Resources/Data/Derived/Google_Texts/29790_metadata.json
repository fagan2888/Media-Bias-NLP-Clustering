At the time of the conference, the administration launched a new mental health website, MentalHealth.gov. The site offers information about mental health conditions, how to get treatment, and how to make your voice heard when it comes to improving mental health care in America.\n\nMeanwhile, the Affordable Care Act has declared mental health an \u201cessential benefit\u201d for Medicaid patients, and thousands are seeking treatment for the first time. As the influx of new patients floods the system, a lack of providers has left many people in urgent need of help unable to see a doctor quickly.\n\n\u201cBehavioral health is perceived as a cost as opposed to a profit center,\u201d Dr. David Lischner, a Seattle-based psychiatrist, told Healthline.

Call Your Legislator\n\nSaturday ends National Mental Health Awareness Week, but National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) spokesperson Bob Corolla told Healthline that efforts to shine a spotlight on mental health shouldn't end tomorrow, especially during an election year.\n\nMental health awareness doesn't end this week. It\u2019s just one step in what has to be an ongoing dialogue, and in an election year that\u2019s very important. Bob Corolla, National Alliance on Mental Illness\n\nCorolla said mental health is one of the few issues that is non-partisan. \u201cMental illness affects Republicans as well as Democrats,\u201d he said.\n\nCorolla urges everyone to let political candidates at all levels of office know about the urgent need for mental health reform. \u201cLook at the campaign literature, and if they haven\u2019t said anything [about mental health] send an email to the campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re at a town meeting, raise your hand and ask. Mental health awareness doesn't end this week. It\u2019s just one step in what has to be an ongoing dialogue, and in an election year that\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nAlthough two separate bills are now pending in Congress, he said neither is likely to pass this year. \u201cIt becomes less likely they\u2019re going to do anything in what will end up being a lame duck session,\u201d Corolla said.\n\nNAMI offers tips on lobbying political candidates on its website.\n\nRead More: 9 Myths About Depression \u00bb\n\nGetting Past the Stigma to Seek Help\n\nMany people don\u2019t seek mental health treatment because they\u2019re concerned about the stigma that comes along with it. People with a mental illness diagnosis often can\u2019t obtain life insurance. Other times, they don\u2019t want their employer to find out they\u2019re seeking help.\n\n\u201cWe want people to be fine about getting treatment, not worry about privacy, and have faith in the system,\u201d Lischner said. \u201cWe need special rules.\u201d\n\nCorolla said friends and loved ones of people exhibiting symptoms of mental illness should gently extend a hand and offer to help.\n\nHe suggests approaching conversations with, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be yourself these days. Is there something you want to talk about?\u201d Point out specific behaviors you've noticed that seem unusual or detrimental, and offer to go with the person to a mental health appointment.\n\nIf somebody breaks up with a boyfriend or a girlfriend and is feeling depressed for a week, it\u2019s probably nothing to worry about, Corolla said.\n\n\u201cBut a lot of times depression impairs daily functioning to some degree. People may not want to get out of bed or may not have enough energy or enthusiasm to get through the day,\" he said. \"If it begins snowballing and results in someone being late to work, or they find themselves fired, that creates a whole new level of loss.\n\nLearn When to Seek Help from a Psychologist \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/mental-illness-awareness-week-101014", "news_keywords": "mental illness awareness week, mental illness, mental health, depression, Newtown, Robin Williams, National Conference on Mental Health, mentalhealth.gov, David Lischner, medicaid, Evidence Based Treatment Center of Seattle, Valant Medical Solutions, Affordable Care Act, ACA, Obamacare, National Alliance on Mental Illness, NAMI,", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "The national awareness campaign is working to combat stigma and encourage lawmakers to pass vital mental heath care legislation.", "title": "Mental Illness Awareness Week: Where the US Still Falls Short", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/mental-illness-awareness-week-101014", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/mental-health/depression_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/mental-health/depression_1.jpg", "description": "The national awareness campaign is working to combat stigma and encourage lawmakers to pass vital mental heath care legislation.", "card": "summary", "title": "Mental Illness Awareness Week: Where the US Still Falls Short"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-10", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The national awareness campaign is working to combat stigma and encourage lawmakers to pass vital mental heath care legislation."}, "article_summary": "One year after the White House hosted a day-long National Conference on Mental Health, Congress still has not passed comprehensive mental health care reform legislation.\nWhy, after all the acknowledgment of the problem, do so many people still have trouble accessing mental health care?\nThe site offers information about mental health conditions, how to get treatment, and how to make your voice heard when it comes to improving mental health care in America.\nBob Corolla, National Alliance on Mental IllnessCorolla said mental health is one of the few issues that is non-partisan.\nAt the time of the conference, the administration launched a new mental health website, MentalHealth.gov."}
