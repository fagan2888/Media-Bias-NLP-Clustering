But the claims just aren\u2019t true, says Eric Brakey, a first-time Republican candidate running for the District 20 seat in the Maine Senate.\n\nBrakey is challenging incumbent state Sen. John Cleveland, a Democrat and former Auburn mayor.\n\nThe district includes the city of Auburn and the towns of Minot, Poland, Mechanic Falls and part of New Gloucester. The seat is one of a handful up for grabs that will determine which party controls the state Senate.\n\nThe mailers, which claim Brakey opposes birth control and mammograms for women, were not authorized by Cleveland and not approved by him, but were sent in opposition to Brakey\u2019s campaign by the Maine Democratic Party. The postcards are part of more than $30,000 the party\u2019s political action committee has shelled out to re-elect Cleveland.\n\nThe Maine Democratic Party stands by the mailer\u2019s message, saying Brakey once was chairman of the Defense of Liberty Political Action Committee, which opposed the federal Affordable Care Act \u2014 known as Obamacare to opponents. Because the ACA requires insurers to cover reproductive health care for women \u2014 including birth control \u2014 and the Defense of Liberty PAC opposed it, Brakey is therefore against birth control and mammograms, the Democratic Party reasons.\n\nBut Brakey said the mailer, including its misspellings and bad photo manipulations, is flat-out wrong.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s politics, but saying someone opposes mammograms, I don\u2019t know anyone who opposes mammograms, it\u2019s kind of like saying someone supports breast cancer,\u201d Brakey said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating especially when we all have people in our lives who have been affected by breast cancer.\u201d\n\nAccess to birth control is a federal issue, Brakey said. His preference would be to make it more accessible by allowing the sale of Federal Drug Administration-approved birth control medications over the counter.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one way we could have a market-based approach to birth control and make it more affordable for women,\u201d Brakey said.\n\nBrakey declined to say whether he would support allowing women who may become eligible under any expansion of Medicaid in Maine to have access to reproductive health services including abortions. It\u2019s an issue that has set conservative Republicans and most Democrats in Augusta at sharp odds.\n\nCleveland said he supports expanding Medicaid under ACA and that all services offered under Medicaid should continue to be offered to anyone eligible for coverage in an expansion scenario.\n\n\u201cI support decisions being made about a woman\u2019s reproductive health to be made by her and her physician based on what\u2019s best for the woman\u2019s health,\u201d Cleveland said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a decision that should be made between a woman and her doctor in consultation with her family if she wishes to do that.\u201d\n\nCleveland said the difference between himself and Brakey on health care \u2014 Cleveland supports an expansion of Medicaid while Brakey opposes it \u2014 is only one of many between the two candidates.\n\nCleveland cites his experience as a city councilor, mayor and state lawmaker as setting him apart from his opponent. The Democrat also notes he\u2019s a lifelong resident of Auburn and a business owner in the city for 25 years.\n\n\u201cI think this is an important election. There are going to be some very large challenges before us in regard to the state budget, energy and health care,\u201d Cleveland said. \u201cThose things are going to require some experience, some knowledge and an understanding of how the process works to get legislation passed to become law. That\u2019s not something you know how to do in the first two years of your Senate service.\u201d\n\nBrakey recently moved to Auburn from New Gloucester. He became a Maine resident three years ago. His immediate family, which has roots in New Gloucester, lived in Ohio, where Brakey grew up, went to high school and college, before spending time in New York City pursuing an acting career. He moved to Maine in 2011.\n\nA direct mail piece that Brakey\u2019s campaign has sent to voters, including a questionnaire, touts his family\u2019s \u201ceight generations\u201d in Maine.\n\nBrakey\u2019s acting work in New York featured the candidate dancing in a Brazilian Speedo in an advertisement for VitaCoco, a coconut water drink. The video drew media attention to the conservative\u2019s state Senate campaign in August 2013.\n\nActive in Community Little Theatre and the Girls and Boys Club of Lewiston-Auburn as well as his church, Brakey said he moved to Auburn from his parent\u2019s New Gloucester home to be closer to the activities and organizations he has been involved with, and not because Auburn was the largest city in the Senate district.\n\n\u201cIt was just more convenient all around for me,\u201d Brakey said.\n\nBrakey and Cleveland have conflicting views on reforming Maine\u2019s energy policies. Cleveland serves as Senate co-chairman of the Legislature\u2019s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee and has been credited with brokering a deal on a major energy bill that eventually was passed into law over a Gov. Paul LePage veto.\n\nAmong other things, the bill expanded funds for energy efficiency programs, including renewable sources. It also lays the groundwork for an expansion of natural gas infrastructure in the state \u2014 a key component for lowering Maine\u2019s high electricity costs, according to most energy experts.\n\nWhile Cleveland opposes a move proposed by LePage to remove a 100-megawatt cap in the state\u2019s renewable portfolio standard as it applies to hydro power, Brakey supports that change.\n\nCleveland said dropping the cap would damage a host of emerging renewable energy technologies which benefit from it including solar, tidal, biomass and wind power.\n\nLePage has argued that removing the cap would pave the way for low-cost hydropower from Quebec but Cleveland and other opponents argue that Quebec hasn\u2019t shown any interest in selling into Maine\u2019s energy market.\n\nHe also said if the Quebec hydropower generators were to sell into Maine, they first would need a transmission line and likely would sell their power at the market rate, meaning Maine would not get any cheaper power than it has now.\n\nWhile Maine produces more electricity than it consumes, prices remain high because the going rate for certain kinds of energy \u2014 especially renewable \u2014 is in demand in other New England states that have policies requiring certain percentages of their electricity come from renewable sources.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a commodity that we sell like lobsters, we don\u2019t just sell lobsters in Maine, we sell lobsters to people around the world who want to buy them. It\u2019s the same thing with electricity,\u201d Cleveland said.\n\nBrakey said lobbyists in Augusta, not citizens, ultimately are crafting the state\u2019s energy policy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve testified in front of the energy committee on several occasions, and it\u2019s frustrating to see that committee more than most any other committee is when you go in any day you see it\u2019s packed with paid lobbyists and everybody asking for a handout,\u201d Brakey said.\n\nCleveland said crafting good energy policy is complex work and there are many misconceptions about what is and is not driving Maine\u2019s high energy costs.\n\nEven if the regulatory policies were in place to allow an expansion of natural gas inflow to Maine, it would take a minimum of between two to three years to permit and build that pipeline infrastructure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUBURN, Maine \u2014 It was bad enough they Photoshopped his head onto somebody else\u2019s body, but what really bugs him \u2014 besides the fact they misspelled his first name \u2014 is the claim he\u2019s against women having mammograms and he opposes access to birth control.
