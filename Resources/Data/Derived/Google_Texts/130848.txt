Congressional Democrats really want Obamacare regulations to take on movie theater popcorn

First they came for your large sodas, now Obamacare and the nanny state wants to get their hands on your movie theater popcorn.

In yet another case of Obamacare including all kind of miscellaneous and burdensome regulations, the law included a provision requiring all chain restaurants to post calorie count data on their menus.

The original writing of this law said restaurants and “similar retail food establishments,” but was removed by the Food and Drug Administration before the law was put into effect. The FDA said the regulation would only apply to establishments that devote 50 percent or more of their square footage to the preparation, sale, and consumption of food, excluding movie theaters, grocery stores, golf courses, bowling alleys, and other types of establishments.

Now two congressional Democrats are up in arms that movie theaters are exempt from the law.

Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) sent a letter Friday to the FDA saying it was their intent that establishments such as movie theaters and grocery stores should have to post calorie information.

Their letter offers no real reason for why they are mad about it or why they feel movie theater popcorn should be taken down other than to say that the FDA rule does not match “Congressional intent.”

Goodness knows the Republic will never survive if people don’t know the amount of calories in their large tub of movie theater popcorn.
