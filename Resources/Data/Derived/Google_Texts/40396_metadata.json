And there are a few things that just a pastor could understand.\n\n\u201cA pastor knows how to make an organization work on the funding provided voluntarily by its members \u2013 not coerced.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Rod Chaney, from a 2012 campaign ad.\n\nThat\u2019s when Chaney, a Republican, ran against Valerie Foushee for the NC House 50 seat.\n\nDistrict 50 includes parts of Durham and Orange Counties. Foushee won that race, by 55-to-45 percent.\n\nThis time, the incumbent in the race is Democratic Rep. Graig Meyer.\n\nHe was appointed to the seat last year to replace Foushee, who\u2019d been chosen for the state\u2019s District 23 Senate seat, left vacant by the retirement of Ellie Kinnaird.\n\nChaney, a pastor at Sunrise Church in Chapel Hill, is running again in 2014. His Republican opponent in the May 6 primary is retired banker Lewis Hannah, the same as in 2012.\n\nThis past week, Chaney did not respond to several interview requests from WCHL.\n\nBack in 2012, he filled out a survey from the conservative Civitas Institute, asking about his positions on some issues.\n\nIn the survey, he agreed that the Affordable Care Act should be repealed.\n\nChaney also answered that he believes marriage between one man and one woman should be the only domestic legal union considered valid in North Carolina.\n\nHe said that North Carolina\u02bcs status as a so-called \u201cRight-to-Work\u201d state should be written into the state constitution.\n\nChaney also took the position that North Carolina should allow offshore and natural gas exploration.\n\nHe was also opposed to the creation of a nonpartisan redistricting commission.\n\nIn 2012, Chaney opposed raising the state sales tax by \u00be of one cent to provide additional resources to public schools.\n\nChaney ran in 2012 as a supporter of charter schools.\n\nAs he stated in this ad from that campaign, Chaney served on the board of Orange Charter School for two years.\n\n\u201cBy competition, the public school is getting leaner in their bureaucracy, they\u2019re being more effective, because they realize there\u2019s another game in town.\u201d\n\nIn the coming weeks, WCHL and chapelboro.com will reach out to candidates in all local races.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nRelated", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chaney, a pastor at Sunrise Church in Chapel Hill, is running he NC House 50 seat in 2014.
