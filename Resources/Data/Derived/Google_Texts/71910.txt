David Arthur Stack went on a cross-country adventure in 1976 using his thumb to hitch rides.

He vanished somewhere along the way.

For 39 years what happened to him remained a mystery.

On Tuesday the mystery was partially solved by the efforts of the Tooele County Sheriff’s Office, west of Salt Lake City in Utah, along with forensic scientists.

The biggest part of what happened to Stack is yet to be solved but Tooele County Sheriff Paul Wimmer is eager to do the improbable and figure out who put two bullets the young man’s body.

Stack had been murdered.

His body was dumped near a water treatment plant.

It’s not known where Stack met his killer. Did the killer pick the young man up while he was thumbing for a ride near his home in Broomfield?

Or had he made his way over the course of several days to Utah and met his killer for the first time in another jurisdiction?
