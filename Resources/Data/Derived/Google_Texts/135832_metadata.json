First, this piece from September, about Kentucky voters who love the state's new health insurance exchange (Kynect) but still disapprove of the Affordable Care act:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tickled to death with it,\u201d Ms. Evans, 49, said of her new coverage as she walked around the Kentucky State Fair recently with her daughter, who also qualified for Medicaid under the law. \u201cIt\u2019s helped me out a bunch.\u201d But Ms. Evans scowled at the mention of President Obama \u2014 \u201cNobody don\u2019t care for nobody no more, and I think he\u2019s got a lot to do with that,\u201d she explained \u2014 and said she would vote this fall for Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and minority leader, who is fond of saying the health care law should be \u201cpulled out root and branch.\u201d\n\nAnd in Racine, Wis., Jeffrey Kowalczuk, a 56-year-old account representative for a trucking company, seemed no less disillusioned than Ms. Pizarro after voting for Republicans in that critical state. \u201cI\u2019m just tired of all the fighting and bickering,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all Americans. It\u2019s just getting old with all that stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cObama has not accomplished what he promised to the community,\u201d said Juan Neyra, 69, a retired security guard in Denver. He said he used to vote for Democrats, but this year had voted for the Republican Senate candidate, Representative Cory Gardner, who was challenging Senator Mark Udall, a Democrat. \u201cAnd Udall supports Obama,\u201d Mr. Neyra said.\n\nThen there was this piece about disillusionment with Washington last Wednesday. It was full of quotes by people angry about gridlock, but not quite grasping its source:That would be from a man who ostensibly voted for SCOTT WALKER. The article concluded:Straight outta the GOP playbook.\n\nFollow Jen on Twitter at @JenSorensen", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "(Click to enlarge)\n\nA couple articles inspired this cartoon.
