Since 2011, the district\u2019s health insurance costs have increased by more than 20 percent amid new federal health care mandates.\n\nBy bringing all employees under the same health plan, district and union officials believe the state\u2019s largest public employer will have the bargaining power to negotiate lower health costs.\n\n\u201cThere is an opportunity here to provide something much better,\u201d School Board member Linda Young said. \u201cThis has the possibility for a win-win.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Clark County\u2019s administrators, police officers, support staff and teachers have separate health insurance plans, which are negotiated by their respective unions.\n\nThe School District offers six health insurance plans to its administrators, police officers and support staff through United Healthcare\u2019s Health Plan of Nevada. The Clark County teachers union provides two health insurance plans to its 18,000 teachers and their dependents through the nonprofit Teachers Health Trust.\n\nTo study how a consolidated health insurance plan could be implemented, the School District and the teachers union hired an independent insurance consultant, Mercer Health and Benefits, LLC. To prevent a biased report, the School District and the Clark County Education Association split the $158,350 consulting fee.\n\nMercer consultants presented their findings to the School Board during a three-hour special meeting Monday evening.\n\nThe consulting firm found that both the district\u2019s and union\u2019s health insurance options offer \u201cgenerous\u201d benefits at an affordable price, relative to similar plans across the country.\n\n\u201cBoth organizations have done a remarkable job,\u201d said John Vlajkovic, a Mercer partner overseeing health and benefits. \"The experience through both plans are exceptional compared to what we usually find in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nHowever, \u201cthe world is changing around us,\u201d Vlajkovic said. The Affordable Care Act has escalated health insurance costs while providing more health care options for employers and employees, he said.\n\nAnd as the number and cost of medical claims rises, so too will the district\u2019s health insurance costs, Vlajkovic said. The district and union\u2019s current health insurance options are unsustainable, he said.\n\n\u201cAs we look forward, we\u2019re concerned (that claims) are going to catch up,\u201d Vlajkovic said. \u201cAt some point in time, the obligation to pay for all of the claims incurred is going to a reality.\u201d\n\nMercer recommended a consolidated health care plan for 30,000 full-time employees in the district, as well as their dependents and some retirees. The consultants left it up to the School Board to decide what kind of health plan and benefits level they want to pursue.\n\nThe School District will now negotiate with its four employee unions over several options for health insurance plans.\n\nUnion leaders said they welcomed the Mercer report and its findings, but strongly urged the School District to maintain good health benefits for employees. Many union members said they favored a nonprofit health insurance model, similar to the Teachers Health Trust.\n\n\u201cNot one penny should go into profit. It should be invested back into teachers,\u201d John Vellardita, CCEA\u2019s executive director, said. \u201cWhat we want is affordable, quality health care for all employees. We don\u2019t want disparity in care.\u201d\n\nDistrict officials hope to have a consolidated health plan in place by January 2016.\n\n\u201cThis will take some time,\u201d Skorkowsky said. \u201cWe need to move on this, but we need time for everyone to process this information. This is a very difficult topic to wrap our heads around.\u201d\n\nCheck back later for more on this developing story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Clark County School District is considering a single, districtwide health insurance plan to offer cheaper health care for its 38,000 employees.
