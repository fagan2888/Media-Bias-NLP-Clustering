At least seven Democrats have spoken out with concerns about Obama\u2019s executive actions. However, it\u2019s unclear if the GOP will be able to attract any for the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. Republicans control 54 seats.\n\n>>> House Votes to Undo 4 Years of Obama\u2019s Immigration Policies\n\nOn Friday, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the chamber\u2019s second-ranking Democrat, said his party will block a funding measure for Homeland Security that includes language undoing Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration.\n\nDemocrats have called for the passage of a \u201cclean\u201d appropriations bill free of amendments related to Obama\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nObama has vowed to veto any bill that includes measures to stop his actions. And today, speaking at the Homeland Security headquarters, Obama warned Congress not to play politics with the agency\u2019s funding.\n\n\u201cThe men and women of the America\u2019s homeland security apparatus do important work to protect us, and Republicans and Democrats in Congress should not be playing politics with that,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe need to fund the department. Pure and simple.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s conservative critics argue that if the White House is unwilling to make changes to its immigration policies, the president should be blamed if Homeland Security were to shut down.\n\nDavid Inserra, a homeland security expert at The Heritage Foundation, acknowledged a shutdown was \u201cnot the best situation for security, but it\u2019s not the disaster people make it out to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, we want people to be paid and you can\u2019t improve border security without funding,\u201d Inserra said. \u201cBut why should conservatives get blamed? The president instigated this. He should have put border security over amnesty.\u201d\n\nRegardless of who\u2019s to blame, Moran is worried about how the funding fight affects the morale and well-being of the 17,000 Border Patrol agents his union represents.\n\nMoran says that Border Patrol agents continued to work during the government shutdown in 2013 because their service is considered \u201cessential,\u201d but they didn\u2019t receive paychecks during the Washington standoff.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our border left unguarded,\u201d Moran said. \u201cWe want people out there doing their job.\u201d\n\nThe White House released a statement today saying more than 40,000 border patrol agents would work without pay under a shutdown, along with 13,000 at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 40,000 in the Coast Guard, 50,000 at the Transportation Security Administration and 4,000 in the Secret Service.\n\n>>> \u2018Clock Is Ticking\u2019: Homeland Security Chief Warns Congress to Fund His Agency\n\nThough Moran\u2019s agents did eventually get paid after the 16-day shutdown was resolved in October 2013, he said that working without pay\u2014and worrying that such service will be required again\u2014proves to be distracting and tiresome.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disruptive,\u201d Moran said. \u201cIt does have a huge impact on how you go about your day-to-day life. It\u2019s the inability to plan financially as you don\u2019t know when the paychecks will come again.\u201d\n\nMoran insists his agents\u2019 collective pride won\u2019t let them give any less in doing their job, no matter the surrounding politics. But he worries how funding scares like this one will impact Border Patrol\u2019s ability to attract new agents.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re out there able to do our job,\u201d Moran said. \u201cWe want to be funded. We don\u2019t want politics to play into how we secure the border.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A union leader for U.S. Border Patrol agents spoke out to voice concern about the political haggling over funding for the Department of Homeland Security.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A union leader for U.S. Border Patrol agents spoke out to voice concern about the political haggling over funding for the Department of Homeland Security.", "title": "Border Patrol Union Leader Blasts Washington: \u2018We\u2019re in the Middle of Political Football\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/4442886118_74c6ea9f77_o.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1BXBGkM"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A union leader for U.S. Border Patrol agents spoke out to voice concern about the political haggling over funding for the Department of Homeland Security.", "title": "Border Patrol Union Leader Blasts Washington: \u2018We\u2019re in the Middle of Political Football\u2019", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/4442886118_74c6ea9f77_o.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-02-02T18:15:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Shawn Moran, border patrol, National Border Patrol Council, Homeland security, illegal immigration, Dick Durbin, funding fight, executive action"}, "article_summary": "A union leader for U.S. Border Patrol agents spoke out today to voice concern about the political haggling over funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\nMoran says that Border Patrol agents continued to work during the government shutdown in 2013 because their service is considered \u201cessential,\u201d but they didn\u2019t receive paychecks during the Washington standoff.\nHe should have put border security over amnesty.\u201dRegardless of who\u2019s to blame, Moran is worried about how the funding fight affects the morale and well-being of the 17,000 Border Patrol agents his union represents.\n\u201cYou want to be able to do your job, but things like this make it more difficult.\u201dThe current funding for Homeland Security expires Feb. 27.\nAnd today, speaking at the Homeland Security headquarters, Obama warned Congress not to play politics with the agency\u2019s funding."}
