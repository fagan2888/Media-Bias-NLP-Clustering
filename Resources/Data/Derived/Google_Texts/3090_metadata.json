And, yes, she does have a prenup arrangement.\n\nAyesha has raised eyebrows by setting up a website dedicated to her forthcoming nuptials with Stephen Bence, who has a PhD in astrophysics.\n\nPride of place is given to a supersize picture of her \u00a310,000 Harry Winston peridot and diamond engagement ring.\n\n\n\nLook of love: Ayesha Vardag and soon-to-be husband Stephen Bence\n\n\n\nBling: Ayesha's wedding website and her 10k engagement ring\n\n\u2018It caught my eye amid the fields of diamond rings and the peridot spoke to me as peridots spoke to Cleopatra thousands of years ago,\u2019 she says.\n\nAyesha, 45, who recently reached an out-of-court settlement with her former employer, Raymond \u2018Jaws\u2019 Tooth, after he accused her of trying to poach his clients, says her make-up for the big day will be done \u2018by the artist who styled me for my first glossy magazine feature in Easy Living\u2019.\n\nWho says money can\u2019t buy class?\n\nQueen turns Palace into royal job centre\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile William and Kate are said to be about to present the taxpayer with a new bill of up to \u00a31million for renovation work on their home at Kensington Palace, the Queen is making sure her property portfolio is up to scratch.\n\nLooking for staff? The Queen\n\nThe Royal Household has placed ads on its website for staff to help maintain the monarch\u2019s buildings in and around London.\n\n\n\nThe eight jobs on offer range from a property supervisor on \u00a327,000 to a project manager on \u00a340,000.\n\n\n\nThey total more than \u00a3200,000 in salaries. \u2018We are looking to recruit a number of high-calibre professionals to complement the existing team,\u2019 the advert states.\n\n\n\n\u2018The property section is responsible for the maintenance of the Queen\u2019s official residences and for other properties within the royal estates.\u2019\n\n\n\nLast September, the Royal Household spent more than \u00a3250,000 on four newly created roles to help spruce up the estate, which includes Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace.\n\nBalls gets into an Eton mess\n\nWhen George Osborne and Ed Balls \u2014 both privately educated at St Paul\u2019s and Nottingham High School respectively \u2014 sat next to one another on BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show yesterday, the Shadow Chancellor had a parting shot for the Chancellor. \u2018At least we can agree there are too many Etonians in the Government,\u2019 he said.\n\n\n\nHas he forgotten that his father, Professor Michael Balls, once taught at Eton and that Osborne\u2019s father-in-law, Lord Howell, is an Old Etonian?\n\nTalk about being a snappy dresser. Singer and actress Pixie Lott, 23, celebrated her new single, Nasty, on Saturday night at London\u2019s Steam & Rye Americana-themed bar by posing for a picture in a shark-head costume.\n\nSnap it up: Pixie Lott\n\nIt clearly still rankles with David Heyman, producer of the Harry Potter films, that J. K. Rowling vetoed plans for a musical about life at Hogwarts.\n\nHeyman was being honoured at the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, Harvard University\u2019s social club, when he said: \u2018I only wish J. K. Rowling were here.\n\n\n\n'She might have been less reluctant to allow a musical version of Harry Potter.\u2019", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "divclassbody": "sebastianshakespeareforthedailymail", "news_keywords": "SEBASTIAN,SHAKESPEARE,For,queen,divorce,10k,engagement,ring", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2582412/SEBASTIAN-SHAKESPEARE-For-queen-divorce-10k-engagement-ring.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Ayesha has raised eyebrows by setting up a website dedicated to her forthcoming nuptials with Stephen Bence, who has a PhD in astrophysics.", "title": "For the queen of divorce, a \u00a310k engagement ring", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2582412/SEBASTIAN-SHAKESPEARE-For-queen-divorce-10k-engagement-ring.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/03/17/article-2582412-1BE067E600000578-66_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2582412, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "SEBASTIAN,SHAKESPEARE,For,queen,divorce,10k,engagement,ring", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-03-17T01:48:27.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/columnist-1092116/Sebastian-Shakespeare-for-the-Daily-Mail.html", "section": "Femail", "modified_time": "2014-03-17T01:49:17.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE For queen divorce 10k engagement ring"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Ayesha has raised eyebrows by setting up a website dedicated to her forthcoming nuptials with Stephen Bence, who has a PhD in astrophysics.", "title": "For the queen of divorce, a \u00a310k engagement ring", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2582412/SEBASTIAN-SHAKESPEARE-For-queen-divorce-10k-engagement-ring.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/03/17/article-2582412-1BE067E600000578-66_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "Lifestyle,Femail", "description": "Ayesha has raised eyebrows by setting up a website dedicated to her forthcoming nuptials with Stephen Bence, who has a PhD in astrophysics."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce750\"", "article_summary": "SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE: For the queen of divorce, a \u00a310k engagement ringWedding bells are about to ring a second time for one of Britain\u2019s top divorce lawyers, Ayesha Vardag.\nPride of place is given to a supersize picture of her \u00a310,000 Harry Winston peridot and diamond engagement ring.\nThe QueenThe Royal Household has placed ads on its website for staff to help maintain the monarch\u2019s buildings in and around London.\nAyesha has raised eyebrows by setting up a website dedicated to her forthcoming nuptials with Stephen Bence, who has a PhD in astrophysics.\nThe eight jobs on offer range from a property supervisor on \u00a327,000 to a project manager on \u00a340,000."}
