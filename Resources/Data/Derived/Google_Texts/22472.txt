Letter to the editor (Photo: Times graphic)

My wife retired two months ago. We lost our health coverage under her employer’s plan, and because we are not 65, had to get insurance through MNsure.

For decades I’ve heard people complain they “had to keep working for health insurance.” I had budgeted $950 a month to bridge the gap between retirement and Medicare. Our insurance costs $20.54 per month! Thank you Obama for being so generous with other people’s money. (Dripping with sarcasm here!)

We saved for retirement and live quite comfortably. We should not be receiving $885 a month, the Advance Premium Tax Credit, from the taxpayer.

One of my objections to entitlements to individuals is the unintended consequences. Or is it unintended?

APTCs, as well as cost-sharing for deductibles and copays, are based on income only. Eligibility is not based on assets such as retirement savings. It should be!

By drawing primarily from our Roth funds, which do not count as taxable income, we have the ability to “set” our income low enough to qualify for free insurance, while still spending as much as we desire.

Citizens should be required to spend their savings and sell their assets, with the exception of a house and car, before receiving taxpayer money.

Asset testing is required for Medical Assistance (Medicaid in MN) as well as Medicare Savings Plans and many other forms of public assistance. So why not Obamacare? I can think of only one reason – it was politically important for the Affordable Care Act to be successful as measured by maximum participation.

So why are we taking the money? Four reasons: 1) to make a point, 2) to give more to charity, 3) to recoup some of the excessive taxation by Minnesota liberals, and 4) so my wife and I can afford first class on our monthly air travel.

Again, thank you Obama!
