It was important to be conservative about what financial commitments you make,\" McGuire said.\n\n\n\nSince the 2008 recession, some hospitals have scaled back on construction projects \u2014 except on emergency departments \u2014 and invested more in physician development, medical equipment and information technology.\n\n\n\nOne exception is Detroit Medical Center, which was infused with $850 million for designated construction and capital improvement projects by its new owner, for-profit Vanguard Health Systems.\n\n\n\nSince 2011, DMC has spent $315 million on capital projects at its eight hospitals, leaving about $535 million to be spent by 2017. Projects include a heart center, pediatric outpatient center and two hospital emergency department expansions.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Building a 32-bed adult unit at Providence Park Hospital and modernizing a neonatal unit at St. John Hospital and Medical Center are two of more than a dozen capital projects planned over the next year at St. John Providence Health System.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "Building a 32-bed adult unit at Providence Park Hospital and modernizing a neonatal unit at St. John Hospital and Medical Center are two of more than a dozen capital projects planned over the next year at St. John Providence Health System.", "title": "No longer holding back: St. John plans dozen capital projects", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20130901/NEWS/309019961/no-longer-holding-back-st-john-plans-dozen-capital-projects", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CD/20130901/NEWS/309019961/AR/0/Patrick_McGuire.jpg&MaxW=1400&MaxH=1400", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "tag": "Hospitals", "published_time": "2013-09-01T08:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-03T06:39:00-04:00", "author": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/staff/JAYGRE"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "theme-color": "#b51218"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29c1\"", "article_summary": "No longer holding back: St. John plans dozen capital projectsBuilding a 32-bed adult unit at Providence Park Hospital, modernizing a neonatal unit at St. John Hospital and Medical Center and upgrading telemetry equipment at Providence Hospital are three of more than a dozen capital projects planned over the next year at St. John Providence Health System.\nThe capital spending for 2014 is more than double the $60 million St. John spent in fiscal 2013, he said.\nSince 2011, DMC has spent $315 million on capital projects at its eight hospitals, leaving about $535 million to be spent by 2017.\nFlush off two \"solid\" financial years, the Warren-based, five-hospital Roman Catholic system will spend $140.5 million on capital projects in fiscal year 2014 that began July 1 and a total of $190.8 million over two years for those projects, St. John CFO Patrick McGuire said.\nOne exception is Detroit Medical Center, which was infused with $850 million for designated construction and capital improvement projects by its new owner, for-profit Vanguard Health Systems."}
