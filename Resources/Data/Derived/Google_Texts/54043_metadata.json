That power is temporarily given to the President by the American people with the understanding that the President is a person of integrity. The American people expect the President to protect us and our Allies.\n\nThe American people expect that our President will have a level of integrity that will prevent him from abandoning our Allies, weakening our military and national security, unsecuring our borders, creating racial and class resentment, and siding with our enemies. The American people expect that our President will work hard to protect us and to preserve our Constitution and will not seek to discard our Constitution in order to rule us.\n\nBarack Hussein Obama has lied to the American people and to our Allies from the very beginning. Obama has distanced himself from our Allies, including Israel, Ukraine, Britain, Poland, the Czech Republic, Iraq, and Afghanistan.\n\nObama has lied to the American people about George W. Bush, ObamaCare, immigration, national defense, Benghazi, the IRS attacks on Conservatives, NSA, Global Warming, Red Lines and other military matters, jobs, our economy, taxes, and American Exceptionalism.\n\nWe pray the time will be soon that a President like Ronald Reagan or George Washington will again occupy our White House. A prayer of John Adams is inscribed on the front of the fireplace mantle in the White House State Dining Room. The prayer reminds us of the immense importance that integrity brings to the White House,\n\n\u201cI pray to heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this house and all that hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "LubbockOnline Blog", "og": {"url": "http://lubbockonline.com/interact/blog-post/donald-r-may/2014-11-21/greatest-danger-obama%E2%80%99s-lack-integrity", "site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "type": "article", "title": "The Greatest Danger is Obama\u2019s Lack of Integrity"}, "description": "Presidents of the United States of America have enormous power.\u00a0 That power is temporarily given to the President by the American people with the understanding that the President is a person of integrity. \u00a0The American people expect the President to protect us and our Allies."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb74\"", "article_summary": "A prayer of John Adams is inscribed on the front of the fireplace mantle in the White House State Dining Room.\nThat power is temporarily given to the President by the American people with the understanding that the President is a person of integrity.\nWe pray the time will be soon that a President like Ronald Reagan or George Washington will again occupy our White House.\nThe American people expect the President to protect us and our Allies.\nBarack Hussein Obama has lied to the American people and to our Allies from the very beginning."}
