He noted how he had been waiting for two years to receive a replacement from the Veterans Administration.\n\nAccording to SILive.com, the VA sent Sulsona a new, customized wheelchair on Tuesday, after the letter had already gone viral.\n\nIn response to the VA, which told Buzzfeed that the office was \u201csorry to hear about the reported circumstances surrounding Sulsona\u2019s request for a new wheelchair,\u201d the Vietnam veteran said: \u201cI\u2019d hate to cheapen what these guys did, but isn\u2019t that their job? I should have had the chair I was entitled to, but because of red tape, I never got a chair until now.\u201d\n\nEven so, Sulsona sought to keep public attention focused on the good deeds of those three men who wanted to help a fellow citizen in need\u2013or, in his words, \u201cwho still believe in stepping to the plate.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Sulsona wrote, \u201cThey didn\u2019t ask any questions, didn\u2019t feel the need to fill out any forms or make phone calls. Someone needed help and they felt privileged to be given the opportunity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A thank you letter written by vet Michael Sulsona--a double-amputee, who lost both his legs in service--has made waves across news outlets and social media.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A thank you letter written by vet Michael Sulsona--a double-amputee, who lost both his legs in service--has made waves across news outlets and social media.", "title": "Lowe\u2019s Employees Jump to Assist Double-Amputee Veteran in Need", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/071714_VeteranLowes_sanchez.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-22T17:07:25+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/WyPDpu"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A thank you letter written by vet Michael Sulsona--a double-amputee, who lost both his legs in service--has made waves across news outlets and social media.", "title": "Lowe\u2019s Employees Jump to Assist Double-Amputee Veteran in Need", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/071714_VeteranLowes_sanchez.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "veterans", "published_time": "2014-07-23T03:01:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-22T17:07:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Michael Sulsona, Vietnam veteran, Veterans Administration, Lowe\u2019s, letter, wheelchair, broken, repair, replacement"}, "article_summary": "In the letter, Sulsona wrote expressing his gratitude to three Lowe\u2019s Home Improvement employees for helping repair his wheelchair that had fallen apart in their store.\nAccording to SILive.com, the VA sent Sulsona a new, customized wheelchair on Tuesday, after the letter had already gone viral.\nHe noted how he had been waiting for two years to receive a replacement from the Veterans Administration.\nSomeone needed help and they felt privileged to be given the opportunity.\u201d\nA thank you letter written by Michael Sulsona of Staten Island, New York\u2013a double-amputee, who had stepped on a landmine during a tour in Vietnam and subsequently lost both his legs\u2013has made waves across news outlets and social media."}
