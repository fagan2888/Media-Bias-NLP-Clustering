But not Katy Perry, apparently.\n\nIn an article published on Monday, the singer revealed to magazine Marie Claire that she was mildly outraged that her parents even dared ask to accompany her to President Barack Obama\u2019s second inauguration.\n\n\u201cMy parents are Republicans, and I\u2019m not,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cThey didn\u2019t vote for Obama, but when I was asked to sing at the inauguration, they were like, \u2018We can come.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018No, you can\u2019t. I love you so much, but that \u2014 on principle.\u2019 They understood, but I was like, \u2018How dare you?\u2019 in a way.\u201d\n\nPerry also told the publication she has a wonderful relationship with her parents, Keith Hudson and Mary Perry Hudson. She lauded the fact that there\u2019s no judgment, pointing out that her mom and dad are more \u201cfascinated\u201d by her fame than anything.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily agree with everything I do, but I don\u2019t necessarily agree with everything they do,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re at peace with \u2014 they pray for me is what they do.\u201d\n\nThe singer was an outspoken supporter of Obama during the 2012 election cycle, performing at an October concert fundraiser to drum up dollars for the President. Post-election, she\u2019s also been spreading the word about Obamacare, retweeting a health care-related post on the official Barack Obama Twitter account.\n\n(h/t Newsbusters)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "When someone makes it big in show business and is asked to perform at a presidential inauguration, you'd think that person would invite their proud parents to witness the monumental event.
