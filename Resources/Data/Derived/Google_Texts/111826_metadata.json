John McCain\u2019s daughter says that her father is \u201cdepressed\u201d and \u201cfrustrated\u201d with the impact the \u201chyper-conservative wing of the party\u201d is having on national politics, including on the recent government shutdown.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both frustrated with the idea that only the hyper-conservative wing of the party is going to represent the masses,\u201d Meghan McCain said in a joint interview with ABC and Yahoo News.\n\nSEE RELATED:\n\nMs. McCain, who has her own reality show \u201cRaising McCain,\u201d said the last time she can remember her father was so depressed about the state of politics was after his failed 2008 presidential bid.\n\n\u201cHe is so depressed. He is so downtrodden,\u201d the 29-year-old said. \u201cThe way he\u2019s talking about it, how he\u2019s never seen it this bad in his 30-plus years in office.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain, Arizona Republican, has been one of the most vocal critics of the effort led by Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah to reject any spending bills that included funds for Obamacare, a strategy that a number of Republicans say was doomed to fail and led the nation into a 16-day government shutdown that has hurt the GOP\u2019s national brand.\n\nMr. McCain said that the politics that led to the shutdown marked \u201cone of the more shameful chapters that I have seen in the years I have spent here in the Senate.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain announced this week that he is flirting with running for a sixth term in the Senate \u2014 a move that would make the 77-year-old a target of tea party activists, who think he has sold out conservatism and is part of the problem in Washington.\n\nSome big GOP donors say that Mr. McCain is right to push back against tea party.\n\nMs. McCain, though, said she has reservations about her father seeking another term.\n\n\u201cMy father has more energy than I do,\u201d Ms. McCain said. \u201cSo it is not his age, it is just the idea of having another dirty tea party election.\u201d\n\nMs. McCain said that the GOP is still struggling to reach out to young voters.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are giving young people no reason to join their party right now,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
