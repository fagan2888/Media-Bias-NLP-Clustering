Later, she and her husband took in their daughter\u2019s mid-sized, mixed-breed dog. And then there was Apple, rescued in 2005 when the state shut down a large breeding operation in Dover-Foxcroft.\n\n\u201cThis time, I thought I should get something smaller, easier to take care of and easier to travel with,\u201d said Gallant, who is in her mid-60s.\n\nBut instead of the lap dog she envisioned, she came home from the Bangor Humane Society with Bubba, a 6-year-old, 85-pound yellow Labrador retriever.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that fits in my lap is his head,\u201d she joked in a recent conversation. \u201cHe is the antithesis of what I was looking for. But he is a wonderful dog \u2014 everything I wanted and more.\u201d\n\nVeterinarian David Cloutier of the Veazie Veterinary Clinic says many dog-lovers decide to downsize their dogs as they get older, for reasons ranging from ease of handling to portability.\n\n\u201cA lot of young families want a big, high-energy, durable dog like a Lab to play with the kids out in the yard,\u201d he said. But older people often find that a large breed, however beloved, no longer suits their needs.\n\nFor one thing, the complications of human aging can make it hard to manage a big dog that needs a lot of exercise and training, he said. But even healthy, active older adults may prefer the convenience of a smaller breed.\n\n\u201cIf you travel by air, a small dog can fit in a carrier under the seat,\u201d Cloutier said. \u201cIf you enjoy visiting friends and family, a small dog is generally a more welcome houseguest than a big, rambunctious dog.\u201d\n\nCloutier said most veterinarians are happy to help their clients find a new pet.\n\nIf a purebred dog is their preference, Cloutier says it\u2019s essential to work with a reputable breeder. However, mixed-breed dogs also can be a good choice, he said, including dogs adopted from a shelter or rescue organization.\n\n\u201cDogs are never at their best in a shelter,\u201d he said, \u201cso it\u2019s important to spend as much time as possible getting to know them.\u201d\n\nAt the Bangor Humane Society, Stacey Coventry said finding the right match is key to a happy adoption. An older dog or one with separation anxiety will generally do well in a home where there isn\u2019t a lot of coming and going, for example, while an rambunctious younger dog is a good choice for a more active owner.\n\nCost can be another important consideration for older dog-owners, Coventry said, including food, grooming and veterinary care.\n\n\u201cWe try to get people to think about it rationally, not just with their hearts,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Coventry said there\u2019s no reason an energetic older adopter such as Gallant, who has the support of her husband and adult children as well as an appropriate home setting, shouldn\u2019t adopt a big dog such as Bubba.\n\n\u201cHe has no issues and no bad habits,\u201d Coventry said. \u201cIf you really fall in love with an 85-pound Lab, we would never tell you you shouldn\u2019t have that dog.\u201d\n\nGallant couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n\u201cMy daughter told me not to pass up the right dog just because it was big,\u201d she said with a chuckle. \u201cI was trying to turn myself into a small-dog person, and I ended up with a horse.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Veterinarian David Cloutier of the Veazie Veterinary Clinic says many dog-lovers decide to downsize their dogs as they get older, for reasons ranging from ease of handling to portability.
