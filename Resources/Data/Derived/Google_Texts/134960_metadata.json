Pope Francis has dramatically shifted the message and tone of the Vatican in the last nine months, and he\u2019s forcing Republicans in Washington to reassess their relationship with the Catholic church.\n\nFor years, Catholic leaders\u2019 staunch and very public opposition to abortion, gay marriage and the contraception-related provisions of Obamacare made them natural allies for the GOP. But Francis has scrambled the equation by de-emphasizing hot-button social issues, warning against unchecked capitalism and pushing a populist message at odds with the core of the anti-spending, anti-big government Republican Party.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Francis\u2019s proclamations will fray the ties between the right and the Vatican, but already some conservatives have sharply criticized his economic ideas. At the same time, some on the right have expressed admiration for the 77-year-old pope\u2019s more inclusive approach, including on subjects such as homosexuality. Their praise comes as the GOP itself grapples with growing disenchantment among young people and other demographics for its strident tone on social issues.\n\n\u201cHis economic perspective I\u2019m not particularly enamored with, but his advocacy for the poor, his lifestyle example, his more modern outlook on social issues \u2014 I\u2019ve been very impressed,\u201d said Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Pope Francis is Time's \"Person of the Year\")\n\nLast month, Francis blasted \u201ctrickle-down\u201d economics as an \u201copinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, [that] expresses a crude and na\u00efve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power.\u201d He also criticized the \u201cidolatry of money\u201d and unbridled capitalism as \u201ca new tyranny.\u201d\n\nConservative radio host Limbaugh slammed the comments as \u201cpure Marxism\u201d and other commentators on the right also vehemently disagreed with the pope\u2019s message. One derided Francis as the \u201cCatholic Church\u2019s Obama.\u201d Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a tea party darling, said Francis had made \u201csome statements that to me sound kind of liberal,\u201d though she later walked back that assessment.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Pope's Christmas wish: hope for a better world)\n\nIn an interview with an Italian outlet, Francis replied to his critics: \u201cThe Marxist ideology is wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have met many Marxists in my life who are good people, so I don\u2019t feel offended.\u201d\n\nRep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), who grew up attending Catholic school and graduated from the University of Notre Dame\u2019s law school, told POLITICO that he disagreed with the pope\u2019s economic message. He considers the phrase \u201ctrickle-down\u201d to be a \u201cpejorative\u201d term, \u201clike some liberal speechwriter stuck it in.\u201d But he also argued that the pope\u2019s message should be considered in a broader context.\n\n( PHOTOS: Jorge Bergoglio elected Pope Francis)\n\n\u201cI genuinely believe\u2026supply-side economics does more to help people come out of poverty, move up in the world \u2026 but on the other hand, we shouldn\u2019t be dwelling on wealth,\u201d King said. \u201cThe guidance I\u2019d take from this is, when I support conservative economics, I should do it in a way that helps the most people.\u201d\n\nKing also praised Francis for signaling a more accepting outlook on gay people.\n\n( From POLITICO Magazine: The biggest overlooked trends of 2013)\n\nWhen asked about gay priests last summer, the pope responded, \u201cIf someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\u201d That quote was highlighted in the influential gay rights magazine The Advocate. It named Francis its \u201cPerson of the Year,\u201d noting that as the leader of 1.2 billion Roman Catholics around the world, \u201cwhat he says makes a difference.\u201d\n\nObservers said Francis\u2019s understated approach to polarizing social issues represents a sharp break with his predecessors, including Pope Benedict XVI and Pope John Paul II, though the newest pontiff hasn\u2019t altered church doctrine on those issues.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Joel Osteen: Pope Francis more 'inclusive')\n\nHis inclusive outlook may have played a role in his decision to remove Cardinal Raymond Burke from the Congregation for Bishops, an influential Vatican organization. Burke, an outspoken conservative, in 2004 signaled he would deny communion to John Kerry, a Catholic running for president at the time, because of his support for abortion rights.\n\nSen.
