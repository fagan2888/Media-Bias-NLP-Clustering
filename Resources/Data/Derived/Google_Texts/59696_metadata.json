Unemployment rates, the most familiar and famous of labor market indicators, are nearing pre-recession lows. But the shares of adults with jobs \u2014 or employment rates \u2014 look much less healthy.\n\nThe reason is that the numbers are not quite two sides of a coin. The employment rate counts everyone with a job, while the unemployment rate counts only people actively seeking work. It excludes most people who are unemployed.\n\nAfter most recessions, the numbers have moved in sync as the share of the population neither working nor looking has remained fairly constant. But after this recession, the middle ground has ballooned as fewer people try to find jobs.\n\nEmployment-to- population ratios 50% 55 60 65 70 58.2 62.7 lowest rate reached rate at start of recession United States 58.9% 58.9 current West Virginia 50.7 Mississippi 51.6 Alabama 52.9 Arkansas 54.0 New Mexico 54.6 South Carolina 54.8 Arizona 55.1 Kentucky 55.8 Tennessee 55.9 Michigan 56.0 Louisiana 56.6 Florida 56.9 Oregon 57.0 57.1 Delaware New York 57.1 North Carolina 57.3 57.4 California Nevada 57.9 Georgia 58.2 58.6 Hawaii Oklahoma 58.8 59.2 New Jersey 59.5 Ohio Pennsylvania 59.5 Washington 59.5 Indiana 59.6 Rhode Island 59.9 Illinois 60.2 60.2 Missouri 60.6 Idaho Connecticut 60.7 Massachusetts 60.7 61.3 Montana 61.8 Maine Texas 61.8 Maryland 62.9 Alaska 63.7 Virginia 63.9 Colorado 64.1 64.1 Wisconsin 64.8 Kansas 66.1 Vermont Wyoming 66.2 66.5 New Hampshire 66.9 Utah Iowa 67.0 Minnesota 67.2 South Dakota 67.4 Nebraska 69.1 69.3 North Dakota Employment- to-population ratios 50% 55 60 65 70 58.2 62.7 lowest rate reached rate at start of recession U.S. 58.9% 58.9 current W.V. 50.7 Miss. 51.6 Ala. 52.9 Ark. 54.0 N.M. 54.6 S.C. 54.8 Ariz. 55.1 Ky. 55.8 Tenn. 55.9 Mich. 56.0 La. 56.6 Fla. 56.9 Ore. 57.0 57.1 Del.

Employment rates have climbed above the post-recession nadir in every state, although the improvements are often quite small. In Mississippi, the employment rate is just 0.1 percent above its recent low.\n\nIt also shows that the recovery has a long way to go. Employment rates have rebounded in some states with strong growth, like Utah, Nebraska and Montana. But only three states \u2014 Maine, Texas and Utah \u2014 have retraced more than half their losses.\n\n(Maine is a curiosity. Its economy has expanded less since 2009 than any state\u2019s except Connecticut. Conversely, North Dakota and South Dakota, two of the three states with the most growth over the same period, have seen little recovery in their employment rates \u2014 perhaps in part because their losses were relatively small.)\n\nThe slow progress hints at a bleak reality. Most economists do not expect employment rates to rebound completely. A growing share of adults is too old to work, because baby boomers are aging into retirement while fewer immigrants are arriving to take their places in the work force. The share of workers claiming disability benefits, or retiring early, also increased sharply in recent years.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140616113740, "twitter": {"description": "The employment rate shows that the economy is improving.
