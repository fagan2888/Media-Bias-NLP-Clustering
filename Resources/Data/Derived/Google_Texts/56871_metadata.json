According to the results of the \u201cSwift Prime\u201d trial (Solitaire With the Intention For Thrombectomy as PRIMary Endovascular treatment), researchers believe that removing the stroke-triggering clot, in addition to applying the typical medication, is better than simply using the drug.\n\n\u201cThese findings are a game-changer for how we should treat certain types of stroke,\u201d Dr. Demetrius Lopes, surgical director of the comprehensive stroke center at Rush University Medical Center, said in the press release. \u201cThese outcomes are the difference between patients being able to care for themselves after stroke and being dependent.\u201d\n\nAccording to the study, less than 40 percent of patients who have experienced the most severe form of stroke are able to function normally and independently if they take the stroke drug alone. But the combination of both clot removal and stroke medication improves blood flow to the brain, as well as long-term outcomes, the researchers found.\n\nThe researchers examined 196 patients and divided them into two groups \u2014 one received the drug, IV tPA, and the other group received the combination of the drug and clot removal within 6 hours of stroke symptoms. Typically, doctors undertake a procedure called thrombectomy, in which a catheter is inserted through an incision in a person\u2019s groin, then slid up towards the brain where the clot is grabbed and pulled out.\n\nThe patients who received both the drug and the thrombectomy saw reduced disabilities afterward. Those who received thrombectomy also experienced improved cerebral blood flow; 27 hours after treatment, 82.8 percent of them had mostly normal blood flow, while only 40.4 percent of patients who only received the drug had normal or better blood flow.\n\nInterestingly, in past studies, researchers did not find that this combination therapy was any better than simple drug use. But the authors of this new study argue that \u201cThe Swift Prime trial used better technology, better imaging and quicker intervention, and we obtained a different result,\u201d Lopes said in the press release. \u201cEthically, we can\u2019t deny patients a treatment when we have such strong evidence it\u2019s better for them,\u201d he continued. As a result, hospitals where the study was carried out now have standard procedure to complete a thrombectomy on stroke patients in addition to the drug.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "stroke treatment", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Administering a stroke drug in addition to removing the clot may be the best way to treat a severe stroke, according to a new report.", "title": "New Approach To Stroke Treatment Offers Hope To Severe Stroke Patients", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-approach-stroke-treatment-offers-hope-severe-stroke-patients-329808", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/17/stroke.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Administering a stroke drug in addition to removing the clot may be the best way to treat a severe stroke, according to a new report.", "title": "New Approach To Stroke Treatment Offers Hope To Severe Stroke Patients", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-approach-stroke-treatment-offers-hope-severe-stroke-patients-329808", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/17/stroke.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/17/stroke.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-04-17T17:26:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-17T17:26:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Administering a stroke drug in addition to removing the clot may be the best way to treat a severe stroke, according to a new report."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf78\"", "article_summary": "A new study appears to have pinpointed a better way to treat stroke patients than in the past.\nAs a result, hospitals where the study was carried out now have standard procedure to complete a thrombectomy on stroke patients in addition to the drug.\n\u201cEthically, we can\u2019t deny patients a treatment when we have such strong evidence it\u2019s better for them,\u201d he continued.\nThe patients who received both the drug and the thrombectomy saw reduced disabilities afterward.\nBut the combination of both clot removal and stroke medication improves blood flow to the brain, as well as long-term outcomes, the researchers found."}
