At the 120-pound state high school wrestling championship last week, Malik Stewart accepted defeat like a champ. His opponent, Mitchell McKee, pinned Stewart in just over a minute, but in the moment that followed, Stewart brought the crowd to tears in a display of true sportsmanship: He shook the hand of McKee\u2019s father, who is terminally ill with cancer.\n\n\u201cI heard a couple people as I did it say, \u2018That was pretty classy,\u2019 but I just did it straight from the heart,\u201d said Stewart, a sophomore from Blaine High School. \u201cI went through the same thing when I was younger, but my dad didn't pass by cancer.
