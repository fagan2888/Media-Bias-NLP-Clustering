Mitt Romney devoted an entire speech back in March to attacking Donald Trump in an effort to steer conservatives away from the businessman. Since then, he’s continued hammering the real estate mogul on one issue after another, including Trump’s tax returns. Romney said earlier this week that Trump's refusal to release them was “disqualifying.”

“There is only one logical explanation for Mr. Trump's refusal to release his returns: there is a bombshell in them," he wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday. "Given Mr. Trump's equanimity with other flaws in his history, we can only assume it's a bombshell of unusual size."

But some conservatives are tired of Romney’s continued attacks on Trump over this issue, especially now that he’s the GOP’s presumptive nominee.

“I don’t know what’s wrong with Mitt Romney. It’s so strange,” American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp said on Fox News. “He as a candidate didn’t even release his taxes until Harry Reid took to the floor and claimed that maybe he didn’t pay any income taxes at all, and now all of a sudden Mitt Romney is chastising Donald Trump for not releasing his taxes.”

He continued: “A lot of us voted for him [Romney]. I voted for him, I held my nose, he wasn’t a conservative, and now he thinks he’s channeling conservatives in attacking Donald Trump over this. You know what I’d like Mitt Romney to do? Go home and be quiet, or, start focusing on Hillary Clinton. She’s our political opponent.”

While the GOP is divided after a long and fractious primary, it seems we can all agree—as House Speaker Paul Ryan and Donald Trump said this week in a joint statement—the country can’t afford another four years of the Obama White House, which is exactly what we’ll get if Clinton is elected.

Schlapp is correct: It’s time to start focusing on Hillary.
