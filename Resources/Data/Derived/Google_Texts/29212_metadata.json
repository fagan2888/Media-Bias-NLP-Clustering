Lukyanova, or as she is more internationally recognized, the \"Human Barbie,\" has had an abundance of plastic surgeries in order to alter her looks to resemble a doll. She is also well known for her alternative lifestyle and beliefs.\n\nWhen she first made headlines in 2012, Lukyanova astonished the world with her extreme body alterations that included an almost inhuman waistline that she maintained through a diet of nothing more than carrot juice and chutney. The Ukrainian woman then shocked the world with her desire to become a breatharian, meaning that she would no longer need to eat or drink and could live only on air and light. Now the Barbie look-alike is once again making headlines for her controversial belief that race-mixing creates more flaws in beauty and therefore is causing a bigger need for plastic surgery.\n\nLukyanova recently interviewed with GQ Russian editor, Michael Idov, while modeling for a photoshoot with the magazine. There, she told Idov that, in her opinion, plastic surgery is on the rise because of the \"degeneration\" caused by racial mixing. \u201cFor example, a Russian marries an Armenian. They have a kid, a cute girl, but she has her dad\u2019s nose. She goes and files it down a little, and it\u2019s all good. Ethnicities are mixing now, so there\u2019s degeneration, and it didn\u2019t use to be like that. Remember how many beautiful women there were in the 1950s and 1960s without surgery? And now, thanks to degeneration, we have this,\u201d Lukyanova explained in a recent NY Daily News article.\n\nThe 28-year old loves her own beauty, which she refers to as \u201cNordic type, perhaps with a little Eastern Baltic, but closer to Nordic.\u201d Her counterpart, Justin Jedlica, or \"Human Ken,\" does not seem to think as highly of his feminine mirror-image\u2019s appearance. \u201cI don\u2019t really get her. I don\u2019t get why people think she\u2019s so interesting. She has extensions. She wears stage makeup. She\u2019s an illusionist,\u201d Jedlica explained in his interview with GQ.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "human, barbie, valeria, lukyanova, believes, plastic, surgerys, popularity, due, flawed, race", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "\"Human Barbie,\" Valeria Lukyanova, shocked readers in a controversial GQ interview where she claimed the rise in plastic surgery's popularity is due to the need to correct flaws caused by an increase in race-mixing.", "title": "Flawed Race-Mixing Fuels Society's Plastic Surgery Obsession, Says 'Human Barbie'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/human-barbie-valeria-lukyanova-believes-plastic-surgerys-popularity-due-flawed-race-mixing-275190", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/08/val-4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Human Barbie,\" Valeria Lukyanova, shocked readers in a controversial GQ interview where she claimed the rise in plastic surgery's popularity is due to the need to correct flaws caused by an increase in race-mixing.", "title": "Flawed Race-Mixing Fuels Society's Plastic Surgery Obsession, Says 'Human Barbie'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/human-barbie-valeria-lukyanova-believes-plastic-surgerys-popularity-due-flawed-race-mixing-275190", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/08/val-4.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/08/val-4.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-04-08T13:00:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-08T13:00:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\"Human Barbie,\" Valeria Lukyanova, shocked readers in a controversial GQ interview where she claimed the rise in plastic surgery's popularity is due to the need to correct flaws caused by an increase in race-mixing."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb6b4\"", "article_summary": "When demonstrating the world\u2019s increasing infatuation with plastic surgery, there is no better model to use than Valeria Lukyanova.\nNow the Barbie look-alike is once again making headlines for her controversial belief that race-mixing creates more flaws in beauty and therefore is causing a bigger need for plastic surgery.\nThere, she told Idov that, in her opinion, plastic surgery is on the rise because of the \"degeneration\" caused by racial mixing.\nI don\u2019t get why people think she\u2019s so interesting.\nLukyanova, or as she is more internationally recognized, the \"Human Barbie,\" has had an abundance of plastic surgeries in order to alter her looks to resemble a doll."}
