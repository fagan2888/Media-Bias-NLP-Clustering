UPDATE (WKOW) -- Republican Presidential candidate Ted Cruz made two stops in Wisconsin on Thursday.

During a visit to Dane Manufacturing, Cruz called Donald Trump a "sniveling coward" over Trump's comments about Cruz's wife Heidi. Cruz also told Trump to "leave Heidi the hell alone."

At a rally in Janesville Thursday night, Cruz outlined some of his plans if elected president. The Texas senator said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act and pass a flat tax, which he says will help the economy.

"We will see millions and millions of new jobs, manufacturing jobs coming back to Wisconsin. We will see trillions in new federal government revenue and we will use that money to rebuild our military so it remains the mightiest fighting force on the face of this planet," Cruz said.

The candidate also told supporters he will protect their right to religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms.

DANE (WKOW) -- Republican Presidential candidate Ted Cruz will stay in Wisconsin and campaign in Dane and Janesville Thursday.

He plans to make stops at Dane Manufacturing Co., the place where Governor Scott Walker kicked off his re-election campaign in 2014. Then Cruz will head to House Speaker Paul Ryan's hometown of Janesville. Walker, however, has not endorsed anyone in the race. He says he plans to decide whether to make an endorsement in the race next week.

But Gov. Walker did say Wednesday, while Ted Cruz was campaigning in Pewaukee, that the Texas Senator was the only candidate other than Donald Trump with a chance to win the nomination. His comments were broadcast on WTMJ Radio. When Walker dropped out of the presidential race, he urged others to join him in order to defeat Trump.

Wisconsin's presidential primary is April 5.

Ted Cruz's Janesville event is free and open to the public. It's at 5:00 p.m. at 10 S. High Street in Janesville.
