Millions do, and most of them were crowded into my yoga class last week. In addition to triangle, cobra and head stand, there was an abundance of sneezing, coughing, wiping and wishing there was something they could do to make their symptoms disappear.\n\nEveryone had tried something, with mixed results. Some people get great results from over-the-counter meds. Others react poorly to all that manufactured dryness \u2014 \u201cit feels like a bullet to the brain\u201d \u2014 and are desperately searching elsewhere.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to try juniper,\u201d I heard one yogi tell a fellow sufferer who'd just finished her third round of bee-venom therapy. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that works for me.\u201d\n\nThe only allergy remedy that seems to work for everyone is the Neti Pot. It\u2019s an ancient way to gently wash your nasal passages, using gravity and clean water to flush out the stuff that is making your eyes run, your nose blow, your head miserable.\n\nI used to fear the Neti Pot, even though I knew it was a smart thing to do. Every day \u2014 right up there with brushing and flossing. I imagined I\u2019d lift the little pitcher to my nose, tilt my head to the side, pour warm, slightly salted water into one nostril . . . and before it poured out the other, I would gag, choke and drown.\n\nBut when all else failed and the pollen count was reaching heavenward, I decided to risk it. I\u2019m tickled with the results. The sinus passages really are all connected, and once I relaxed my brain and got my head tilt just-so, in I poured, and out the water flowed, carrying all sorts of pink, yellow and basic black nasal gunk with it.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to gross you out. If I did, I\u2019d tell you about another ancient method of nasal cleansing that involves a long thread and a man in a turban, but let\u2019s stick to the Neti Pot for now.\n\nThe simple healthy lifestyle truth is: It\u2019s extremely beneficial to wash away your nasal gunk on a daily basis. If you were to pick apart your mucus \u2014 interesting, but not required \u2014 you\u2019d find all sorts of irritating agents inside: pollen, dust, pollutants, bits of engine parts, flecks of cheap water bottles and other forms of toxic ickiness that are better off outside you.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what the ancient Ayurvedic practice of nasal washing is all about, and why it\u2019s so effective against allergies and sinus problems. It flushes that irritating stuff away, using gravity and common sense instead of costly and risky steroids, sprays and pills.\n\nThe Himalayan Institute introduced the Neti Pot in 1972 and now it\u2019s become one of the superstars of self-care, widely available. It\u2019s safe to try and a pittance to continue (think sea salt and water), and has none of the nasty side effects of some of the Big Pharma remedies famous for substituting one set of symptoms for another.\n\nCould nasal washing help calm your allergies? Help you sleep better and breathe easier? You won\u2019t know until you try.\n\nBut before you do, know this: It\u2019s best not to wing it with the Neti Pot. You can learn how to do it in less than a minute, but if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, it won\u2019t be fun or effective.\n\nFor divine video instruction, try the Himalayan Institute website.\n\nAnd remember, it\u2019s all in the head tilt. Look down, over a sink, keep your neck still while you gently rotate your head (about 35-45 degrees) until one ear is facing the sink and the other the ceiling. When you\u2019ve reached a comfortable position, hold steady and pour. That way, the salted warm water will flow smoothly from one nostril to the other \u2014 up and around \u2014 and you won\u2019t drown.\n\nBreathe through your mouth. Enjoy the sensation. Long live the Neti Pot! Don\u2019t worry if your doctor\u2019s never heard of it.\n\nMarilynn Preston is a fitness expert, personal trainer and speaker on healthy lifestyle issues.
