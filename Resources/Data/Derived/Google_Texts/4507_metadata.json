Mayer explained that these groups are protected by the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u201cWe spent two-and-a-half years investigating this group and during that time we interviewed law enforcement about why these groups, why these facilities were allowed to exist in the United States. We got a host of reasons, but the number one reason is they are protected by the U.S. Constitution and they are protected by state constitutions in the United States. Really, law enforcement\u2019s hands are tied in trying to shut these groups down.\u201d\n\nMawyer said he believes these groups are planning another attack on Americans.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cNot only do I believe that, not only will people who watch this documentary believe that, but even the law enforcement officials that we have spoken with \u2013 not the ones based in Washington D.C., but the field officers \u2013 they believe that. We\u2019ve had law enforcement tell us they have weapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n\nMawyer was unable to disclose the specifics of the WMD\u2019s to Hannity. He did say that al-Qaeda would \u201clove\u201d to have multiple compounds in the U.S. to hide terrorists and weapons.\n\n\u201cI would say without a doubt al-Qaeda would love to have such compounds that range from 25 acres to 300 acres sitting on American soil in order to hide terrorists, hide weapons, and train future jihadists for the United States. It\u2019s shocking.\u201d Advertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThe film, Homegrown Jihad \u2013 The Terrorist Camps Around The U.S., available for viewing on YouTube, reveals the secret Islamic terrorist camps in America.\n\nh/t: Independent Sentinel", "article_metadata": {"description": "Law enforcement has documented 35 Islamic compounds in U.S.", "author": "Tom Hinchey", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "Law enforcement has documented 35 Islamic compounds in U.S.", "title": "Martin Mawyer: U.S. Islamic Terrorist Groups Protected By The Constitution", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 747, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/homegrownjihad.png", "height": 422}, "updated_time": "2015-01-12T14:01:23-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/muslims-america-terrorist-camps-inside-america/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Law enforcement has documented 35 Islamic compounds in U.S.", "title": "Martin Mawyer: U.S. Islamic Terrorist Groups Protected By The Constitution", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/homegrownjihad.png", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-01-12T13:53:47-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "News", "tag": "Terrorism", "published_time": "2015-01-12T13:53:47-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-12T14:01:23-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "christian action network, martin mawyer, martin mawyer on hannity, sheikh gilani, muslims in america, terrorists in america, homegrown terrorists, terrorist cells in america, homegrown jihad - the terrorist camps around the u.s., al-qaeda, islamic terrorism, terrorism, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "We got a host of reasons, but the number one reason is they are protected by the U.S. Constitution and they are protected by state constitutions in the United States.\nMayer explained that these groups are protected by the U.S. Constitution.\nWe\u2019ve had law enforcement tell us they have weapons of mass destruction.\u201dMawyer was unable to disclose the specifics of the WMD\u2019s to Hannity.\nIt\u2019s shocking.\u201d Advertisement \u2013 story continues belowThe film, Homegrown Jihad \u2013 The Terrorist Camps Around The U.S., available for viewing on YouTube, reveals the secret Islamic terrorist camps in America.\n\u201cWe spent two-and-a-half years investigating this group and during that time we interviewed law enforcement about why these groups, why these facilities were allowed to exist in the United States."}
