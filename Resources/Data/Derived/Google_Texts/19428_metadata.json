Fire departments across the state rely on those volunteers, but now there\u2019s a question about whether cities will now have to pony up for their health insurance.\n\nThe Burlington Fire Department has nine full-time employees and 30 volunteers on the roster. If the department has to pay for those volunteers\u2019 health insurance, it would eat up nearly half of the yearly budget, Fire Chief David Nielson said Friday.\n\n\u201cVolunteers are very critical to how we do it, but also to what we can achieve,\u201d said Nielson.\n\nHe says big changes could be coming for his long list of volunteer firemen if something doesn\u2019t change.\n\n\u201cThe Burlington Fire Department cannot operate without volunteers. They\u2019re valuable employees,\u201d said Nielson.\n\n\u201cI think perhaps the Affordable Care Act just didn\u2019t\u2019 take this into consideration,\u201d said Bryan Harrison, the city administrator for Burlington.\n\nThe ACA requires employers with 50 or more employees who work more than 30 hours a week to help pay for their health insurance or face a stiff penalty. But are volunteers legally defined as employees?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a unique definition in state law and IRS codes that deem a volunteer firefighter, you can compensate volunteer firefighters and they still maintain their status. But by IRS rules they\u2019re an employee so the ACA applies,\u201d said Harrison. \u201cWe have to monitor, or I believe in our case, restrict the number of shifts they can actually work for us.\u201d\n\nAnd that means, at best, Nielson has to get creative with volunteer schedules.\n\n\u201cLimiting the number of hours volunteers can work before we\u2019re obligated to pay them health benefits,\u201d said Nielson. \u201cClearly the city cannot afford to pay all the volunteers in the Fire Department.\u201d\n\nHarrison said the cost would be too high to offer that benefit to all volunteers.\n\n\u201cIf we were to extend full medical benefits to those firefighters, it would be $750,000 that the city hadn\u2019t anticipated. And given the entire fire budget is $1.6 million, that\u2019s a substantial portion of the budget,\u201d said Harrison. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where we\u2019d get that money.\u201d\n\nFire departments across the country that count on volunteers to protect their communities could be in trouble.\n\nThe president of the International Association of Fire Chiefs warned the IRS in a letter that the consequences could be devastating.\n\n\u201cVolunteer fire departments may be unintentionally forced to comply with requirements that could force them to close or curtail their emergency response activities,\u201d said William Metcalf.\n\nMeanwhile, Neilson worries he\u2019ll have a harder time filling his volunteer roster if he can only offer people one 24-hour shift a week.\n\n\u201cWe will need more volunteers and we will need to make sure they get all the training they need to stay proficient and current with all the standards they need to meet,\u201d Nielson said.\n\nThe rules for firefighter volunteers won\u2019t go into effect until 2015, so the city has some time to figure out a good plan.\n\nHarrison is hopeful that the IRS gives them some relief.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BURLINGTON, Wash. -- An unintended consequence of the Affordable Care Act has volunteer firefighters in the cross-hairs.
