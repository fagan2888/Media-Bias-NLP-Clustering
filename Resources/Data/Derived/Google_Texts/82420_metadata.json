There is no air conditioning and the room quickly becomes sweltering as the tropical sun beats down on the metal roof. A black fly buzzes around the room amid the smell of decay.\n\nA Jamaican forensic pathologist and his sweating assistants can merely shrug at the primitive conditions in the facility, which doesn\u2019t even have an x-ray machine to find bullet fragments.\n\n\u201cWhat can I say? The lack of resources is definitely a challenge,\u201d Dr. S.N. Prasad Kadiyala said as he waited for police officers to show up so he could start autopsies on a recent morning inside a hospital complex in gritty Spanish Town, on the edge of the Jamaican capital.\n\nJamaica has had one of the highest homicide rates in the world for years, but its capacity to deal with the wave of killings has not kept pace. While the Caribbean country has made some gains in the gathering and processing of evidence, one of its biggest challenges is simply finding adequate places to store and study the dead.\n\nThe island has not had a national morgue since the 1970s despite widespread agreement that autopsies are often performed in facilities so inadequate that investigations are placed in jeopardy, said Hayden Baldwin, who has worked as a forensic consultant to Jamaica\u2019s police force.\n\n\u201cI have never seen such deplorable conditions and lack of support from a government to resolve these issues,\u201d said Baldwin, a retired Illinois state police officer and director of Forensic Enterprises, Inc. of Orland Park, Illinois.\n\nIn a report on global homicides released earlier this year, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime listed Jamaica as having the world\u2019s sixth highest homicide rate. About a decade ago, it had the highest. The island of 2.7 million people has seen 1,000-plus killings every year since 2004, mostly in slums far from the beach resorts.\n\nRelatively few murders are solved. The conviction rate for homicides is 5 percent, according to a 2013 U.S. State Department report.\n\nPolitical leaders have vowed over the years to construct a modern public morgue, especially after the botched 2007 death investigation of Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer, who died unexpectedly while the island hosted the sport\u2019s World Cup. That year, Peter Phillips, then national security minister, said the Woolmer case \u201cbrought into focus the need for the most up-to-date forensic capabilities possible, including most importantly the construction of a new public morgue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With murder common, Jamaica morgue plans stall", "author": "DAVID McFADDEN", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "With murder common, Jamaica morgue plans stall", "title": "With murder common, Jamaica morgue plans stall", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/21/with_murder_common_jamaica_morgue_plans_stall/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/jamaica-no-place-for-the-dead.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With murder common, Jamaica morgue plans stall", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/jamaica-no-place-for-the-dead.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "With murder common, Jamaica morgue plans stall", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "With murder common, Jamaica morgue plans stall", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff08\"", "article_summary": "There is no air conditioning and the room quickly becomes sweltering as the tropical sun beats down on the metal roof.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsSPANISH TOWN, Jamaica (AP) \u2014 Corpses, the suspected victims of violent deaths, are wrapped in plastic bags or covered loosely in stained sheets.\nThe island of 2.7 million people has seen 1,000-plus killings every year since 2004, mostly in slums far from the beach resorts.\nJamaica has had one of the highest homicide rates in the world for years, but its capacity to deal with the wave of killings has not kept pace.\nIn a report on global homicides released earlier this year, the U.N.
