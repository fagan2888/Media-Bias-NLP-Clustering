Police arrest a homeless man after he allegedly held a young girl at gunpoint inside a gas station bathroom.

According to a police report, Christopher Todd Gard, 40, was arrested Sunday, September 15, following the incident.

The report states the girl and her family were traveling through Oklahoma City when they stopped for gas in the 500 block of S. Meridian Avenue. A family member took the girl inside to use the bathroom and waited outside the bathroom door. Once inside, the girl told police a man locked the door behind her and put an orange shirt over her head and tried to choke her.

The family member heard the girl screaming and couldn't get inside the locked door. A witness grabbed the bathroom key and helped push open the door to free the girl. The girl ran to safety. The witness said the man had a gun and he struggled to get the gun away from him. The gun turned out to be a BB gun pistol.

However, Gard, reportedly wearing only a pair of red woman's panties broke free and took off on foot. The report states another witness chased him and held him down until police arrived and took him into custody.

Gard was arrested and booked into the Oklahoma County Jail. He faces numerous charges including aggravated assault and battery, assault with a dangerous weapon, kidnapping, indecent exposure and possession of a firearm during a felony.
