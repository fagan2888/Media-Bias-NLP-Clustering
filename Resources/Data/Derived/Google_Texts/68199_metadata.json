Tom Rice (R-S.C.) said at the hearing. \u201cBetween the Affordable Care Act, between the limit to access to capital under Dodd-Frank, all these things are well intentioned, but they are significant constraints on small business.\u201d\n\nThe overtime rule \u201cis just more icing on the cake,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Labor Department proposed expanding the number of people who qualify for overtime pay in June.\n\nCurrently, employees who make more than $23,660 a year may not qualify for time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours in a week. The Labor Department is seeking to raise that level to $50,440, so millions of more workers will qualify.\n\nThe Labor Department is expected to finalize the rule by 2016.\n\nDemocrats say it will raise millions of hard-working Americans out of poverty. But Republican complain the overtime rules will hurt the bottom line of many businesses and force them to cut jobs.\n\nOr as Rice puts it, the overtime rules will \u201csmother\u201d small businesses in regulation.\n\n\u201cThis is administration is tone deaf when it comes to actually helping small businesses,\u201d said Rep. Cresent Hardy (R-Nev.).\n\nBut Democrats contested the notion that regulations are hurting the economy.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think we can say that what\u2019s killing jobs is regulation,\u201d said Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.). \u201cWe had a huge thing called the Great Recession that had a huge impact on employment.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cWe\u2019re drowning these businesses in regulation,\u201d Rep.
