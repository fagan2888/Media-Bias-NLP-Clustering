The White House said this would be the fairest way to dissuade employers from offering overly generous coverage.\n\nYet outside groups such as the American Federation of Teachers, a labor union, and the Alliance to Fight the 40, an anti-Cadillac tax group, said anything short of repeal is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s proposal acknowledges that the tax is seriously flawed, but takes extremely modest steps to address the problem,\u201d James A. Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, said through the alliance.\n\nAnother provision was aimed at states that have resisted a key pillar of Obamacare \u2014 the expansion of Medicaid to those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nUnder existing law, the federal government pays the full tab for the expanded population, before scaling back its contribution to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s proposal would allow 19 holdout states to enjoy the 100-percent match for three years, no matter when they expand. While it could grease the skids in states that are considering expansion, it probably won\u2019t get far in Congress.\n\n\u201cI think the reality is that the provision included the president\u2019s budget will never become law,\u201d said Elizabeth Carpenter, a vice president at Avalere Health, a D.C.-based consultancy.\n\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, Georgia Republican, has said his fiscal 2017 budget will, once again, envision the full repeal of Obamacare instead of tweaks that make it more palatable.\n\nRepublican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and David Perdue of Georgia filed a plan Tuesday to repeal and replace Obamacare with a plan that mirrors one by Mr. Price. It would use age-adjustment tax credits and health savings accounts, among other reforms, to shore up health coverage without onerous mandates.\n\nBut at least one aspect of Mr. Obama\u2019s spending blueprint won rare, if guarded, kudos from Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe proposal sets aside $1 billion to fight the opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic that is ravaging the U.S. \u2014 a key priority for Senate Republicans locked in reelection battles in New Hampshire, Ohio and other states.\n\nKevin Smith, a spokesman for Sen. Rob Portman, Ohio Republican, said the senator wants more resources to fight the epidemic but that \u201che also supports, and has voted for, balanced budgets, so he understands the need to prioritize funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, the president did not do that here, but Congress will have to as it moves through the appropriations process,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire Republican, applauded Mr. Obama\u2019s focus on the problem, though she urged the administration to disburse funds that have already been appropriated by Congress, \u201cso that communities have quick access to the resources they need to combat this epidemic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama used his final budget proposal Tuesday to try and shore up his health care legacy before he leaves office, tweaking Obamacare's contentious \"Cadillac\" tax and enticing holdout states to expand Medicaid even as he targets a devastating heroin epidemic that's got the attention of both parties.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama used his final budget proposal Tuesday to try and shore up his health care legacy before he leaves office, tweaking Obamacare\u2019s contentious \u201cCadillac\u201d tax and enticing holdout states to expand Medicaid even as he targets a devastating heroin epidemic that\u2019s got the attention of both parties.", "title": "Obama uses budget to bolster his health care legacy", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/9/obama-uses-budget-bolster-his-health-care-legacy/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/09/obama_security.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/09/obama_security.jpeg", "title": "Obama uses budget to bolster his health care legacy", "description": "President Obama used his final budget proposal Tuesday to try and shore up his health care legacy before he leaves office, tweaking Obamacare's contentious \"Cadillac\" tax and enticing holdout states t", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues"}, "article_summary": "Yet Mr. Obama\u2019s fiscal 2017 blueprint would adjust the 40-percent excise so that firms in areas with particularly expensive health care don\u2019t face an outsized burden.\nMr. Obama\u2019s proposal would allow 19 holdout states to enjoy the 100-percent match for three years, no matter when they expand.\nIt would use age-adjustment tax credits and health savings accounts, among other reforms, to shore up health coverage without onerous mandates.\nBut at least one aspect of Mr. Obama\u2019s spending blueprint won rare, if guarded, kudos from Republican lawmakers.\nTuesday\u2019s proposal would use the average premiums for \u201cgold\u201d tiered plans on each state\u2019s Obamacare exchange as the threshold instead, but only if they exceed the current cutoff."}
