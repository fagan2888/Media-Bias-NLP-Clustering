It's a process that's much harder for her than a heterosexual couple, however.\n\n\n\nWhen a fire breaks out, minutes count for firefighters arriving on the scene.\n\n\n\nFire Captain Andi Mooneyham is one of those firefighters.\n\n\n\nMooneyham and her wife married in California a year ago. When she came back to the Ozarks, they began looking for equality for same-sex couples, starting with her health benefits.\n\n\n\n\"In March of this past year, the Obama Administration mandated that health insurance companies have to offer the same rights and benefits to same-sex couples as they do straight couples,\" says Mooneyham.\n\n\n\nCurrently, the district's policy offers family insurance for heterosexual couples. Chief Darren White says the discussions are new to the district.\n\n\n\n\"This topic was brought up about basically defining a spouse and what a spouse is,\" White says.\n\n\n\nMooneyham proposed a change to the recognition of marriage licenses and the definition of a spouse.\n\n\n\n\"That's going to help me and my partner out financially and stress-wise too to know that I work for a district that supports us,\" she says.\n\n\n\nThe district is insured through Anthem, a spokeswoman says in an email.\n\n\n\n\"We refer to it as a domestic partner, as we don't really get into whether it is marriage or not and we do permit either same sex or opposite sex domestic partner coverage, as elected by the group,\" the statement reads.\n\n\n\nThe decision is left in the hands of the board.\n\n\n\n\"There were some in favor of this and they voiced their opinion as to why and there some opposed and likewise,\" White says.\n\n\n\nCaptain Mooneyham says whether she's gay or straight doesn't determine how she fights a fire and she's proven that over the last eight years she's been with the district.\n\n\n\nEleazar Soto is a firefighter on Mooneyham's shift and says no matter who she loves, they are a family.\n\n\n\n\"If I were to get hurt, she would have my back,\" Soto says. \"Its back and forth, I'm her spine, she's my spine.\"\n\n\n\nChief White says districts handle plenty of issues professionally and avoid distractions.. This is no different.\n\n\n\n\"The citizens should feel comfortable that these people here, these firefighters, these driver operators, these captains, they will continue to do the same work they have always done,\" he says.\n\n\n\nIn the end, Mooneyham is a firefighter at heart and says that'll never change.\n\n\n\n\"I love where I work and my family and friends that I have there,\" she says.\n\n\n\nThe board approved the first change to recognize marriage licenses from other states.\n\n\n\nMembers chose to table the change of definition of a spouse and dependent until their next meeting on September 2.\n\n\n\nIn states where same-sex marriage is legal, insurance companies have four months to become compliant with the act.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2016 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
