Rust College has paid an undisclosed sum to settle a sexual misconduct case brought by three former students at the Holly Springs campus.

The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports by settling the civil case, the college, president David Beckley and former professor Sylvester Oliver avoided trial.

The federal lawsuit was filed in August 2013 by one woman, alleging that Oliver raped her in his campus office and that the college knew he had a history of sexually assaulting women. The lawsuit asked for $2 million in damages. Eight other women joined the lawsuit with allegations dating back to the 1993-94 school year.

In March, Senior U.S. District Judge Neal Biggers Jr. dismissed six of the claims, claiming the three-year statute of limitations had run out.
