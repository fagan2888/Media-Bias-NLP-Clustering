According to Weigel, the ads, presented by pollster Frank Luntz, did not cause members of the group to move away from Trump. In fact, focus group members were more inclined to support Trump following the presentation.\n\nWeigel describes only two of the negative ads presented to the group. The first was an over-the-top ad which, in Weigel\u2019s words, \u201cnot too subtly compare[d] the Republican front-runner to Adolf Hitler.\u201d The panel saw this for what it is \u2014 an insult to their intelligence.\n\nThe second ad was a compilation of unkind comments by Trump about his opponents. Marco Rubio sweats too much; Carly Fiorina talks like a \u201crobot;\u201d Ben Carson is \u201cpathological;\u201d Jeb Bush has to \u201cmeet[] with Mommny and Daddy\u201d for support. This is vintage Trump. Why, by now, would anyone expect a Trump supporter to recoil?\n\nWeigel also describes efforts by Luntz to show that Trump misstates facts, e.g., his claim that thousands of Muslims cheered the collapse of the World Trade Center. I think it has been established that some Muslims cheered, but there is no evidence that thousands did. It\u2019s not clear why a Trump supporter would abandon him over an exaggeration.\n\nThere is a line of attack that I believe might erode Trump\u2019s support and very likely help prevent his support from rising to where it may need to be in order for him to secure the nomination. That line of attack would focus on Trump\u2019s record of non-conservatism \u2014 e.g., his support for universal health care, his glowing remarks about Hillary Clinton, his massive financial support for Democrats in 2006 that led to Obamacare.\n\nWeigel doesn\u2019t say whether Luntz presented such ads to his focus group. Either Luntz didn\u2019t present any or Weigel didn\u2019t think it worth mentioning, perhaps because Trump\u2019s shaky conservative credentials aren\u2019t part of the mainstream media\u2019s critique of Trump.\n\nAccording to Weigel, focus group members were quite attuned to the source of anti-Trump material. They reportedly were skeptical of an ad produced for the Kasich campaign and of criticism based on mainstream media sources.\n\nTo me, this suggests that ads produced for the Cruz campaign (or perhaps for Rubio\u2019s) that focused on Trump\u2019s left-of-center past might make more headway with the billionaire\u2019s supporters. Alternatively, they might at least help limit the level of Trump\u2019s support.\n\nWeigel seems intent on making Trump\u2019s supporters look as bad as possible. He devotes several paragraphs to two supporters who said they wouldn\u2019t urinate on President Obama if he was on fire.\n\nLuntz responded that this is \u201cthe meanest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\nMaybe, but Weigel\u2019s own call for Matt Drudge \u201cset himself on fire\u201d ranks right alongside it. As hateful as a few of the focus group members may have sounded, I doubt that any of them matched Weigel\u2019s body of venomous anti-conservative rhetoric.\n\nYet the Washington Post gives Weigel a place in its news pages from which to work over Trump, his supporters, and other Republican candidates. No wonder the focus group members, along with many conservatives regardless of whom they support, are inclined to \u201cconsider the source\u201d when assessing the Post\u2019s news stories about Trump and the rest of the GOP field.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "The Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel reports on a focus group in which supporters of Donald Trump were shown attack ads against the tycoon.
