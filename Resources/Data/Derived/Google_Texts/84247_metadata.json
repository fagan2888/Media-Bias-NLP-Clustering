Important bathroom policy will finally be determined at the highest levels.\n\nIn early May, public school educators nationwide received a legalistically-worded joint letter from the Departments of Justice and Education explaining how to legally treat transgender students under Title IX of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nCNN boiled it down to \u201cFall in line or face loss of federal funding.\u201d\n\nFriendly federal \u201cguidance\u201d comes after dueling lawsuits between the Feds and North Carolina over that state\u2019s House Bill 2, which establishes statewide restroom regulations. Those regs require that transgender folks use the bathroom appropriate to the sex listed on their birth certificate (whether Kenyan, Canadian or other).\n\nObama, on the other hand, wants Americans to choose the restroom matching their \u201cgender identity.\u201d\n\nConservatives seem most worried, not about the bathroom usage of transgender folks, but that the Obama policy is so loosely defined as to allow non-transgender male persons of heterosexual intent to simply claim to be transgender in order to shower with the girls\u2019 volleyball team or lurk in the powder room.\n\n\u201cHave we gone stark raving nuts?\u201d questioned Sen. Ted Cruz, proclaiming: \u201cGrown adult men, strangers, should not be alone in a bathroom with little girls.\u201d\n\nOddly, neither approach takes biology seriously. There are many cases where people have had their sex \u201creassigned\u201d by surgery. That is, they\u2019ve had their genitalia altered so that former men can have female (or female-like) pudenda, and women can sport something that\u2019s in the ballpark of masculine sex organs.\n\nWhat with the world\u2019s first successful penis transplant having just been performed, future surgeries are likely to create more realistic alternatives to what is available today.\n\nIn any case, the North Carolina law would forget what a person looks like, when determining restroom selection, but, instead, corral folks into the restrooms that would have suited them had they kept going with their original equipment. What this means is that in North Carolina, people who look like men would be forced to share restrooms with little girls, and people who look like women would be forced to share restrooms with little boys. How this solves the problem Cruz brought up, I know not.\n\nSince many people who are now called \u201ctransgendered\u201d are mainly dressing up, while others are undergoing hormone treatments to nurture the sexual characteristics of the sex opposite to which they were born, but haven\u2019t undergone surgery yet \u2014 or never even plan to \u2014 there\u2019s a great deal of ambiguity here.\n\nSo, little wonder, in California, there\u2019s legislation to force businesses to make \u201call single-stall public restrooms\u201d gender neutral. \u201cLet\u2019s make a clear statement that, if you want to go pee, by all means help yourself,\u201d argued the proposal\u2019s author.\n\nBut how much of a problem was this, ever? Bathroom anarchy, i.e. open public access to restrooms without a genital-monitoring law enforcement presence demanding one\u2019s papers, has been working just fine.\n\nSo, why are we talking about this now?\n\nIs this a \u201creactionary,\u201d \u201cfear-based\u201d right-wing panic? Or was this spurred by \u201csocial justice\u201d activists obsessed with the \u201cintersectionality\u201d that we\u2019ve been hearing so much from and about on campuses these past two years?\n\nWhich brings up an interesting point: the question seems to be of \u201csafe spaces.\u201d\n\nTypically, we want restrooms to be safe spaces, where we don\u2019t engage with each other, but do what needs to be done and get out with a minimum of fuss (while not touching the door with our hands as we exit).\n\nThe theory of \u201csafe spaces,\u201d however, has been advanced courtesy of the social justice warriors, who are somehow expressly concerned that no one ever be discomfited on the grounds of sex, gender, race, etc. And ideas, too. On campuses around England and America, \u201csafe spaces\u201d have been set up, complete with pillows, cookies and cocoa, to protect college students from mere ideas they find disturbing. Ideas that run counter to their social justice causes, that bring up facts that they\u2019d prefer not to consider, and arguments that are foreign to their mindsets.\n\nHow they can learn anything with that attitude, I don\u2019t know. Homer, Sophocles, the Bhagavad Gita\u2014 all have shocking things to say, considering the left-wing sensibilities of the Safe Space crowd.\n\nBut the public toilet issue, as it is now being batted back and forth, seems to be a question of \u201csafe spaces for whom?\u201d Progressives seem much exercised to protect the sensibilities of every possible \u201cgender\u201d difference; conservatives are obviously much exercised to protect the sensibilities of children and . . . the \u201ccisgendered.\u201d\n\nRestrooms, provided for public use either by governments or businesses, should be safe spaces for everybody. But when disagreements occur about how to accommodate disagreeing people, with radically different needs, we need a proper venue for discussion and conflict resolution.\n\nWhere would that place be? Not a safe space itself? No. But it doesn\u2019t have to be the most public places, either.\n\nFor my part, it seems the best way to handle the few cases where this matters is as locally and discreetly as possible. Transgender people should be treated with care and respect, as should every person. But we are talking about our private functions here. Even in public bathrooms much of what we do is cordoned off from prying eyes. Must we develop a whole new ideology to accommodate current discord, a \u201ctoiletarianism\u201d?\n\nAnd, more importantly, do we really need a national bathroom policy designed for maximum division in an election year?\n\nBefore politicians solve today\u2019s glaring non-problem in public restrooms, they should solve a real problem first.\n\nJust one.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama and other politicians are taking a wide stance over the nations public restrooms.
