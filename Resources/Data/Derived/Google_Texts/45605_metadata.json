But what California is experiencing is historically low snowpack \u2014 a meager accumulation that has serious implications not only for the state but potentially for the entire West if the drought not just of water, but of snow, persists.\n\nSnowpack at 12 percent of average in the Sierra Nevada means there is less runoff to feed rivers and streams that run through dams to generate cleanly produced hydroelectric power. Despite the state\u2019s ambitious clean-air goals, officials are turning to dirtier, more costly fossil-fuel plants to fill some of the power gap. They also will seek more hydroelectricity imports in a region expected to have markedly less to offer this summer.\n\nAt a minimum, \u201cwe\u2019ll keep the lights on,\u201d said Robert Weisenmiller, chairman of the California Energy Commission. \u201cWe\u2019re not concerned about not having power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re concerned about,\u201d Weisenmiller said, \u201cis the power is going to come from different sources not as benign\u201d for the health of people and the environment as hydroelectricity.\n\nA study this past week by the nonprofit Pacific Institute think tank in Oakland, California, estimated that three years of waning hydroelectricity during California\u2019s drought already have cost utility ratepayers $1.4 billion, including purchases of power from natural gas-fired plants to make up for reduced hydroelectric power.\n\nThe increased reliance on fossil fuel also caused an 8 percent rise in emissions of climate-changing carbon dioxide in California, the Pacific Institute said.\n\nRobert Oglesby, executive director of the state energy commission, said he didn\u2019t expect the decline of hydro power\u2014 and the boost in gas-fired power\u2014 to set back California\u2019s goal of generating 33 percent of electricity from renewable energy by 2020. That\u2019s because large hydroelectric dams, which are controversial because they block natural river flows, are not officially included with solar, wind and other sources in California\u2019s renewable energy equation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California first to feel hydro-power crunch of drought", "title": "California first to feel hydro-power crunch of drought", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "California first to feel hydro-power crunch of drought", "title": "California first to feel hydro-power crunch of drought", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/21/california_first_to_feel_hydro_power_crunch_of_drought/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/california-drought-no-snow.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "California first to feel hydro-power crunch of drought", "title": "California first to feel hydro-power crunch of drought", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/california-drought-no-snow.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ellen Knickmeyer", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4a55\"", "article_summary": "At a minimum, \u201cwe\u2019ll keep the lights on,\u201d said Robert Weisenmiller, chairman of the California Energy Commission.\nThe increased reliance on fossil fuel also caused an 8 percent rise in emissions of climate-changing carbon dioxide in California, the Pacific Institute said.\nSpring is arriving with the Pacific Northwest measuring near record-low-snowfall, and much of the rest of the West below average.\nThat\u2019s because large hydroelectric dams, which are controversial because they block natural river flows, are not officially included with solar, wind and other sources in California\u2019s renewable energy equation.\nSnowpack at 12 percent of average in the Sierra Nevada means there is less runoff to feed rivers and streams that run through dams to generate cleanly produced hydroelectric power."}
