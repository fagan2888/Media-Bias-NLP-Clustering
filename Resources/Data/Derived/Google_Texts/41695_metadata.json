The move would mark the end of Maine Coast\u2019s nearly 60-year history as an independent hospital.\n\nThe agreement must win approval of state and federal regulators before becoming final, a process expected to take at least six months, according to a joint statement released Thursday by Maine Coast and EMHS. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nThe Ellsworth hospital, which opened in 1956, would become the ninth hospital in the EMHS network, which also includes nearby Blue Hill Memorial Hospital.\n\n\u201cWhile we will see a lot of exciting changes, many areas will stay the same,\u201d Charlie Therrien, CEO of Maine Coast, said in the statement. \u201cFor example, our local board will continue to govern the hospital, and donations intended for Maine Coast will stay with Maine Coast. \u2026 An affiliation with EMHS will provide support and additional services that we need in order to grow and navigate the rapidly changing health care environment.\u201d\n\nFinances were one factor in the hospital\u2019s decision to explore joining EMHS, Patricia Patterson King, a spokeswoman for Maine Coast, said in August. The hospital posted an operating loss of nearly $5 million in 2014.\n\nCostly health care infrastructure, including electronic health records, has become increasingly difficult for small, independent hospitals to afford and maintain, Patterson King said at the time.\n\nMaine Coast anticipates no staffing changes as a result of the deal, she said Thursday.\n\nThe agreement would step up an existing relationship between EMHS and Maine Coast, which shares oncology staff with Eastern Maine Medical Center, the system\u2019s flagship hospital in Bangor. The Ellsworth hospital also participates in EMHS\u2019 \u201caccountable care organization,\u201d a health care model outlined under the Affordable Care Act that rewards hospitals financially for keeping patients healthy at less cost.\n\n\u201cOur organizations are a perfect fit to advance the EMHS model of delivering high-quality services close to home,\u201d M. Michelle Hood, president and CEO of EMHS, said in the statement. \u201cBringing Maine Coast, Blue Hill Memorial Hospital and EMHS together would enable us to design a comprehensive, long-term plan for health care in Hancock and Washington counties.\u201d\n\nAs a member of EMHS, the Ellsworth hospital would increase collaboration with Blue Hill Memorial, an EMHS spokeswoman said in August.
