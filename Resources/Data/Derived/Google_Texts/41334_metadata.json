She remembers watching as her own hands dropped lifelessly from the steering wheel onto her lap, still conscious, but unable to move.\n\nThe gunshot wound resulted in a spinal cord injury, leaving her a quadriplegic - unable to walk and with limited upper body and hand movement.\n\nHer art was temporarily abandoned as she learned how to navigate the world with a disability.\n\nThen a therapy session changed everything.\n\n\u201cI had learned from a therapist how to write my name with a pen in my mouth and I took that idea and said, \u2018well, I love painting so much and I want to still have painting in my life. I should try painting this way,\u2019\u201d Par\u00e9 said.\n\n\u201cI found that I could do it and kept doing it and ever since then I\u2019ve been developing myself as an artist but as a mouth-painting artist.\u201d\n\nShe began with stick figures, and worked her way up to complex portraits and landscapes.\n\n\u201cIt is like starting over again,\u201d Par\u00e9 said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like it was automatically as good as I had been with my hands.\n\n\u201cI had to learn what my neck could do and what motions would mimic a flick of the wrist or a light shading touch with the hand. I experimented a lot to find the brushstrokes I had before.\u201d\n\nNow, Par\u00e9 serves as an ambassador for Mouth and Foot Painting Artists, a group of working artists with disabilities.\n\nShe recently wrapped up a North American tour at a stop at the St. Petersburg Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nWith her easel set up, a palette of acrylic paints nearby and a paintbrush gripped tightly between her teeth and lips, Pare painted while onlookers watched.\n\nMost of Par\u00e9\u2019s paintings are brightly colored depictions of people, sometimes imagined, sometimes celebrities like Pierce Brosnan as Agent 007 or fellow painter Frida Kahlo.\n\nIt She said it took years for her to base art on her experience as a gunshot victim and disabled person, but the \u201cHeavy Series\u201d changed that. The paintings, mostly devoid of color, depicted images like clouds hanging by ropes or birds tied to boulders.\n\n\u201cIt was my attempt at creating images that if an able-bodied person were to look at them, might visually give them an idea of what the heaviness of paralysis might be like, the heaviness of the body and spirit, something that would give them a tactile experience of it,\u201d Par\u00e9 said.\n\nThrough her art and mouth-painting demonstrations, Par\u00e9 hopes to inspire people - those with disabilities and those without \u2013 to continue their passions no matter what obstacles they encounter.\n\nSee more of Mariam Par\u00e9's art.\n\nDaylina Miller is a reporter with WUSF in Tampa.
