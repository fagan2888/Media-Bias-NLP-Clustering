David Vitter (R-LA) that if Vitter wins the Louisiana gubernatorial race, Maness would be \u201cvery interested in his seat, and we are taking a very hard look at the seat.\u201d\n\nManess failed to win the Louisiana Senate race in 2014 against incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) and establishment Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), who eventually won the race. But he won the respect of conservatives across the state and nation with his grassroots campaign.\n\nOn Breitbart News Sunday, Maness blasted the Supreme Court for once again deciding to \u201clegislate from the bench\u201d last week in its rulings on Obamacare and gay marriage. He said the \u201cmost egregious decision\u201d was the high court\u2019s ruling that \u201cgay marriage is an inherent right under the Constitution.\u201d Maness predicted that, like with the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision, last week\u2019s gay marriage ruling will set off another long cultural battle.\n\nManess had some serious concerns about how the ruling would impact religious liberty. He said \u201cwe need to go ahead and make sure that religious liberties are protected for all. We need to make sure that the Constitution is not misinterpreted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to ensure that this decision doesn\u2019t flow into all kinds of other discrimination practices against folks because of their religious beliefs, whether they be personal, organizationally or culturally,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s what our country is built on and we need to make sure this decision is implemented fairly and with equality.\u201d\n\nHe said he was also \u201cdisappointed but not surprised\u201d by Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019s deciding vote in the Obamacare ruling because, according to Maness, Roberts, who deemed that Obamacare was a \u201ctax\u201d (even though the Obama administration claimed that it wasn\u2019t) when his decisive vote upheld the law when it first came before the Supreme Court in 2012, \u201chas shown a penchant for rewriting that law to save it.\u201d\n\nManess said though he heard that \u201csecretly a lot of Republicans are happy that the court\u201d ruled to save Obamacare again, \u201cthe grassroots are very dissatisfied with the court and their inability to read the law\u2026 and reinterpret what plain words mean.\u201d\n\nOn the Obamatrade deals, Maness said he \u201ccannot fathom a good reason why this Republican Congress will give this particular president more power under TPA [Trade Promotion Authority], especially if we have to keep the agreements like TPP [Trans-Pacific Partnership] and TiSA [Trade in Services Agreement] secret until TPA is passed.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously there are things that are going to hurt the american people in these bills,\u201d Maness said, recognizing that Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) has been one of the only lawmakers who has been revealing truths about the trade bills that the bipartisan permanent political class want to hide from the American public.\n\nOn the 2016 field, he said there are \u201cplethora of good, solid candidates\u201d in the field and every one should be vetted thoroughly in the coming months. He said he was looking for a candidate who has \u201cachieved victory when the odds said it was against them\u201d and for \u201cfolks that believe in a principled view of the Constitution and what it says about the limited role of our federal government\u201d in addition to someone who will fight for a \u201cstrong national defense but will insist on the Constitutional powers being adhered to.\u201d He also said the Republican nominee should have a \u201cstrong record of principled decision making that doesn\u2019t go with the flow.\u201d\n\nHe was critical, though, of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL). Maness said he\u2019s \u201cnot happy with his stance on immigration and I certainly wasn\u2019t happy with what he said on the marriage decision.\u201d Maness noted that Rubio essentially said \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t fight it and we should just move on\u201d and sounded like the most liberal of Republicans in doing so.\n\nAfter he failed to win Louisiana\u2019s Senate race in a better-than-expected showing in 2014, Maness started his GATOR PAC, which formed to \u201cinspire and recruit conservative activists and citizen leaders who are committed to accountability in government, constitutional principles, certainty and prosperity.\n\nHe said that the PAC ensures that he will start any future candidacy with \u201ca good base\u201d and mentioned that his organization has \u201ckept the fundraising machinery well-oiled\u201d in addition to training hundreds of grassroots activists across Louisiana.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rob Maness Leaving Door Open to Another U.S. Senate Run", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rob Maness Leaving Door Open to Another U.S. Senate Run", "title": "Rob Maness Leaving Door Open to Another U.S. Senate Run - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Rob-Maness.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/29/rob-maness-leaving-door-open-to-another-u-s-senate-run/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rob Maness Leaving Door Open to Another U.S. Senate Run", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Rob-Maness.jpg", "title": "Rob Maness Leaving Door Open to Another U.S. Senate Run - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-06-29T06:06:24-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe310d\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRetired Air Force Colonel Rob Maness is leaving the door open to another possible run for U.S. Senate in Louisiana, and on Breitbart News Sunday, Maness showed why his message will resonate with a core base of conservative supporters should he choose to do so.\nOn Breitbart News Sunday, Maness blasted the Supreme Court for once again deciding to \u201clegislate from the bench\u201d last week in its rulings on Obamacare and gay marriage.\nManess had some serious concerns about how the ruling would impact religious liberty.\nManess said he\u2019s \u201cnot happy with his stance on immigration and I certainly wasn\u2019t happy with what he said on the marriage decision.\u201d Maness noted that Rubio essentially said \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t fight it and we should just move on\u201d and sounded like the most liberal of Republicans in doing so.\nHe said \u201cwe need to go ahead and make sure that religious liberties are protected for all."}
