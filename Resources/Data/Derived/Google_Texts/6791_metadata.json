Well, absolutely nothing. That\u2019s why Jason James Richter, the actor who played Jesse, was dumbfounded when a GOP Congressman Tim Griffin used an image from the movie in an anti-ObamaCare campaign.\n\nThe Free Willy poster was posted on Griffin\u2019s Facebook page on Thursday. The image, which shows Willy jumping over the wall as Jesse throws out an epic fist punch, also bears the message: Free America.\n\nGriffin made the poster after SeaWorld announced that they would be cutting hours to avoid paying more health insurance for their employees.\n\nBut this article isn\u2019t about SeaWorld\u2019s decision and really, it isn\u2019t about ObamaCare. It\u2019s about Free Willy.\n\nJason James Richter told Buzzfeed: \u201cI think it\u2019s terrible. To many thought to convey in 140 characters. Shameful comes to mind though. The film holds a special place for a lot of people. To use the iconic poster image to further a political agenda is shameful.\u201d\n\n140 characters may not be enough to convey the complex thoughts regarding the issues of ObamaCare but Free Willy actor Jason James Richter and congressman Tim Griffin certainly did try.\n\n\n\nFree America (from #Obamacare) #ar2 pic.twitter.com/dP6sy6EnGJ \u2014 Rep. Tim Griffin (@RepTimGriffin) September 12, 2013\n\n\n\n@RepTimGriffin really congressman? Don\u2019t you have better things to do? Go do your job, sir. \u2014 Jason James richter (@JasonRichter_) September 12, 2013\n\n\n\nAny word yet on whether @JasonRichter_ also thinks it\u2019s terrible that SeaWorld\u2019s employees and their families are being hurt by #Obamacare? \u2014 Rep. Tim Griffin (@RepTimGriffin) September 12, 2013\n\n\n\n@RepTimGriffin isn\u2019t really the corporate greed that is harming these family\u2019s? Maybe think about that, sir. \u2014 Jason James richter (@JasonRichter_) September 12, 2013\n\n\n\n@RepTimGriffin and don\u2019t you have an unnecessary war to go stop? \u2014 Jason James richter (@JasonRichter_) September 12, 2013\n\nWhat do you think of the Free Willy poster. Was it out of line for the congressman to use a movie image for a political message?\n\n\n\nNever expected I\u2019d get a tweet from a congressman\u2026what a day hahaha wow. \u2014 Jason James richter (@JasonRichter_) September 12, 2013", "article_metadata": {"description": "What does a Free Willy poster and ObamaCare have in common?
