BGR Group, a largely Republican public affairs firm, has hired an official who served in both the Obama and Clinton administrations.



Maya Seiden spent five years at the State Department, most recently serving as the chief of staff to the deputy secretary of State.



It’s a strategic move for the GOP firm, which only has two other Democratic lobbyists on staff.
