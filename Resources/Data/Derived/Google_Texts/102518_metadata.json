As is always the case in Washington scandals, the question of whether crimes were committed arises \u2014 and now, the companion question of whether lawmakers who encouraged executive lawlessness are guilty of crimes.\n\nFor the time being, the lawsuits brought by conservative organizations victimized by the IRS have alleged only civil wrongs: principally, the deprivation of their constitutional rights to free speech and association, and of their statutory right to tax-exempt status. Nevertheless, these claims could trigger criminal jeopardy. For example, federal law (specifically, Section 242 of the penal code) makes it a crime for a government official to \u201cwillfully subject[] any person\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d#page#\n\nWithout a competent, impartial investigation, it will be tough to amass sufficient evidence to prove a willful violation of law. The officials implicated would surely claim \u2014 however dubiously \u2014 that they were just trying to enforce ambiguous regulations. Moreover, even if executive-branch officials could be proved criminally culpable, any prosecution of members of Congress would face a severe roadblock: the broad constitutional immunity lawmakers enjoy whenever arguably engaged in \u201clegislative acts.\u201d Remember Representative William Jefferson, whose crass acceptance of bribes did not stop a federal appeals court from invalidating an FBI search of his Capitol Hill office.\n\nIn any event, as I argued here last weekend, to focus on criminal or civil liability is to miss the point. The importance of government officials lies in the public trust reposed in them and the awesome power it entails. When they demonstrate themselves to be unworthy of that trust, the imperative is to take the power away.#ad#\n\nThe IRS has become a vehicle of repression \u2014 one that Democrats have further empowered through Obamacare. Its budget should be slashed, and we should figure out better ways to raise revenue. In addition, government officials have engaged in conduct that, at a minimum, grossly disregarded the constitutional rights our government exists to safeguard. Whether such serious misbehavior is attributable to incompetence or corruption, the officials who engaged in it should be defrocked. Most of us couldn\u2019t care less whether they are sent to jail or successfully sued, but we should all insist that they no longer wield power.\n\nThe most ominous development in the IRS scandal is the confederation of executive and congressional authority in opposition to our fundamental rights. The accumulation of all government powers in the same hands, Madison warned, \u201cmay justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\u201d In a free society, powers must be separated. The Framers thus gave us a Constitution that heeded the wisdom of Montesquieu:\n\n\nWhen the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.\n\n\nThe IRS scandal presents a textbook case of tyrannical execution. It is fraught with peril. We are dealing not merely with a single president, who presumes to rule by decree; nor just with his congressional partisans, who presume to pull the executive bureaucracy\u2019s coercive levers. Enormous power is cumulating in an ideological movement that is hostile to free expression, one that views its political opposition not as fellow citizens with a different point of view but as enemies to be silenced and destroyed.\n\nFrightening times.\n\n\u2014 Andrew C.
