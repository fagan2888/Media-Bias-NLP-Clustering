The radio host was ranting against Democrats like Hillary Clinton who have denounced the decision, which will allow closely-held companies to deny employees coverage for birth control, when he suggested there\u2019s one easy way for women to avoid the need for birth control.\n\nRepeating a question he received from a caller yesterday, Limbaugh asked, \u201cWhen did birth control pills become so important to the human condition the federal government requires every insurance policy to cover them?\u201d He noted that eye exams and dental work are not covered under the Affordable Care Act, but contraception is. \u201cWhich is worse, to go blind from lack of regular eye exams or to get pregnant?\u201d\n\nRELATED: Limbaugh: Hobby Lobby Ruling Strikes Blow Against Obama \u2018Assault\u2019 on Liberty\n\n\u201cPregnancy is something that you have to do to cause,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just happen to you while you\u2019re walking down the street, except in this case of sexual abuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut in the normal, everyday flow of events, pregnancy requires action that has consequences,\u201d he continued. \u201cYet we treat it as a great imposition that women need to be protected from. It\u2019s a sickness, it\u2019s a disease, it\u2019s whatever, and there\u2019s got to be a pill for it. And yet they wouldn\u2019t have the problem if they didn\u2019t do a certain thing. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\n\nTo reiterate Limbaugh\u2019s message to women everywhere, just don\u2019t do that \u201ccertain thing,\u201d which we dare not mention on the radio, and you\u2019ll have no need for birth control.\n\nListen to audio below, via The Rush Limbaugh Show:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to listen.\n\n[h/t The Week]\n\n[Photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "There were echoes of Rush Limbaugh's infamous attack on Sandra Fluke in his commentary Wednesday about the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision, though he did", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-02-at-12.40.17-PM.png", "title": "Limbaugh: Women Wouldn\u2019t Need Birth Control If They Didn\u2019t \u2018Do a Certain Thing\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "There were echoes of Rush Limbaugh's infamous attack on Sandra Fluke in his commentary Wednesday about the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision, though he did not name any specific names this time.", "title": "Limbaugh: Women Wouldn't Need Birth Control If They Didn't 'Do a Certain Thing'", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-02-at-12.40.17-PM.png", "creator": "@themattwilstein", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2014-07-02T15:53:12+00:00", "keywords": "online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYet we treat it as a great imposition that women need to be protected from.\nListen to audio below, via The Rush Limbaugh Show:Please enable Javascript to listen.\nIt\u2019s that simple.\u201dTo reiterate Limbaugh\u2019s message to women everywhere, just don\u2019t do that \u201ccertain thing,\u201d which we dare not mention on the radio, and you\u2019ll have no need for birth control.\nAnd yet they wouldn\u2019t have the problem if they didn\u2019t do a certain thing.\nThe radio host was ranting against Democrats like Hillary Clinton who have denounced the decision, which will allow closely-held companies to deny employees coverage for birth control, when he suggested there\u2019s one easy way for women to avoid the need for birth control."}
