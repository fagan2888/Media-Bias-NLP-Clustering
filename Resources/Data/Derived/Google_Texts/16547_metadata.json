And its geographic position is the only thing that can be considered to the left in the commonwealth.\n\nThe district, formerly the breeding ground of folks described as \u201cyellow dog Democrats,\u2019\u2019 can now better be viewed as the Rick Pitino of political subdivisions. The veteran basketball coach, you\u2019ll remember, ventured from the Big Blue of the University of Kentucky to the red of the University of Louisville, forever drawing the enmity of Wildcat fans.\n\nWell, the First District also has gone from blue to red, ditching a Democratic Party that dominated local politics for decades and produced some of the commonwealth\u2019s most noteworthy politicians of the 20th Century \u2013 folks like legendary Vice President Alben Barkley of Paducah, former governor and senator Earle Clements of Morganfield and, of course, A.B. \u201cHappy\u2019\u2019 Chandler, of Corydon \u2013 in favor of the Republican Party in the concluding decades of the 20th Century.\n\nThe First District incredibly provided President Obama with a mere 32.1 percent of the vote in 2012. There was a time not that long ago when Republicans didn\u2019t even bother to contend in many regions of the district, making the speed at which voters flipped from the party of Jefferson to the GOP all the more remarkable.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than 20 years since the First District congressional seat was held by a Democrat and there\u2019s no reason to think that lack of fortune is going to end anytime soon. Sam Gaskins, a Marine and Army veteran from Hopkinsville with no political experience, is the lone Democrat seeking the seat in the May 17 primary.\n\nThere are reasons aplenty for the transformation. The district has always had a decidedly conservative bent, particularly on social issues like abortion and guns, and is decidedly more rural than the nation as a whole. As the Democratic Party turned more liberal and urban, many folks went looking for a political party that better reflected their views.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that Carroll Hubbard Jr., a Democrat who held the seat from 1975 to 1993 wound up serving two years in prison for federal campaign finance law violations and also was involved in the House banking scandal during his tenure on Capitol Hill. His successor, Tom Barlow, who was and is a fine gentleman, didn\u2019t possess the dynamism required of a federal office holder and he served only two years \u2013 the last Democrat to hold the seat.\n\nBut those weren\u2019t the only reasons for the metamorphosis. It\u2019s no secret that the Republican Party is increasingly becoming the party of white folks, particularly white men, and lord knows there\u2019s a ton of Caucasian votes to be harvested in Kentucky\u2019s First Congressional District, which the Census Bureau reports is 90.4 percent white. That compares to 77.7 percent for the nation as a whole.\n\nThere are pockets of African-Americans in the district, in places like Paducah, Fulton County and Hoptown, where almost one-third of the residents are black. But spots like Marshall County, which at one time was reputed to have no black citizens living within its borders and today is 98.57 percent white, are more representative of the district as a whole. Latinos, the fastest growing sector of the U.S. population, constitute only 1.5 percent of the total.\n\nDemocrats also have been affected by organized labor\u2019s loss of influence. Unions once held significant sway in the district. J.R. Gray, of Benton, a union advocate who served as former Gov. Steve Beshear\u2019s first secretary of labor, was a potent presence during his tenure as a state representative during the 1980s.\n\nBut that influence waned as factories moved out, some of them destined for overseas. The coup de grace came in 2007 when German-based Continental Tire closed its huge plant near Mayfield, a move that carried significant impact on the local economy.\n\nAll of that has benefited Republicans, and no one has benefited more than Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Hopkinsville, who has spent most of his 22 years in Washington following that grand, old, Kentucky tradition of shilling for the coal industry, laboring assiduously to undermine the Obama Administration\u2019s ongoing efforts to clean the nation\u2019s air and waters, protect asthmatic children from noxious emissions and address the obvious dangers of global climate change.\n\nLike most of the folks he has served in Congress, Whitfield is a former Democrat, serving as such in the state legislature in the early 1970s, making the switch at the behest of kingmaker, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, of Louisville, to take on and ultimately defeat Barlow in 1994. As chairman of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power, Whitfield has devoted most of his time in recent years to killing the president\u2019s Clean Power Plan intended to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.\n\nSince arriving in Washington, records show, Whitfield has reaped, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, $769,815 in campaign contributions from the utility industry, $563,097 from oil and gas interests and $334,477 from the mining sector.\n\nNot a bad little haul.\n\nWhitfield has been careful to avoid positioning himself as a global climate change denier. But his votes do all the talking. The League of Conservation Voters has given him a dismal lifetime score of 13 percent on environmental issues \u2013 6 percent in 2015. In 2014, he voted in support of the Secret Science Reform Act, aimed at crippling the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to use the best available science in establishing public health safeguards.\n\nIf he\u2019s not a denier, he\u2019s certainly an agnostic.\n\nRegardless, Whitfield has mercifully decided to call it a career. His decision might have something to do with a House Ethics Committee probe into whether he improperly aided the lobbying work of the firm employing his wife, Connie Harriman-Whitfield, in behalf of the Humane Society Legislative Fund.\n\nSince arriving in Washington, records show, Whitfield has reaped, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, $769,815 in campaign contributions from the utility industry, $563,097 from oil and gas interests and $334,477 from the mining sector.\n\nIt seems the Office of Congressional Ethics found that Whitfield\u2019s office helped set up \u201cas many as 100 meetings\u201d for his wife\u2019s organization and that he conducted joint meetings with her to promote organization\u2019s legislative priorities.\n\nImagine that.\n\nSo, with Western Kentucky Democrats barely registering any interest in competing for the open slot, the likely successor will emerge from the Republican primary where former state Agriculture Commissioner James Comer, of Tompkinsville, who last year finished within 85 votes of capturing the GOP gubernatorial nomination that instead went to Gov. Matt Bevin (heaven help us) is considered the favorite.\n\nOne internal poll conducted for the Comer reportedly had him ahead by about 30 points. He hails from the eastern part of the district which also is the most heavily Republican, something that is expected to work in his favor.\n\nBut Comer has baggage \u2014 a former girlfriend alleged during the gubernatorial primary that he abused her. In a letter to the Courier-Journal of Louisville, the woman related that her relationship with Comer was \u201ctoxic\u201d and \u201cabusive.\u201d\n\nComer denied the allegations, continues to do so, but it likely had an impact on his effort.\n\nThen there\u2019s Mike Pape, of Hopkinsville, who was Whitfield\u2019s district director for 21 years and carries the retiring lawmaker\u2019s endorsement. Pape is running \u2013 without irony, mind you \u2013 as an outsider, foisting the same scam on the voting public that has worked so well thus far for Donald Trump.\n\nPape is running so hard to the right he\u2019s making Ted Cruz look like Saul Alinsky. He has produced what universally is regarded as the worst campaign ad in a political season that reached historic proportions for terrible campaign ads. His spot, which walks the fine line between obnoxiousness and racism, depicts three men, apparently meant to be Latinos, one with an awful mustache, cutting through a chain-link fence that is supposed to represent the barrier along the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nOf course the three comic book Latinos are discussing Republican politics as they enter the U.S. vowing to stop Trump from building the wall across the border when one offers that Pape must also be stopped. As an extra added bonus, the soon-to-be undocumented worker asserts Pape will also work with Cruz to end Obamacare.\n\n\u201cVamonos!\u2019\u2019 declares one as the meander through to rape, pillage and keep Pape from building a wall.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one who\u2019ll stop me from standing up for you,\u2019\u2019 Pape declares.\n\nComer has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association and the Chamber of Commerce, leading Pape to dismiss the support as \u201cthe establishment\u2019\u2019 getting behind its candidate, sounding for all the world like a drug-addled hippie in a bad 1960s movie.\n\nQuite a campaign. But there\u2019s speculation that the god-awful ad might actually help Pape in a district where more than nine out of every 10 residents are white and people of color are viewed with concern.\n\nAnd this is what the Republican and Democratic parties are offering the public in the year 2016. No wonder everybody\u2019s mad.\n\nWashington correspondent Bill Straub served 11 years as the Frankfort Bureau chief for The Kentucky Post.
