Labor activists are accusing T-Mobile of labor violations ahead of the company's annual shareholder meeting on Thursday. They say the telecommunications company is not treating U.S. workers fairly by discouraging them from unionizing.

"Worldwide, and especially in Germany where T-Mobileâ€™s parent company Deutsche Telekom is based, T-Mobile workers benefit from better protections than their American counterparts because of an employee union," the activists wrote in a petition to the company.

At the shareholder meeting, the Marco Consulting Group will call on T-Mobile's board of directors to conduct a human rights risk assessment. Nearly 28,000 protesters have signed the petition demanding that the company stop violating the rights of U.S. workers.

This comes after the National Labor Relations Board expressed concerns that T-Mobile illegally interrogated, suspended and discharged employees to discourage them from forming a union.

"The petition launched by SumOfUs.org and signed by thousands of T-Mobile customers, calls on T-Mobile to stop treating US workers differently from other workers internationally," the petition says.
