Instead, they jeopardize their futures. There\u2019s not a worse decision a young American can make than attending college sans parental money or massive scholarship.\n\nLet\u2019s start off with the basics. In 2012, 71 percent of all students who graduated accrued some amount of student loan debt, with the average amount of debt soaring to $29,400. More than half of student loans officially became delinquent or in deferral in 2013. New information indicates this trend will only worsen; recent college graduates face the worst unemployment rate in more than 20 years, as well as severe underemployment, with 44 percent of grads saying they could find work but not enough of it. Not even the vaunted STEM fields are immune from the perils of cheap labor, smartsizing, and the Great Recession.\n\nHere\u2019s where college apologists will say debt used to acquire a degree is \u201cgood debt\u201d since it ultimately pays off in the end \u2014 both because the degree will land you a job and provide \u201cintellectual enrichment\u201d and \u201ccritical thinking\u201d and other impossible to quantify, dubious buzzwords used in college marketing pamphlets across the country.\n\nThis baby boomer-esque sentiment is garbage.\n\nFirst of all, there\u2019s a decent chance that students will be indebted forever. Tuition is increasing so much it\u2019s outpacing inflation. That money isn\u2019t even going into educating the students and/or providing them with highly valuable internships during school or jobs after graduation. Instead, much of the tuition dollars are being funneled into administrator salaries, as well as salaries for coaches and athletic directors and other sports-related nonsense. Tuition dollars are also crucial in providing amenities that are absent in some 5-star hotels. Yet colleges across the country are sporting these luxuries, things like mega-gyms, gourmet eateries, washing machines that make the Curiosity rover look like an obsolescent tin can, and more. Colleges are spending money on salaries and sales gimmicks, not on what matters. \u201cHey, kids! Come to our college; we\u2019re Club Med. Oh and yeah there are some courses but that\u2019s not important.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that in 2011, a Chronicle of Higher Education study found that \u201clarge numbers of U.S. college students can be accurately described as academically adrift. They might graduate, but they are failing to develop the higher-order cognitive skills that it is widely assumed college students should master.\u201d To put it in less pedantic language, students are paying tens of thousands of dollars for a degree and walking away equally empty-headed as they were when they graduated high school, straight-A\u2019s notwithstanding. The degree, which failed to get them a job, failed to educate them as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For today's grads, a job is no sure thing, but decades of debt may be.
