Three out of seven seats on the Denver School Board are being contested Nov. 3. Here are some important Denver Public Schools data with which you should be acquainted before you vote:\n\n\u2022 ACT scores (the bar by which \u201creformers\u201d cite college readiness) have remained stagnant, with a slight drop to 18.3 in 2015. Twenty-one is the number generally cited for college readiness; 26 is the average score needed to enter CU Boulder.\n\n\u2022 The DPS graduation rate is 62.8 percent. Colorado\u2019s rate is 77.3 percent. The last available remediation rate stands at 52.4 percent.\n\n\u2022 Academic proficiencies for DPS students are: reading, 54 percent; math, 47 percent; and writing, 44 percent.\n\n\u2022 Achievement gap increases since 2005, based on economics (free and reduced-lunch students and paying students): reading, 7 percentage points, from 29 to 36; math, 14 percentage points, from 20 to 34; and writing, 9 percentage points, from 27 to 36.\n\n\u2022Achievement gap increases based on ethnicity (between white students and black and Hispanic students): reading, 4 percentage points, from 36 to 40; math, 3 percentage points, from 34 to 37 points, with the gap between white and black students the highest at 47 percentage points; and writing, a less than 1 percentage point decrease to 42 percent, but the numbers have been increasing since 2011.\n\n\u2022 Resegregation in Denver: Three-quarters of DPS schools are what The New York Times calls \u201cdemographically homogenous\u201d based on this data: 65 percent of Denver Public Schools have student bodies with more than 70 percent students of color; 11 percent of schools have students bodies with less than 30 percent students of color\n\nOn Oct. 11, The Denver Post published even more unfavorable statistics.\n\n\u2022 Teacher turnover in DPS is 22 percent per year. DPS is experiencing the highest teacher turnover in the metropolitan area.\n\n\u2022 Principal turnover is 30 percent per year. Since Superintendent Tom Boasberg took over in 2009, approximately 90 percent of DPS traditional schools have experienced at least one change in leadership.\n\n\u2022 The Academic Innovation Office, a new department within DPS that oversees charter and innovation schools (not traditional schools), has 54 directors, managers, and assistant directors, with salaries totaling $5.3 million. Average salary: $100,000.\n\nFinally, on Oct. 7, the University of Washington\u2019s Center on Reinventing Public Education released a report card on the status of 50 urban school districts that have been actively engaged in education reform. Thirty-seven districts supplied enough achievement gap data to be evaluated.\n\nOf them, Denver Public Schools was dead last in both reading and math, with gaps of 38 percent and 30 percent respectively. The average for the other districts was around 14 percent for each subject. As for graduation rates, Denver ranked 45th out of the 50 districts.\n\nThe Denver Plan 2020 emphasizes reducing the gaps and increasing graduation rates, among other goals. Given the performance of the past 10 years, is this a district going in the right direction to achieve this?\n\nYou be the judge.\n\nJeannie Kaplan is a former Denver Public Schools board member.
