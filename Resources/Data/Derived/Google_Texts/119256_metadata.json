I didn\u2019t even know he was still around. I think he made movies a long time ago or something. ... He interviewed El Chapo, we, I\u2019ll guess, use the interview that he had in order to find him. That\u2019s ... the Mexicans did, that\u2019s fantastic. I hope they extradite El Chapo to the United States.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, a Mexican official said security forces at one point located the world's most wanted trafficker thanks to a secret interview with Penn that appeared on the Rolling Stone website.\n\nMcDonough weighed in on the issue as well, expressing his distaste for Guzman boasting about his drug empire in the interview.\n\n\u201cI was appalled by his bragging to the interviewers in Rolling Stone that he moves more heroin than anyone in the world,\" said the White House Chief of Staff.\n\nWhen asked about a possible investigation by federal authorities, McDonough commented, \"We\u2019ll let somebody else sort out what Sean Penn did and didn\u2019t do.\" He also had some words for Rubio.\n\n\u201cWe hope that Senator Rubio, if he is appalled about this, will stop those in his party who would appeal the Affordable Care Act, which has done more for mental health treatment and addiction treatment and substance abuse treatment than anything that we've seen in decades,\" said McDonough.\n\nSanders expressed his satisfaction that the drug lord was finally captured.\n\n\"I read a little bit about it, so I have nothing much profound to say about it, except that I\u2019m glad that this drug-cartel leader has been caught,\" he said. \"People like him have done incredible harm to people in our country and to his own country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "THR Staff", "description": "\u201cI was appalled by his bragging to the interviewers in Rolling Stone that he moves more heroin than anyone in the world,\" said White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough on ABC's 'This Week.'", "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "description": "\u201cI was appalled by his bragging to the interviewers in Rolling Stone that he moves more heroin than anyone in the world,\" said White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough on ABC's 'This Week.'", "title": "White House Chief of Staff \"Appalled\" by El Chapo Comments in Sean Penn Interview", "url": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/white-house-chief-staff-appalled-853851", "image": {"width": 1296, "identifier": "//cdn5.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/01/el_chapo_arrested.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 730}, "type": "website"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-10 12:54:58", "sailthru.title": "White House Chief of Staff \"Appalled\" by El Chapo Comments in Sean Penn Interview", "fb": {"admins": 3111204}, "sailthru.vertical": "Television", "sailthru.tags": "Television,Sean Penn", "sailthru.description": "\u201cI was appalled by his bragging to the interviewers in Rolling Stone that he moves more heroin than anyone in the world,\" said White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough on ABC's 'This Week.'", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3864\"", "article_summary": "Rubio called the Penn interview with El Chapo \"grotesque,\" and added that the actor was within his legal rights to conduct the interview.\nHe continued: \"Sean Penn is not someone I spend a lot of time thinking about.\nHe interviewed El Chapo, we, I\u2019ll guess, use the interview that he had in order to find him.\n\u201cI was appalled by his bragging to the interviewers in Rolling Stone that he moves more heroin than anyone in the world,\" said the White House Chief of Staff.\nI hope they extradite El Chapo to the United States.\""}
