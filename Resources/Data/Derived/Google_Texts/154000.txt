No matter the language being spoken around a small, glittering Eiffel Tower replica in downtown Denver, it was easy to discern the concern and love pouring from the community who gathered to support Paris and its people after the Friday terrorist attacks.

Emilie Gettliffe and Vincent Paul, of Denver, said their French roots inspired them to co-organize the Saturday rally of solidarity near Civic Center park for those who experienced the violence in Paris that killed more than 100 people.

“It feels very close to home,”Gettliffe said.

Paul, who hails from Paris, said that he was pleased to see a growing turnout for the cause.

“We have quite the French community in Denver,” he said. “It’s good to see this group come together in times of grief and pain.”

Jerome Michelet moved to Denver this summer from Denver’s first sister city: Brest, France.

Michelet knew people who witnessed the Paris attacks up close and said he was touched by the solidarity he found in his new home.

“This is a good sign,” he said. “This is not going to destroy our way of life.”

Dave Stalls made a sign declaring Denver’s love for those in Paris right now.

“I’m just really sad and truly confused on what we can do as a country or as an individual to help,” he said. “The only thing I can is try to say we’re thinking of Paris and saying we love you.”

Saturday night Denver’s City and County Building, like landmarks around the world, was lit with blue, white and red to show solidarity with France.
