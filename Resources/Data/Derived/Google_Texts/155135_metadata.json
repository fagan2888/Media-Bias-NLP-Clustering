After his female colleagues expressed dismay, he later apologized for that analogy.\n\nIn order to explain the intent behind his bill, Rep. Chuck Gatschenberger (R) recounted a personal story about recent decisions that involved big purchases. He said that he recently visited a car lot and didn\u2019t purchase a car immediately, and that he took a month to decide about whether to install new carpet in his home.\n\n\u201cEven when I buy a new vehicle \u2014 this is my experience \u2014 I don\u2019t go right in there and say, I want to buy that vehicle, and, you know, leave with it,\u201d the lawmaker, whose comments were recorded by Progress Missouri, said. \u201cI have to look at it, get information about it, maybe drive it, check prices. There\u2019s lots of things I do going into a decision \u2014 whether that\u2019s a car, whether that\u2019s a house, whether that\u2019s any major decision that I make in my life. Even carpeting. You know, I was just considering getting carpeting in my house. That process probably took a month\u2026 I wanted to be as informed as possible, and that\u2019s what this bill is, having them get as much information as possible.\u201d\n\nGatschenberger\u2019s legislation would triple the current waiting period for the women in the state who want to have a legal abortion. They\u2019ll be required to make an initial trip to a clinic, receive information about the risks of abortion \u2014 including scientifically inaccurate information about abortion\u2019s link to breast cancer \u2014 and then wait 72 hours before returning the clinic to have the actual procedure. When it was first introduced, it sparked considerable protest, and activists rallied around a #wait72hours hashtag to make the point that women can be trusted to make their own decisions.\n\nAnd at Tuesday\u2019 hearing, Gatschenberger\u2019s colleagues didn\u2019t hesitate to push back on his analogy. Rep. Stacey Newman (D) asked him if he really believed buying a car is in any comparable to women\u2019s personal medical decisions. \u201cYour comments were extremely offensive to every single woman sitting in here. I want to point that out, because that kind of attitude is demeaning to women, regardless of what they decide to do,\u201d Newman said.\n\n\u201cThat was not my intent. I apologize for that,\u201d Gatschenberger responded.\n\nNewman, who chairs the Progressive Caucus, told ThinkProgress that she was offended by the analogy because it came across as \u201cvery flippant\u201d about the legislation\u2019s effect on women. \u201cWe\u2019re making policy for women throughout the state,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard personal stories from them \u2014 and from my daughters, my granddaughters \u2014 and I\u2019m seeing those women\u2019s faces. It\u2019s not as if they put no thought into what can be the hardest decision of their lives.\u201d\n\nThe research in this area backs her up. Studies have found nearly 90 percent of women are \u201chighly confident\u201d about their choice to end a pregnancy before ever approaching a doctor, and mandatory waiting periods don\u2019t do anything to sway them. And women who choose abortion overwhelmingly say it was the right choice for them.\n\nGatschenberger told ThinkProgress that it was \u201cthe wrong example to use,\u201d noting he acknowledged that at least three times during the hearing.\n\nThe Missouri legislature has been particularly intent on attacking reproductive rights during this legislative session. Lawmakers have introduced more than 30 different anti-abortion bills \u2014 more than nearly any other state in the country so far this year. And since there\u2019s just one sole abortion clinic left in the entire state, all of that legislation is seeking to regulate a single facility.\n\nWomen\u2019s health advocates in the state are fighting back. Hundreds of activists rallied in front of the state capitol on Tuesday, displaying signs like \u201cIf you can\u2019t trust me with a choice, how can you trust me with a child?\u201d and \u201cWomen\u2019s lives matter.\u201d They\u2019re demanding that Missouri lawmakers stop \u201cplaying politics\u201d with women\u2019s health, which includes ceasing to introduce abortion restrictions and agreeing to accept Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t just one bill that we\u2019d like to see defeated. We\u2019d like to see all of the more than thirty bills hostile to women\u2019s health defeated,\u201d Ryann Summerfield, the statewide manager of government affairs for Planned Parenthood Advocates in Missouri, explained to ThinkProgress. \u201cIf the legislature is truly concerned with protecting the health of women, it should be by expanding Medicaid for the 260,000 Missourians who are going without affordable health care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Rep.
