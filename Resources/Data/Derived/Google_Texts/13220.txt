Kevin Williamson, the National Review writer who was once best known as The Guy Who Flipped Out At A Broadway Musical, but who has recently tweaked his brand by adding healthy dollops of transphobia and racism, did it again this weekend, flexing his increasingly well-toned troll muscles by advocating state resources be devoted to killing women who have abortions.

“I have hanging more in mind,” Williamson tweeted when asked by a Twitter interlocutor whether he really considers abortion to be murder, and thus deserving of a sentence of life without parole. Here’s a quick Storify I made to give you the essentials (I left out parts where Williamson says he’d want the doctors who performed the procedure to die, too):

Anyway, since Williamson is clearly pretty invested in his nascent persona as National Review’s in-house Erick Erickson impersonator, I figured now would be a good time to put his trolling to the test and see if it can stand up to the masterful displays of willfully anti-social and hostile online behavior that have put notorious Internet cesspool 4chan on the map.

So here’s a quiz, featuring some quotes that come either from Williamson or an anonymous 4chan wannabe sociopath. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to determine which came from one of the premiere writers at conservatism’s most august publication, and which came from the place where people go to send anonymous death threats. Best of luck, and scroll to the bottom to find the correct answers.
