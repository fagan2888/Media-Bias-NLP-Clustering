(Although it may have been a low bar for Mr. Bennett, considering that previous clients who paid him to praise them included Rick Perry, Liz Cheney and Rob Portman. Not exactly a Mensa gathering.)\n\nBut what is the evidence that he\u2019s the anti-Trump? Well, according to Mr. Bennett and the news articles today about the Carson surge, we start with his long career as a neurosurgeon. Hard to argue with that.\n\nAccording to Mr. Bennett, Mr. Carson has 67 doctorates! Now that\u2019s impressive. That would be more than one a year, if he started the day he was born. Dr. Carson\u2019s Wikipedia entry, which reads like he wrote it, says he has 38 honorary degrees. So he earned 29 more on his own. That\u2019s got to be close to one a year after he finished medical school and his surgical residency. Wherever did he find the time to separate those conjoined twins that he talks about all the time?\n\nThat was an indisputable medical achievement, but is about as irrelevant to being president of the United States as Mr. Trump\u2019s deep experience running casinos into the ground. And if Mr. Carson actually wins the nomination, just remember that the Republicans who will be singing his praises are the same ones who said in 2008 that Barack Obama could not be president because he only was elected to the Senate once.\n\nSo how is Mr. Carson different from Mr. Trump? You could be forgiven for assuming that he\u2019s less of a bigot than Mr. Trump since the good (former) doctor is African American. But you would be wrong.\n\nThe rioting in Baltimore recently was not a racial matter, Mr. Carson declared at the time. And just like every run-of-the-mill white right-wing political hack, Mr. Carson makes the argument that politicians who talk about the lingering racism in this country, like President Obama, are just fomenting discontent and division.\n\nWhen Mr. Obama attempted to talk honestly and rationally about racism in America after the South Carolina church murders, Mr. Carson said: \u201cI think I would use the bully pulpit to help people realize what we have in common rather than what separates us. What it\u2019s been used for the last several years is to create wars: a war on women, race wars, any kind of anything involving people of two different races, income wars, always class warfare, religious wars now, age wars.\u201d\n\nHe also called the Affordable Care Act \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d (When he was called on that ridiculous comment, Mr. Carson bleated that the political correctness \u201cpolice\u201d were after him \u2014 just like Donald Trump.)\n\nMr. Carson is different than Mr. Trump, according to Mr. Bennett and other supporters, because he is a scientist, which means he bases his beliefs on data and facts. Well, again, no.\n\nMr. Carson, in 2004, said he does not believe in evolution and that believing in evolution rejects \u201cmorality and the basis of ethical behavior.\u201d\n\nMr. Carson recently said he does not believe there is any value in using human fetal tissue for medical purposes. Of course now he is running for office. Before that, he conducted research with tissue from fetuses aborted in the ninth and 17th weeks.\n\nMr. Carson has said that being gay is \u201cabsolutely\u201d a choice \u2013 one that people often make in prison. He later conceded that he did not actually know how \u201cevery individual came to their sexual orientation.\u201d\n\nIt is true that Mr. Carson has been quieter, literally, than Mr. Trump. But that may because he didn\u2019t get the microphone much at the first Republican \u201cdebate.\u201d Stay tuned.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150902124059, "twitter": {"url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/is-ben-carson-really-the-anti-trump/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/09/02/opinion/2rosenthalWEB/2rosenthalWEB-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "We\u2019re supposed to believe he\u2019s more thoughtful, but the evidence suggests otherwise.", "card": "summary", "title": "Is Ben Carson Really the Anti-Trump?"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000003887467, "CLMST": "Andrew Rosenthal", "org": "Republican Party;Senate;Wikipedia", "keywords": "Carson Benjamin S,Cheney Liz,Obama Barack,Perry Rick,Portman Rob,Trump Donald J,Discrimination,Homosexuality and Bisexuality,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Presidential Election of 2016,Race and Ethnicity,United States Politics and Government,Republican Party,Senate,Wikipedia,Baltimore (Md),United States,Featured Posts", "GBLC": "Featured Posts", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/Is Ben Carson Really the Anti-Trump?
