Young people are abandoning President Barack Obama in big numbers, according to a new poll.

Young people are abandoning President Barack Obama in big numbers, according to a new poll by the Harvard University Institute of Politics.

The survey shows the president's approval rating among young people has fallen to 41 percent, and 52 percent of those ages 18 to 24 say they would vote to recall the president if they could.

Researchers found younger Americans disapproved of Obamacare and the government surveillance program and that they're concerned about their future.

"The trend is daunting for the White House but not necessarily surprising," Catholic Online quoted Pew Research Center Director Michael Dimock. "Younger folks are part of Obama's base ... but the roll-out confirmed concerns that were already in their minds."

The poll also found a growing disillusionment with both parties and Congress.
