The company plans a new generation of engines, dubbed Skyactiv 2, that could debut by 2020 with a target of achieving 30 percent better fuel economy than the current line, pictured.\n\nHIROSHIMA, Japan -- Masamichi Kogai, Mazda Motor Corp.'s cost-conscious CEO, says he has no plans to revive the discontinued RX sports car series. Instead, he wants to plow limited resources into improving the Skyactiv technologies that set the brand's bread-and-butter vehicles apart from the competition.\n\nThe move underscores the fragile state of Mazda's recovery and the challenge the CEO faces in keeping products competitive with the first round of Skyactiv redesigns already halfway over.\n\nMazda's seven-vehicle lineup is almost stretched to its max, Kogai said. It's time to focus on a new generation of improvements.\n\n\"It's difficult for us at present to further expand our lineup,\" Kogai told Automotive News at the company's headquarters here. \"The company is still in the process of improving its financial structure. We want to focus our limited resources on the Skyactiv products that we have today.\"\n\nEvery nameplate except the CX-9 crossover and Mazda5 minivan has received a Skyactiv makeover. Skyactiv is the name Mazda gave to a variety of technologies behind a more efficient powertrain, lightweight body and sportier chassis.\n\nThe Skyactiv Mazda2 has yet to reach the U.S. but is on sale in Japan. The overhauled MX-5 Miata roadster was unveiled this year with a 2015 U.S. launch date. And a new CX-3 subcompact crossover based on the Mazda2 will debut this month at the Los Angeles Auto Show.\n\nThe big question for Kogai: What next? The small, export-reliant company is under pressure to meet increasingly stringent emissions standards around the world. But it lacks the deep r&d coffers of Japanese rivals Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co.\n\nWhen Kogai, 60, took office in June 2013, he inherited a company that had just recorded its first annual profit in five years.\n\nIn many ways, today's Mazda looks stronger than ever. It is booking record profits, U.S. sales are outpacing the industry's and it has rebalanced its global production footprint with a new plant in Mexico. Incentives are down; transaction prices are up.\n\nBut Kogai's challenge is keeping that momentum with a tight lineup and preparing future products on a shoestring budget.\n\n\"Mazda is at a turning point,\" said Takaki Nakanishi, an auto analyst with Jefferies Japan in Tokyo. \"Consistent success will be determined by the next generation of products.\"\n\nKogai says his top immediate priority is achieving quality sales, not just higher volumes. Discipline will be key: He favors a more focused core lineup over flashy cars such as the RX-8, and lower incentives. So far, his strategy has been working.\n\nTake the redesigned Mazda3 compact. U.S. sales fell 2 percent to 87,505 units through October. But Mazda says its share of retail, nonfleet sales in the compact segment is actually up.\n\nAverage incentives on the Mazda3 fell by half to $1,203 in the first nine months from the year-earlier period, according to TrueCar Inc. By contrast, average incentives for the entire compact segment rose 24 percent to $2,048.\n\nMazda CEO Masamichi Kogai: Keep the focus on Skyactiv technologies\n\nMazda's incentives as a brand have been in reverse since 2011, said Edmunds.com analyst Jonathan Mandanici. And average transaction prices are up 10 percent so far in 2014 vs. 2012.\n\n\"We're holding down incentives, without pursuing volume,\" Kogai said. \"The challenge for us now is how we can sustain this.\"\n\nKogai has scaled back his forecast that Mazda's U.S. sales could hit a record approaching 400,000 vehicles in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016. Now he says he doesn't consider that figure \"an absolute target,\" though he'd like to get there \"eventually.\"\n\nMaintaining discipline also means not being tempted into ego entries, such as a revived RX sports car, he said.\n\nMazda retired the RX-8 in 2012 amid slumping sales.\n\nDespite being a signature car for the Mazda, equipped with the brand's famed rotary engine, RX is dead for now, Kogai said.\n\n\"We don't have that kind of vehicle in our future product plan,\" he said.\n\n\"If you increase the number of segments, then the resources we can allocate to each will decline and that will prevent us from developing truly good products.\"\n\nKogai added that the company is continuing development of its rotary engine drivetrain for possible use in future cars.\n\n\"It's a unique technology that only Mazda has, and I don't think we should allow the flame to go out,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, analysts applauded the decision to park the RX car.\n\n\"A brand this size needs only so many poster cars,\" said Kurt Sanger, an auto analyst with Deutsche Securities Japan in Tokyo.\n\nKogai, an avid baseball fan and former pitcher, draws from the diamond when planning his product portfolio. The truly successful company doesn't rely on just one product, just as a pennant-winning team doesn't rely on a star power hitter. \"We don't need a home run, if each player hits a single,\" he said.\n\nBut Kogai knows Mazda's Skyactiv engines, which first appeared in 2011, need updating to keep getting on base with customers.\n\nThat plan hinges largely on a new generation of engines, dubbed Skyactiv 2, that could debut by 2020 with a target of achieving 30 percent better fuel economy than the current line.\n\nMazda engineers outlined the strategy this year, saying the gains will come through improvements in the existing combustion engine technology and through the introduction of homogeneous charge compression ignition, or HCCI.\n\nThe latter technology compresses the fuel-air mixture to such a high pressure and temperature that it ignites by itself without requiring a spark, similar to the way a diesel engine operates. It's a technology that numerous automakers have pursued for decades, so far without commercial success.\n\nKogai declined to discuss the progress toward introducing HCCI.\n\nAnalyst Nakanishi expects the first such engines around 2018. They will use HCCI only during limited combustion ranges and rely on traditional spark ignition in others, he predicted.\n\nMazda's determination to squeeze better performance from the internal combustion engine diverges from the strategies of rivals with bigger r&d budgets, who are pursuing a range of alternative drivetrains, such as hybrids and fuel cells.\n\n\"They want best-in-class combustion engines, but they also will have to do something in terms of electrification,\" said Chris Richter, an auto analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets in Tokyo.\n\n\"Of course, there are worries,\" he said. \"They are competing directly against automakers with a lot more resources.\"\n\nMazda has invested in electrified drivetrains to meet more stringent emissions standards, mainly engine stop-start or brake-regeneration technologies. It licenses its hybrid system from Toyota.\n\nControlling cost on the new technology is paramount for Mazda, one of the world's smallest global, mass-market automakers. One reason Kogai wants to keep refining the Skyactiv engine is because it is a cost-effective approach with a proven technology.\n\n\"The biggest challenge will be how we can reduce costs,\" he said. \"If technology costs a lot, I believe you can't just force it on customers simply because it's good technology.\"\n\nYet by just piggybacking on existing Skyactiv engines, Mazda's next generation runs the risk of delivering only incremental, not revolutionary, increases in performance and efficiency.\n\n\"It won't be easy,\" Kogai said, \"but we need technologies that can be deployed across the board, and a way of reducing costs.\"", "article_metadata": {"timeCrawled": "20160525_00:21:25", "twitter": {"account_id": 14628959, "title": "Mazda's next big challenge", "image": {"src": "http://www.autonews.com/assets/jpg/icon/an-button.jpg"}, "site": "@Automotive_News", "card": "summary", "description": "Mazda's recovery is in a fragile state and the automaker is facing challenges in keeping products competitive with the first round of Skyactiv redesigns already halfway over."}, "published_at": "2014-11-10", "year": 2014, "description": "Mazda's recovery is in a fragile state and the automaker is facing challenges in keeping products competitive with the first round of Skyactiv redesigns already halfway over.", "byline": "Hans Greimel", "author": "Hans Greimel", "image": "http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CA/20141110/OEM/311109962/AR/0/adfasf.jpg", "categoryName": "OEM", "tags": "Mazda", "fb": {"page_id": 299833160103483, "app_id": 230521947020498}, "content_type": "article", "msvalidate.01": "559498F855972429551A034E0ACBDDBE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "og": {"site_name": "Automotive News", "description": "Mazda's recovery is in a fragile state and the automaker is facing challenges in keeping products competitive with the first round of Skyactiv redesigns already halfway over.", "title": "Mazda's next big challenge", "url": "http://www.autonews.com/article/20141110/OEM/311109962/mazdas-next-big-challenge", "image": {"width": 450, "identifier": "http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CA/20141110/OEM/311109962/AR/0/adfasf.jpg", "height": 298}, "type": "article"}, "title": "Mazda's next big challenge", "summary": "Mazda's recovery is in a fragile state and the automaker is facing challenges in keeping products competitive with the first round of Skyactiv redesigns already halfway over.", "url": "http://www.autonews.com/article/20141110/OEM/311109962", "published_date": "2014-11-10", "google-site-verification": "PJrncMiSNhK_CeZMhQkriKmQfa_KlBBc3DGosYSmHJY", "distribution": "global", "y_key": "b309030fed32c7b0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceec3\"", "article_summary": "But Kogai knows Mazda's Skyactiv engines, which first appeared in 2011, need updating to keep getting on base with customers.\nMazda's Skyactiv engines, which first appeared in 2011, need updating.\nYet by just piggybacking on existing Skyactiv engines, Mazda's next generation runs the risk of delivering only incremental, not revolutionary, increases in performance and efficiency.\nHIROSHIMA, Japan -- Masamichi Kogai, Mazda Motor Corp.'s cost-conscious CEO, says he has no plans to revive the discontinued RX sports car series.\nThe move underscores the fragile state of Mazda's recovery and the challenge the CEO faces in keeping products competitive with the first round of Skyactiv redesigns already halfway over."}
