(Oregon is one of 10 states that link their minimum wage to the Consumer Price Index.) After raising the pay for his 24 employees, he raised the prices for coffee, smoothies and beer to compensate.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a wash,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not the consumer that wins, because most businesses will pass their increase on to the consumer through higher prices. The business doesn\u2019t win, because they are forced to increase their prices to maintain proper margins to keep their doors open, thus affecting current customers and the potential of loss of new business. The employee doesn\u2019t win, because they are the consumer.\u201d\n\nStates are allowed to mandate minimum wages higher than the federal rate, and 21 have done just that. (Oregon\u2019s wage has been higher than the federal minimum since the early 1990s.) Twenty states have kept to the federal standard, including Idaho, which has the highest percentage among all states of hourly workers earning the minimum wage or less, according to federal figures.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Lynch\u2019s story illustrates some of the competing narratives of the minimum wage debate. When she took her Oregon job last year, at an Irish-themed restaurant and bar called Mackey\u2019s, she got more hours at higher pay, allowing her to compete in more barrel racing events, her rodeo specialty. Two months ago, she even bought a second horse, a gelding paint named Blue Duck.\n\nBut Mackey\u2019s owners also told her that she would have to work harder than before for that money. Higher labor costs meant getting rid of the dishwasher, for one thing, said Angena Grove, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Shawn. And whereas Ms. Lynch covered three tables at a time in her old Idaho job, Mackey\u2019s waitresses, with the owners helping out, cover five.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou work for the money,\u201d Ms. Lynch said.\n\nJackie Heintzelman, 32, a bartender and server at the Little Palomino, another restaurant and bar in Ontario, also commutes from Idaho. She said the higher Oregon wages, and additional hours, had improved her life, allowing her to quit a second job cleaning houses during the day and to pay her bills on time.\n\n\u201cEverything is paid for, and that is a luxury in itself,\u201d Ms. Heintzelman said. She said she even managed to take a recent weekend trip with her boyfriend.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany low-wage workers in this region said that what mattered as much as, and sometimes more than, the actual wage was the number of hours worked. Angela Lowry, 41 and a single mother, recently landed a full-time minimum-wage job in a thrift store in Ontario, and said she was thrilled to have it. She will get a paid vacation for the first time in years, she said.\n\nBut the job has trade-offs. As Ms. Lowry\u2019s income surges toward $18,000 a year, from about $10,000 at her previous part-time minimum-wage job at Kmart, the government assistance she receives \u2014 helping her pay for food, rent and after-school day care for her 7-year-old son, Darian \u2014 will all go down.\n\n\u201cYou make a little more, they take a little more away,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I understand that \u2014 it\u2019s got to be fair.\u201d She added, \u201cI am really fortunate and blessed.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the differences in the minimum wage, poverty rates have remained high for many years on both sides of the border. In Malheur County, which surrounds Ontario, 24.5 percent of the population lived in poverty in 2011, according to the most recent federal figures, up from about 19 percent in the late 1990s. In Payette County, Idaho, the poverty rate rose to 19 percent in 2011 from about 13 percent in 1999. A family of four earning about $24,000 or less is considered impoverished under federal standards.\n\nOn both sides of the border, few question that life at the minimum wage is hard.\n\nDarin Hill, 39, has been a minimum-wage worker for 19 years on a farm and feed lot outside Ontario, supporting his wife, Cathy, and their two children on about $300 a week. He often gets lots of hours, sometimes 60 or more per week, and that helps, he said. So does the fact that his wife raises pigs. But the trick to getting by, he said, is learning to simplify one\u2019s needs and desires.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a lot of \u2018I wants,\u2019 \u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140215191455, "twitter": {"description": "A rolling borderland of onion farms and strip malls provides a test tube of sorts for observing how the minimum wage works in daily life.", "title": "Crossing Borders and Changing Lives, Lured by Higher State Minimum Wages", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/us/crossing-borders-and-changing-lives-lured-by-higher-state-minimum-wages.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002692474"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "kljohnso", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/16/us/MINIMUM-4/MINIMUM-4-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/us/crossing-borders-and-changing-lives-lured-by-higher-state-minimum-wages.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002692474", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/us/crossing-borders-and-changing-lives-lured-by-higher-state-minimum-wages.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Crossing Borders and Changing Lives, Lured by Higher State Minimum Wages", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 15, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Minimum Wage,Oregon,Idaho", "news_keywords": "Oregon,Idaho", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Kirk Johnson", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/16/us/MINIMUM-4/MINIMUM-4-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By KIRK JOHNSON", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A rolling borderland of onion farms and strip malls provides a test tube of sorts for observing how the minimum wage works in daily life.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/16/us/MINIMUM-4/MINIMUM-4-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "A rolling borderland of onion farms and strip malls provides a test tube of sorts for observing how the minimum wage works in daily life.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 15, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/kirk_johnson/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-03-31", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Idaho", "published": "2014-02-15", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Idaho", "slug": "16minimum", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140331151953, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/us/crossing-borders-and-changing-lives-lured-by-higher-state-minimum-wages.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/16/us/MINIMUM-4/MINIMUM-4-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A rolling borderland of onion farms and strip malls provides a test tube of sorts for observing how the minimum wage works in daily life.", "title": "Crossing Borders and Changing Lives, Lured by Higher State Minimum Wages"}, "pdate": 20140215, "des": "Minimum Wage", "articleid": 100000002692474, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Crossing Borders and Changing Lives, Lured by Higher State Minimum Wages", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "PhotoMs. Lynch\u2019s story illustrates some of the competing narratives of the minimum wage debate.\nOn both sides of the border, few question that life at the minimum wage is hard.\n(Oregon\u2019s wage has been higher than the federal minimum since the early 1990s.)\n(Oregon is one of 10 states that link their minimum wage to the Consumer Price Index.)\nThe employee doesn\u2019t win, because they are the consumer.\u201dStates are allowed to mandate minimum wages higher than the federal rate, and 21 have done just that."}
