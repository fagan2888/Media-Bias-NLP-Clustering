Officials are releasing the identity of the man who was killed during a two-vehicle accident Saturday afternoon in Jackson County.

According to Florida Highway patrol officials, 47-year old Curtis Rice and his wife were driving their semi truck southbound on U.S. 231 in Jackson County. They were going to turn left onto the east entrance ramp onto Interstate 10, when 59-year old Alvin McGinty ran into the side of the semi-truck.

Officials say McGinty died, and the semi driver and passenger were unharmed. At this time, officials do not think alcohol was a factor, but they are still investigating.

Reports state this is the first fatality in Jackson County this year. No charges are pending.
