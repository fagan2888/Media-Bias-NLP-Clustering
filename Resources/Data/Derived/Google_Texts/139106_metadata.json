Real bad.\u201d\n\nWith Indianapolis preparing for one of its biggest events of the year, the national uproar over the religious freedom act could not come at a worse time. The local economy is built on tourism, particularly sports events and conferences. Businesses across the city say they are scrambling to salvage both the Hoosier reputation and their bottom lines.\n\nFrom the streets of Indianapolis to statehouses across the South, the religious freedom issue is aggravating divisions between social conservatives, who promote the measures, and Main Street conservatives, who see them as bad for business.\n\nOn Wednesday, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he would not sign a newly passed religious liberty bill in that state, reversing course after entreaties from both Wal-Mart, the state\u2019s biggest employer, and his son, Seth, 31.\n\n\u201cThis is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial. But these are not ordinary times,\u201d Hutchinson, a Republican, said, urging lawmakers to send him a revised measure.\n\nIn Indiana, Republican Gov. Mike Pence called on lawmakers to \u201cfix\u201d their law this week, one day after the president of the NCAA, which is based in Indianapolis, threatened to relocate future events. Dozens of corporations, from Apple to the Gap, have publicly denounced the law. A commercially ominous hashtag persisted for days on Twitter: #BoycottIndiana.\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, one of Indiana\u2019s largest employers, pressed Pence to make sure its employees felt welcome. And Angie\u2019s List, an economic anchor here (as well as one of Pence\u2019s biggest campaign contributors), halted plans for a $40 million expansion, jeopardizing hundreds of potential jobs.\n\nPence has strongly defended the Indiana statute, which grants individuals and businesses legal grounds to protect themselves against claims of discrimination. He said the law is meant to protect people and institutions such as the University of Notre Dame, which recently objected on religious grounds to a mandate in the federal Affordable Care Act that requires employers who provide health insurance to cover contraceptives.\n\nBut Pence also vowed to \u201cfix\u201d the law to make clear that it \u201cdoes not give businesses the right to deny services to anyone.\u201d And he acknowledged a \u201cperception problem\u201d with the law \u2014 one vividly illustrated Tuesday by Crystal O\u2019Connor, whose family owns Memories Pizza in Walkerton, Indiana, about 150 miles northwest of Indianapolis.\n\nO\u2019Connor cited the law when she told a news station that she would not make pizza for same-sex weddings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not discriminating against anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s just our belief, and anyone has the right to believe in anything.\u201d\n\nThat view is mistaken, according to Daniel Conkle, a law professor at Indiana University. Writing last week in the Indianapolis Star, Conkle said no court has ruled in favor of a business seeking to deny wedding services to a same-sex couple.\n\nNoting that \u201cmost religious freedom claims have nothing to do with same-sex marriage,\u201d Conkle wrote that the Indiana law \u201cwould provide valuable guidance to Indiana courts, directing them to balance religious freedom against competing interests.\u201d\n\nMany Indianapolis residents, however, fear that the law will undermine the city\u2019s transformation from Rust Belt ghost town to Midwest success story. The state capital is one of more than a dozen Indiana communities that have adopted local civil rights protections for gay people. It has also built a reputation as a prime destination for conventions and sporting events.\n\nIn 2012, the Super Bowl pumped $277 million into the local economy. (Indianapolis is angling to attract the game again.) The Final Four, which brought $50 million to the city in 2010, is projected to pour $70 million into the local economy this year.\n\nIndianapolis Mayor Gregory Ballard, a Republican, said he is not overly concerned that the new law will disrupt this week\u2019s Final Four festivities. Basketball fans, he said, have no time to change their plans.\n\n\u201cBut afterward,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll have to see.\u201d\n\nBallard said he worries that the law could turn off businesses and educated millennials. Already, Gen Con, the summer gaming festival held annually at the Indiana Convention Center, has said it would go elsewhere if the state fails to adopt meaningful protections for gays and lesbians.\n\n\u201cThey need to fix the perception that\u2019s out there,\u201d Ballard said of state lawmakers. \u201cThey can\u2019t just put some fancy words on it.\u201d\n\nIn shops across the city, people expressed the same fear: that lawmakers would fail to deliver explicit language, that the world would continue to perceive Indianapolis as a city that rejects those who are different. All-are-welcome signs have cropped up in dozens of shop windows, scrawled in rainbow chalk and printed on big blue stickers.\n\nMeanwhile, the city\u2019s convention and visitors association, better known as Visit Indy, has erected five-foot concrete letters around town: \u201cNDY.\u201d Marketing director Jeff Robinson, 39, encouraged pedestrians to complete the word by becoming a human \u201cI.\u201d The idea is to take a photo and post it on social media with the hashtag #IndyWelcomesAll.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been asked by a lot of people, by convention planners from around the country: \u2018Are there places we can go in Indy where we\u2019ll be welcome?\u2018 \u201c Robinson said. \u201cWe want the world to know it\u2019s business as usual in Indy, regardless of legislation.\u201d\n\nDoug Litsey, 63, co-owner of Calvin Fletcher\u2019s Coffee Company, remembers how his downtown neighborhood looked less than a decade ago. Before swanky apartments sprouted up in Fletcher Park, once known for a smoky tavern, a tiny insurance company and bleak views of Interstate 70. Before an upscale Italian eatery inhabited the old warehouse next door. Before a new brunch spot drew lines across the street with sweet-tea fried chicken. And Fletcher Park represents a mere slice of the citywide transformation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen so much change in the 34 years I\u2019ve lived here,\u201d said Litsey, a soft-spoken pastor with a wiry gray beard who preaches at a nearby nondenominational church. \u201cAll built on love, on acceptance. Now it feels almost oppressive to be living in this kind of atmosphere.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees. Carl Kelley, 68, an Uber driver and pastor in the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, accused \u201cLGBT activists of using this law as an excuse to push their agenda on people who stand by the Bible.\u201d\n\nStill, Kelley said: \u201cWe will drive anyone. We are not bigots. We are not ogres.\u201d\n\nBack at the Chilly Water Brewing Company, DuVall, who opened the brewpub nine months ago, worried that negative publicity about the law might drive away tourists. He\u2019s counting on basketball fans to wander in this weekend and order his site-brewed beers.\n\n\u201cWe are on such an upward momentum,\u201d said Bob Grist, a regular at the bar who owns a local architecture firm. \u201cAnd this thing is such a diversion.\u201d\n\nGrist lives in this neighborhood and is proud of its growth, its progress. His son was \u201cbrave enough to come out in high school,\u201d Grist said. He now lives in Los Angeles with his husband and 4-year-old twin girls.\n\nGrist, 63, wants them to feel comfortable when they visit. This is his son\u2019s home, he said, tears clouding his light blue eyes.\n\nThe law shouldn\u2019t suggest he\u2019s not welcome here.\n\n- - - -\n\nWashington Post staff writer Sandhya Somashekhar in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nbc-gayrights", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Standard-Examiner's latest news about new businesses, local businesses, jobs and economics in Ogden, Layton, Roy, Bountiful, Kaysville, Syracuse, Weber County, Davis County and across northern Utah.", "copyright": "Standard-Examiner", "author": "Standard-Examiner", "og": {"site_name": "Standard-Examiner", "description": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 At Calvin Fletcher\u2019s Coffee Company, a sign taped to the front door says, \u201cWE SERVE EVERYONE,\u201d inviting out-of-towners of all sexual orientations to enjoy an organic mocha latte.
