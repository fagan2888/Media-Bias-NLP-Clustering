John Kasich slipped up to third place in the Republican presidential primary. When he first announced his campaign in July 2015, we expected it would be short-lived. \u201cHe\u2019s a long shot, and deservedly so,\u201d we wrote. That \u201clong shot\u201d estimation is as true now as it was then, even if his campaign wasn\u2019t actually short-lived.\n\nKasich survived despite tepid standing in the polls and obscurity on the debate stage. He stretched his resources by only focusing on key states, like New Hampshire and Ohio, where his moderate stances could gain traction. Now he\u2019s the last candidate in the race with legislative and executive experience \u2014 governor of the swing state of Ohio, and former congressman who headed the House Budget Committee and reformed federal spending in the \u201890s. And he\u2019s the establishment\u2019s last holdout. He calls himself the \u201cprince of light and hope\u201d and yet comes off as abrasive and unscripted as Trump. He recently told an 11-year-old boy who asked him about the Islamic State to imagine a woman he loved being beaten \u201cto a living pulp.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s experience is tempered by his social policies. He muscled an ObamaCare expansion in his state based on a misunderstanding of Christian charity, and he proposed turning Voice of America into a propaganda tool to promote Judeo-Christian values. These stances \u2014 possibly driven by his Anglican faith \u2014 make the candidate a big-government advocate, and not a true champion of limited government.\n\nKasich\u2019s only path to the nomination is through a contested convention. But his more likely play is to become Trump\u2019s running mate \u2014 a way for the establishment to absorb Trump and save the GOP. Either way, Kasich plays a role.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Ohio governor might be angling for the VP slot.", "csrf-token": "KPz3xdjUjgFLaGDygyppPnlwR91GPnJfYlmEfkrzrGg=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "The Ohio governor might be angling for the VP slot.", "title": "Why Is Kasich Still Running?", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/posts/41369", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2016-03-17-e0aa46d9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Either way, Kasich plays a role.\nThat \u201clong shot\u201d estimation is as true now as it was then, even if his campaign wasn\u2019t actually short-lived.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a long shot, and deservedly so,\u201d we wrote.\nBut his more likely play is to become Trump\u2019s running mate \u2014 a way for the establishment to absorb Trump and save the GOP.\nRight Hooks Why Is Kasich Still Running?"}
