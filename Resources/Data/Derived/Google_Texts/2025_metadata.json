The aim is to solicit input from residents and health care providers on the Mid-Shore.\n\nThe first session is Tuesday, March 29, at the public library in Cambridge.\n\nThe sessions in Kent County are Saturday morning, April 2, at the Rock Hall firehouse and Thursday evening, April 14, at Kent County High School in Worton.\n\n\u201cOur intention is to listen to people share the specific challenges they face in living their healthiest lives here on the Shore \u2014 from the ability to have a family doctor, nurse practitioner or physician assistant to care for their primary care needs, access to specialists and specialty services, transportation, help in managing their care at home, and the involvement of family in their care,\u201d Patti Willis, regional senior vice president of strategy and communications for Shore Regional Health, wrote in an email Tuesday, March 15. She said Internet access, basic education about living a healthy life, access to prevention, screening and diagnostic tests and how to live with an ongoing disease such as diabetes or heart failure also are concerns for rural communities on the Eastern Shore.\n\nKen Kozel, CEO and president of Shore Regional Health, and members of the health system board are expected to attend the sessions.\n\n\u201cThe focus of these sessions is to seek a wide picture of our communities\u2019 health needs and make sure our strategies incorporate this information,\u201d Willis wrote in Tuesday\u2019s email.\n\nSkeptics and cynics believe this process is a sham and that Shore Regional Health, taking its direction from the University of Maryland in Baltimore, is moving forward with a plan to shutter the hospital in Chestertown and build a regional facility in Easton.\n\nA Save Our Hospital campaign, led by physicians who practice in Kent County and northern Queen Anne\u2019s County, has enlisted thousands of supporters in its bid to retain inpatient beds and surgical services at Shore Medical Center at Chestertown \u2014 the current name for what the community founded in the 1930s as Kent & Queen Anne\u2019s Hospital.\n\nSome state officials with significant political clout also appear to be on board.\n\nState Sen. Thomas \u201cMac\u201d Middleton, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is the primary sponsor of SB 707, which proposes to convert acute care hospitals to freestanding medical facilities. Middletown has promised to amend the bill to exclude the hospital in Chestertown.\n\nMiddleton, Del. Peter Hammen, chairman of the House Health and Government Operations Committee, and state health secretary Van Mitchell have pledged their support of a process to identify the health care needs of the Eastern Shore and how to address those needs. No hospitals on the Shore will close until the process is completed and a plan is developed with the support of the Eastern Shore delegation.\n\nIn a Feb. 18 letter to the Eastern Shore delegation, Middleton, Hammen and Mitchell said \u201cthe Eastern Shore will be specifically excluded from legislation that provides hospitals with an avenue to convert to freestanding medical facilities.\u201d\n\nShore Regional Health\u2019s announcement of the community listening sessions comes at the same time the Save Our Hospital campaign appears to be gaining momentum with a battle being waged on the state level in Annapolis.\n\nWillis said that is only coincidence.\n\nKozel has repeatedly said \u2014 publicly and in news releases \u2014 that no decision has been made about inpatient beds in Chestertown.\n\n\u201cThese listening sessions are part of Shore Regional Health\u2019s strategic planning process and were developed as such,\u201d Willis wrote in the March 15 email.\n\nShe acknowledged that the information gathered would be incorporated into Shore Regional Health\u2019s community health needs assessment this year. The Affordable Care Act requires health systems to conduct a CHNA and adopt an implementation strategy at least once every three years.\n\nWillis said the Shore Regional Health board will address its planning decisions in May as part of the strategic planning process.\n\n\u201cHowever, the discussion about inpatient beds at the hospital in Chestertown is no longer part of the Board\u2019s planning decisions and will not be the focus of these listening sessions, since the announcement of a legislative and health policy study on rural health care in Maryland was announced\u201d by Middleton last month, Willis wrote in email. \u201cSince then, Shore Regional Health committed that any possible conversion of the hospital from acute inpatient care will be tabled for six years \u2014 the presumed one year of the State\u2019s study plus an additional five year commitment by Shore Regional Health. After that six years, State policy could guide additional resources to vulnerable rural hospitals in Maryland and the Shore Regional Health Board would want to consider that and all options before making a decision.\u201d\n\nA complete list of the community listening sessions is printed here.\n\nTuesday, March 29, 5:30 p.m.: Dorchester County Public Library, 303 Gay St., Cambridge\n\nWednesday, March 30, 5:30 p.m.: Caroline County Public Library, 100 Market St., Denton\n\nSaturday, April 2, 9:30 a.m.: Rock Hall firehouse, 21500 Rock Hall Ave.\n\nTuesday, April 5, 5:30 p.m.: Talbot County Community Center, 10028 Ocean Gateway, Easton\n\nMonday, April 11, 5:30 p.m.: Hurlock Train Station, 107 Gay St.\n\nTuesday, April 12, 5:30 p.m.: Centreville firehouse, 212 Broadway\n\nThursday, April 14, 5:30 p.m.: Kent County High School auditorium, 25301 Lambs Meadow Road, Worton\n\nSunday, April 24, 2 p.m.: Sudlersville firehouse, 203 N.
