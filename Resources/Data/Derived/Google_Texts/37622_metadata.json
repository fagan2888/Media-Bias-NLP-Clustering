Photo screenshot of The Associated Press\n\nIn February of 2009, Charla Nash survived an incredibly brutal chimpanzee attack. Unfortunately, she lost her hands, nose, eyes, lips, and mid-face bone structure, and received significant brain injuries at the hands of her neighbor\u2019s 200-pound \u201cpet.\u201d The U.S. government quickly volunteered to step in and pay for Nash\u2019s \u201cunfathomable\u201d medical bills, but what Nash may give the military doctors in return is truly priceless.\n\nDue to the extent of her injuries, Nash became a candidate to become recipient of the novel complete face transplant, and in 2011 she received the innovative operation, fully funded by the U.S. government. The Pentagon\u2019s involvement in Nash\u2019s recovery did not end after surgery, however. Every six weeks Nash undergoes lab tests for the military, MRIs and CT scans, to determine how well her brain is sending signals to her new face, The Associated Press repored. The military doctors are also interested in how well Nash\u2019s body is delivering blood to her new face and how her scars are healing.\n\nAlthough the tests are in exchange for the free medical care, Nash, the daughter of a U.S. Air Force veteran, does not seem to mind. The 61-year-old explained that she\u2019s happy to \u201cdo something good out of all this bad,\u201d and potentially help wounded soldiers.\n\n\u201cThey asked me, could they? I said, 'Yeah, I'd be thrilled to help out in any way I could,'\" said Nash, AP reported.\n\nThe next biggest hurdle in Nash\u2019s recovery is coming off of the immunosuppression medication. In all organ transplants the recipient\u2019s body will reject the foreign body part. Immunosuppression drugs help to prevent this rejection and are given to the recipient for the rest of his life. Unfortunately, these drugs carry a high risk of serious health complications, including viral infections, kidney failure, and even cancer.\n\nIn a new treatment, Nash will be switched from her regular immunosuppressions to Interleukin-2, a drug commonly used to treat skin and kidney cancers. It\u2019s hoped that the Interleukin-2 will promote the growth of new cells that will in turn protect her against transplant rejection. This would provide her with a resistance to rejection without the need for harsh medication.\n\nIf the Interleukin-2 drug proves to work on Nash, it would mean that transplants may become an even more common operation and could even be done on \u201cnon-vital\u201d organs, such as fingers and ears, which are currently not viewed as worth the risk of rejection drugs.\n\nThe face and extremities are the most common wounds experienced by soldiers in war, and although Nash\u2019s hand transplants had to be removed, her face is helping add to ongoing research on the relatively new operation.\n\nAP reported that since the world\u2019s first face transplant in 2005, 35 full or partial face transplants have been performed worldwide. Today it\u2019s estimated that of the 560 soldiers who have suffered severe facial wounds in Iraq and Afghanistan, 50 to 60 of those may be viable candidates for the face transplant surgery. The Pentagon\u2019s observations of Nash will go on to not only help the many U.S. wounded warriors, but also help to make advancements in transplant operations for all patients.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "charla nash, chimpanzee attack, transplant surgery, reconstructive surgery", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Observations of Charla Nash's amazing military-funded recovery following her chimp attack will help to advance transplant surgeries for both soldiers and civilians.", "title": "Survivor Of A Horrendous Chimp Attack Is Helping Change Transplant Surgery [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chimpanzee-attack-survivor-charla-nashs-new-face-may-forever-change-transplant-325220", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/11/charla-nash_0.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Observations of Charla Nash's amazing military-funded recovery following her chimp attack will help to advance transplant surgeries for both soldiers and civilians.", "title": "Survivor Of A Horrendous Chimp Attack Is Helping Change Transplant Surgery [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chimpanzee-attack-survivor-charla-nashs-new-face-may-forever-change-transplant-325220", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/11/charla-nash_0.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/11/charla-nash_0.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-03-11T12:31:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-11T12:31:50-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Observations of Charla Nash's amazing military-funded recovery following her chimp attack will help to advance transplant surgeries for both soldiers and civilians."}, "article_summary": "AP reported that since the world\u2019s first face transplant in 2005, 35 full or partial face transplants have been performed worldwide.\nToday it\u2019s estimated that of the 560 soldiers who have suffered severe facial wounds in Iraq and Afghanistan, 50 to 60 of those may be viable candidates for the face transplant surgery.\nIt\u2019s hoped that the Interleukin-2 will promote the growth of new cells that will in turn protect her against transplant rejection.\nThe military doctors are also interested in how well Nash\u2019s body is delivering blood to her new face and how her scars are healing.\nPhoto screenshot of The Associated PressIn February of 2009, Charla Nash survived an incredibly brutal chimpanzee attack."}
