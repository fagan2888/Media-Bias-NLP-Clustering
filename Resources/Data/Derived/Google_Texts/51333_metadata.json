The Pixies\u2019 main stage set in 2004 was the first major reunion gig for the act, which, in its heyday, had never broken through more than the college-radio club scene.\n\nThe Pixies\u2019 surprising, star-powered legacy was emboldened by the signifiers of cult status -- tape trades and older-brother recommendations, file-sharing and rock-star endorsements, rather than radio play and MTV airing. It was exciting for everyone and launched Coachella\u2019s international reputation as the place where band reunions, even those deemed impossible, could actually happen.\n\n\n\nBut this year\u2019s last-minute addition of the Pixies brought the quartet to the desert with a different agenda: after 10 years of nostalgia-drenched reunion tours, they\u2019re now in a promotion cycle for \u201cIndie Cindy,\u201d the band\u2019s first album in 23 years. Unsurprisingly, those critics concerned with the band\u2019s legacy have already blasted it for sullying their perfect rep (Pitchfork infamously gave it a 1.0). Their placement -- in a spot in the Mojave tent against major acts on both the main stages -- begged the question of whether anyone still cares about the Pixies?\n\n\n\nThe answer, thankfully, is yes. Despite a Coachella crowd that\u2019s appeared indifferent to fellow legacy acts like the Replacements and the Afghan Whigs, kids packed the Mojave to yelp through \u201cWave Of Mutilation\u201d and \u201cBone Machine,\u201d seemingly unaware or uncaring that founding bassist/vocalist Kim Deal\u2019s spot on stage has been taken by A Perfect Circle\u2019s Paz Lenchantin. That move has found the band derided in hardcore fan circles, but here seemed to have emboldened the rest of the group.\n\n\n\nFrontman Black Francis played as if he had something to prove rather than some money to collect; drummer David Lovering bashed hard; and guitarist Joey Santiago was clearly fully-invested, wailing through \u201cVamos\u201d at the close of the set before flipping his Les Paul around and playing the pickup toggle switch, left-handed, while holding it aloft.\n\n\n\nAnd those new songs? While they may not have gotten the crowd response of \u201cCaribou\u201d or \u201cWhere Is My Mind?,\u201d they don\u2019t stand out, either. The newer tracks are secondary cuts, for sure, but secondary cuts that don\u2019t get in the way of those that brought the band to prominence -- and could have come from any of their primary albums.\n\n\n\nThe new material is also a sure sign that the Pixies aren\u2019t going anywhere again. At this point, that\u2019s still cause for celebration.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "When the Pixies played Coachella 10 years ago, the band\u2019s set was a defining moment in both the festival and the group\u2019s history.
