Abortions, by nature, are performed on young women, a population that is generally healthy. Colonoscopies, by contrast, are typically performed on older people who are more likely to have other health problems, which can cause complications during the procedure. Yet nobody is calling for TRAP-like laws for colonoscopies. I am not either; just making a point.\n\nTRAP laws are not intended to protect women. Indeed, as your editorial points out, women who don\u2019t have access to legal abortions may attempt to induce their own abortions, which is very risky.\n\nEven the Southern Baptist Convention understood the need for women to have access to safe abortions when, in 1971 (before Roe v. Wade was decided), it called upon \u201cSouthern Baptists to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.\u201d Roe v. Wade was similarly decided to protect the health of women.\n\nWhen politicians enact TRAP laws, they are disregarding these roots, and harming women in the process.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCAROL ROYE\n\nOssining, N.Y.\n\nThe writer is a professor of nursing at Pace University and the author of \u201cA Woman\u2019s Right to Know: How Women\u2019s Health Became a Political Pawn \u2014 and the Surprising Alliances Working to Reclaim It.\u201d\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nPerhaps if politicians stopped harping on abortion for two seconds, they\u2019d realize what an essential medical resource Planned Parenthood has been for low-income women through the years.\n\nDuring my starving artist days (no health insurance), Planned Parenthood allowed me to have regular gynecological exams on a sliding fee scale; it saved a friend\u2019s life through early detection of a breast lump. My mother, who often scoffed at clinics, no doubt remembering the overcrowded facilities of her youth on the Lower East Side, swore by Planned Parenthood, whose counselors gave her excellent advice.\n\nEven after obtaining health insurance, I continued to use Planned Parenthood, finding its medical and support staff more professional and compassionate than other health care providers I visited.\n\nWhere is the logic in cutting off medical services and contraceptive counseling in tandem with restricting abortion access while eliminating economic safety net services for low-income women trying to act responsibly? Do Republicans simply expect women to stop having sex? Or do they plan to dance on the graves of women living below a certain income level by denying their rights to affordable, quality health care?\n\nJUDY CHICUREL\n\nBrooklyn\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nOnce again your editorial board ignores the fact that the reproductive \u201cright\u201d of elective abortion involves the deliberate and direct annihilation of an innocent human life in utero.\n\nThe so-called constitutional right that permits the atrocity of elective abortion vitiates protections of life found in the Fifth and 14th Amendments to the Constitution.\n\nMost compellingly, Supreme Court decisions permitting elective abortion amount to a court-sanctioned home invasion in the first home of the unborn human being, in the womb of the unborn child\u2019s mother, a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nRICHARD H.
