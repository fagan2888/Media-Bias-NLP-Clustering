Voelker was joined on the call by state Sen. Anna Tovar, D-Tolleson, state Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Phoenix, and David Simas, a deputy advisor at the White House.\n\nSimas said national healthcare enrollment in December was more than 1.8 million, nearly five times the enrollment in October and November combined.\u02dc Arizona had more than 9,000 people sign up in December.\n\nBut where Democrats saw gains, at least one Republican congressman from the state said the numbers were nothing to brag about.\n\n\u201cArizona\u2019s population is more than 6.5 million, yet a measly 28,000 Arizonans purchased health care plans on the exchange\u201d since it began in October, said Rep. Paul Gosar,R-Prescott in an emailed statement.\n\nThe statement noted that 36 percent of the Arizona enrollees are between 55 and 64 years old, and that the program needs more younger people to keep health insurance premiums from rising further. Gosar pointed to a Prescott woman who testified to a House committee that her monthly premiums rose $800 under the act, which she feared might force the family to sell its home and cars to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cThis law us a complete disaster, which must be repealed and replaced with a free-market, patient-centered alternative,\u201d Gosar said in his statement.\n\nSimas conceded that just one in three Arizonans enrolled so far is under age 35. But he said a strategy of \u201cconstant outreach, repetition and engagement\u201d has started to bear fruit, noting that there have now been 11 million phone calls and 53 million visits to the health care website.\n\nSimas also pointed to efforts to boost youth enrollment in the program by getting as many athletes and celebrities as possible to endorse enrollment. He said Feb. 15 has been designated National Youth Enrollment day in hopes of gaining massive sign-ups.\n\nTovar, a cancer survivor, said she was elated to be in Washington for the passage of the health care act, saying it could give all Arizonans the opportunity for health care that she had.\n\nGallego also emphasized that before the passage of the ACA nearly 129 million Americans had their health care coverage threatened due to a pre-existing condition \u2013 people like Voelker and her Marfan\u2019s, a genetic disorder that affects connective tissue. The act has changed that, Simas said.\n\n\u201cEvery person in Arizona who wants coverage will be able to sign up for that coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not about Democrats or Republicans.\u02dcIt is not about the Washington debates.\u02dcIt is about making sure everyone in Arizona gets affordable care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "index.html", "image": "http://cronkitenews.asu.edu/assets/images/13/09/25-premiums-needles-front.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Laid off and with a pre-existing medical condition, Tucson resident Sue Voelker said it was a struggle to get health insurance \u2013 until the passage of the Affordable Care Act.
