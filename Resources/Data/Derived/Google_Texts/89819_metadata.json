He said the disconnect between improving economic conditions and stagnant gaming growth is changing.\n\n\u201cIn our view, what is different now is the convergence of a surging Las Vegas Strip coupled with an improving locals economy,\u201d Shore told investors last month. \u201cWhile we aren\u2019t forecasting a near-term return to peak levels, we continue to remain positive on the long-term health of the market given the aforementioned issues.\u201d\n\nMuch of the news surrounding the gaming industry\u2019s economic recovery has focused on the Strip.\n\nCompanies such as MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment Corp. are spending a combined $1 billion to create large outdoor retail, nightlife and entertainment districts, each highlighted by a centerpiece attraction. For MGM Resorts, a 20,000-seat sports arena and events center will anchor The Park by 2016. In April, Caesars opened the 550-foot-tall High Roller observation wheel as the focal point of The Linq.\n\nNotice gaming is not the focus.\n\nMGM Resorts is upgrading New York-New York and Monte Carlo as part of The Park, but is not adding new gaming areas. Caesars moved and downsized the shuttered O\u2019Shea\u2019s Casino to become part of The Quad.\n\nThe main point is to drive nongaming spending by customers.\n\nThe locals market has gotten the hint.\n\nStation Casinos is spending $55 million to upgrade its restaurants, nightlife and other amenities at its flagship Red Rock Resort and Green Valley Ranch Resort.\n\nBoyd Gaming Corp. executives said during the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings call that a retooling of restaurant offerings at its Coast Casinos and Sam\u2019s Town is being considered.\n\nThe idea is to build off the business being created by the Strip, which often translates into increased business in the locals market.\n\n\u201cBoyd has both derivate and direct exposure to a Strip recovery,\u201d Shore said. \u201cThe Las Vegas Strip is rebounding as evidenced by recent data out of the market and first-quarter Las Vegas results to-date from Strip operators.\u201d\n\nDeutsche Bank gaming analyst Andrew Zarnett predicts a modest growth in the Las Vegas locals market this year, which helps Boyd Gaming and Station Casinos. He said both companies have improved their credit profiles at the same time they move to reinvest in their properties.\n\n\u201cOver the last 12 months, Station Casinos has successfully completed a series of financial transactions that have improved the company\u00b4s liquidity profile, extended debt maturities and reduced borrowing cost,\u201d Zarnett said.\n\n\u201cThere have been many positive catalysts for Boyd credit in the past year, such as bank/bond refinancing at Borgata and Boyd and the sale of non-core assets (the Echelon site on the Strip to Genting).\u201d\n\nOne other piece of the Station Casinos puzzle is the company management contract with the Graton Resort and Casino north of San Francisco for a Northern California Indian tribe.\n\nZarnett said the Indian casino \u201cprovides the company with some diversification away from the local Las Vegas market.\u201d\n\nGaming revenue is not driving the Strip nor the locals markets, for now.\n\nThrough March, Strip gaming revenue is down 5.4 percent. For casinos along the Boulder strip, which includes Henderson, gaming revenue is down 7.3 percent through March. Both North Las Vegas casinos (1 percent) and the rest of Clark County (1.1 percent) are up for the year\u2019s first three months.\n\nShore said $8 billion has been earmarked for investment on the Strip, including the $4 billion Resorts World Las Vegas development and MGM\u2019s arena. Those projects mean more construction jobs, which result in more spending by potential locals gaming customers.\n\n\u201cConstruction workers have high relative salaries when compared to other subsectors, are transient and free spending,\u201d Shore said. \u201cThe upcoming capital development projects and related new construction workers should have a clear positive impact on the locals\u2019 economy and gross gaming revenue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/inside-gaming/new-life-being-breathed-locals-gaming-market", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "HOWARD STUTZ LAS VEGAS BUSINESS PRESS", "parsely-title": "New life being breathed into locals gaming market", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_Red-Rock-Restaurant-Row_1.jpg", "twitter": {"description": "You know things are on the upswing in the locals gaming market when the two Arizona Charlie\u2019s casinos report a first-quarter net revenue increase.
