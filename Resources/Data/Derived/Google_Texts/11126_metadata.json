Heather Duncan\n\nThere are no national requirements that local utilities provide reliable electric service.\n\nAnd although half of all states have set reliability standards and even more require at least reliability tracking, Tennessee does neither.\n\nThe national Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers has developed a system of benchmarks for reliability widely used in the industry. Among the most commonly tracked are the average length of time a customer of the utility is without power in a year, and how often the average customer loses power.\n\nLin Fangxing, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Tennessee, said more than 20 states require utilities to meet a minimum standard for the length and frequency of power outages. More than 10 states require only that the information be reported.\n\nTennessee falls into the category of about a dozen states that have no electric reliability requirements at all, despite the monopoly status enjoyed by electric providers.\n\nIn many states, public utilities commissions must approve changes to rates but do not directly oversee reliability. Such commissions also focus on investor-owned utilities, not public ones, according to the Regulatory Assistance Project.\n\n\u201cEven those (utility commissions) that do investigate service problems may not have the authority to punish a utility,\u201d said Rob Thormeyer, spokesman for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. \u201cAnd even if they do, the fines may be so low that the commission just holds a hearing and says: \u2018Utility, do better next time.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Tennessee Regulatory Authority is one of those commissions that oversees only rates \u2014 except in the case of privately-held electric utilities, of which there are none in the Knoxville area. Although power in the region is generated by the Tennessee Valley Authority, the quasi-public agency sells power in bulk to distributors that are mostly local governments.\n\nAllen Mosher, vice president of policy analysis for the American Public Power Association, said most municipal utilities aren\u2019t regulated by state utility commissions.\n\nBut he argues that because those power providers live in the communities they serve, they are more responsive to customer feedback.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re at Rotary, church, and the Piggly Wiggly, so the customer interface is really immediate,\u201d Mosher said. \u201cWe think we do a better job, even adjusting for the fact that we have a more urban territory.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to know for sure since no one is tracking their performance.\n\nStates that monitor reliability more closely are often those that have had problems in the past, such as northeastern states that lost electricity for more than a week in 2003.\n\nSome states, such as North Carolina, have an independent public safety staff to advocate for consumers in cases that come before the utilities commission.\n\nShannon Littleton, general manager for the Lenoir City Utilities Board, said he foresees that the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, an international regulatory authority, is going to start focusing more on reliability at the distributor level.\n\nA 2011 report by the Galvin Electricity Initiative recommended power providers be required to report reliability information to communities without excluding major events such as storms. The report also argued utilities should be required to report deaths or injuries caused by power outages or interactions with the distribution system.\n\nBut many experts agree federal regulation is unlikely for several reasons. Challenges to electrical systems vary, depending on a region\u2019s climate and topography, said Joydeep Mitra, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Michigan. He said stringent standards would require more providers to install expensive smart-grid technology that might be beyond their means.\n\nBut Mosher and Mitra agreed state and regional pressure for utilities to reduce outages is increasing.\n\nAnd although the federal government doesn\u2019t punish poor performance, it could encourage better performance.\n\nFor example, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, passed to help stimulate the economy after the 2008 recession, provided smart-grid investment grants for 99 projects, including one at KUB.\n\nMore than half of the grants sought to increase the reliability of distribution systems, usually through automated feeder switching, which can isolate and reconfigure faulty segments of the power grid and reduce outage frequency, length, and the number of customers affected.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Electric utilities don't have to track or report outages", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/electric-utilities-dont-have-to-track-or-report-outages-ep-814322241-353822871.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/utility_10550820_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 425}, "type": "article", "description": "There are no national requirements that local utilities provide reliable electric service.", "title": "Electric utilities don't have to track or report outages"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/utility_10550820_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "There are no national requirements that local utilities provide reliable electric service.", "site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Electric utilities don't have to track or report outages"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe18e2\"", "article_summary": "The report also argued utilities should be required to report deaths or injuries caused by power outages or interactions with the distribution system.\nA 2011 report by the Galvin Electricity Initiative recommended power providers be required to report reliability information to communities without excluding major events such as storms.\nTennessee falls into the category of about a dozen states that have no electric reliability requirements at all, despite the monopoly status enjoyed by electric providers.\n(NEWS SENTINEL ARCHIVE)</p>By S.
