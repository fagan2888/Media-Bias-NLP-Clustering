Abby Wambach and Christie Rampone, the only player remaining from the 1999 title team, both came on as subs late in what\u2019s expected to be their final World Cup appearances.\n\nLloyd scored in the third, sixth and 16th minutes, the last a speculative shot from midfield that beat Japan goalkeeper Ayumi Kaihori. Lloyd scored the fastest hat trick in World Cup history, men\u2019s or women\u2019s, in the highest scoring Women\u2019s World Cup final.\n\nLauren Holiday also scored in the first half and Tobin Heath added a goal in the 54th minute after Japan scored an own goal to cut the deficit to 4-2.\n\n#USWNT celebrating a goal.
