WASHINGTON, D.C. (WSAU) -- Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson has teamed with Texas Senator John Cornyn to increase preventative measures against the Zika virus.

If passed, the legislation would add $1.1 billion in supplemental funding to the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of State by cutting $1.2 billion from the Affordable Care Act Prevention and Public Health Fund in the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years. It would also amend federal regulations that would prevent state and local authorities from effectively spraying against mosquitoes year-round.

While the mosquito types that carry Zika have yet to be identified in Wisconsin, there are more than 50 species of the insect in the state annually. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that Zika mosquitoes have made their way into Iowa, Illinois, and part of Minnesota. The virus is not debilitating to adults, but it is known to cause unborn children to have underdeveloped brains if a pregnant mother is infected.
