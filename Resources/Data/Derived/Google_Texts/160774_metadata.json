Together, their responses illustrate the diversity of the indigenous communities of the Western Hemisphere, as well as their shared concerns, and offer insights beyond what\u2019s in the news to the ideas and experiences of Native peoples today.\n\nPlease introduce yourself with your name and title.\n\nMy name is Brenda Meade. I'm chairperson of the Coquille Indian Tribal Council.\n\nWhere is your tribal community located?\n\nThe Coquille Indian Tribe is headquartered in North Bend, Oregon, on the southern Oregon Coast.\n\nWhere were the Coquille people originally from?\n\nWe are originally from Southern Oregon. Our knowledge of the exact boundary and use areas of our ancestors is evolving as we recover from federal termination. Our ancestral range includes lands in Coos, Curry, Douglas, Josephine, and Jackson counties in Oregon.\n\nIs there a significant point in your tribe's history that you would like to share?\n\nIt would have to be June 28, 1989, the day that Congress finally acknowledged the efforts of my tribal elders and restored federal recognition of the Coquille Indian Tribe. As a result of that day, a historic injustice\u2014the U.S. government's termination of the tribe as a nation and denial of our status as Indian people\u2014was corrected. We are now the second largest employer in Coos County, Oregon, and an undeniable force for positive change in our communities.\n\nHow is your tribal government set up?\n\nWe are governed by a seven-member Tribal Council that is elected by our General Council\u2014all enrolled tribal members 18 years old or older. Our constitution reserves several rights to the General Council. We provide many leadership and government-participation opportunities for our members. One thing that I am especially proud of is that we are forming a youth council to promote leadership and cultural competence among our young tribal members.\n\nIs there any other functional, traditional entity of leadership in addition to your modern government system?\n\nI would say it is in the way we gain knowledge from our elders. We continue to gather as Indian people on this land and share information with each other. We continue to learn and understand as we hunt, fish, and gather traditional foods and materials together.\n\nHow often are elected leaders chosen?\n\nAll Tribal Council members serve three-year terms.\n\nHow often does your government meet?\n\nOur Tribal Council meets at least twice per month. Our General Council has at least two meetings a year, always coinciding with the winter and summer solstices.\n\nHow did your life experience prepare you to lead your tribe?\n\nWhen I grew up my tribe was not recognized as a tribe by the federal government, and we had very few financial resources. But we had our collective desire to make a change. Coquille people are characteristically kind, generous, humorous, and absolutely unwavering when it comes to tribal sovereignty. These values shaped me and many other tribal members who grew up during that time. I understood how important sovereignty was and how important it was to uphold our cultural and historic values.\n\nWho inspired you as a mentor?\n\nMany people every day! But I would first recognize my uncle Jerry Running Foxe for teaching me as I was growing up to always fight for the rights of all Indian People. He taught me always with a kind heart and for the right reasons. Also my aunt Sharon\u2014as a child I was lucky enough to spend time with her as she fought for us to be recognized as Coquille people. Her lifelong dedication and personal sacrifices in gathering Coquille people together in support of those efforts will never be forgotten. I watched her and many other tribal members work tirelessly for our people\u2014after mass disbursement to the reservation, termination policies, and very successful assimilation programs\u2014to be recognized again. Thankfully our elders never gave up, and for that reason we must continue to strengthen our nation every day.\n\nI later was able to sit on Tribal Council with my auntie and with many other amazing tribal leaders. One that I must mention is our chief of 23 years who recently passed, Chief Ken Tanner. He taught me to be humble, to be grateful for what we have, and to always save some for the others. I must also recognize my amazing husband who supports me every day and allows me to do the things I feel I need to do. All of my family influences me\u2014my children, my mother, my brothers, and those who have passed. I have also been very fortunate in my life to be able to work and spend time with many of our tribal elders and our tribal youth. I know that we must learn from our elders, teach our children, and never forget!\n\nTo read the full interview, visit the NMAI series here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The National Museum of the American Indian interview series Meet Native America continues today with Brenda Meade.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/08/29/brenda-meade-nmais-meet-native-america-series-161563", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/chairperson_meade_raising_the_flag_of_the_coquille_indian_tribe_at_a_ceremony.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Brenda Meade: NMAI\u2019s Meet Native America Series"}, "abstract": "The National Museum of the American Indian interview series Meet Native America continues today with Brenda Meade.", "dc": {"title": "Brenda Meade: NMAI\u2019s Meet Native America Series"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/08/29/brenda-meade-nmais-meet-native-america-series-161563", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Dennis Zotigh, NMAI, National Museum of the American Indian, Meet Native America, Brenda Meade, Coquille Indian Tribe", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-08-29T10:14-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Brenda Meade: NMAI\u2019s Meet Native America Series"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde50d\"", "article_summary": "We are governed by a seven-member Tribal Council that is elected by our General Council\u2014all enrolled tribal members 18 years old or older.\nI'm chairperson of the Coquille Indian Tribal Council.\nI later was able to sit on Tribal Council with my auntie and with many other amazing tribal leaders.\nThe Coquille Indian Tribe is headquartered in North Bend, Oregon, on the southern Oregon Coast.\nAll Tribal Council members serve three-year terms."}
