The more I digest it, the more revolutionary it seems.\n\nHold on to your Whoppers: The report calls for a plant-based diet, much less red meat, taxes on high-sugar products, and personal coaching to help citizens eat smarter and fight their addictions to toxic processed foods. I\u2019m not making this up. The way most Americans eat is making the country sick and fat, the independent advisers concluded. The committee weighed tons of data \u2014 including the fact that 70 percent of Americans are overweight or obese \u2014 and called for drastic changes in both thinking and policy.\n\nFor starters, the report is a giant poke in the eye \u2014 or more fitting, a metal spike into the brain \u2014 for the U.S. conventional meat industry.\n\nAs Politico reported: \u201cIf adopted by the departments of Agriculture and Human and Health Service as part of their every-five- year exercise to educate the public about how to eat healthier, the suggestions could not only influence consumer decisions but also be used to guide federal nutrition policy, including the $16 billion school lunch program.\u201d\n\nFat chance. It\u2019s one thing for the report to emphasize the usual stuff about eating more fruits and veggies; it\u2019s another to imagine the government is actually going to tax desserts or tell the truth about our toxic food supply.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth taking a closer look at some of the DGAC recommendations. Even if the government refuses to go along, you can still follow along in your own home. Go to DietaryGuidelines.org to see the full report. You have until April 8 to chew it over and make comments.\n\n\u25a0 The red meat issue: There are two good reasons the panel wants you to give up red meat. First, conventionally produced meat is laden with chemicals, hormones and additives that are unhealthy to humans. Just because all those burgers and pork chops are legal, don\u2019t assume they\u2019re good for your innards. They\u2019re not; even though the meat industry is going to try its darndest over the next few months to convince you the jury is still out.\n\nDGAC is the jury. It\u2019s telling you you\u2019ll be a lot healthier if you eat a plant-based diet. Believe them.\n\nThe second reason the panel came out against red meat has to do with the environment. It\u2019s a first. In the past, no one in charge talked about the obvious link between food policy and environmental policy, but this time the nutrition experts bit the bullet and explained that consuming red meat isn\u2019t just bad for human health, it\u2019s unhealthy and unsustainable for the planet. Animal farts are a leading cause of climate change. Laugh all you want but don\u2019t turn up your nose at the importance of what they\u2019re saying.\n\n\u25a0 Eat less sugar: The eat-a-lot-less sugar recommendation is old news. You\u2019re probably tired of hearing it. Too bad.\n\nSugar causes obesity and serious chronic health problems. Americans consume 22 to 30 teaspoons of added sugar daily, half of it from soda, juices and sugar drinks. The DGAC report tells you to cut that in half, at least. And to help you change your behavior, it\u2019s calling for taxes on high sugar foods and drinks. It also wants the amount of added sugar clearly spelled out on nutrition labels. This may sound like pie in the sky, but think tobacco and how every cigarette box now tells you smoking can kill you.\n\nLook out, Pop-Tarts and Frosted Flakes.\n\n\u25a0 The big fat mistake: Since 1980, the DGAC has urged people to cut back on cholesterol and fat.\n\nSurprise! They were wrong \u2014 and in this new report, they almost admit it. When people switched to non-fat and low-fat things, they ended up eating loads of grains, pasta, carbs and addictive, oversweetened and processed foods.\n\nIt turns out processed foods are the enemy, not fat. Now the panel wants you go back to eating healthy fats \u2014 olive oil, nuts, even butter \u2014 and forget all the bad things they said about eating eggs and shrimp.\n\nIs it confusing? Absolutely. Is it essential to your health? You betcha.\n\nMarilynn Preston is a fitness expert, personal trainer and speaker on healthy lifestyle issues.
