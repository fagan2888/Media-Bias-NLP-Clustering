Work-life balance as an issue is as relevant to fathers in 2014 as it has long been to mothers:\n\nDr. Wayne Scott Andersen, medical director, Take Shape For Life, Inc.:\n\n\u201cI travel almost every week for work, so to prioritize my time, I apply the Mason jar parable: You have a jar, large rocks, pebbles, and sand. Imagine the sand is what\u2019s happening right now. If you fill the jar with sand, there is no room for anything else, specifically the big rocks \u2013 the important things \u2013 in your life. So I fill my life with the big rocks first \u2013 family trips, my daughters\u2019 school events. Then I add the pebbles and sand.\n\nRelated: 10 Easy Ways to Improve Your Work-Life Balance\n\n\u201cI had my 14-year-old daughter\u2019s graduation on my calendar for months so that no small things could block it. My wife, Lori, and our daughters, Erica, 14, and Savannah, 17, stack our cell phones when we go out to dinner \u2013 and the first one to pick up a phone to check messages has to pay for dinner. The girls have had to pay once or twice! We also avoid electronics on vacations so we have time to connect with each other.\n\n\u201cWhen the girls come home from school and I\u2019m there, I drop everything and devote 100 percent of my attention to them \u2013 because I know I\u2019ll only have their attention for about five minutes. I make sure they\u2019re validated.\u201d\n\nRaul Corzo, president, IMUSA USA:\n\n\u201cIn the boardroom, I'm dialed in on IMUSA but when I am home, being a father to Sabrina, 14, and Raul, 10, is my main priority. My kids call the shots, from going to the movies, a concert or the mall. I\u2019m a hands-on father.\u201d\n\nMike MacDonald, CEO, Medifast:\n\n\u201cI have three adult children and four grandchildren, with a fifth grandchild on the way. As active and out front as I am in running a public company and needing to demonstrate leadership, I try to spend every minute I can on the weekends with all my children and grandchildren. It\u2019s a very balanced life that way \u2013 I\u2019m a fortunate man.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bribe Your Kids and You\u2019ll Pay the Price\n\nTed Karkus, CEO, ProPhase Labs:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m motivated to provide my wife and kids with as much love and attention as possible. I volunteered to coach my two sons, Jason, 16, and Brett, 11, in AAU travel basketball. Coaching my kids guarantees that I spend quality time with them in a situation where I cannot be distracted by work. As for the rest of the time, I watch less TV and do fewer activities that aren\u2019t productive and instead spend time with my family.\u201d\n\nMichael Mahoney, SVP, Consumer Marketing, GoHealth:\n\n\u201cThe key is making time at the right time. I have a 3-month-old son, so I\u2019m always deciding when to be in or out of the office and when to be engaged (even remotely) \u2013 and how to prioritize my time while at work. I want to get more done in less time so I can be present and engaged in my child's life. I try to focus on maximizing what matters and minimizing what does not.\u201d\n\nCraig Shirley, author:\n\n\u201cI never subscribed to the BS about \u2018quality time.\u2019 All time is quality time when it comes to children. I\u2019ve been fortunate to write from home and so never bought into the nonsense about rationing time with our four children \u2013 but even when I went to an office, I rejected that false notion.\u201d\n\nDr. John P. Salerno, MD, The Salerno Center:\n\n\u201cI take my son, age 10, and my daughter, age 6, to school every day. Since I tend to work later hours and arrive home late, it\u2019s a great way for me to spend time with the kids. I\u2019ll often ride my bike with them to school. We have great conversations.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Americans will spend an estimated $12.5 billion on Father\u2019s Day gifts for dear old dad", "title": "Father\u2019s Day: Family First for These Business Leaders", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/15/Father-s-Day-Family-First-These-Business-Leaders", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06172010_father_day_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/15/Father-s-Day-Family-First-These-Business-Leaders", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06172010_father_day_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@maurmack"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Americans will spend an estimated $12.5 billion on Father\u2019s Day gifts for dear old dad", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd85d1\"", "article_summary": "So I fill my life with the big rocks first \u2013 family trips, my daughters\u2019 school events.\nThis Father\u2019s Day, we asked seven executives how they balance the critical job of parenting with their 24/7 professional lives \u2013 and how they keep their children front and center.\nSince I tend to work later hours and arrive home late, it\u2019s a great way for me to spend time with the kids.\nCoaching my kids guarantees that I spend quality time with them in a situation where I cannot be distracted by work.\nI\u2019m a hands-on father.\u201dMike MacDonald, CEO, Medifast:\u201cI have three adult children and four grandchildren, with a fifth grandchild on the way."}
