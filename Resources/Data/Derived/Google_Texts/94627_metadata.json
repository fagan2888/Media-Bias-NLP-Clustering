I think people are worn out of the daily news cycle. Monthly magazines are having a bit of a revival, and I\u2019d like to think the Sunday news shows could be that for politics. I want to do healthcare in multiple segments, do a status update, try to be less political and less Washington about it, and I think Sunday shows have that luxury again.\n\nDo you think you\u2019re already doing that, or is that a direction you want to go?\n\nIt\u2019s a direction I\u2019m trying to go. When we did an Ebola show, we brought in experts and the politicians were secondary. We had doctors \u2014 specialists in the field. I want to do that more on big issues.\n\nWhat do you think ratings for a Sunday show correlate to: the better interviews, the better host, the topics?\n\nI think it\u2019s habitual. If you look at the history of all of television news, it\u2019s habitual. People are NBC families or ABC families or CBS families. Tim Russert was in third place, and it took him four or five years to catch David Brinkley. I\u2019m really trying to keep our P.R. people from trumpeting short-term rating success. It\u2019s more like building a football program; it\u2019s a three-year plan. In three years, I\u2019d better be in the top spot or they should think about a new head coach.\n\nDo you think delivering ratings are part of your job?\n\nYeah, whether I like it or not.\n\nIf a year from now you\u2019re happy with the quality of the journalism and the news division is happy with what\u2019s going on the air but you don\u2019t have the ratings, then what do you have?\n\nI assume if the quality is there that the ratings will follow. They have followed quickly in D.C. That to me is an important metric; if Washington cares about the show, that\u2019s a start. If you look at the rings of opinion leaders, that\u2019s ring No. 1. If you\u2019re doing a quality show, then the ratings will follow.\n\nMy beef with media writers is that they only cover the ratings. I hope we have the guests and are asking the questions that make news. If we have more clips that are generated by what people are saying on the show, that tells me we\u2019re doing our job.\n\nThe show\u2019s iPhone app got folded into the NBC News app. Is the digital strategy for the show to be more a part of NBC News?\n\nWe\u2019re trying to meld the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and our politics into one brand, which is easier to do now because I have both titles \u2014 moderator and political director \u2014 so we\u2019re trying to meld those two worlds together. The gold standard in politics is the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d brand, so we should be embracing the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d brand.\n\nIsn\u2019t it a little icky that corporate media companies are polling on how much viewers like you?\n\nLet me say this: I don\u2019t like it when journalists become part of a story. We have a culture in social media that wants to make journalists as big a part of the story as politicians themselves. That\u2019s not good. People say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re trying to insert yourself into a story.\u201d I\u2019m not. I\u2019m trying to be a conduit, to be a challenge or a devil\u2019s advocate for the public. I wish there wasn\u2019t as much focus on the individual personalities of journalists. The people we cover should be the focus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon talked to the \"Meet the Press\" host about cable news, Hillary fatigue and his beef with media writers", "author": "Scott Porch", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon talked to the \"Meet the Press\" host about cable news, Hillary fatigue and his beef with media writers", "title": "Chuck Todd: \u201cI wish we didn\u2019t focus on the individual personalities of journalists\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/29/chuck_todd_i_wish_we_didnt_focus_on_the_individual_personalities_of_journalists/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/chuck_todd2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon talked to the \"Meet the Press\" host about cable news, Hillary fatigue and his beef with media writers", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/chuck_todd2.jpg", "title": "Chuck Todd: \u201cI wish we didn\u2019t focus on the individual personalities of journalists\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Chuck Todd: \u201cI wish we didn\u2019t focus on the individual personalities of journalists\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Cable News, chuck todd, Editor's Picks, Hillary, Hillary Clinton, meet the press, Obama, The Stranger", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf8b0\"", "article_summary": "What do you think ratings for a Sunday show correlate to: the better interviews, the better host, the topics?\nI\u2019m trying to be a conduit, to be a challenge or a devil\u2019s advocate for the public.\nDo you think you\u2019re already doing that, or is that a direction you want to go?\nI wish there wasn\u2019t as much focus on the individual personalities of journalists.\nIt\u2019s a direction I\u2019m trying to go."}
