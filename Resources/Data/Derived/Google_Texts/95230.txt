A local church celebrated its pastor's promotion within the military on Sunday.

Central United Methodist Church in Meridian honored lead pastor John Branning, who is the brigade chaplain for the 185th Theater Aviation Brigade, and has been promoted to a major. Branning's commander and command element were on hand for the special occasion.

"This was an achievement for me," Major Branning says. "I mean, you have to work to move up through the ranks of the military. But to be the lead pastor here at Central and to be a chaplain in the United States Army, has just been a fulfillment of my calling into the ministry."

Branning says he wanted to share this occasion with those he is closest to, which is his church family.
