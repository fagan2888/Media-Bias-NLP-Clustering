For moms it decreases the risk of Ovarian and Breast Cancer and helps with postpartum depression.\n\nSo you could say that breastfeeding builds a bond for mother and child that is emotional and biological. Dietician and Certified Breastfeeding Counselor Jean Ballone says even though it\u2019s natural there is still a stigma.\n\n\u201cWomen sometimes when they breast feed in public a lot of people give them a dirty look or they\u2019ll not want them to breastfeed in public. They want them to go into a restroom or a private area. Actually, in Michigan a woman can breastfeed anywhere, anytime, as long as they\u2019re legally allowed to be in that spot,\u201d said Ballone.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s about 75% of women in Michigan that initiate breastfeeding. Prior to last year in the legislation that was passed, we had women asked to leave stores and kicked off buses and other things because people felt uncomfortable with women breastfeeding and there was really no protection from that,\u201d said Julie Lothamer, Michigan Breastfeed Peer Councilor Coordinator.\n\nMichigan has seen changes to legislature to protect breastfeeding and even the nation has, too, since the Affordable Care Act, but progress is still needed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for everybody to know they have a role in supporting breastfeeding. They may not know what their direct roll is, and it may be just the person on the street that smiles at a nursing mom, but I think that culture change is the biggest thing that\u2019s needed for us to support breast feeding,\u201d said Lothamer.\n\nIf moms are not able to breastfeed there are breast-milk donors who donate through the Human Milk Bank Association of North America, that way babies can still get the benefits of breast-milk that formula can\u2019t offer.\n\nFor more information about Human Milk Bank Association of North American click here.\n\nFor more information on the National WIC Association click here.\n\nFor more information about the Michigan WIC and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services click here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Women sometimes when they breast feed in public a lot of people give them a dirty look or they'll not want them to breastfeed in public.
