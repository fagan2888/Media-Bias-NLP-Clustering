Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement.\n\nSBA List filed a lawsuit in 2010, when the Ohio Elections Commission ruled probable cause existed to believe a billboard it wanted to buy contained a false statement about a candidate\u2019s voting record, in violation of Ohio Revised Code 3517.21.\n\nThe billboard would have said former Rep. Steve Driehaus, D-Ohio, supported taxpayer-funded abortion by voting for the Affordable Care Act. Driehaus, who was defeated in the 2010 election, dropped his complaint against the group after he lost.\n\nCOAST \u2014 Coalition Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxation \u2014 sued because it planned to erect similar billboards. Both groups claimed the law was a violation of their First Amendment rights.\n\nLower courts ruled that since SBA List was never prosecuted under the law and, since COAST hadn\u2019t actually erected billboards, lacked standing to sue.\n\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court disagreed.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the majority opinion, referenced several prior cases in which the court held that an individual does not need to \u201cfirst expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nThe case was remanded back to the lower court and oral arguments were presented Sept. 4.\n\nCiting a quote from the SBA List\u2019s oral arguments, Black wrote:\n\n\u201c(We are not) arguing for a right to lie. We\u2019re arguing that we have a right not to have the truth of our political statements be judged by the Government.\n\n\u201cLies have no place in the political arena and serve no purpose other than to undermine the integrity of the democratic process. The problem is that, at times, there is no clear way to determine whether a political statement is a lie or the truth. What is certain, however, is that we do not want the Government (i.e. the Ohio Elections Commission) deciding what is political truth \u2013 for fear that the government might persecute those who criticize it. Instead, in a democracy, the voters should decide.\u201d\n\nBlack found several other problems with the law, saying it was \u201centirely possible\u201d a true statement could be determined false and there was no guarantee the hearing process for complaints under the law would be concluded \u201cin time to preserve the integrity of the election.\u201d\n\nHe wrote that Ohio\u2019s law was more burdensome than necessary to accomplish its alleged objectives and that it was often used by candidates to silence opponents by \u201cstrategically deploying OEC complaints to burden and distract their electoral rivals.\u201d\n\nCiting the Supreme Court in 2012, Black wrote, \u201cThe remedy for speech that is false is speech that is true.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short,\u201d he said, quoting from the television show \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cthere is no better way to overpower a trickle of doubt than with a flood of naked truth.\u201d\n\nHe noted the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals declared unconstitutional a similar law in Minnesota.\n\nA key component in their arguments in favor of standing before the Supreme Court was that both groups where \u201cchilled\u201d from publishing similar advertisements in the 2012 and 2014 elections. The ruling means they are now free to do so without fear of prosecution.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision allows us to freely communicate the truth with voters \u2014 that elected representatives who voted for the Affordable Care Act voted for taxpayer-funded abortion,\u201d Dannenfelser said in her statement. \u201cThis reality will continue to be a key part of our message to voters in the 2014 midterm elections and beyond.\u201d\n\nSBA List already launched a similar billboard campaign against U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., for her vote, and it plans to do the same against U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio.\n\nSteve Fought, a spokesman for Kaptur, told the Cleveland Plain Dealer the right-to-life group was \u201cmore interested in the right to lie than the right to life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Susan B. Anthony List has no respect for the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cEven their name is a lie. Susan B. Anthony was a progressive, and there\u2019s nothing even remotely progressive about them. They should come clean and rename themselves the Sarah L. Palin List or the Ann H. Coulter List.\u201d\n\nDannenfelser took exception to that.\n\n\u201cSusan B. Anthony challenged government control of women\u2019s participation in the political process and that is exactly what Susan B. Anthony List did in Ohio,\u201d she wrote in an emailed response. \u201cWe have fought for and vindicated our right to disagree with Marcy Kaptur and the other Democrats who claimed to be pro-life but then voted to compel taxpayers to fund abortion through the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nBut Dannenfelser agreed their namesake was indeed progressive.\n\n\u201cShe was progressive on abortion in that she opposed it from the depth of her being,\u201d Dannenfelser said. \u201cShe believed women should have a future of equality and bring their children along with them into that future.\u201d\n\nThe Attorney General\u2019s office, which defended the case on behalf of the Elections Commission, said it would consult with the commission to decide whether the state would appeal the ruling.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A false statment law which put government bureaucrats in charge of determining the truth during a political campaign was declared unconstitutional.", "title": "Ohio false statement law declared unconstitutional - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/SBAL-billboard.jpg", "url": "http://watchdog.org/170273/false-statement-law-unconstitutional/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "2014 elections,Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur,Driehaus,Ministry of Truth,Ohio,Sen.
