Ketterer, Ph.D.\n\n\u201cWasted resources have become a central concern in American health care, including readmission soon after a patient has been released from hospital care,\u201d Ketterer said.\n\n\u201cBecause heart failure has one of the highest readmission rates of all conditions that have been studied in Medicare and Medicaid populations, we decided to focus on it and try to identify predictors for early readmission.\u201d\n\nAs discussed online in the journal Psychosomatics, researchers discovered a psychiatric history of depression, anxiety and other mood disorders, and other impairments in a patient\u2019s ability to think, remember and reason can be predictors of readmission.\n\n\u201cGiven both the exorbitant fiscal costs and known health risks of hospitalization, including exposure to drug-resistant infections and medical errors, it could be well worth further study to test our findings.\u201d he said.\n\nLast month, Medicare said it will assess $227 million in fines against hospitals in 49 states as part of an initiative to reduce the number of patients readmitted within a month.\n\nMedicare said that 2,225 hospitals will see payments reduced for a year. Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit is one of those that will see a reduction in payments starting Oct. 1.\n\nIn the study, the researchers chose 84 patients who were admitted to Henry Ford Hospital for treatment of acute congestive heart failure. Each was interviewed for basic clinical and demographic information and asked to complete several questionnaires measuring depression, anxiety and spirituality.\n\nTheir medical risk factors \u2014 including other illnesses and their severity \u2014 and behavioral risk factors \u2014 including depression and such cognitive impairments as loss of reasoning, planning, forgetfulness and other reduced mental functions \u2014 as well as admissions during the past year and re-admissions during the previous 30 days were recorded.\n\nThe patient group was 62 percent male with an average age of 66.\n\nCentral nervous system disorders \u2014 including Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia, closed-head injury and others \u2014 were present in 21 percent.\n\nNearly 70 percent lived with a family member, 24 percent acknowledged a psychiatric history, 36 percent used or had used antidepressants, 40 percent had coronary artery disease, 43 percent had diabetes, 86 percent had hypertension, 20 percent had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 48 percent had chronic kidney disease and 24 percent were alcohol or drug abusers.\n\nThe researchers found that depression, a history of substance abuse, and a history of coronary artery disease were related to hospital admissions during the previous year.\n\nFactors in 30-day readmission rates included immediate memory problems and a history of psychiatric treatment and/or the use of an antidepressant. The severity of congestive heart failure, however, was not a factor in either admission or readmission rates.\n\n\u201cOur results agree with several recent studies in finding an adverse impact of depression on admission and readmission rates,\u201d Ketterer said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, substance abuse and chronic kidney disease may also adversely impact these rates in congestive heart failure patients.\n\n\u201cEven severe heart disease, except in the extreme, appears to be manageable after release from the hospital unless it\u2019s complicated by one or more of the behavioral factors.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps most important in these findings is the relationship between emotional stress and/or cognitive impairment and early readmission to the hospital.\n\n\u201cBoth suggest a possible way to predict readmission and avoid it,\u201d Ketterer said.\n\nEducating patients about their mental illness, as well as involving live-in family members in helping with the patient\u2019s medications, and keeping medical appointments may also help reduce hospital readmissions, the study concluded.\n\nSource: Henry Ford Health System\n\nPatient in the hospital photo by shutterstock.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Historically,\u00a025 percent of individuals discharged from a hospital after treatment for heart failure will be readmitted to the hospital within a month of", "og": {"site_name": "Psych Central News", "description": "Historically,\u00a025 percent of individuals discharged from a hospital after treatment for heart failure will be readmitted to the hospital within a month of discharge.
