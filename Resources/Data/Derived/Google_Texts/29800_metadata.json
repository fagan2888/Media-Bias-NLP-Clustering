It wasn\u2019t practical.\n\nOur very real president kept the section in.\n\n\u201cLast year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moon shot, America can cure cancer,\u201d Obama said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cTonight, I\u2019m announcing a new national effort to get it done. \u2026 For the loved ones we\u2019ve all lost, for the family we can still save, let\u2019s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.\u201d\n\nALLIES FROM ACROSS THE AISLE \u2014 Fellow Democrats hailed Obama\u2019s aspiration as inspirational \u2014 and it even won allies from across the aisle.\n\n\u201c[W]e have an incredible opportunity before us in 2016 to make a positive and lasting difference in paving the way for more life-saving cures and treatments,\u201d House Energy and Commerce Chair Fred Upton said in a statement, touting his 21st Century Cures legislation. \u201cThe talk of a \u2018moon shot\u2019 is the exact mindset we need \u2014 America can and should lead the way.\u201d\n\nPROMISE OR PATIENCE? But where politicos saw promise, scientists were more cautious. For one, Obama\u2019s \u201cmoonshot\u201d will be more like \u201cmany shots,\u201d empowering numerous organizations and researchers. And the White House isn't guaranteeing a swift cure \u2014 just a swifter pace of research and innovation.\n\nAnd other presidents have begun similar battles, with mixed results. Richard Nixon may have gotten the United States out of Vietnam, but he declared a \u201cWar on Cancer\u201d in his own 1971 State of the Union address \u2014 a war that we\u2019re still fighting.\n\nVincent DeVita\u2019s recent book, \u201cThe Death of Cancer,\u201d explains some of the institutional problems behind America\u2019s stalled war, including inflexible regulators and siloed institutions. (DeVita would know: He ran the National Cancer Institute for most of the 1980s.)\n\nAs my POLITICO Pro colleagues report, Obama\u2019s moonshot could catalyze cancer research by cutting through red tape, pouring in new funds and encouraging public-private partnerships. The administration will make a big push for data-sharing and collaboration \u2014 as well as an effort to ensure more patients get access to costly tumor-sequencing and the chance to take part in clinical trials. Our story.\n\nIt's heady stuff. Of course, health care's always full of big, exciting pronouncements. Time will tell if this one leads to real changes \u2014 or another stalled war.\n\nMEANWHILE, BACK ON EARTH \u2014 By shooting for the stars, Obama skipped over some pressing issues down here on Earth.\n\nHe didn\u2019t call on nearly 20 holdout governors to expand Medicaid. He didn\u2019t talk about prescription-drug costs. And for all the recent attention and even tears, the president didn\u2019t discuss gun violence as a public health issue.\n\nCould the president have dwelled on those health care topics? Consider that his relatively brief speech left time on the table, and most of his previous State of the Union addresses went far deeper into his domestic health policy initiatives. In 2010, Obama spent nearly three times as long talking about health care as he did on Tuesday night, as he tried to jump-start the legislation that became the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPerhaps Obama\u2019s said all that he needs to say about the ACA. But in his final State of the Union address, it was notable that the president stayed away from trying to ground his signature health initiative \u2014 and instead tried to launch a new one.\n\nGood Wednesday morning \u2014 And welcome to Pulse 2.0, as we start moving to a slightly different beat.\n\nI\u2019m your new author, formerly the editor of the Advisory Board Daily Briefing and a writer for Forbes and Vox. And I\u2019m thrilled to join POLITICO\u2019s incredible health care team, including my amazing Pulse predecessors Brianna Ehley and Erin Mershon.

Morgan Healthcare Conference: Aetna expects to sustain \u201cmid-single digit\u201d losses on its Obamacare exchange business for 2015. But Pro's Paul Demko tells us that the insurer is taking a very different tack from UnitedHealth Group, which has threatened to bolt the exchanges because it\u2019s losing too much money. \u201cIt is too early to give up on this process,\u201d Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini told investors on Tuesday, pointing out that the exchange business accounts for just 5 percent of the company\u2019s members and 6 percent of revenues. \u201cFrom a tactical standpoint this is not breaking the bank one way or the other.\u201d\n\nGRASSLEY ADDS HEALTH DIRECTOR \u2014 Karen Summar will join the office of Sen. Chuck Grassley on Jan. 19, after serving since 2011 as a health policy adviser in the House of Representatives for Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Marsha Blackburn.\n\n** A message from PhRMA: Coverage does not necessarily mean access to care.

But pushing oncologists to focus on pathways may be taking away from their focus on patients, an American Society of Clinical Oncology task force warned, adding that \u201cthere is a growing sentiment in the oncology community that this trend is eroding both the doctor-patient relationship and the overall quality of cancer care.\u201d ASCO rolled out nine suggestions to improve the pathway process. Pros can read Sarah\u2019s story here.\n\nDOCTORS SAY THEY\u2019RE GETTING CRUSHED \u2014 Clinical pathways are just one reason why doctors are raising red flags: The new Medscape Lifestyle Report warns that \"burnout among US physicians has reached a critical level.\u201d More than half of physicians in at least nine specialties say they\u2019re burned out, topped by doctors who practice in critical care, urology, emergency medicine, and family medicine. The number one cause of burnout, according to the survey? Too much bureaucracy. Read the survey here.\n\nPOLL: DOCS WANT CDC\u2019S OPIOID GUIDELINES \u2014 A new survey by SERMO finds that 87 percent of its social network of doctors welcome CDC\u2019s forthcoming opioid prescribing guidelines. The public comment period on the agency\u2019s draft guideline ends today. More than eight in 10 of the 1,600-plus physicians surveyed supported mandatory registration and use of state prescription drug monitoring programs, while 63 percent reported being registered with their PDMPs.

John Bel Edwards wants to have the expansion in place by July 1, but it's not a done deal, Pro\u2019s Rachana Pradhan writes. The Republican-led legislature has control over certain funding decisions, including the appropriation of federal funds into the state budget. Sources tell Rachana that they don\u2019t think expansion is likely to be thwarted, but it\u2019s unclear if GOP lawmakers will cooperate with Edwards. The Pro story.\n\nTHE STATE OF THE STATES ON MEDICAID \u2014 Louisiana would be the 31st state to opt into the expansion. Who's next? I asked Rachana and she rattled off three state debates she's watching this year: South Dakota, Wyoming, and Alabama.\n\nHOUSE COMMITTEE GREENLIGHTS MENTAL HEALTH MEASURE \u2014 The House Judiciary Committee Tuesday approved a bipartisan Senate-passed mental health and criminal justice reform measure sponsored by Sens. Al Franken and John Cornyn that will now awaits consideration by the full House. The bill provides crisis intervention training, funding for mental health courts, veterans treatment courts and training for state and federal law enforcement officers. It focuses primarily on law enforcement and criminal justice reform unlike more comprehensive mental health legislation sitting in the Senate HELP Committee and the House Energy and Commerce full committee.\n\nA SOLUTION TO SOCIOECONOMIC RISK ADJUSTMENT? NOT YET \u2014 The Institute of Medicine is out with the first in a series of five reports on how socioeconomic risk factors like race, gender and financial resources affect value-based payment in Medicare. But anyone hoping they'd wrap up the debate on the controversial issue quickly is out of luck. This first report \u2014 which, like the rest, was requested by HHS as it prepares its own mandated reports on the topic \u2014 simply sums up existing research and outlines a framework for addressing it. Future reports, the IOM committee promises, will tackle how to measure risk factors and adjust or account for them.

While the Florida-based dental benefits company won't get to see Perry in the White House, they have secured a consolation prize: Perry is now serving as MCNA's \u201cchief strategist,\" a spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING, by Rachana Pradhan\n\nMore hospitals are trying to purchase meat raised without antibiotics, NPR reports. http://n.pr/1P8am74\n\nState measures to cut drug prices are facing big obstacles, STAT writes. http://bit.ly/1l3bnFN\n\nIn a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Thomas Stratmann and Matthew Baker criticize state certificate-of-need programs as stifling health care competition. http://on.wsj.com/1W2YVmI\n\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel will propose raising the minimum age for buying tobacco products to 21 from 18 years old, the Chicago Tribune reports. http://trib.in/1Q42kRT\n\nThe Atlantic examines past usage of LSD in treating mental health issues, and therapists who are advocating for such an approach. http://theatln.tc/1Zs81Pi\n\n** A message from PhRMA: Everyone has a story.

The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
