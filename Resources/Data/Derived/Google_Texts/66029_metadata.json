He attributes the prosperity to the 2.5 million net new jobs created in 2013, the 3 million in 2014, and the cash subsidies Obamacare offered to low-income households.\n\nOne of the more surprising findings was that 2013 and 2014 were good years for people without a high-school diploma. Gen Xers and Baby Boomers without a diploma made more progress raising their incomes than people who'd gotten a diploma. Millennials were the only group that didn't see the trend, Shapiro notes.\n\nAfter several years of decline, the incomes of those without high-school diplomas began to rise 3.1% in 2013 and 2014. Those with a high-school diploma, however, saw 5% gains over the same period.\n\nThe data doesn't offer any insights about income inequality, however \u2014 only the average rise and fall of the entire group.\n\nOnce the Census data for 2015 comes out in a few months, Shapiro expects to see even more hopeful data.\n\n\"We already know that the economy created another 2.65 million new jobs in 2015,\" he explains. \"If, as expected, the broad income progress seen in 2013 and 2014 persists in 2015, it will rebut much of the economic message touted by Trump and badly weaken Sanders's critique of Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nEven after November's election, the progress will be felt in millions of households across America.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#1e2021", "sailthru.author": "Chris Weller", "application-name": "Tech Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Don't let punditry fool you.", "title": "American incomes are actually getting better and better", "url": "http://www.techinsider.io/american-incomes-are-actually-rising-2016-4", "image": "http://static2.techinsider.io/image/55e481c39dd7cc19008b7088-506-253/american-incomes-are-actually-getting-better-and-better.jpg", "site": "techinsider", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "innovation", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Income, Income Inequality, Obamacare, Brookings, TI Graphics, Chris Weller", "description": "Don't let punditry fool you.", "author": "Chris Weller", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-28", "sailthru.title": "American incomes are actually getting better and better", "theme-color": "#1e2021", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static5.techinsider.io/image/55e481b69dd7cc11008b7107-50-50/american-incomes-are-actually-getting-better-and-better.jpg", "news_keywords": "Income, Income Inequality, Obamacare, Brookings, TI Graphics, Chris Weller", "tbi-image": "http://static2.techinsider.io/image/55e481b69dd7cc11008b7107/american-incomes-are-actually-getting-better-and-better.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 1111678992180150}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.techinsider.io/assets/images/ti/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=TI-2016-03-31", "date": "2016-04-28", "article": {"publisher": "techinsider", "author": "http://www.techinsider.io/author/chris-weller"}, "sailthru.description": "Don't let punditry fool you.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Tech Insider", "description": "Don't let punditry fool you.", "title": "American incomes are actually getting better and better", "url": "http://www.techinsider.io/american-incomes-are-actually-rising-2016-4", "image": "http://static4.techinsider.io/image/55e481c39dd7cc19008b7088-1190-625/american-incomes-are-actually-getting-better-and-better.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Tech Insider", "p": {"domain_verify": "d6302fabb0c3cb7485489a9c237bf78f"}, "title": "American incomes are actually getting better and better", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static2.techinsider.io/image/55e481b69dd7cc11008b7107/american-incomes-are-actually-getting-better-and-better.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "innovation"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec45\"", "article_summary": "White millennials saw 2.9% growth, African Americans saw 3.0% growth, and Hispanics saw 3.2% growth.\nIn comparing income increases across three generations among whites, African Americans, and Hispanics, a new Brookings report suggests American incomes actually rose in 2013 and 2014.\nOne of the more surprising findings was that 2013 and 2014 were good years for people without a high-school diploma.\nGen Xers and Baby Boomers without a diploma made more progress raising their incomes than people who'd gotten a diploma.\nIn fact, at every age cohort, Shapiro notes, Hispanics had the fastest-growing incomes of the three ethnicities."}
