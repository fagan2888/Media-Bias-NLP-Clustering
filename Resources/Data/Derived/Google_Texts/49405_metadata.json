You need to give people something to lose or some relationship to damage in order for them to care about what you want or what you can achieve.\u201d\n\nQuintana sees things differently.\n\nIn setting up an embassy and encouraging Americans to travel to Cuba, the Obama administration is recognizing Cuba as a legitimate state and is helping to fund its hostility against the U.S. and abuse of its people, Quintana says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re throwing a lifeline to the Castro regime,\u201d Quintana said.\n\nOne thing that Obama cannot change, though, is the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba that has been in place for 53 years.\n\nOnly Congress has the power to lift those economic sanctions.\n\nQuintana believes that this is not likely to happen.\n\n\u201cCongress is overwhelmingly showing that it does not support the Cuba policy,\u201d Quintana said.\n\nIn order to open an embassy, Congress must appropriate funds to do so.\n\nFurthermore, any appointment of a Cuban ambassador will have to be approved by the Senate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama announced that Cuba and the U.S. will be reopening embassies in each other\u2019s capitals after over a half century of severed diplomatic ties.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Obama announced that Cuba and the U.S. will be reopening embassies in each other\u2019s capitals after over a half century of severed diplomatic ties.", "title": "US to Open Embassy in Cuba.
