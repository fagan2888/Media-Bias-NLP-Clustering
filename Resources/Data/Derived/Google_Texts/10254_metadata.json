Well, that, or a truck accident that spilled cranberries across a bridge there early this morning was an unfortunate accident where no people were killed but one was seriously injured, and many berries were sacrificed.\n\nAround 6:30 this morning, there was a head-on collision between a truck full of cranberries and another vehicle on the Sagamore Bridge on Cape Cod. Two people were injured, presumably the drivers of both vehicles: one sustained serious injuries and was transported to a hospital in Rhode Island. The other had minor injuries and declined going to a hospital.\n\nCranberries are everywhere after the truck carry them was in a crash on Sagamore Bridge. https://t.co/uWS8vwyJUT pic.twitter.com/H94oBdDaP6 \u2014 MassLive Food (@masslivefood) November 6, 2015\n\nThe state police announced two hours later that the fruit had been cleared and the bridge re-opened. From 6:30 to 8:30, the spill came just in time to disrupt rush hour, yet was too early for Thanksgiving.\n\nAll lanes now open on Sagamore Bridge. We thank motorists for their patience. \u2014 Mass State Police (@MassStatePolice) November 6, 2015\n\nFood jokes aside, we hope that both injured people make a swift recovery, and that they aren\u2019t tired of terrible cranberry jokes and puns yet. Or ever.\n\nPhotos: Truck carrying cranberries involved in crash on Cape Cod\u2019s Sagamore Bridge [MassLive]\n\nCranberry spill snarls traffic on Cape Cod bridge [Associated Press]", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "application-name": "Consumerist", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Consumerist", "description": "I really enjoy cranberry sauce, but I have some serious doubts about how they go about making the stuff on Cape Cod.
