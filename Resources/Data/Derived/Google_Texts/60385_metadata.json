For them, shutting down the government is an option. Boehner felt it would be a disaster.\n\n\u201cI hope all Republicans \u2014 including those in the Senate \u2014 are listening to what grassroots conservatives are saying: It is time for conservative leadership and conservative principles,\u201d Rep. Roger Williams, R-Weatherford, said last week. Williams has some support from tea party voters.\n\nIn the coming months, the new House leadership will have to navigate stormy issues, including whether to raise the debt ceiling.\n\nTea party members don\u2019t want the debt ceiling raised or budget caps busted, and they\u2019re willing to do what it takes to prevent it.\n\nBut now House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California appears poised to pick up Boehner\u2019s fallen standard. His selection would mean tea party conservatives won\u2019t be getting one of their own, just the next leader up.\n\nOne aide to a prominent Texas Republican told me that McCarthy is Boehner with a different name.\n\nIndeed, the hard-right revolution is far from complete.\n\nSo as the tea party prepares for another round of fights with the GOP leadership, activists are also looking for reinforcements.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that it has to happen this way,\u201d said Dallas tea party leader Ken Emanuelson. \u201cMany of our representatives in Congress just go along to get along.\u201d\n\nTexas\u2019 March 1 primary gives them a chance to knock off Republican incumbents and replace them with tea party loyalists and libertarians.\n\nIn 2014 they helped defeat former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, in a political shot heard around the country.\n\nThe upheaval was felt in North Texas, where former U.S. Attorney John Ratliffe, on the strength of tea party support, beat longtime incumbent Ralph Hall, R-Rockwall. State government saw even more carnage, with state Sens. John Carona and Bob Deuell losing to Don Huffines and Bob Hall, respectively, both backed by the tea party and libertarians.\n\nNow hard-right conservatives have the taste of blood. And they promise to be more organized and better funded than the last election cycle.\n\nTopping their hit list this time around is Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Dallas. Sessions chairs the House Rules Committee and is likely a candidate for majority whip.\n\nIn 2014, Sessions easily beat tea party leader Katrina Pierson for re-election, and he\u2019s mobilizing for another tussle. Two weeks ago Huffines, the state senator, said he was not planning to run against Sessions, but his twin brother, businessman Phillip Huffines, is considering a challenge. Iraq war veteran Paul Brown has already announced his candidacy, and businessman Russell Ramsland has formed an exploratory committee. Both are tea party favorites.\n\nOthers in the Republican congressional delegation from North Texas could also get primary opponents.\n\nAs the last election cycle proved, grassroots activists are serious about reshaping government.\n\nBoehner\u2019s departure is another warning shot.\n\nFollow Gromer Jeffers Jr. on Twitter at @gromerjeffers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reverberations could be felt around the country, including in Texas.", "og": {"description": "Reverberations could be felt around the country, including in Texas.", "title": "Tea party celebrates House speaker\u2019s departure", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/gromer-jeffers-jr/20150928-tea-party-celebrates-house-speakers-departure.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-09-29T03:55:05Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-09-29T03:55:05Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Tea party celebrates House speaker\\u2019s departure\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/gromer-jeffers-jr/20150928-tea-party-celebrates-house-speakers-departure.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2455647\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-09-29T03:55:05Z\", \"section\": \"Gromer Jeffers Jr.\", \"author\": \"Gromer Jeffers Jr.\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-09-29T03:55:05Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce4a3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that it has to happen this way,\u201d said Dallas tea party leader Ken Emanuelson.\nJohn Carona and Bob Deuell losing to Don Huffines and Bob Hall, respectively, both backed by the tea party and libertarians.\nSo as the tea party prepares for another round of fights with the GOP leadership, activists are also looking for reinforcements.\nHis selection would mean tea party conservatives won\u2019t be getting one of their own, just the next leader up.\nTea party members don\u2019t want the debt ceiling raised or budget caps busted, and they\u2019re willing to do what it takes to prevent it."}
