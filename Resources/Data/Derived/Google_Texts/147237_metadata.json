Elsewhere, in another ER\u2019s electronic health record, a patient\u2019s name isn\u2019t clearly displayed, so the nurse misses it and enters symptoms in the wrong person\u2019s file.\n\nThese are easy mistakes to make. As ER doctors and nurses grapple with the transition to digitalized record systems, they seem to happen more frequently.\n\n\u201cThere are new categories of patient safety errors\u201d in emergency rooms that didn\u2019t exist before the push to use electronic record systems, said Raj Ratwani, who researches health care safety and is the scientific director for MedStar Health\u2019s National Center for Human Factors in Healthcare in Washington, D.C.\n\nSpurred by the 2009 stimulus package and the 2010 health reform law, the federal government has offered hospitals financial incentives to adopt electronic health records that, among other things, will add efficiency and reduce errors by linking physicians\u2019 patient records, and coordinating and tracking how care is delivered across the health system. Hospitals that don\u2019t meet those standards are hit with penalties.\n\nBut in ERs, where things often happen fast, this push is sometimes setting up a technology mismatch that creates challenges that aren\u2019t necessarily as evident in other parts of the hospital.\n\nSneaker-clad doctors and nurses rush between patients, often juggling multiple cases. Verbal communication is key. Patients, even after being wheeled in by paramedics, can wait in a triage room for extended periods until a free nurse or physician comes to find out what\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s a different style of medicine, and one that\u2019s often resulted in a distinct workflow.\n\nAs a result, the electronic record programs in many ERs evolved independently of hospital-wide systems. Since those homegrown, emergency department record systems often aren\u2019t compatible with the newer, comprehensive ones hospitals are buying, they\u2019re being phased out. The new EHR models are in many ways more efficient, but they may require adjustments.\n\n\u201cThe way the systems are set up, it can actually predispose to higher error rates,\u201d said Jesse Pines, who directs the Office for Clinical Practice Innovation at the George Washington University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 2013, Pines, with other members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, wrote a report finding mistakes in the ER \u2014 like ordering the wrong medications or, because of confusing computer displays, more easily missing key patient information \u2014 were common after the switch to these digital systems.\n\n\u201cA growing body of evidence suggests that many errors may be the result of poor design rather than user errors,\u201d the report states. That \u201ccan have a profound influence\u201d on patients.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a patient safety concern,\u201d said Jason Shapiro, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Mount Sinai, who chairs ACEP\u2019s informatics committee and co-authored the report.\n\nThere\u2019s no research measuring how often these errors \u2014 like entering care instructions in the wrong patient file or missing instructions altogether \u2014 cause actual harm.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out how we\u2019re working with our electronic records, to make it part of the workflow,\u201d said Nathan Spell, chief quality officer at Emory Hospital in Atlanta. Even when doctors have learned to use the record systems, missteps still occur.\n\nThe ER\u2019s culture and pace, for instance, can amplify the risks of human error that stem from an already less user-friendly system. Think of the emergency physician who, reaching the end of a hectic 12-hour shift, looks for the record of a patient he just examined. He types in the man\u2019s last name, clicks and writes medical instructions \u2014 not realizing that he\u2019d accidentally pulled up the file of another patient with the same last name and similar age, who was admitted five minutes before.\n\nWhile misidentifying patients in this way was hardly an issue before EHRs, it\u2019s \u201cbecoming quite prevalent,\u201d in this more digital era, Ratwani said.\n\nMany systems, meanwhile, allow doctors to edit the record for only one patient at a time, said Zach Hettinger, who practices emergency medicine at MedStar Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore. That makes it harder to keep track of things, he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re stuck with, \u2018Do I cancel what I\u2019m in the middle of and not complete that task? Or do I deal with the new task? Do I make a note somewhere \u2014 take scrap paper \u2014 or just remember it?\u2019\u201d said Hettinger, who\u2019s also the medical director for the National Center for Human Factors in Healthcare and has researched how electronic records work in the ER.\n\nHow does that scenario play out? A triage nurse who is attending to multiple patients at once might scribble each individual\u2019s details on the back of a piece of paper \u2014 ducking away later to enter the information into the computer system. That can make it easier to confuse things, and leave the emergency room short a nurse.\n\nComputer systems need to better account for that potential human error, said Shawna Perry, an associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of Florida College of Medicine-Jacksonville, who has worked in multiple hospitals.\n\nStories of such near misses in the ER are now common lore, she added. In one episode, an electronic record system\u2019s poor design, which made the appropriate medication dosage difficult to read, led to an instruction for a nurse to give a child a sedative 10 times the correct amount. The patient was fine, Perry said, but the incident demonstrates how a clunky or counterintuitive record can be dangerous.\n\n\u201cIt was a simple slip of a cursor,\u201d she said, questioning why the system even allowed the drug to be available in that strength for a 44-pound child. \u201cHow did this software fail its users?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not an unusual event,\u201d Perry added. \u201cI know of many other situations. All of us do, by word of mouth.\u201d\n\nIn fairness, electronic records have resolved many safety concerns, Pines said. They\u2019ve rendered obsolete issues like misreading doctors\u2019 handwriting. Accessing records is easier and faster, noted Dan Hampton, an emergency physician who works at Epic Systems, a major electronic health record vendor.\n\nBut because doctors don\u2019t decide what a hospital buys, designs often emphasize what administrators or technology officials want, Pines said. To understand ERs, designers must spend time in them, Perry said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have a computer, and informaticists on your staff, or have a doctor come in and look at this [particular design feature],\u201d said Robert Wachter, a patient safety expert and interim chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get into this issue of what does it look like to be using this system at 4 in the morning, when you have nine other patients and a trauma patient running into the ER, and your beeper\u2019s going.\u201d\n\nManufacturers said doctor feedback is important and something they prioritize in their designs.\n\nFor instance, Epic, based outside of Madison, Wisconsin, sends developers to hospitals to study their needs, Hampton said. \u201cMaking our software easy to use is one of our top priorities, along with quality of care and patient safety.\u201d\n\nAt Cerner, another vendor from Kansas City, Misouri, doctors on advisory councils give feedback on the ER-specific system. Representatives visit emergency rooms to hear from physicians, said Leslie Lindsey, Cerner\u2019s senior manager of emergency medicine.\n\nBut there\u2019s room to improve, Lindsey added. To address oral communication, Cerner sells supplements, like a phone-like device meant to fix communication gaps with emergency medicine. But hospitals may not want to buy add-ons when they\u2019ve already paid tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars for a record system.\n\nDespite these concerns, Pines said, it\u2019s early. With time, companies will address kinks, so that patient safety issues diminish.\n\n\u201cThink about where we were even 30 years ago with cars. Cars are rapidly innovating to become safer and more efficient \u2014 and I think we can expect to see the same transformation in the electronic health record space,\u201d Pines said. \u201cThings are improving. And things will continue to improve.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The mouse slips, and the emergency room doctor clicks on the wrong number, ordering a medication dosage that\u2019s far too large.
