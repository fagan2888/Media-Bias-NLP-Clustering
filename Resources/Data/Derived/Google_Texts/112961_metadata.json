At 22, I have experimented with three different types of hormonal birth control over the course of eight years and have been to more clinic appointments than I can count. Let\u2019s just say that a dwindling pack of birth control pills has become the symbol of a bitter countdown to another hellish doctor\u2019s appointment that involves dreaded pelvic exams and hours spent in crowded clinic waiting rooms.\n\nThanks to a new California law that will make hormonal birth control available at pharmacies without a doctor\u2019s prescription, those time-consuming, uncomfortable clinic visits will be a thing of the past for women of all ages.\n\nIntroduced initially on February 2013 by Dr. Ed Hernandez, California state senator from District 22, Senate Bill 493 grants pharmacists the authority to act as health care providers. Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill into law on October 2013, but state regulations delayed implementation, according to the American Pharmacists Association.\n\nCalifornia is the second state after Oregon, implemented on Jan. 1, to allow birth control to be obtained without a doctor\u2019s prescription. Contraceptives are the only provision of the new law, but it has captured the most media attention and has received an outpour of support.\n\nHernandez explained to The American Pharmacists Association in March 2014, that the Affordable Care Act created a \u201chuge need\u201d for primary care providers. The \u201cseries of scope of practice bills,\u201d including SB 493, was created to address that need. Hernandez told The Press-Enterprise, that other states that had adopted similar laws had seen improved access to health care.\n\nThe law will allow pharmacists to prescribe self-administered birth control methods, such as pills, patches, vaginal rings and injections.\n\nA common misconception about the law is that the birth control will be offered \u201cover-the-counter.\u201d Contraceptives will still require a prescription from a pharmacist, so it isn\u2019t quite as simple as buying aspirin.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s progress. The fact that women now have a choice about where to get their birth control is something to be celebrated. I am personally looking forward to living in a world where hair spray, mascara and my latest refill can be purchased at the same counter, where birth control is no longer held hostage and instead is available on well-stocked pharmacy shelves. It\u2019s equality disguised as luxury, but nevertheless a step in the right direction.\n\nBirth control made more accessible sends a positive message that women\u2019s sexual health is a priority. But shouldn\u2019t it have always been that way? Many women have supported more accessible birth control for decades. Of 2,000 women asked about their thoughts on over-the-counter birth control by Ibis Reproductive Health in 2013, 31 percent were in favor, according to Reuters Health.\n\nThanks to the new law, women can obtain contraception almost as easily as they would receive a walk-in flu shot, and this convenience is something hundreds of women have looked forward to. To be able to reject a visit to the doctor is progress for those of us who simply don\u2019t have the time or access to a clinic on a monthly regular basis.\n\nUnlike Oregon\u2019s law, California law will not impose any age regulations, which is important, because studies show that preteens and young teenagers are sexually active. In California, there were 30,819 births to women under age 20 in 2013, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A study in the Journal of Public Health revealed that out of 6.6 million pregnancies that occurred in 2008, 51 percent were unintended.\n\nAs outlined by the Board of Pharmacy, with the new law, women will only have to complete a twenty-question health assessment, have their blood pressure taken and receive counseling and information about the contraceptive before they can walk out with a prescription.\n\nSome health care professionals argue that routine check-ups monitor contraceptive side effects and are proactive health measures that can detect cervical cancer and other health issues early-on.\n\n\u201cRoutine visits with a healthcare provider can help prevent illness and can find problems that need treatment,\u201d according to Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \u201cPelvic exams, pap tests and screenings for breast cancer are all vital health care needs for women.\u201d\n\nI agree that thorough examinations should not be forsaken in the name of convenience, however this should be the individual woman\u2019s initiative. We are capable enough of taking care of our own bodies. We don\u2019t need doctors to hold contraceptives over our heads in order to lure us to the exam room.\n\nFor years, male condoms have been handed out free by the dozens in every size, shape and variety, while women\u2019s contraceptives have been obscured behind conditions and regulations.\n\nAccording to Reuters Health, one third of 1,200 U.S. doctors surveyed required women to have a pelvic exam before writing them a prescription, even though research shows that they are unnecessary.\n\n\u201cThere is no established medical need for women to have the exam before receiving a prescription for birth control pills,\u201d Dr. George F. Sawaya, a researcher of the study told Reuters Health.\n\nConcerning? It should be.\n\nMother Jones reporter Stephanie Mencimer said, \u201cDoctors regularly hold women\u2019s birth control prescriptions hostage\u2026Forcing them to come in for exams that research is increasingly showing are too frequent and often unnecessary and ineffective.\u201d\n\nSome have argued that there is still work to be done in order to make birth control fully accessible. \u201cRequiring a pharmacist to prescribe and dispense oral contraceptives only replaces one barrier \u2014 a physician\u2019s prescription \u2014 with another,\u201d said Dr. Mark S. DeFrancesco, president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in a Jan. 4 statement.\n\nThis law is about more than just convenient birth control. By liberating contraceptives from the control of doctors and letting women take charge of their own health decisions, pharmacy birth control will set a new standard for healthcare equality in California.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "The Pioneer", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://thepioneeronline.com/29528/opinions/birth-control-a-hostage-to-be-freed/", "article_author_name": "Shannon Stroud", "image": "http://thepioneeronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-02-23-BirthControl-BrittanyEngland-WEB-900x768.png", "site_id": "0f5b11feecfe2c39a52b7b932229f229", "article_published_time": "2016-02-25T15:03:15+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T20:58:45+00:00", "keywords": "affordable care act, american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists, american pharmacists association, birth control, birth control pills, california law, governor jerry brown, senate bill 493, opinion, showcase", "wp_version": "7.8.0.1"}, "language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Pioneer", "description": "I received my first prescription of birth control pills when I was 14 years old.
