The Camera has been working with an advisory board for seven years. The all-volunteer board works to advise the Camera on topics that are important to our community. We've always strived to have people with diverse political views, as well as a range of interests and experience. All care very deeply about this region and its future. We've had scientists and bankers, business owners and activists.

In addition to advising our editorial board, they write opinion pieces which run on Saturdays.

Since diversity is important for the board's make up, it's critical to us to keep the group evolving. Members often recommend their own replacements. We've also had two community-wide searches. The most recent one just concluded.

Here are brief biographies of the board members, with the year they joined:

Mara Abbott (2014) was born and raised in Boulder, graduating from Whitman College in 2008 with a degree in economics. She is currently a professional bike racer who has won both two U.S. national championship titles and two Giro Rosa stage race general classifications. In her spare time she trail runs, adventures in the Colorado mountains, is a yoga instructor and is the current chair for the City of Boulder's Environmental Advisory Board.
