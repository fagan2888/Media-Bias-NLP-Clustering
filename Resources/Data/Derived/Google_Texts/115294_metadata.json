Not so for the sovereign Navajo Nation, whose borders spill over into the northeastern part of the state and where tribal law is clear: Such unions are banned.\n\nSome Navajo hope to change that, buoyed by the cultural climate shift underscored when the U.S. Supreme Court in June struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Gay marriage is permitted in the District of Columbia and 18 states, the most recent being Utah, although officials there are appealing a federal court decision that overturned the state\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nFor Navajo activists, it won\u2019t be easy.\n\nThe Dine Marriage Act, passed in 2005 by the Navajo Nation Council, defines marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman and declares polygamy, unions between family members and same-sex marriages \u201cvoid and prohibited.\u201d\n\nA grass-roots attempt to block it from becoming law failed when the legislature overrode a veto from the Navajo Nation\u2019s then-president, Joe Shirley Jr.\n\n\u201cThe Dine Marriage Act legislation is unnecessary and addresses issues already governed by existing law and by cultural values and our clan system,\u201d Shirley said in a statement posted on the Web site for the advocacy group Coalition for Navajo Equality, which seeks to repeal the law.\n\nRecently, Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly, who took office in 2011, also backed the effort to allow same-sex marriage. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some catching up here to do with our laws, our codes and what we operate our government under,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nShelly, who served as Shirley\u2019s vice president from 2007 to 2011, was among 14 council members in 2005 who voted against the override, short of what was needed. Sixty-two voted for the override and 12 delegates abstained.\n\nDespite the high-level support, \u201conly an action by the Navajo Nation Council to repeal the act would change the law,\u201d Jared Touchin, a council spokesman, said in an e-mail. \u201cThere is currently no such legislation that attempts to do so.\u201d\n\nThough the law states that \u201cthe purposes of marriage on the Navajo Nation are to promote strong families and to preserve and strengthen family values,\u201d some Navajo activists say it does the opposite.\n\n\u201cIt goes against our tribe\u2019s fundamental teaching of harmony in family,\u201d said Alray Nelson, 27, a gay member of the Navajo Nation and part of the Coalition for Navajo Equality. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand why we implemented something like this because it goes against everything we are founded upon.\u201d\n\nNelson nonetheless said he was undaunted by the failed effort in 2005 because persuading the council president to veto the measure is still seen as one of the coalition\u2019s biggest accomplishments.\n\n\u201cIt was not popular in 2005 to support same-sex marriage,\u201d he said, \u201cso the political climate was already set against the coalition efforts. The coalition basically took a long nap until this year, after the Supreme Court decisions.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court, in striking down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, declared that same-sex couples who were legally married had the same right to federal benefits as other married couples. The court also upheld a lower court\u2019s invalidation of California\u2019s Proposition 8, clearing the way for same-sex marriage to resume in the state.\n\nJustices did not, however, require states to legalize gay marriage. Even if they had, tribes would almost certainly be exempt because of their sovereignty.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, our first goal will be to repeal the act by going through the courts like they did in New Mexico,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cSecond, we will continue to have these conversations with family members and community leaders. We are not going directly to lawmakers. We are going to the people who put them into office.\u201d\n\nSome tribes permit same-sex marriage. In 2008, the Coquille Indian Tribe in Oregon became the first in the U.S. to approve a gay marriage law that states \u201cmarriage\u201d or \u201cdomestic partnership\u201d means a \u201cformal and express civil contract entered into between two persons, regardless of their sex.\u201d Seven others have followed suit, including the Santa Ysabel tribe in California\u2019s San Diego County.\n\nElizabeth A. Kronk Warner, director of the Tribal Law & Government Center at the University of Kansas School of Law, said her research showed that tribes historically accepted gay unions.\n\n\u201cIn many of our tribal cultures, we called gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender members as \u2018two spirits,\u2019 because there was a belief that they had two spirits captured within themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were treated specially and with a lot of respect.\u201d\n\nNow, there is a struggle between the two-spirit concept and the Christian influence, she said.\n\n\u201cI think the national trend is definitely in favor of recognizing same-sex marriage,\u201d said Kronk Warner, a member of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians. \u201cThere are already several tribes who recognize same-sex marriages despite state law. . . . It\u2019s as complicated an issue among tribes as it is in individual states.\u201d\n\nTouchin, the council spokesman, said there was room for debate on the Navajo law.\n\n\u201cThe increased attention placed on gay marriage over the last few years certainly has the potential to make people, including the Navajo Nation\u2019s lawmakers, rethink the issue,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, most would agree that the Navajo Nation has taken a conservative approach to gay marriage. . . . Therefore, until legislation is introduced to address the Dine Marriage Act, we cannot be certain.\u201d\n\nNelson, however, is confident that change is on the horizon.\n\n\u201cBy around this time next year, if the law is repealed . . . that\u2019s when we can be proud as a Navajo people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Navajo and gay marriage, Native Americans and Supreme Court", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Activists battle ban on same-sex unions, but fight to be difficult", "title": "Navajo fight set over same-sex unions", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/navajo-fight-is-set-over-same-sex-unions/2014/01/01/4514642c-7309-11e3-9389-09ef9944065e_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/navajo-fight-is-set-over-same-sex-unions/2014/01/01/4514642c-7309-11e3-9389-09ef9944065e_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Navajo and gay marriage, Native Americans and Supreme Court", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "4514642c-7309-11e3-9389-09ef9944065e", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Activists battle ban on same-sex unions, but fight to be difficult"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd317a\"", "article_summary": "Recently, Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly, who took office in 2011, also backed the effort to allow same-sex marriage.\n\u201cIt was not popular in 2005 to support same-sex marriage,\u201d he said, \u201cso the political climate was already set against the coalition efforts.\n\u201cI think the national trend is definitely in favor of recognizing same-sex marriage,\u201d said Kronk Warner, a member of the Sault Ste.\n\u201cHowever, most would agree that the Navajo Nation has taken a conservative approach to gay marriage.\nNot so for the sovereign Navajo Nation, whose borders spill over into the northeastern part of the state and where tribal law is clear: Such unions are banned."}
