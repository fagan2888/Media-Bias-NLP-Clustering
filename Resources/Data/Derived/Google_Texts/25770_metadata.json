That would require neutralizing Syria\u2019s formidable antiaircraft batteries, which the Pentagon, fearing U.S. casualties, has long resisted.\n\nMr. Gerson created an ominous scenario \u2014 that Iran will devote \u201ctens of billions\u201d of dollars to bolstering Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \u2014 and ignored diplomacy.\n\nAs Mr. Assad\u2019s fellow Alawites and Hezbollah militants reconsider allegiance to his faltering regime, renewed efforts to craft a diplomatic settlement have been reported. And Tehran is unlikely to bolster Mr. Assad with billions at the cost of ignoring Iranians\u2019 demands for better post-sanctions lives.\n\nRichard McKee, Arlington\n\n\u25cf\n\nI disagree with Colbert I. King\u2019s assertion of the accepted wisdom that Iran poses a threat to Israel [\u201cMending the D.C.-Jerusalem divide,\u201d op-ed, Sept. 5]. Unlike Iran, Israel is believed to possess up to 300 nuclear weapons, has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has never accepted inspection of its alleged nuclear sites. If anything, it is Israel that is a threat to Iran.\n\nAnother aspect of the general debate over the nuclear deal is that Iran has a small Jewish community that has existed there for thousands of years. As reported recently in the Atlantic , that community of 10,000 to 25,000 has religious freedom, with dozens of synagogues, kosher shops, etc. Judaism, like Christianity and Zoroastrianism, is an officially recognized religion in Iran. There is a national Jewish association and a Jewish member of parliament. Does that really sound like a country that is a threat to Israel?\n\nAnthony C. Newton, Arlington\n\n\u25cf\n\nAnother piece of legislation Republicans don\u2019t like, another tortured argument for legal action against it, this time by Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) and David B. Rivkin Jr. of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, [\u201cDon\u2019t vote on the Iran deal,\u201d op-ed, Sept. 7]. Last I checked, Republicans had the majority in both the House and the Senate. They actually get to write the laws that govern our country. Yet instead of taking that opportunity to craft a plan of action and gather votes for it, they waste time trying to stymie efforts to actually solve problems (e.g., the Affordable Care Act and the Iran nuclear deal). When that doesn\u2019t work, they try to figure out how the judicial branch can save them. With that kind of track record, is it any wonder that early polls show Donald Trump doing so well?\n\nChris Wilcox, Fulton, Md.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "richard mckee, syria, michael gerson, syria civil war, syria iran, iran nuclear agreement, anthony newton, israel, colbert king, chris wilcox, mike pompeo, david rivkin", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "In his Sept. 4 op-ed column, \u201cObama\u2019s biggest failure,\u201d devoted to assailing the president over the massive human tragedy that is Syria, Michael Gerson mentioned just one possible tactic: destroying...", "title": "The Iran nuclear deal", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-iran-nuclear-deal/2015/09/10/771128dc-5333-11e5-b225-90edbd49f362_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/09/10/Editorial-Opinion/Images/238980142.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-iran-nuclear-deal/2015/09/10/771128dc-5333-11e5-b225-90edbd49f362_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "richard mckee, syria, michael gerson, syria civil war, syria iran, iran nuclear agreement, anthony newton, israel, colbert king, chris wilcox, mike pompeo, david rivkin", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "771128dc-5333-11e5-b225-90edbd49f362", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "In his Sept. 4 op-ed column, \u201cObama\u2019s biggest failure,\u201d devoted to assailing the president over the massive human tragedy that is Syria, Michael Gerson mentioned just one possible tactic: destroying..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3d39\"", "article_summary": "Unlike Iran, Israel is believed to possess up to 300 nuclear weapons, has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has never accepted inspection of its alleged nuclear sites.\nAnother aspect of the general debate over the nuclear deal is that Iran has a small Jewish community that has existed there for thousands of years.\nYet instead of taking that opportunity to craft a plan of action and gather votes for it, they waste time trying to stymie efforts to actually solve problems (e.g., the Affordable Care Act and the Iran nuclear deal).\nRichard McKee, Arlington\u25cfI disagree with Colbert I.
