One Illinois man is dead and another in serious condition after an explosion outside of a Destin home Saturday night.

Officials with the Okaloosa County Sheriff's office say they received dozens of calls just after 7 Saturday Night evening after residents heard two loud explosions.

Sheriff Larry Ashley says the car's explosion appears to be a freak and tragic accident.

35-year-old Michael Brower of Illinois died due to the explosion outside a house on Harbor Lane.

58-year-old Dr. Luis Lopez also of Illinois was transported to Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola where he is in critical condition.

Residents nearby say they could not only hear the explosion but felt it throughout their homes.

Neighbor, Linda Phillips, said, "My two thoughts that I had were first Eglin and like a transformer, like a huge transformer explosion or something, if you've ever heard that go, but it was the shaking. I mean, the whole house just vibrated."

State Fire Marshal is heading up the investigation.

No foul play is suspected.

Okaloosa Officials say that investigators are focusing on Acetylene torches that were rented to do work on the house.
