Cantor said the House will take up legislation in March targeting the Affordable Care Act\u2019s definition of a full-time workload as 30 hours per week, arguing that it removes incentives to work. The bill would define full-time work as 40 hours per week.\n\nCantor also noted that the House could consider legislation targeting the law\u2019s mandate that individuals buy insurance or pay a fine and legislation dealing with the ACA\u2019s cuts to Medicare Advantage.\n\nSetting up a Judiciary Committee hearing this week on the president\u2019s \u201cConstitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws,\u201d Cantor said the House will take aim at Obama\u2019s State of the Union promise to use his executive authority rather than wait for Congress to act. He did not specify which bills will be taken up.\n\n\u201cThe House will consider a number of bills the week of March 10th designed to restore the balance of power created by our Founders and require that the President faithfully execute our nation's laws,\u201d he said.\n\nThis coming week, the House will vote on a slate of bills that Cantor said seek to halt government abuse. Among them are bills to force the IRS to continue using certain standards to determine which organizations can apply for tax-exempt status, rather than enforcing new standards that Republicans believe unfairly target conservative organizations. Other IRS-related bills would put a time limit on how long an individual can be targeted and would prevent the IRS from inquiring about individuals\u2019 religious, political or social beliefs.\n\nThe House will also take up a number of antiregulatory bills, including legislation dealing with propane delivery, construction projects and coal mining.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., reiterated on Friday that the House plans to bring up a bill to replace President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., reiterated on Friday that the House plans to bring up a bill to replace President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.", "title": "Cantor Says GOP Finishing Work on Obamacare Alternative, Details Agenda", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/cantor-says-gop-finishing-work-on-obamacare-alternative-details-agenda", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.videos.rollcall.com/blogs/sites/2/2013/12/cantor121013-445x295.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2014-02-21T21:58:18Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., reiterated on Friday that the House plans to bring up a bill to replace President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,author,category,category,CQToday Topic,eric-cantor,health-care,icnw", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2014-02-21T21:58:18Z", "modified_time": "2014-02-21T21:58:18Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., reiterated on Friday that the House plans to bring up a bill to replace President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.", "title": "Cantor Says GOP Finishing Work on Obamacare Alternative, Details Agenda", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/cantor-says-gop-finishing-work-on-obamacare-alternative-details-agenda", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.videos.rollcall.com/blogs/sites/2/2013/12/cantor121013-445x295.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c6e\"", "article_summary": "This coming week, the House will vote on a slate of bills that Cantor said seek to halt government abuse.\nThe memo highlights an onslaught against the administration\u2019s policymaking, including bills to target Obama\u2019s executive actions, the IRS and the health care law.\nThe House will also take up a number of antiregulatory bills, including legislation dealing with propane delivery, construction projects and coal mining.\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., reiterated on Friday that the House plans to bring up a bill to replace President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\u201cAs we continue to work to finalize our Obamacare replacement plan, we will also act to highlight and address the serious consequences of the law,\u201d he said."}
