CNN has announced the firing of news editor Marie-Louise Gumuchian from its London bureau after finding “multiple instances of plagiarism” in her work. Gumuchian wrote about international news, covering Africa, Europe and the Middle East.

In an editor’s note published Friday, the media organization reported that its investigation is ongoing, but has so far discovered and removed plagiarism from “about 50 published stories.”

From CNN:

An unpublished story flagged last week during our editing process led to an internal investigation that uncovered other examples in about 50 published stories, and our investigation is ongoing. We’ve terminated Gumuchian’s employment with CNN, and have removed the instances of plagiarism found in her pieces. In some cases, we’ve chosen to delete an entire article. Trust, integrity and simply giving credit where it’s due are among the tenets of journalism we hold dear, and we regret that we published material that did not reflect those essential standards. We also believe in letting audiences know when we’ve remedied situations that threaten to compromise that trust.
