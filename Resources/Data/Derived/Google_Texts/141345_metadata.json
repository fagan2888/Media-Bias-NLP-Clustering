That hurts consumers coming and going \u2014 less investment in new networks to give them faster service and no net neutrality protection at all.\n\nCongress must step in and pass real net neutrality rules to protect consumers without the destructive baggage of utility regulation.\n\nTo be sure, legislation in this area would have to be fully protective of the open Internet and ensure there is sufficient future investment and job creation, propel economic opportunity and permanently bridge the digital divide.\n\nThe common carrier utility approach fails on this score. When tried in Europe, it led to considerably less investment, less affordable Internet service and fewer technology options for customers.\n\nThe heavy hand of \u201ccommon carrier\u201d regulations \u2014 with all the extra regulatory baggage and price controls it would bring \u2014 seems to drive away needed future investments, slowing deployment and making it harder to close the digital divide.\n\nWhy should workers and consumers care about investments by network providers in new and upgraded networks?\n\nResearch by the NAACP and the Communications Workers of America shows that, of the $230 billion invested in the Internet ecosystem from 2010 to 2013, network providers were responsible for a full 84 percent of the capital expenditures ($193 billion).\n\nThat investment means jobs \u2014 the largest network providers employed 869,000 people in 2013, more than three times that of leading \u201cedge providers,\u201d the companies that produce apps, technology and content.\n\nNetwork providers employ people of color at high rates, comparable or exceeding their rates in the overall labor force (11 percent to 14 percent for network providers compared with just 1 percent to 4 percent for the Silicon Valley edge providers). And while network providers\u2019 jobs are almost all in the U.S., many edge companies have a significant portion of their employees located overseas.\n\nWhile high-speed networks in the U.S. are some of the best in the world, hundreds of billions of dollars of additional investment are needed to build the robust high-speed broadband capability needed for the applications of tomorrow and to meet the goals set forward in the FCC\u2019s National Broadband Plan of bringing the very fastest networks into 100 million new homes.\n\nWith enough capacity, people will not have to worry about \u201cfast vs. slow\u201d lanes and we will be able to make real progress closing the final segments of the digital divide.\n\nThe FCC seemed to succumb to pressure to use the utility approach because its attorneys said it was the safest strategy to prevail in the courts. Other experts say the FCC lawyers are hopelessly mistaken and that the overreach will leave the rules more vulnerable.\n\nBut whoever is right, no one disputes that Congress has the power to enact an Open Internet law without the harmful and anti-consumer utility approach. Leaders of both parties have already expressed openness to this possibility.\n\nClayola Brown is the president of the A.
