On a property outside of Lexington in Cleveland County, two companions were completely failed by their caretakers.

On a property outside of Lexington in Cleveland County, two companions were completely failed by their caretakers.

The bodies of two dogs are there, and it appeared they were imprisoned on the property, left to die without food or water in sight.

“Those animals suffered greatly. It wasn’t quick. It was over a long period of time that they just had to lay there and die. It’s tragic,” the property owner Allaura Henry said.

Henry said she leased the property to a woman who brought the dogs there.

Neighbors saw someone come by every so often to check on them, but then it just stopped.

“These dogs are chained up and caged in why would you not just let them off and out where they had a fighting chance of their own?” Henry asked.

Henry blamed the renter for this disturbing situation.

Despite her attempts to get in touch with her, she said the woman's relatives were the only ones to ever respond, saying another person was supposed to come pick them up long ago, and apparently didn't come through.

“It’s unreal that somebody would just do that. Just leave it there to die, not come check on it, make sure it went to whatever home it was supposed to go to, to whoever was supposed to pick it up,” she said.

While justice is in the works, Henry wants the dogs removed from the rain and laid to rest. She cannot go near them now because of the investigation.

“They’re owed that. They’re owed that respect being that they were disrespected in their time living,” she said.

The Oklahoma Animal Alliance also contacted News 9 about this, saying these dogs could have been theirs.

If so, they were being fostered by the same woman Henry reported as the renter.

Cleveland County sheriff’s deputies took the report of possible animal neglect Saturday evening. More details could be released by authorities about the case on Monday.
