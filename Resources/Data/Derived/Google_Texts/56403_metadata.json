That\u2019s what he\u2019s doing!\u201d Hannah Hart replied.\n\n\u201cHis moves are telling us something,\u201d Barnatt said as Simmons started shaking.\n\n\u201cThey are, and I think they\u2019re saying, \u2018Be flexible about your health insurance options,\u201d Hart replied.\n\nThe event goes on like that for quite some time.\n\nYou can see the dance-off weirdness at the 20 minute mark:\n\nThe entire point of the online event was to encourage younger consumers to enroll in Obamacare. But based on how the event turned out, you have to wonder what the people behind Covered California think of the state\u2019s young people.\n\n(H/T: Red Alert Politics)\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "A pro-Obamacare event hosted by Covered California, the state's heath insurance marketplace, descended into the bizarre Thursday as fitness enthusiast Richard Simmons led a series of dance-offs.
