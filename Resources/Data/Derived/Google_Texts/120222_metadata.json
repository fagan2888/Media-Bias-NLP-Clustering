SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER That number appears to be shrinking: Administration officials said last month that about 2.5 million new customers had bought insurance through HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange serving 38 states, since open enrollment began on Nov. 1. The number of new enrollees is 29 percent higher than last year at this time, suggesting that the threat of a larger penalty may be motivating more people to get covered. But plenty of healthy holdouts remain, and their resistance helps explain why insurers are worried about the financial viability of the exchanges over time. They say they sorely need more healthy customers to balance out the costs of covering the sicker, older people who have flocked to exchange plans.\n\nTranslation: people won\u2019t buy Obama\u2019s lousy insurance, not even when forced to buy it at gunpoint. Obvious left-wing solution: use bigger guns.\n\nThis is one of the biggest disasters in the history of American government, and that\u2019s saying something. It\u2019s also one of the biggest lies ever peddled to the American people. ObamaCare is fraud on an unprecedented scale. Remember, it was sold to the American public as a voluntary exercise \u2013 \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep your plan, period.\u201d Barack Obama smugly assured skeptics that his health care plan would be so awesome that millions of Americans would rush to drop their old plans and buy into ObamaCare, saving thousands of dollars in the process.\n\nInstead, premiums are up, and sky-high deductibles make the resulting health \u201ccoverage\u201d virtually useless. The only reason many people are buying into this scheme is that Obama is frog-marching them into it. The New York Times analysis frankly acknowledges that word-of-mouth isn\u2019t helping.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t embracing the Affordable Care Act. The only thing \u201cimproving\u201d its catastrophically low enrollment figures is the threat of higher penalties\u2026 which could not have been assessed in the first couple of years, because that would have triggered a full-blown revolt against Obama and his party.\n\nThe penalties already paid represent one of the biggest tax increases on the middle class in living memory, precisely as ObamaCare critics warned\u2026 and it\u2019s a tax people are paying for the \u201cprivilege\u201d of getting nothing. They\u2019d rather pay the IRS than give the money to Barack Obama\u2019s cronies in the insurance industry for a low-quality product.\n\nThat means it\u2019s time to roll out the scare tactics. \u201cWe understand some people may be thinking through their choice of coverage, but going without health insurance is a serious gamble that can be catastrophic if wrong,\u201d argued Health and Human Services spokesman Ben Wakana.\n\nAh, the fearsome battle cry of the Obama ineptocracy: You little people are stupid and don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you.\n\nOn the contrary, the people passing up on ObamaCare are making entirely rational decisions. They\u2019re voting with their wallets, and if they vote the same way with their ballots in 2016, we can finally end this nightmare.\n\nThe NYT article begins with the example of an engineer named Clint Murphy who concluded it\u2019s still better to pay the higher 2016 penalty than to purchase pricey health insurance \u2013 in fact, he describes the decision as a no-brainer.\n\nAnother subject of the article, 61-year-old Susan Reardon, said she figures it\u2019s better to pay the tax penalty and pay for her fibromyalgia medicine out-of-pocket than shell out over $12,000 in premiums and deductibles for useless ObamaCare coverage. She felt it\u2019s \u201cbetter just to die\u201d if something catastrophic happens to her, and challenged the IRS to \u201ccome and get me\u201d for the Obama tax.\n\nSome of the other unhappy campers interviewed by the Times described themselves as living in fear because ObamaCare has forced them to make do without health insurance. Some were willing to pay the inflated Obama premiums at first, but bailed out as soon as they actually tried to use their \u201cbenefits\u201d and were hit with jaw-dropping deductibles. What ringing endorsements of the President\u2019s scheme!\n\nIncidentally, even though Congress refused to give Obama\u2019s cronies a fat taxpayer bailout in the omnibus spending bill \u2013 one of the very few good things about it \u2013 the Administration is still looking for ways to go around the Constitution and loot the Treasury to cover what it calls an \u201cobligation of the U.S. government for which full payment is required.\u201d\n\nIf we don\u2019t kill ObamaCare soon, we will get shaken down for billions of dollars to prop up the insurance companies\u2026 and that will become another epic middle-class tax increase, on top of the one we\u2019ve already been hit with, to sustain a scheme very few taxpayers approve of.\n\nAll of the Democrats\u2019 political spin evaporates before the amazing number of people who are willing to pay a special tax to exercise the rights that were taken away from them in 2010.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ObamaCare is fraud on an unprecedented scale.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "ObamaCare is fraud on an unprecedented scale.", "title": "Americans Pay IRS Penalty to Escape From ObamaCare - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/anti-ObamaCare-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/04/americans-pay-irs-penalty-escape-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ObamaCare is fraud on an unprecedented scale.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/anti-ObamaCare-Getty.jpg", "title": "Americans Pay IRS Penalty to Escape From ObamaCare - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "affordable care act, individual mandate, irs, obamacare, tax penalty,Big Government, Obamacare,ObamaCare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "tax penalty", "published_time": "2016-01-04T10:14:16-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "She felt it\u2019s \u201cbetter just to die\u201d if something catastrophic happens to her, and challenged the IRS to \u201ccome and get me\u201d for the Obama tax.\nInstead, premiums are up, and sky-high deductibles make the resulting health \u201ccoverage\u201d virtually useless.\nAnother subject of the article, 61-year-old Susan Reardon, said she figures it\u2019s better to pay the tax penalty and pay for her fibromyalgia medicine out-of-pocket than shell out over $12,000 in premiums and deductibles for useless ObamaCare coverage.\nThey\u2019d rather pay the IRS than give the money to Barack Obama\u2019s cronies in the insurance industry for a low-quality product.\nSome of the other unhappy campers interviewed by the Times described themselves as living in fear because ObamaCare has forced them to make do without health insurance."}
