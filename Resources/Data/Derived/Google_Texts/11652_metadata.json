There, the patients will receive primary care, chronic disease management, prescription medications and referrals to specialty care at county facilities, said Tangerine Brigham, deputy director for the managed care services division at the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.\n\n\u201cWhen they have a medical home, they will be less inclined to use the system episodically, like going to one clinic for one thing, and another clinic for another,\u201d Brigham said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not cost effective. But with this restructuring, it\u2019ll be a more efficient.\u201d\n\nMy Health L.A. replaces a former program called Healthy Way L.A. Unmatched, which ended on Dec. 31, she said. Those who qualify for My Health L.A. are undocumented, live in Los Angeles County and have an income at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. For a family of four, that would mean a monthly income of at or below $2,743.\n\nPeople who are undocumented are ineligible to sign for health care plans under the Affordable Care Act, including Medicaid.\n\nSo far, 3,000 people have signed up for My Health L.A. at Northeast Valley Health Corp., which operates 14 health care sites across the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, said Vilma Champion, director of managed care at Northeast Valley,\n\nChampion said even though clients receive a medical card, the program is not insurance, but it is designed as a quasi-managed care program, she said. Clients are matched or assigned to a medical home for a year, she added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an insurance program, but it\u2019s a coverage program,\u201d Champion said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A program that will offer free health care to thousands of undocumented youth and adults and assign them to specific community clinics launched on Wednesday, officials said.Called", "title": "New Los Angeles County health program provides free care to the uninsurable", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/health/20141001/new-los-angeles-county-health-program-provides-free-care-to-the-uninsurable", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "New Los Angeles County health program provides free care to the uninsurable"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "A program that will offer free health care to thousands of undocumented youth and adults and assign them to specific community clinics launched on Wednesday, officials said.Called", "title": "New Los Angeles County health program provides free care to the uninsurable", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/health/20141001/new-los-angeles-county-health-program-provides-free-care-to-the-uninsurable", "image": {"src": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews.png?052016"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Access to health care, Access to health care news, Los Angeles Access to health care news, CA Access to health care news, US Access to health care news, world Access to health care news.", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Access to health care, Access to health care news, Los Angeles Access to health care news, CA Access to health care news, US Access to health care news, world Access to health care news."}, "article_summary": "People who are undocumented are ineligible to sign for health care plans under the Affordable Care Act, including Medicaid.\nThere, the patients will receive primary care, chronic disease management, prescription medications and referrals to specialty care at county facilities, said Tangerine Brigham, deputy director for the managed care services division at the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.\nA program that will offer free health care to thousands of undocumented youth and adults and assign them to specific community clinics launched on Wednesday, officials said.\nCalled My Health L.A., the $61 million program will assign people to one of 164 community clinics countywide that will become their medical home.\nThose who qualify for My Health L.A. are undocumented, live in Los Angeles County and have an income at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level."}
