If you layer it with more and more bureaucracy, that doesn\u2019t actually make us safer because it doesn\u2019t do a better job of screening but simply makes it almost impossible to process individuals who are coming in, then you\u2019re effectively ending the refugee program for people who desperately need it.\n\nAnd when I referred to a betrayal of our values, I was being very specific about some of the commentary that was made that would suggest, for example, that we might let Christians in but not Muslims; that we \u2014 somehow we\u2019re so fearful that a four-year-old orphan might be let in. And those of you who joined me to the refugee center yesterday and you saw those kids, that\u2019s who we\u2019re talking about. If you are a parent and you saw those kids, and you thought about what they had gone through, the notion that we couldn\u2019t find a home for them anywhere in the United States of America, that is contrary to our values.\n\nAnd the good news is, is that the overwhelming majority of the people who know that we are screening and all the precautions that are already taken \u2014 if they saw those kids, they\u2019d say, yeah, we need to do right by those children.\n\nThe four-year-old refugee comment was made by Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie, but virtually all of the Republican presidential candidates dove head first into the politics of fear. Donald Trump refuses to believe that the refugees are mostly women and children because of images that he saw on television. Jeb Bush only wants to let Christian refugees into the country. Ted Cruz has been trying to boost his sagging presidential campaign by spreading fear of refugees.\n\nUnlike the Republican candidates, President Obama is living in reality. Just as the Republican Party tried to deny people health care by spreading inaccurate fears about the Affordable Care Act, the party\u2019s presidential candidates are trying to win an election with a factless fear campaign against child refugees from Syria.\n\nObama is having none of it, and the President called out the cowardice of the men who want to next occupy the Oval Office. If Republicans continue to try to exploit the politics of fear, President Obama will reveal the true colors of his opposition.\n\nWhile 4-year-old refugees make Republicans cower in fear, President Obama is bombing and killing terrorists on a daily basis.\n\nThe difference between the Republican pretenders and the true leadership of Obama has never been clearer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "During a press conference in Malaysia, President Obama pulled no punches and shredded cowardly Republican presidential candidates who are fearing four-year-old orphan refugees being admitted to the United States.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "During a press conference in Malaysia, President Obama pulled no punches and shredded cowardly Republican presidential candidates who are fearing four-year-old orphan refugees being admitted to the United States.", "title": "Obama Shreds Cowardly GOP Presidential Candidates For Fearing 4 Year Old Orphan Refugees", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/11/22/obama-shreds-cowardly-gop-presidential-candidates-fearing-4-year-orphan-refugees.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/obama-press-conference-malaysia.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-22T12:01:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,Chris Christie,Jeb Bush,Obama,President Obama,press conference Malaysia president obama,republicans fear child refugees,Ted Cruz,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-11-22T12:01:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-22T12:01:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, Obama, President Obama, press conference Malaysia president obama, republicans fear child refugees, Ted Cruz"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd31bc\"", "article_summary": "During a press conference in Malaysia, President Obama pulled no punches and shredded cowardly Republican presidential candidates who are fearing four-year-old orphan refugees being admitted to the United States.\nIf Republicans continue to try to exploit the politics of fear, President Obama will reveal the true colors of his opposition.\nWhile 4-year-old refugees make Republicans cower in fear, President Obama is bombing and killing terrorists on a daily basis.\nUnlike the Republican candidates, President Obama is living in reality.\nThe four-year-old refugee comment was made by Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie, but virtually all of the Republican presidential candidates dove head first into the politics of fear."}
