Jesse Jackson spoke to The Commercial Appeal's editorial board Monday. (Mark Russell/The Commercial Appeal)\n\nSHARE April 3, 2016 - Rev. Jesse Jackson speaks about Rev. Samuel Billy Kyles during a program that honored the legacy of the former Monumental Baptist Church pastor and civil rights leader. (Mike Brown/The Commercial Appeal)\n\nBy Tom Charlier of The Commercial Appeal\n\nIn remarks Monday to The Commercial Appeal\u2019s editorial board, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said the social and economic progress ushered in by the \u201cnameless, faceless marchers\u201d of the Memphis sanitation workers strike in 1968 is under assault across the South by opponents of health care reform and similar programs for the poor.\n\nKing is in town for activities surrounding April 4, the date that King was killed at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis in 1968.\n\n\u201cThe irony is there is an undercurrent of backlash, inexplicably, against the New South progress,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nThe marchers and other activists, he said, \u201cpulled the walls down,\u201d bringing an end to legal segregation and unfair practices and making possible the industrial shift to the South and the economic expansion of the region in recent decades.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have FedEx in Memphis, CNN in Atlanta\u201d without that social progress, Jackson said.\n\n\u201cThere was a low cloud over the South because of these historic relationships.\u201d\n\nBut today, he said, Southern governors and legislators are following a \u201cConfederate ideology\u201d in rejecting billions of dollars from Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nJackson also criticized campaign remarks by Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, who has called for both the curtailing of the immigration of Muslims into the U.S. and the construction of a massive wall along the Mexican border.\n\n\u201cJesus was a refugee,\u201d Jackson said. The apparent preference of many Christians, he added, is to \u201cworship a refugee on Sunday and shut \u2018em out on Monday.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "Rev.
