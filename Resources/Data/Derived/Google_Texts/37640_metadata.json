The district has gotten three written complaints so far. Instead of a cupcake, students will now get a pencil or handmade card from classmates.\n\nHow fun.\n\nApparently, some teachers complained that there were simply too many birthdays during certain weeks and the extra sweets made kids rowdy. Okay, but can't they just celebrate some joint birthdays without cutting cake entirely?\n\nNope, according to Edmonds School District spokeswoman DJ Jakala:\n\n\"If the child chooses, the class will sing to them.
