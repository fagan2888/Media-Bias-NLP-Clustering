An Oklahoma City firefighter was injured early Saturday morning while responding to a house fire.

Fire officials said they responded to a house fire at 5:15 a.m. near May and NW 40th. The firefighter injured a leg when he slipped before entering the home. Fire officials said he was unable to put weight on his leg and was taken to the hospital.

The fire started when a weather head pulled away from the house and caused an electrical fire. The fire was quickly extinguished.
