We are confident that you will want to be a part of the recovery process, to put a stop to Sheriff Mack's challenges and help him bounce back to great health and work.\"In a fiery document posted by TPM outlining how state governments can block President Barack Obama, Mack, who's also known for supporting Cliven Bundy in his standoff against the federal government, writes the states \"do not have to take or support or pay for Obamacare or anything else from Washington DC. The States are not subject to federal direction.\"Even those who disagree with Mack offered donations, including one man who identified himself as a \"Georgia Democrat\" and wrote Friday: \"Everyone \u2026 deserves adequate health care. Please pay the kindness you are receiving forward.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "obamacare, opponent, high, medical, bills, seeks, help", "pubdate": "2015-02-27T19:54:02", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "A former Arizona county sheriff who's been an ardent Obamacare opponent is turning to the Internet to raise $30,000 to cover mounting medical bills for himself and his ailing wife.", "title": "Uninsured Ex-Sheriff Who Fought ACA Seeks Help for Medical Costs", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/obamacare-opponent-high-medical/2015/02/27/id/627422/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/obamacare-opponent-high-medical/2015/02/27/id/627422/", "title": "Uninsured Ex-Sheriff Who Fought ACA Seeks Help for Medical Costs", "description": "A former Arizona county sheriff who's been an ardent Obamacare opponent is turning to the Internet to raise $30,000 to cover mounting medical bills for himself and his ailing wife.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1425066842, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "obamacare, opponent, high, medical, bills, seeks, help", "article": {"section": "US", "published_time": "2015-02-27T19:54:02"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/obamacare-opponent-high-medical/2015/02/27/id/627422/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "A former Arizona county sheriff who's been an ardent Obamacare opponent is turning to the Internet to raise $30,000 to cover mounting medical bills for himself and his ailing wife."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9bff\"", "article_summary": "\"Their modest personal resources alone aren\u2019t sufficient to carry them through these crises,\" friends of the former sheriff wrote on the site.\n\"With the family's permission, we (local friends) are dispensing this call for help, to ask for your financial contributions.\n\"It is difficult and humbling to say that we need your help, but we do.\n\"Even those who disagree with Mack offered donations, including one man who identified himself as a \"Georgia Democrat\" and wrote Friday: \"Everyone \u2026 deserves adequate health care.\nWe are confident that you will want to be a part of the recovery process, to put a stop to Sheriff Mack's challenges and help him bounce back to great health and work."}
