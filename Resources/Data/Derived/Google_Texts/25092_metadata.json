(NYSE: HCP), Welltower Inc. (NYSE: HCN) and Ventas (NYSE: VTR) are placing bets on higher yields in the hospital system space. But while Ventas has staked its claim with the \u201cbeachhead\u201d investment in hospitals by acquiring Ardent for $1.75 billion, the CEO of Welltower is talking about putting acute hospitals \u201cout of business.\u201d\n\nLeaders from the \u201cBig Three\u201d REITs recently spoke with Senior Housing News to weigh in on the hospital asset class and what the new focus means for senior housing.\n\nThe Last Frontier\n\nThe shift in focus for REITs comes at a time when the role of the hospital within the U.S. health care system is evolving, due in large part to Affordable Care Act reforms that incentivize more coordinated care across the continuum and reward provider groups that can place patients in the lowest-cost settings as rapidly as possible.\n\nWelltower CEO and President Thomas J. DeRosa sees a changing acute care landscape and anticipates that hospital systems will undergo a transformation with the help of REITs investing more in the space\u2014and in his estimation the days may be numbered for the acute care hospital as we know it.\n\n\u201cI think that hospital systems are just starting to recognize that their models have to change,\u201d Thomas J. DeRosa, CEO and president of Welltower Inc., told SHN. \u201cThe next 50 years will look very different than the last 50 years. Our goal is to put the traditional acute care business out of business. The days of keeping the beds filled in an acute care hospital are over.\u201d\n\nFitch Ratings also views the shift to more capital dedicated in the space as a natural progression for REITs seeking the next sector with high yields, calling hospitals the \u201clast frontier that pencils out.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, hospital systems are consolidating, influenced by recent mergers among the largest commercial insurance companies, such as the acquisition of Humana Inc., the fourth-largest health insurer by revenue, by Aetna Inc., the third-largest insurer. With REITs investing more in sector, consolidation is likely to increase at a faster pace.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of incentives for hospital consolidation,\u201d Britton Costa, director of U.S. REITs Corporate Ratings with Fitch Ratings, told SHN. \u201cNow that REITs are potentially willing to allocate capital toward it, they can serve as the grease in the transaction if they\u2019re able to finance the majority of a merger with the real estate early on.\u201d\n\nConsolidation may also further accelerate as REITs take on a larger role, says Costa, who anticipates that more systems will converge amid health care changes.\n\n\u201cREITs have been deploying more capital to the hospital space to the extent that during a merger, the acquiring company could finance the portfolio transaction at the time of the announcement or shortly thereafter,\u201d Britton told SHN. \u201cIt could allow for more transactions. In the past, an operator would have to finance the transaction, be it through their bank facility or bridge facility, and then sell the real estate to leasebacks over time.\u201d\n\nLauralee Martin, CEO and president of California-based HCP Inc., agrees that consolidation in the sector is happening due to health care law changes as rules from the Affordable Care Act continue to come into play, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) implements alternative payment methods.\n\n\u201cHospital systems are consolidating because they need to negotiate with the payer systems as well as the consumer\u2019s choice,\u201d Martin told SHN. \u201cAs transparency around that comes into play, there a battle, a focus on market share and being the No. 1 or No. 2 system in any given market. Consolidation is definitely going on and [hospital systems] want to make sure they have the specialties in the different areas.\u201d\n\nHospital systems are also consolidating because the landscape of acute care is undergoing a transformation, according to DeRosa.\n\n\u201cWe think there are too many acute care hospital buildings that are outmoded to deliver health care today,\u201d DeRosa told SHN. \u201cThe future of health care and acute care is outpatient, not inpatient. The future is about moving people out of the high-cost beds and partnering with other providers of health care services that can offer a better outcome at a lower cost. We have to move away from a health care system that sees the acute care hospital bed as the central point.\u201d\n\nDiverging Big 3 Strategies\n\nWhile large-cap REITs are engaging with hospital systems, they vary in their approach to the acute care part of the continuum.\n\nVentas CEO and Chairman Debra Cafaro has spoken frequently of the REIT\u2019s aggressive strategy in the hospital system space, noting several contributing factors.\n\n\u201cWe see a tremendous opportunity to grow in the large, fragmented and rapidly consolidating $1 trillion domestic hospital segment,\u201d Cafaro said in a statement to SHN. \u201cWe believe that several key trends benefit hospitals, including attractive demographics, policy tailwinds such as the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion and an improving economy.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Ventas massively increased its stake in the hospital sector by purchasing Ardent Health Services, Inc., one of the largest for-profit hospital companies in the country, for $1.75 billion.\n\n\u201cOur recent acquisition of Ardent, a top 10 U.S. hospital operator, is the leading edge of our investment program in this highly fragmented market,\u201d Cafaro said. \u201cBy providing capital to high quality hospitals and health systems in attractive markets, we will help care providers fulfill their core missions and improve efficiency in health care.\u201d\n\nHCP has a very focused approach to hospital systems, with 14% of its portfolio dedicated to the medical office sector and 4% to hospitals. Of its medical offices, roughly 80% of these assets are on hospital campuses and 95% are affiliated with hospital systems. By comparison, 19% of Ventas\u2019 portfolio consists of medical office buildings and 2% is made up of specialty hospitals.\n\nWhile their investment exposures may be different, HCP and Ventas have similar views when it comes to what makes the space attractive.\n\n\u201cWe favor the medical office portion of the hospital systems, particularly when the medical office is on campus,\u201d Martin told SHN. \u201cAs we see hospital systems today navigating the changes in health care reimbursement, the ACA\u2019s impact, we see them strategically focused on their acute hospital as sort of their heart and center. If they are going to monetize something\u2014which is where REITs come into play\u2014they are more comfortable monetizing their medical office portfolios than their acute care hospitals.\u201d\n\nGiven this perspective, it makes sense that instead of going after the heart of acute care\u2014the hospital\u2014HCP has a significant portfolio in specialty hospitals, senior living and medical offices that surround and are integrated into hospital campuses. However, Martin also told SHN the REIT wouldn\u2019t rule out acute hospital investments in the future.\n\nSpecialty hospitals and medical offices may become more favorable than traditional acute hospitals as they are generally lower-cost settings. Like HCP, Welltower similarly sees more opportunities in the surrounding campuses.\n\n\u201cWe stop at the front door of the hospital,\u201d DeRosa told SHN. \u201cWhat we are looking to do is partner with hospital systems to build, own and manage the outpatient system to bring in a broader population to those major acute acute settings.\u201d\n\nStill Bullish on Senior Housing\n\nDespite a heavier concentration and more capital being diverted into hospital system assets, senior housing providers shouldn\u2019t be concerned, the Big 3 leaders say. They agree that with 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every day, there will be plenty of demand for years to come, and all are firm that they will continue to invest heavily in the sector.\n\nSpeaking at a recent forum in Chicago, Cafaro noted that Ventas is still optimistic about senior housing down the line, particularly given the opportunity to increase market penetration. She pointed to the fact that less than 10% of seniors live in senior living communities.\n\n\u201cWe are very bullish on senior housing for the long term,\u201d Cafaro told the forum.\n\nWelltower also balks at concerns of oversupply or overbuilding in senior housing, adding that it\u2019s best to look at the sector by regional real estate markets.\n\n\u201cThe headlines of oversupply and overbuilding in senior housing are misleading because you have to look at specific market,\u201d DeRosa told SHN. \u201cIf you are focused to the urban core of the market, those areas are not overbuilt. We are still deploying capital to the best-in-class operators in the Welltower senior housing family who are bringing the beds to treat people to the places where people live.\u201d\n\nHCP\u2019s Martin warns that overbuilding is something to watch, but agrees that looking at specific markets is the best way to detect oversupply. And she delivered a very direct message of reassurance to senior housing providers.\n\n\u201cSenior housing operators should feel that they remain a very sought after investment asset class by REITs,\u201d said Martin.\n\nWritten by Amy Baxter", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ardent, cms, hcp, ventas, welltower inc., business, finance, real estate, senior housing", "og": {"site_name": "Senior Housing News", "description": "After a year of record transaction volume across senior living, the \u201cBig Three\u201d senior housing REITs now are taking aim at a different asset class by\u00a0allocating more resources\u00a0through very different strategies.
