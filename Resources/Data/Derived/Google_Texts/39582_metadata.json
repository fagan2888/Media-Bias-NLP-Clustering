Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski, members of the business community, and advocates for the homeless are supporting the proposal. Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams thanked the bill\u2019s sponsor House Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan for what he called compassionate legislation.\n\n\u201cThere are significant numbers of low-income individuals that cycle in and out of our jail, and in and out of our homeless services system with access to limited treatment options,\u201d McAdams says. \u201cThese are the people that representative Dunnigan\u2019s bill will help.\u201d McAdams says he would prefer a solution that would close the coverage gap entirely, but this proposal appears to have the best hope of passing.\n\nLast year, House Republicans rejected several proposals, finally concluding that the body was not interested in Medicaid expansion as it\u2019s defined by the federal Affordable Care Act. Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder says that was a blow to criminal justice reform which depends on funding for treatment.\n\n\u201cLast year, many of us in the criminal justice community were devastated at the news that the discussions of Medicaid expansion were simply dead. Thank God, they are not dead,\u201d Winder says. \u201cThank God that good people like Representative Dunnigan and others in the Utah legislature to revitalize this critical effort and to move forward on a compromise.\u201d\n\nBut for a former small business owner like Grant Burningham of Bountiful, this legislation does nothing. Burningham considers himself to be part of the middle class, but he has an immune disorder and is too sick to work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of those who would not be covered or helped, and I don\u2019t think Dunnigan\u2019s bill goes far enough,\u201d Burningham says. Without health coverage, he says he\u2019s at risk of becoming homeless.\n\nMayor McAdams says in the future, he\u2019s hoping the state legislature will look towards serving all of the uninsured in Utah.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health Care", "description": "Local leaders gathered at the Utah Capitol Tuesday to throw their support behind legislation that would provide health coverage to those in extreme poverty", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kuer.org/post/salt-lake-area-leaders-support-compromise-health-care-bill", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuer/files/styles/medium/public/201603/DunniganMcAdams.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Local leaders gathered at the Utah Capitol Tuesday to throw their support behind legislation that would provide health coverage to those in extreme poverty", "title": "Salt Lake Area Leaders Support \u201cCompromise\u201d Health Care Bill"}, "story_id": 468779514, "twitter": {"site": "@KUERNews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@KUERNews"}, "author": "Andrea Smardon", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Salt Lake Area Leaders Support \u201cCompromise\u201d Health Care Bill"}, "nid": 74629, "datePublished": "2016-03-01", "wordCount": 383, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski, members of the business community, and advocates for the homeless are supporting the proposal.\nSalt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams thanked the bill\u2019s sponsor House Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan for what he called compassionate legislation.\nSalt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder says that was a blow to criminal justice reform which depends on funding for treatment.\nLocal leaders gathered at the Utah Capitol Tuesday to throw their support behind legislation that would provide health coverage to those in extreme poverty.\nHouse Bill 437 would provide Medicaid benefits to an estimated 16,000 Utahns who are considered most in need."}
