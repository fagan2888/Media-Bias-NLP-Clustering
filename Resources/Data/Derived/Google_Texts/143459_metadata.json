Keith Rothfus (R-Allegheny) has tepid support among voters in Pennsylvania\u2019s 12th district.\n\nAccording to the poll, first reported by Early Returns, Rothfus enjoys a positive favorability rating: 38% to 27%. 35% percent didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t have an opinion about him.\n\nA narrow plurality said Rothfus deserves to be re-elected, 31% to 30%. 39% said they weren\u2019t sure.\n\nWhen it came to the government shutdown, 50% of respondents said the opposed \u201cshutting down the federal government over funding for Obamacare\u201d while 40% supported it.\n\nThe poll was conducted by DC-based Lincoln Park Strategies, who surveyed 708 likely voters from October 8-9. The results were down-weighted to 400 respondents to ensure proportional responses. The margin of error is plus or minus 4%.\n\nMcClelland needs to show national and state Democrats that there is a path to victory against Rothfus in order to generate the type of fundraising necessary to make her a serious competitor.\n\nAs with any poll conducted by a candidate or interest group, the results should be taken with a grain of salt. Pollsters often prepare two versions of a polling memo: one for public release, and one for private review by the campaign.\n\nIn this case, the polling memo does not include head-to-head numbers between McClelland and Rothfus \u2013 a sign that the numbers weren\u2019t favorable to McClelland. **\n\n**McClelland\u2019s campaign told PoliticsPA that no head to head matchup was conducted \u201csince this poll was to test Rothfus\u2019 numbers alone.\u201d\n\nMcClelland Endorsements\n\nMcClelland, who runs a substance abuse rehabilitation center in Blawnox, also recently announced the endorsement of three Westmoreland County Democrats. County Commissioner Ted Kopas, County Democratic Committee Chair Dante Bertani, and County Democratic Committee Executive Director Jesse Walker all voiced their support of McClelland.\n\n\u201cErin McClelland has spent the majority of her adult life raising a family in Westmoreland County and is a person of high character, energy, and enthusiasm,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI am proud to endorse her candidacy. There is a grave disconnect between Congressman Rothfus and the needs of those in the 12th Congressional District. Erin is the best person to replace Mr. Rothfus and represent those of us living in the 12th District.\u201d\n\nJohn Hugya, the retired Marine Colonel and former Chief of Staff to Rep. Jack Murtha, entered the Democratic primary on Friday.\n\nRothfus defeated Rep. Mark Critz in 2012. He faces former Critz supporter Larry Stiles in the Republican primary.\n\nOctober 11th, 2013 | Posted in Congress, Front Page Stories, Top Stories | 2 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "A poll commissioned by the 12th district Democratic hopeful found freshman Rep.
