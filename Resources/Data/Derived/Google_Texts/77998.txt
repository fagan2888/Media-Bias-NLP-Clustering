CNBC's Bertha Coombs reports from a hearing at the House pertaining to glitches with the Obamacare websites.

One of the lead contractors responsible for developing the government's troubled health-care website said Thursday his company warned the Obama administration about rollout risks, while another expressed confidence that it will be fixed in time for benefits to go live on Jan. 1.

Andrew Slavitt, executive vice president with the parent of Quality Software Services Inc. (QSSI), said his company told the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services of concerns about testing the Healthcare.gov website.

``We expressed all of those concerns and risks,'' Slavitt said in testimony to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, without immediately elaborating on what those concerns were.

QSSI, a unit of United Health Group, was hired to build a "data hub'' that will allow people to buy insurance on the state exchanges that are the heart of President Barack Obama's signature health care policy.

Another contractor, website developer CGI Federal, said the website will be fixed in time to allow people to enroll in private health insurance by a Dec. 15 deadline to obtain benefits beginning on Jan. 1.

"The system is working. People are enrolling. But people will be able to enroll at a faster pace,'' said Cheryl Campbell, senior vice president at CGI Federal.

CGI Federal built the federal website serving 36 states, and QSSI designed the part that verifies applicants' income and other personal details.
