The court last week considered an appeal brought by medical marijuana user Brandon Coats, who was rendered a quadriplegic by a car accident.\n\nIn 2010, he was fired from his customer service job at Dish Network for failing a drug test and violating the company\u2019s drug policy. Coats says he uses marijuana to control leg spasms.\n\nHe maintains he was never high on the job. And while one might question whether Coats\u2019 drug use really had any effect on his job performance, we don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that the company is allowed to prohibit it.\n\nAnd surely there are situations in which having marijuana-impaired employees could be a liability \u2014 such as on a loading dock where heavy equipment is in use.\n\nOne distinction that makes a difference is that Colorado\u2019s medical marijuana amendment did not establish pot use as a right.\n\nRather, the amendment created what is called an \u201caffirmative defense,\u201d which allows an exemption from prosecution \u2014 not a constitutional right to use medical marijuana.\n\nWe have sympathy for Coats, who apparently remains unemployed, but we hope Colorado\u2019s Supreme Court justices keep faith with both the letter and intent of the amendment and employers\u2019 rights to prohibit marijuana use by their employees.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "No absolute right to use medical marijuana", "title": "No absolute right to use medical marijuana", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/03/no-absolute-right-to-use-medical-marijuana/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141003__marijuanap1.jpg", "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141003__marijuanap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-03T16:58:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:35:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Marijuana Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb2f6\"", "article_summary": "One distinction that makes a difference is that Colorado\u2019s medical marijuana amendment did not establish pot use as a right.\nThe constitutional amendment establishing medical marijuana in Colorado was pretty clear when it came to employers and pot.\nRather, the amendment created what is called an \u201caffirmative defense,\u201d which allows an exemption from prosecution \u2014 not a constitutional right to use medical marijuana.\nThe court last week considered an appeal brought by medical marijuana user Brandon Coats, who was rendered a quadriplegic by a car accident.\nYet Colorado Supreme Court justices seem to find the issue perplexing."}
