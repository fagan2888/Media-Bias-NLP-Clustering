When first he signed up for food stamps, he was told that he didn\u2019t qualify. But after Illinois lawmakers accepted the health care law\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion, Sigoloff was one of the estimated 468,000 low-income residents who gained access to coverage this year.\n\nOne of the first things he did was go to the doctor. He knew he had issues with high blood pressure that he had been neglecting during the 11 years that he hadn\u2019t gone to regular check-ups. But he didn\u2019t expect to discover that he also had a brain tumor.\n\nI always had a feeling I was a walking time bomb, and it turned out I was right.\n\nSigoloff was referred to a neurosurgeon and received radiation treatment. So far, everything seems to be going well. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty lucky. It turned out my tumor wasn\u2019t cancer,\u201d he said in an interview with ThinkProgress. He\u2019ll have a follow-up MRI in December. For the first time in years, he\u2019s also managing chronic conditions like diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\n\u201cI always had a feeling I was a walking time bomb, and it turned out I was right,\u201d Sigoloff said. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for gaining insurance and being able to go to the doctor, I might not be here.\u201d\n\nSigoloff said that one of the best things about gaining health insurance has been the renewed sense of security. He no longer has to worry about the unknown medical issues that may be taking a toll on his body. He feels relieved.\n\nIt\u2019s a hard thing to measure relief, but there\u2019s some research to back up his claim. A large study in Oregon that tracked the effects of people gaining access to insurance found that getting that coverage made them feel healthier, happier, and more financially secure. There is limited evidence suggesting that when one member of a family lacks insurance, that may contribute to higher levels of familial stress.\n\nThere\u2019s also similar anecdotal evidence from some of the other people who are gaining insurance coverage under the health law for the first time in years.\n\nCharles McClinon, a 50-year-old Ohio resident who lives with epilepsy, told ThinkProgress, \u201cThe peace of mind is worth more than anything. I could be a millionaire, but if I don\u2019t have peace of mind, what good is it? And that\u2019s one thing this type of insurance is good for. I know I can get the kind of care I need.\u201d\n\nCharles McClinon before he had surgery to prevent his epileptic seizures CREDIT: Courtesy of Charles McClinon via Enroll America\n\nIn 2010, McClinon\u2019s epileptic seizures intensified, making it too difficult for him to hold down a job or complete the university classes in which he was enrolled in at the time. To make matters worse, his student health policy dropped him under a pre-existing condition clause. After that, McClinon struggled to afford the treatment he needed, especially after his medications started to give him debilitating side effects. He eventually became homeless.\n\nAfter Ohio\u2019s governor became one of the first Republican leaders to accept the Medicaid expansion, however, McClinon gained coverage in February. He can now afford the multiple medications he needs to manage his condition \u2014 and this summer, he also had a cutting-edge surgery that will hopefully prevent his seizures and eliminate the need for all the drugs he currently takes. Thanks to his Medicaid coverage, he didn\u2019t have to pay for that procedure out of his own pocket.\n\nMcClinon, who worked his whole life before his seizures worsened, is looking forward to feeling like his old self again. \u201cIt\u2019s not even just about medical care \u2014 it\u2019s also been helpful for me on the mental health side,\u201d McClinon said, referring to his newfound peace of mind. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done if I lived in another state.\u201d\n\nCarol Fisher Hardaway did live in one of those other states. Plagued with multiple sclerosis and having difficulty finding work, she didn\u2019t qualify for coverage in Texas because the political leaders there have refused to expand the Medicaid program. She ended up relocating to the Maryland area, where her son lives and where state officials have implemented the expansion, so she could have affordable access to health care.\n\n\u201cMy MS got worse over the past year and now I really do need medications. Each of my shots costs $1000 and I get them once a week,\u201d Fisher Hardaway told ThinkProgress. \u201cBut I pay $3 a month with my coverage. Now I can see a neurologist. Now I can go to the doctor and not worry. It\u2019s huge. That\u2019s a success story.\u201d\n\nShe described her new coverage as \u201cliterally a miracle\u201d when it comes to treating her chronic condition. \u201cI\u2019m not cured \u2014 I\u2019ll never be cured. But I don\u2019t writhe in spasms 12 times a day,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty good!\u201d\n\nNow I can see a neurologist. Now I can go to the doctor and not worry. It\u2019s huge. That\u2019s a success story.\n\nNonetheless, Fisher Hardaway doesn\u2019t think everyone should have to follow in her footsteps and move across the country to gain access to health benefits. Indeed, health experts believe that she\u2019s the exception rather than the rule. According to a recent study conducted by Harvard researchers, most low-income Americans who are locked out of affordable insurance won\u2019t move to a different state to take advantage of the Medicaid expansion there. This is a fairly predictable policy dynamic that\u2019s evident in other areas; for instance, people don\u2019t typically cross state lines to take advantage of more generous tax breaks, either.\n\nMost people won\u2019t move for Medicaid because they don\u2019t understand how much they could benefit in another part of the country \u2014 particularly if they live in the red states that have actively resisted allocating funds toward public education campaigns about Obamacare. On top of that, moving requires a lot of financial resources, and most impoverished Americans simply can\u2019t uproot their lives in that way.\n\nSome anti-Obamacare Republicans have told their constituents they should simply travel to another part of the country for health insurance. This past summer, after Missouri lawmakers blocked Medicaid expansion from moving forward, state senator Ed Emery told a supporter of the policy that \u201cindividuals and families are free to consider moving to states with differing and even contrasting government policies.\u201d\n\nIn Fisher Hardaway\u2019s opinion, lawmakers like that are digging in their heels against the expansion because they don\u2019t understand what it means to people like her.\n\n\u201cIf Rick Perry had to go without insurance like I did, he would change things pretty quick, I think,\u201d Fisher Hardaway told ThinkProgress in reference to her former state\u2019s governor, who called Medicaid expansion a \u201cfool\u2019s errand\u201d last year. \u201cIt\u2019s very selfish to me. There are hundreds of thousands of people like me who are still struggling, stuck between a rock and a hard place.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a policy term for the people who are simply stuck. They fall into what experts call the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d \u2014 they earn too much money to qualify for their state\u2019s more restrictive Medicaid program, but too little money to receive federal subsidies to help them purchase private plans on Obamacare\u2019s new state-level marketplaces. Those people are essentially locked out of Obamacare\u2019s promise of health reform altogether.\n\nIf Rick Perry had to go without insurance like I did, he would change things pretty quick.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate that approximately four million people fall into this coverage gap,\u201d Rachel Garfield, a senior researcher for the Kaiser Family Foundation who specializes in data related to uninsured Americans and Medicaid beneficiaries, said. \u201cA few things stand out. They\u2019re by and large concentrated in the South, which reflects the fact that many of the states not expanding Medicaid happen to be in the South. And they\u2019re disproportionately likely to be people of color, particularly black.\u201d\n\nMost of the people who are being denied Medicaid coverage don\u2019t fit the conservative trope of the government beneficiary who solely relies on money from public programs. They\u2019re mostly in working families, which means that they or someone in their immediate family is employed. Some of them are working full time. According to Garfield, these people are simply \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to get insurance through their jobs \u2014 either because they\u2019re employed at small firms that aren\u2019t required to offer it, because they\u2019re juggling multiple part-time hourly jobs, or because they\u2019re in low-wage industries that have very low coverage rates.\n\nLast fall, a New York Times analysis confirmed that the Americans stuck in the Medicaid coverage gap include hundreds of thousands of the working poor \u2014 like cashiers, cooks, nurses\u2019 aides, waiters and waitresses, and janitors. Many of them are single mothers. They are \u201cthe very kinds of people that the program was intended to help,\u201d the Times reported at the time.\n\nThe individuals who are gaining Medicaid expansion understand these realities better than anyone.\n\n\u201cPeople think Medicaid is just for the poor and god forbid if you need it, because if you\u2019re on it you must not have a job,\u201d Fisher Hardaway said. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s a misconception. There\u2019s a much bigger umbrella, and there are people like me who are on the cusp.\u201d\n\nMcClinon agreed. \u201cThere are a lot of people who have gone without coverage for so long that they assume this is just the way it is. But that\u2019s not the way it has to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have this type of legislation that\u2019s been put into place.\u201d\n\nCarol Fisher Hardaway and her son CREDIT: Courtesy of Carol Fisher Hardaway\n\nIt\u2019s still a little too early to have much concrete data about the other people like Sigoloff, McClinon, and Fisher Hardaway who have recently gained health insurance through the Medicaid expansion. We do know that uninsurance rates are falling faster in the states that expanded Medicaid, which suggests that people are getting connected with new coverage, but we don\u2019t know exactly what they\u2019ve done with that coverage so far. The Kaiser Family Foundation is currently conducting a survey to try to figure out how Medicaid coverage is impacting those people\u2019s lives.\n\nResearchers can make some educated guesses about what they may expect to find among this population. Along with one of her colleagues, Garfield recently conducted a review of the previous research in the field and concluded that gaining Medicaid coverage has an overall positive effect.\n\n\u201cWithin the policy community, there is this debate that pops up every now and then about whether getting Medicaid is of any value \u2014 this idea that if you have Medicaid, you\u2019re no better off than you are if you\u2019re uninsured,\u201d Garfield explained. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s pretty clear that, compared to having no coverage at all, gaining Medicaid makes you more likely to see a provider, to get your preventive services, to get the services you need when you\u2019re sick, and also to not face as much financial hardship when you do need care.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, a new study from the Harvard School of Public Health found that a large majority of low-income Americans support Medicaid expansion. But it still has somewhat of an uncertain future. Although the policy\u2019s proponents are hopeful the growing evidence about its benefits may eventually convince every state to accept the expansion, it remains to be seen whether resistant GOP leaders will fall in line. And, in the states where the leadership may switch parties, residents wonder if their coverage will remain in place.\n\nIn Illinois, Sigoloff is certainly thinking about the politics of health care reform. Gov. Pat Quinn (D) is up for re-election this year, and Sigoloff is worried that his Republican opponent will roll back Medicaid benefits if he takes control of the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\n\u201cI keep wondering if he would take away my health insurance. I think he probably would if he had the opportunity,\u201d he said in reference to GOP candidate Bruce Rauner. \u201cI\u2019m very much concerned about that. You know, people don\u2019t vote because they don\u2019t think elections affect them, but this would affect my life considerably.\u201d\n\nSigoloff said he doesn\u2019t hear too many of his friends discussing health care reform. If he ever brings it up to tell them how it saved his life, they usually tell him they\u2019re happy he\u2019s okay, but they don\u2019t want to go into the politics.\n\nPeople don\u2019t vote because they don\u2019t think elections affect them, but this would affect my life considerably.\n\nFisher Hardaway \u2014 who agreed to speak to ThinkProgress on the condition that she would be able to say exactly how she felt about Texas\u2019 Republican governor \u2014 made her feelings about the politics very clear. \u201cAny politician who digs in their heels and refuses to do something to help people should never be elected again,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, she doesn\u2019t necessarily feel comfortable spreading the word about Obamacare with the people whom she encounters in her everyday life. \u201cWith MS, I don\u2019t often walk up to people and tell them as a conversation starter,\u201d she noted, adding that she understands why people have been \u201cfrustrated\u201d with the law following the website problems that plagued the first months of the health insurance marketplaces\u2019 open enrollment period. She said that America\u2019s insurance system has been \u201cbroken\u201d for decades.\n\nMcClinon thinks Medicaid expansion is a step in the right direction, especially since extending health insurance to additional people can help ensure they\u2019re productive members of society.\n\n\u201cI think that a healthier country will definitely make us so much more profitable. When you feel good, and when you don\u2019t have to worry about whether or not you\u2019re going to get care, it\u2019s a lot easier to do things,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we\u2019re all going to be holding hands and singing kumbaya or anything. But this definitely makes it a lot better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"Now I can go to the doctor and not worry. It's huge.
