He was 84 .\n\nStarting in 1965, Barth was the director of LASP for 27 years and a professor in the astrophysical and planetary sciences department at CU. Since 2002, he was a professor emeritus both at the laboratory and in the department.\n\nBetween 1962 and 2002, Barth served as the principal investigator for eleven missions and experiments studying Earth and other planets.\n\n\"He was a pioneer, truly a pioneer, in space research,\" said Dan Baker, Barth's successor as director of LASP. \"He was one of the giants of the field.\"\n\nBarth grew up in Philadelphia and went to college in Bethlehem, Pa. After serving in the Air Force, he earned a doctorate in California and then completed postdoctoral work in Germany before starting a career in space physics as a research physicist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nHis specialty in research was the study of planetary atmospheres and ultraviolet spectroscopy.\n\nPossel started working at LASP in 2006 but said Barth was still active and committed to the lab even though he had retired years earlier.\n\n\"He was very much an innovator and leader and scientist,\" Possel said. \"Finding those qualities in a leader, for a lab like us, is pretty rare.\"\n\nBeing a leader is something that Barth was good at, even outside of his work, said son-in-law Charles Brock.\n\n\"He was always an organizer,\" Brock said. \"Whenever the family had anything to do, he would get everyone organized. He was very impressive in terms of his abilities to get people to come to agreement, organize and move forward on a project.\"\n\nBarth and his wife, Louise, met in Los Angeles during his doctorate studies and moved to Boulder in 1965. The couple enjoyed the outdoors together.\n\n\"He and his wife would travel all over Colorado with a camper trailer and travel all over the state,\" Brock said. \"He loved hiking in the mountains.\"\n\nWhen his sons were Boy Scouts, Barth took them for a 10-day hiking trip in the Flat Tops Wilderness.\n\nBarth also shared his love of technology and science with his children. Together, they would build television sets, radios and garage openers.\n\n\"Technology and the outdoors were his two great loves,\" Brock said.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Charles A. Barth Scholarship in Space Research at the University of Colorado.\n\nCharlie Brennan: 303-473-1327, brennanc@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/chasbrennan", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_26798168/charles-barth-84-remembered-space-research-pioneer-at", "sailthru.author": "By Stephen Autar \n \n  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26798168:view"}, "startDate": "2014-10-25T09:43:18-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Undergraduate students at the University of Colorado are able to design, build and operate spacecrafts - that, in part, is thanks to Charles Barth.", "title": "Charles Barth, 84, remembered as space research pioneer at CU-Boulder", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_26798168/charles-barth-84-remembered-space-research-pioneer-at", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1025/20141025__26dcabarw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "CU News", "modificationDate": "2014-10-25T09:44:29-0600", "endDate": "2024-10-25T09:40:30-0600", "news_keywords": "CU News, CU News news, Boulder Colorado CU News news, Boulder Colorado news, CU News Boulder news, CU News Colorado news, US CU News news, world CU News news.", "byline": "By Stephen AutarCamera", "pubDate": "2014-10-25T09:46:05-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-10-25T09:43:18-0600", "sailthru.title": "Charles Barth, 84, remembered as space research pioneer at CU-Boulder", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1025/20141025__26dcabarw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Undergraduate students at the University of Colorado are able to design, build and operate spacecrafts - that, in part, is thanks to Charles Barth.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_26798168/charles-barth-84-remembered-space-research-pioneer-at", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Undergraduate students at the University of Colorado are able to design, build and operate spacecrafts - that, in part, is thanks to Charles Barth.", "title": "Charles Barth, 84, remembered as space research pioneer at CU-Boulder"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1025/20141025__26dcabarw~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2dff\"", "article_summary": "\"He was a pioneer, truly a pioneer, in space research,\" said Dan Baker, Barth's successor as director of LASP.\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Charles A.
