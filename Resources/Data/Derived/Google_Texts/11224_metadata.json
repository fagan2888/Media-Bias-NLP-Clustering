And it\u2019s fantastically faux. High-end synthetic grass looks like the real thing - even enough to please discerning Californians. So why not make it mandatory? The Synthetic Grass Warehouse - the nation\u2019s largest distributor of the stuff - is calling upon California Gov. Jerry Brown to consider a fake grass law in the drought-stricken state, where residents use 6.4 billion gallons of water per day for lawn care. The Anaheim-based company suggests Mr. Brown propose a law where synthetic grass is a \u201cboth allowed and encouraged anywhere\u201d - front yards, backyards, businesses, doggy runs.\n\n\u201cIf everyone in California switched to synthetic grass, eliminating just the need to water our lawns, we would no longer be in a drought. We need to welcome this idea in today\u2019s day and age as droughts are becoming more and more severe. Besides, there is absolutely no maintenance with synthetic grass and it has the same look and feel as real grass, so why wouldn\u2019t you make the switch if you could?\u201d reasons company co-founder Victor Lanfranco.\n\nIndeed, this is not your grandfather\u2019s astroturf. The fibrous tufts are richly textured and colored , available in a dozen varieties for home use alone. The grass part - non-absorbent and anti-bacterial - is groomed with a brush rather than a mower. \u201cImagine a California where water was no longer wasted on grass!\u201d the company proclaims on a public poster.\n\nThere is water to save, however. The Atlanta-based Synthetic Turf Council estimates that replacing the typical 1,800 square-foot lawn with the faux stuff could save 99,000 gallons of water per year, per lawn. And there would be no pesticide or fertilizer run-off.\n\nGov. Brown, meanwhile, has proposed fines as high as $10,000 for \u201cexcessive water use,\u201dand has ordered that water use be reduced by 25 percent statewide. City and county agencies along with retail and wholesale water agencies will be able to issue the penalties and enforce the restrictions.\n\nA California landscape done in synthetic grass (Synthetic Grass Warehouse) more >\n\n\u201cPeople are stuck between a rock and a hard place because most home owners associations require residents to water their lawn, while the state is simultaneously reducing their water usage. On top of that, some don\u2019t even allow homeowners to install synthetic grass, so what do they do? This is where we need our governor to step in,\u201d Mr. LanFranco explains.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's bristly, lush and there's tangly thatch around the roots.
