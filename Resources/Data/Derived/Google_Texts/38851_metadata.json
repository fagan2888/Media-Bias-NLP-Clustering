For deaths attributed to colon cancer in men, the racial divide has remained the same. This imbalance is likely caused by inequalities in access to care, screening and treatment, the researchers said.\n\n\"There is good news. Cancer death rates among black women are decreasing for all of the top cancers, but compared to whites not as much progress has been made -- particularly for breast cancer,\" said lead researcher Carol DeSantis, an epidemiologist with the cancer society.\n\nIn men, the death rates for colon cancer have remained 50 percent higher for blacks than whites, she said. \"For all of the major cancers, deaths are higher for blacks than whites,\" she added.\n\nReductions in overall cancer deaths since the early 1990s have saved more than 300,000 black lives over the past 20 years, the report said.\n\nDeaths from cancer are declining because improved screening detects many cancers earlier, and improvements in care have made treatments more effective, DeSantis said. \"The disparities remain because not everyone is getting access to the best cancer therapies,\" she said.\n\nThe disparity in care is more economic than racial, DeSantis said. \"It's just that there are more poor blacks,\" she said.\n\nThe report was published Feb. 22 in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.\n\nCancer death rates have dropped faster among blacks than whites for all cancers combined, and for lung, prostate and colon cancer in women, the researchers found.\n\nOther highlights from the report:\n\nDr. Christopher Flowers is chair of the Health Disparities Committee for the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). He said, \"There is some promising news that there is a narrowing of the gap in cancer disparities, but [this study] also raises the concern that there still is a gap between black and white patients in terms of cancer deaths.\"\n\nFlowers added that ASCO is trying to develop new ways to educate doctors and improve the quality of care in hospitals that \"serve traditionally underserved populations.\"\n\nHe said Medicaid reform might help to address the racial disparities in cancer care, and added that that's another area where ASCO is working to make changes.\n\nDeSantis noted that changes in insurance access will likely help. In particular, she said, the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) may help narrow the gap between blacks and whites, because more people will have health insurance. \"That's a huge step,\" she said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 HealthDay.
