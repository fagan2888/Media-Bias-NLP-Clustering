The State Department\u2019s wasteful spending on her \u201cexit interview.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s just recently.\n\n#page#Hillary\u2019s philosophy of government, approach to public power, foreign-policy vision, vindictiveness to critics, and record of leadership matter, and the Republican party\u2019s grassroots voters have good reason to require a nominee who doesn\u2019t think of his Democratic rival as part of his family.\n\nYes, sometimes you\u2019ll see political junkies insisting that a nomination fight or legislative amendment on a spending bill is the moral equivalent of war. But the extraordinary passion that people bring to political debates isn\u2019t always silly or a sign of unthinking partisanship, ill-temperedness, or obstinacy. Democrats and Republicans \u2014 and particularly liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans \u2014 have diametrically opposed ideas about what policies to enact and how to make America a better place. We don\u2019t just think that their ideas won\u2019t work; we think their ideas will make the problems worse. They are not keeping the country stuck in neutral; they\u2019re driving it in the wrong direction. Our liberal counterparts combine a limitless hostility toward those in the private sector who don\u2019t donate to their campaigns with an endless faith in an incompetent, wasteful, fumbling government bureaucracy to work miracles. They would run on the slogan \u201cimmanentize the eschaton\u201d if they hadn\u2019t skipped theology class for gender studies or to join the protest du jour.\n\n#ad#Their idea of a heavenly America \u2014 who are we kidding, half their ranks would object to such an implicitly non-secular concept \u2014 is our version of Hell, and vice versa.\n\nEarlier this month, Hillary Clinton talked about the need for \u201cempathy\u201d in our foreign policy, even with our enemies \u2014 indicating she\u2019s learned nothing of significance from the global wreckage of her alleged \u201csmart power.\u201d\n\nOver the past six years, we on the right \u2014 and in particular, the previous Republican nominee \u2014 have been proven right time and again. Russia is indeed behaving like our preeminent geopolitical foe. Negotiating with the Taliban was a stupid idea. We knew leaving absolutely no U.S. military presence in Iraq was a formula for trouble. We never dismissed ISIS as a \u201cjayvee team.\u201d Democrats didn\u2019t need to pass Obamacare for us to know what was in it. The Obama team scoffed at Romney\u2019s idea of giving veterans vouchers for care at private hospitals, assuring us that the Department of Veterans Affairs was reducing the backlog and giving our veterans the care they deserved. We talked about the need for a secure border decades before Central America decided to turn our border into a giant open-air day-care center.\n\nWe do not like Hillary Clinton. We do not like her philosophies, her decisionmaking, or the weapons-grade pabulum that she stuffs in her books and offers for six figures per speech. Perhaps in person she is warm and funny and all of those things her hagiographic media fans insist. But her record in public life \u2014 and that of her allies, and her party \u2014 has been an absolute disaster for the country for the past six years, and the 2016 Republican nominee needs to be able to make that case and win that argument six days a week and twice on Sundays.\n\nPerhaps Jeb Bush can be that man. But to do so, he\u2019ll have to bring his A-game to the task of thoroughly defeating his metaphorical sister-in-law.\n\n\u2014 Jim Geraghty writes the Campaign Spot on NRO.", "card": "summary", "title": "Is Jeb Ready for Hillary?, by Jim Geraghty, National Review"}, "tweettext": "Is Jeb Ready for Hillary?", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Is Jeb Ready for Hillary?", "keywords": "Jim Geraghty", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Is Jeb Ready for Hillary?, Jim Geraghty, National Review", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Jim Geraghty, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0222\"", "article_summary": "We do not like Hillary Clinton.\nThe base of the Republican party strongly dislikes Hillary Clinton.\nHer whining about allegedly unfair media scrutiny, while enjoying coverage that would represents a triumphant day for the average Republican.\nInsert all the standard boilerplate about the joy of friendship and personal relationships, and how political opponents don\u2019t need to be lifelong enemies.\nPerhaps in person she is warm and funny and all of those things her hagiographic media fans insist."}
