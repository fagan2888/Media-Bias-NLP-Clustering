The newest path, through the EU\u2019s Balkans back door, comes with a cruel twist: an epic 250-kilometer (150-mile) walk that is surging in popularity even though most who try it fail.\n\nThis month, The Associated Press traveled for 10 days and nights with a 45-member group of West African migrants trying to reach Germany and France via Hungary, the terminus of the Western Balkans route. Many trekkers have faced years of failure to reach the heart of Europe by other sea and air routes, and soon discover the new path makes its own peculiar demands on those who try it.\n\nHere is the migrants\u2019 story from their Feb. 27 assembly in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki through 10 days of mounting agony and, for all but a lucky handful, defeat.\n\n___\n\nSAFE HOUSE\n\nThe 32 men and 11 women packed into a two-bedroom basement apartment have left West Africa in search of a better life in Europe. It\u2019s taken them months, some even years, to reach this moment of hope. Two of the women have brought along 10-month-old children born during the journey; the boy in Greece, the girl in Turkey.\n\nMost have come via Turkey and, after paying smugglers around 1,000 euros ($1,100) each, sailed to nearby Greek islands to claim asylum on EU soil. But none wants to stay in Greece, with its unending debt crisis and high unemployment.\n\nTo escape means heading north to Hungary via the former Yugoslavia, and a key link in the journey \u2014 Macedonia \u2014 must be covered on foot because of stiff criminal penalties for traffickers.\n\nThe smuggler, a former soldier who provided AP access to the group on condition of anonymity, sternly tells his clients to be ready for a challenge that will require tents, sleeping bags, cold-weather gear, good shoes and plenty of socks. He promises to deliver them to the Serbian border in 10 days for a price averaging $500 a head. A few are sent to shop for last-minute supplies. All sleep fitfully on the floor.\n\n___\n\nTO THE BORDER\n\nIt takes half a day for the entire group to board buses at a Thessaloniki central station full of rival groups of Asian and Arab migrants \u2014 and a large contingent of immigration police checking IDs. Two of the 45 Africans fall at this first hurdle, facing arrest for failing to carry papers identifying them as asylum-seekers.\n\nThe rest start their long walk an hour north in the Greek border town of Polikastro. They follow an active rail line over a rickety wooden bridge through woods for 10 hours, reaching the frontier with Macedonia shortly before midnight. It\u2019s deemed too late to cross. The weather is cool but fine, and they sleep in the open air.\n\nThe next night \u2014 most hiking will be done after dark to reduce the risk of detection, arrest and deportation back to Greece \u2014 they cross the border under the noses of a hilltop police observation post. After running in small groups across a major highway, they pitch 10 tents in Macedonia amid high spirits.\n\n___\n\nPATH TO PERDITION\n\nInfighting begins as one migrant, an aide to the smuggler, loses his phone and demands everyone be searched. The group traverses a mountain ridge, a road junction, cabbage fields and streams during a 40-kilometer trek that concludes at 4 a.m. under a freeway overpass. A 34-year-old Malian woman with leg pain forces the group to stop midway. Men carry her for a half-hour, then say she must walk or be left behind.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Migrants\u2019 newest route to Europe means an epic Balkans trek", "title": "Migrants\u2019 newest route to Europe means an epic Balkans trek", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Migrants\u2019 newest route to Europe means an epic Balkans trek", "title": "Migrants\u2019 newest route to Europe means an epic Balkans trek", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/28/migrants_newest_route_to_europe_means_an_epic_balkans_trek/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/migrants-journey-to-europe.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Migrants\u2019 newest route to Europe means an epic Balkans trek", "title": "Migrants\u2019 newest route to Europe means an epic Balkans trek", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/migrants-journey-to-europe.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Shawn Pogatchnik and Dalton Bennett", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The rest start their long walk an hour north in the Greek border town of Polikastro.\nThis month, The Associated Press traveled for 10 days and nights with a 45-member group of West African migrants trying to reach Germany and France via Hungary, the terminus of the Western Balkans route.\nThe newest path, through the EU\u2019s Balkans back door, comes with a cruel twist: an epic 250-kilometer (150-mile) walk that is surging in popularity even though most who try it fail.\nHe promises to deliver them to the Serbian border in 10 days for a price averaging $500 a head.\nTwo of the women have brought along 10-month-old children born during the journey; the boy in Greece, the girl in Turkey."}
