Lindsey Graham speaks during an interview with the Associated Press at a U.S. base in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 2008.\n\nU.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham announced last week he is retiring from the Air Force after 33 years \u2014 just ahead of his bid for commander-in-chief.\n\nGraham, who carries the rank of colonel, will leave in June, which is the same month he plans to formally declare his likely GOP run for the White House.\n\nHis office did not respond to questions about the timing of his retirement or if it was linked to his presidential campaign plans.\n\nBefore being elected to Congress in 1994, Graham, a Republican, served 6 1/2 years as an Air Force lawyer. He later joined the S.C. Air National Guard before finishing in the reserves with the duty as a senior individual mobilization augmentee to the Judge Advocate General.\n\nS.C. black voters asked to consider Republicans in 2016\n\nThe S.C. African American Chamber of Commerce is urging black voters to study all the candidates for president this year, including Republicans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that African Americans almost always vote Democratic. As a consequence, our votes are often taken for granted by both major parties,\u201d Chamber President Stephen Gilchrist said. \u201cAnd when our votes are taken for granted, our issues are taken for granted.\u201d\n\nThe chamber plans to develop an issues questionnaire for the candidates to fill out. The group will publish those responses in a voter\u2019s guide ahead of the two party primaries in February.\n\n\u201cWe hope black voters will keep an open mind and consider both parties. Yes, including even voting in the Republican presidential primary,\u201d Gilchrist said.\n\nThe S.C. African American Chamber of Commerce dates to 2011 and has 1,750 members.\n\nLegislature unproductive? House Speaker blames the Senate\n\nGovernment isn\u2019t known for its rapid pace, but things have been slow in Columbia by any standard.\n\nThe blame? House Speaker Jay Lucas says it lies with the so-called deliberative body \u2014 the S.C. Senate. By any standard, senators have been moving at a positively glacial pace.\n\nLucas took the well for a rare speech on the issue last week. \u201cOver the last few months we\u2019ve rolled up our sleeves, we\u2019ve put in the hours to move our state forward,\u201d Lucas told his House colleagues. \u201cUnfortunately, I can\u2019t make the same statement regarding our friends across the hall.\u201d\n\nRegarding ethics reform, a top priority, Lucas said: \u201cSitting in the Senate lies dozens and dozens of unaddressed bills. We made it easy on the Senate.\u201d\n\nHe also said senators should address transportation funding \u2014 another House bill that hasn\u2019t yet passed the Senate.\n\nMany senators have also been frustrated by the slow pace but have also complained about the quality of the House bills.\n\nState\u2019s sole female senator calls for more \u2018wise women\u2019 in the chamber\n\nSen. Katrina Shealy, R-Lexington, burned her fellow legislators on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI was at a press conference this morning, and I heard somebody say that they wanted three wise men to step forward,\u201d Shealy said on the floor. \u201cIf we had more wise women in here, we probably wouldn\u2019t be having this roads problem.\u201d\n\nShealy was referring to a comment by Majority Leader Sen. Harvey Peeler, R-Gaffney, during a news conference on Thursday. Flanked by about 20 Senate Republicans, Peeler asked Shealy to step back to allow for the \u201cthree wise men\u201d to step forward to answer reporters\u2019 questions about a new roads funding proposal introduced Thursday.\n\nThough Shealy said she knew Peeler was not trying to insult her \u2014 she said he meant for the one wise woman to stand back and the three men to step forward \u2014 she still wanted to clarify that if more women stood in the chamber South Carolina\u2019s roads wouldn\u2019t have reached such a deplorable state in the first place.\n\nShealy is the only female senator in the state Senate.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Graham leaving Air Force ahead of run for commander in chief, News, \r\nNewsPolitics, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "U.S. Sen.
