Ed Markey.\n\n\u201cNow, more than ever, Republicans need to connect with the voters in Massachusetts and clearly communicate to them that the Republican Party is the party of working people, that the Republican Party is the party that will protect the middle class, that the Republican Party is the party that cares about the needy and disadvantaged,\u201d Addivinola wrote in a message to supporters announcing his candidacy. \u201cWe have better solutions to help people improve their lives and put our country on the road to prosperity.\u201d\n\nAddivinola joins Republican Hopkinton selectman Brian Herr and independent Millbury resident Bruce Skarin in challenging Markey in the November 2014 election.\n\n\n\nAddivinola is an attorney and former biomedical researcher who owns an educational publishing company. He lives in Boston and grew up in Malden.\n\nIn his last campaign, Addivinola talked about his opposition to the Affordable Care Act and the need to increase government transparency. He wants to cut government spending and lower the individual and corporate tax rates.\n\nAddivinola ran for the U.S. House in 2013, trying to win the 5th District seat that Markey vacated when he won the Senate seat. He won the Republican primary but lost the general election in a landslide to Democrat Katherine Clark. He ran for the U.S. House in 2012, but lost in the Republican primary. He also lost races for state Senate in 2010 and Boston city council in 2013.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "2014-elections, 2014-senate-race, edward-markey, frank-addivinola, news", "title": "Republican Frank Addivinola launches campaign for U.S. Senate seat held by Ed Markey", "og": {"site_name": "masslive.com", "description": "Addivinola recently lost a race for U.S. House to Democrat Katherine Clark.
