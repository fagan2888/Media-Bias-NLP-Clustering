Trent Franks, lead sponsor of the bill along with Rep. Marsha Blackburn, Tennessee Republican, said the reporting requirement was \u201cobviously aimed at making sure other women are protected against the same monster.\u201d\n\nThe pain-capable bill will be brought up at a later time, Rep. Christopher Smith, New Jersey Republican, said Wednesday evening.\n\nThe No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2015 to be considered Thursday is sponsored by Mr. Smith; it would prohibit federal funding for abortions, including in health insurance, except for cases of rape, incest and endangerment of the life of the mother.\n\nA Republican vote on the \u201cpain-capable\u201d bill was intended to occur on Jan. 22 because of its \u201csymbolism,\u201d Mr. Franks said.\n\nThe bill is intended to prohibit abortions after 20 weeks of gestation, when fetuses seem to react to painful stimuli. Exceptions could be made under extenuating circumstances, such as life-threatening complications for the pregnant woman or if the pregnancy was caused by a rape or incest that had been reported to an authority.\n\nThe American people are \u201coverwhelmingly with us\u201d on this effort of limiting these late-term abortions, which number about 18,000 every year, Mr. Franks told The Washington Times.\n\nRallying behind bills\n\nThe vote gives us \u201ceven more reason to rally\u201d with hundreds of thousands of people who celebrate life, said Jeanne Monahan-Mancini, president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund.\n\nBut other pro-life supporters were dismayed. \u201cGOP wimp out on 20-week abortion ban?\u201d tweeted the Stanek report, led by nurse Jill Stanek.\n\nTony Perkins, president of Family Research Council, said the \u201creporting\u201d part of the \u201cpain\u201d bill was necessary to avoid a \u201chuge loophole.\u201d He urged supporters to call Congress all night and in the morning to vote on the bill.\n\nLiberal opposition\n\nNews of the switch on bills drew applause from pro-choice groups. \u201cIt\u2019s so unpopular even their own members won\u2019t support it,\u201d Planned Parenthood tweeted Wednesday night.\n\nEven before Wednesday night\u2019s surprising move, opponents had already rallied to denounce the \u201cpain\u201d bill.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House announced that it would veto the pain-capable unborn child abortion bill as \u201can assault on a woman\u2019s right to choose\u201d to have an abortion.\n\nPro-choice members of Congress condemned the bill, saying it disregarded tragic, late-in-pregnancy reasons for abortion as well as the fact that many cases of rape and incest are not reported.\n\n\u201cThis dangerous legislation is going nowhere,\u201d Sen. Barbara Boxer, California Democrat, told a pro-choice rally in the Capitol on Wednesday.\n\nA legal right means nothing if it\u2019s not enforced, said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Democrat, who with Sen. Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin Democrat, reintroduced a bill called the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 bill would overturn most of the burgeoning number of state restrictions on abortion, prohibiting such laws as bans on abortions by gestational age, local hospital-admitting requirements for abortion doctors and pre-abortion waiting periods.\n\n\u201cRoe v. Wade is threatened every day\u201d in legislatures and in the courts, said Mr. Blumenthal. \u201cRather than being on the defensive, we\u2019re going to be on the offensive.\u201d\n\nIlyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said her organization and other groups such as American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, CREDO, the National Women\u2019s Health Network, UltraViolet, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the National Abortion Federation were set to deliver to Congress the signatures of 140,000 women who oppose the abortion ban introduced by Republicans.\n\nPro-life priorities\n\nLeaders of the National Right to Life Committee said Wednesday that the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act was one of two legislative priorities.\n\n\u201cIn the new Congress, every member of the House and Senate will go on record on whether to permit the continued killing of pain-capable unborn children,\u201d Douglas Johnson, federal legislative director of the right to life committee, said in a media briefing.\n\nAnother National Right to Life Committee priority is legislation prohibiting the \u201cdismemberment\u201d of an unborn child, which means that certain abortion procedures \u2014 again those common later in pregnancy \u2014 would be outlawed.\n\nA Kansas lawmaker has promised to introduce the first of these bills this month. Representatives for the National Right to Life Committee and their allies say the measure is being discussed with lawmakers in other states.\n\nAn estimated 56 million abortions have been performed since the 1973 Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton rulings, according to multiple survey sources including the Guttmacher Institute, a respected source of abortion data.\n\nMarch-related events\n\nThe March, first held on Jan. 22, 1974, \u201cis the single largest annual civil rights demonstration,\u201d said Deirdre McQuade, a communications official at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which is involved in a number of religious events held in conjunction with the march.\n\nPro-life and pro-choice advocates are vying for public attention this week via social media, ads, speakers, conferences and campaigns.\n\nAt 8:30 a.m. Thursday, more than a dozen pro-life leaders will join online supporters for the 10th ProLifeCon at the Family Research Council.\n\nWith pro-life majorities in the House and Senate, legislative momentum at the state level and increasing identification with the pro-life movement, organizers said 2015 is a year for hope.\n\nThe 21st annual National Prayer Service also will be held Thursday, with a Mass at 7:30 a.m. and an interdenominational service at 8:30 a.m. at the DAR Constitution Hall. Organizers include the National Pro-life Religious Council, Priests for Life, and Faith and Action.\n\nThe March for Life begins with a rally around noon on the National Mall followed by a peaceful walk to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has numerous events: Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley of Boston, head of its committee on pro-life activities, was scheduled to be the principal celebrant at an evening Mass Wednesday, which began an all-night National Prayer Vigil for Life.\n\nArchbishop Joseph E. Kurtz of Louisville, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, was scheduled to celebrate the closing Mass Thursday morning.\n\nWhen marchers reach the Supreme Court, speakers with the Silent No More Awareness Campaign will introduce their \u201cShockwaves\u201d outreach and healing campaign, which is aimed at grandparents, siblings, would-be fathers and others who participated in or were affected by an abortion.\n\nPro-life victories\n\nThe federal bills come on the heels of several years of abortion-restricting measures, with 231 such laws enacted since 2011, researchers with the Guttmacher Institute said in a report issued this month. This tally stands in stark contrast to the 1990s and early 2000s, when fewer than 20 anti-abortion measures passed in a typical year.\n\nPro-life activists also have rejoiced in the steadily diminishing abortion numbers and abortion clinics.\n\nIn 1990, there were 1.6 million abortions, whereas today there are about 1 million, Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said in a New Year\u2019s statement that also lauded the November election results as more opportunities to enact state and federal laws this year.\n\nAnother pro-life group, Operation Rescue, said the number of surgical abortion facilities has fallen from a peak of more than 2,100 in 1991 to 551 in 2014. Another 188 facilities provide only medication or chemical abortions, and more clinics could close this year once courts clear lawsuits blocking clinic regulations from going into effect, said Troy Newman, president of Operation Rescue.\n\nWith such anti-abortion provisions passed in states in recent years, it is increasingly likely that Roe will become \u201ca broken promise for more women,\u201d Kalpana Krishnamurthy, policy director of Forward Together, said on a recent press call.\n\n\u201cWe firmly believe that this is the time to stand up and fight back,\u201d she said, noting that a campaign called \u201cAll Above All\u201d has been building support for abortion rights with people, especially young women, throughout the country.\n\nPro-choice activists also will be at the Supreme Court, led by the Feminist Majority Foundation and National Organization for Women.\n\nIn their outreach, especially to young adults, groups such as Advocates for Youth and NARAL Pro-Choice America are stepping up the personal narratives around abortion, giving women ways to explain why they don\u2019t regret their abortions and why abortions late in pregnancy are needed.\n\n\u201cAfter 42 years, the real question we ask today is, \u2018Is Roe a reality for all,\u2019\u201d asked Kate Stewart, executive vice president for public affairs at Advocates for Youth.\n\n\u201cSimply and resoundingly, the answer is \u2018no,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cA legal right to abortion is meaningless if it\u2019s been restricted to the point that it\u2019s out of reach.\u201d\n\nPublic opinion\n\nAs a nation, Americans remain divided on abortion: 47 percent describe their views as \u201cpro-choice\u201d and 46 percent say they are \u201cpro-life,\u201d said a Gallup Poll conducted in May.\n\nThe pro-choice support is actually much stronger, said Ms. Hogue of NARAL Pro-Choice America. In other polls, people may say they are personally opposed to abortion, but seven in 10 will say they don\u2019t want the government to intervene in another woman\u2019s right to choose \u2014 \u201cand 70 percent is a clear majority,\u201d she said.\n\nTo Ms. Monahan-Mancini, two things should help \u201cmove the needle\u201d toward the pro-life side.\n\nScience and technology are continuing to show the humanity of the unborn child, at ever-younger ages, she said.\n\nIn addition, young pro-lifers \u2014 including those pouring into Washington for Thursday\u2019s march \u2014 are enthusiastic without being cynical. \u201cThey really believe that they are going to bring this human rights abuse to an end,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2022 Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 42nd annual March for Life protests against the Supreme Court rulings that made abortion a constitutional right will deliberately coincide with a House vote on a bill that the pro-life movement likes \u2014 but not the one they were hoping for this week.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The 42nd annual March for Life protests against the Supreme Court rulings that made abortion a constitutional right will deliberately coincide with a House vote on a bill that the pro-life movement likes \u2014 but not the one they were hoping for this week.", "title": "March for Life will coincide with House vote on abortion", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/21/march-for-life-will-coincide-with-house-vote-on-ab/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/21/1_212015_ap266221458396-28201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/21/1_212015_ap266221458396-28201.jpg", "description": "The 42nd annual March for Life protests against the Supreme Court rulings that made abortion a constitutional right will deliberately coincide with a House vote on a bill that the pro-life movement li", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "March for Life will coincide with House vote on abortion"}, "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Supreme Court, Jeanne Monahan Mancini, House"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ec7\"", "article_summary": "On Tuesday, the White House announced that it would veto the pain-capable unborn child abortion bill as \u201can assault on a woman\u2019s right to choose\u201d to have an abortion.\nRepresentatives for the National Right to Life Committee and their allies say the measure is being discussed with lawmakers in other states.\nSEE ALSO: House nixes fetal-pain abortion vote, substitutes anti-Obamacare bill insteadSome Republicans balked because many cases of rape and incest are not officially reported.\nPro-life prioritiesLeaders of the National Right to Life Committee said Wednesday that the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act was one of two legislative priorities.\nAnother National Right to Life Committee priority is legislation prohibiting the \u201cdismemberment\u201d of an unborn child, which means that certain abortion procedures \u2014 again those common later in pregnancy \u2014 would be outlawed."}
