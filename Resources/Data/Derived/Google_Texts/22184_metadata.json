The increase lasted two years and expired on Jan. 1.\n\nA state reduction in Medi-Cal reimbursement for primary care providers hit on the same day. The 10% rate cut, approved by the California Legislature in 2011, was held up while the matter was thrashed out in court. Last year, the courts upheld the state\u2019s right to reduce provider reimbursement and health care officials decided to implement the cutbacks in phases. The last phase, which includes primary care providers, went into effect Jan. 1.\n\nThe federal drop is much more precipitous, but it\u2019s the combination of the two rate decreases that has Francisco Silva concerned. Silva, vice president of legal affairs at the California Medical Association, said primary care providers who see a lot of Medi-Cal patients will have to scale back or stop seeing those beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s about 60% less, when you combine both cuts,\u201d Silva said. \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned. It\u2019s really concerning for the sustainability of those practices with a large Medi-Cal patient base. When you look at the financial solvency data \u2026 there\u2019s a strong correlation between solvency and patient load.\u201d\n\nSince providers lose so much on each Medi-Cal patient, they can\u2019t afford to care for too many of them, Silva said.\n\n\u201cThese cuts will have a devastating impact on the ability of doctors to see those patients,\u201d he said.\n\nState health officials have said they\u2019re taking the necessary steps to make sure enough providers continue to care for Medi-Cal patients, according to Anthony Cava, information officer at the Department of Health Care Services, which oversees the Medi-Cal program.\n\n\u201cDHCS has not encountered significant Medi-Cal patient access issues in the fee-for-service program, and we are continually monitoring access to ensure members are able to receive care,\u201d Cava said. \u201cIf access issues are identified, DHCS takes measures to resolve the issues, which could include revisiting the provider payment reductions. Similarly, in our managed care program, DHCS has not encountered significant issues with network adequacy.\u201d\n\nAccording to UCLA researcher Dylan Roby, there may not be an immediate drop in the number of Medi-Cal providers, but a gradual decline is likely.\n\n\u201cThe federal reduction, that\u2019s a pretty significant change. The [primary care] providers are getting the higher rate, so they\u2019re the ones who are going to feel it the most on Jan. 1,\u201d Roby said. \u201cWhen they now realize what Medi-Cal actually pays, that\u2019s a pretty significant change.\u201d\n\nNo one knows the impact of the cuts, Roby said, but he said he could hazard a guess.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a huge change immediately. But anytime you see a downward movement in rates, provider involvement can drop,\u201d Roby said. \u201cThere are certainly side effects with a rate reduction like this. Just like you saw a bump up in provider involvement when there was the rate bump, you\u2019ll see something similar [the other way] if you cut.\u201d\n\nReductions Hit Managed Care Differently\n\nThe state cut hits fee-for-service providers a little differently than providers under Medi-Cal managed care.\n\nAccording to DHCS officials, the state now has about 80% of its Medi-Cal beneficiaries under managed care plans. Those managed care providers aren\u2019t directly reimbursed by Medi-Cal \u2014 they\u2019re reimbursed by health plans \u2014 so the bulk of providers in California won\u2019t feel the 10% cut directly.\n\nBut health plans will, said Nicole Kasabian Evans, vice president of communications at the California Association of Health Plans. The 10% cut will include the \u201cactuarial equivalent\u201d amount in payment to managed care plans, according to state officials.\n\nEvans said the cut is really just part of a larger issue, since California already had some of the lowest Medicaid reimbursement rates in the nation even before the latest reduction.\n\n\u201cTo properly serve this population, we need to address the underfunding of Medi-Cal,\u201d Evans said.\n\nWhen Medi-Cal is underfunded, she said, providers rely more and more heavily on private-pay insurance to basically subsidize the low public-pay rates.\n\n\u201cThe cost shift is dramatic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have some of the lowest reimbursement rates in the nation. We\u2019re not keeping pace for those reimbursements. We need to start the discussion to start to \u2026 make progress in the other direction.\u201d\n\nThat will be a dicey conversation to raise in the Capitol Building, since the expansion of Medi-Cal to millions more Californians equates into more dollars committed to Medi-Cal overall, even if the rates are lower than the rest of the country.\n\nMore than 11 million Californians are on Medi-Cal \u2014 more than 30% of the state\u2019s population. Raising rates by any amount, given that huge pool of recipients, would be an expensive proposition.\n\nEvans said that may be true but increases are necessary because the system will break if too much torque is applied to the private health insurance industry.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go backward any longer,\u201d she said.\n\nRoby said the reimbursement reductions to Medi-Cal managed care plans likely will eventually sift down to the providers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible the health plans could potentially say, \u2018We need a robust workforce and we can\u2019t just pass on this reduction.\u2019 But it certainly would put downward pressure on rates. If fee-for-service rates are lowered, so go capitated rates,\u201d Roby said.\n\n\u201cWe know overall, it will filter down to all providers, but it might not be at the same level,\u201d Roby said.\n\nDirect Cut for Fee-for-Service Providers\n\nFor fee-for-service providers, many already working on a thin margin, the 10% cutback could tip them into insolvency, Silva said.\n\nAlthough fee-for-service providers are most directly affected by the cut, the state is looking at a potential access nightmare on the managed care side, Silva said.\n\n\u201cUnder fee-for-service we can go to the state and say, \u2018We need access.\u2019 Now they\u2019re referring us to the plans, saying it\u2019s their responsibility,\u201d Silva said.\n\n\u201cThat 10% cut is going to have a significant effect over the long run,\u201d he said. \u201cPatients are going to have to wait months, and travel farther, to get the care they need.\u201d\n\nSilva said Congress instituted the two-year bump in primary care provider reimbursement rates after a lengthy investigation. \u201cThey concluded the Medicare rate is the sweet spot, where providers aren\u2019t losing money,\u201d Silva said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they concluded with the primary care rate bump.\u201d\n\nSilva predicted health plans\u2019 provider networks likely \u201cwill get even skinnier.\u201d Providers already lose money with Medi-Cal patients, and now they\u2019ll just lose a little more \u2014 and likely see fewer of them, he said.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s approach has been to wait and see, to wait for something bad to happen,\u201d Silva said. \u201cThis will definitely have an impact on some physicians. Some will continue, some will not, some will stop seeing new patients, some will close their practices, some will practice in a different environment. But yes, you will see an effect, that\u2019s definite.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>The two-year federal bump in Medi-Cal reimbursements for primary care providers ended Jan. 1 -- the same day the state started paying the same group 10% less.
