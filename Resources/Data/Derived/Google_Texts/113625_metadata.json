Here are three ways Planned Parenthood is benefiting at the expense of the American taxpayer.\n\n1. State funding\n\nCurrently, 17 states directly fund elective abortions under Medicaid, the federal health care program for low income Americans. The Guttmacher Institute reports that Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia, use public funding to pay for abortion procedures.\n\nWhile the 1976 Hyde Amendment prevents federal taxpayer dollars from funding abortions through Medicaid\u2014with the exception of cases involving rape, incest, and life of the mother\u2014the program is jointly funded by both the federal and state governments. The 17 states listed above, however, have expanded the definition to include most elective abortions.\n\n2. Obamacare\n\nDespite broken promises by members of Congress and the President, Americans are subsidizing elective abortions and Planned Parenthood under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office reported in September of 2014 that 1,036 health insurance exchange plans under Obamacare illegally cover elective abortions. The health care law mandates insurers offering coverage for elective abortions to collect a minimum surcharge of $12 a year from individuals, which is then placed into a separate account to pay for abortion procedures. This rule, however, is being ignored by insurers, according to the GAO.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act sends funding to health insurance plans that cover abortion, but also creates new paths of funding for abortion giant Planned Parenthood through its involvement in the assister and navigator programs.\n\n3. Federal funding\n\nForty-one percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual revenue\u2014$528 million\u2014 came in the form of government grants and reimbursements, according to the group\u2019s 2013-14 annual report. These streams of funding for Planned Parenthood come through various programs including Medicaid and Title X.\n\nWhile Medicaid and Title X are not directly paying for abortions at the federal level, these programs ensure that Planned Parenthood continues to receive over $500 million in taxpayer funding every year.\n\nAs the nation\u2019s largest abortion chain, Planned Parenthood commits over 320,000 abortions annually, and is the leading abortion advocacy group with tremendous political clout. Because money is fungible, the taxpayer dollars that Planned Parenthood brings in allows them to cover overhead for centers that perform abortions. The taxpayer funds free up Planned Parenthood to direct their donations to grow their abortion services, facility reach, and abortion political advocacy. Additionally, once Planned Parenthood earns money for any service, it can freely invest those earnings into abortion activities.\n\nDespite the ways taxpayer dollars flow into the coffers of Big Abortion, Planned Parenthood and its allies continue to fight for taxpayer funding without restriction through the repeal of the Hyde Amendment.\n\nA report from the Government Accountability Office showed that in just three years, Planned Parenthood received $1.5 billion in combined federal and state funding. Six abortion groups received $481 million in federal dollars and $1.2 billion in state and federal funding from 2010-12, with Planned Parenthood receiving the largest share.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s long legacy of scandal \u2014selling baby body parts, covering up child sexual abuse, aiding child sex-traffickers, and displaying willingness to perform abortions based on race and sex, and supporting infanticide\u2014 renders it unfit for taxpayer money.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's no secret that taxpayers are footing the bill for Planned Parenthood and Big Abortion.", "og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "It's no secret that taxpayers are footing the bill for Planned Parenthood and Big Abortion.", "title": "3 ways taxpayers are funding abortion at Planned Parenthood", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 672, "identifier": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/planned-parenthood-symbol.jpg", "height": 372}, "updated_time": "2015-11-06T12:26:20-04:00", "url": "http://liveactionnews.org/3-ways-taxpayers-are-funding-planned-parenthood/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's no secret that taxpayers are footing the bill for Planned Parenthood and Big Abortion.", "creator": "@Becky_Yeh", "image": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/planned-parenthood-symbol.jpg", "title": "3 ways taxpayers are funding abortion at Planned Parenthood", "site": "@liveactionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"admins": 159900244, "pages": 49651563727}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveactionnewsonline", "section": "Analysis", "tag": "Title X", "published_time": "2015-11-05T13:06:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-06T12:26:20-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Despite the ways taxpayer dollars flow into the coffers of Big Abortion, Planned Parenthood and its allies continue to fight for taxpayer funding without restriction through the repeal of the Hyde Amendment.\nSix abortion groups received $481 million in federal dollars and $1.2 billion in state and federal funding from 2010-12, with Planned Parenthood receiving the largest share.\nThe Affordable Care Act sends funding to health insurance plans that cover abortion, but also creates new paths of funding for abortion giant Planned Parenthood through its involvement in the assister and navigator programs.\nThe taxpayer funds free up Planned Parenthood to direct their donations to grow their abortion services, facility reach, and abortion political advocacy.\nAs the nation\u2019s largest abortion chain, Planned Parenthood commits over 320,000 abortions annually, and is the leading abortion advocacy group with tremendous political clout."}
