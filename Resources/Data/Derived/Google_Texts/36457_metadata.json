Christopher Haga\u2019s gun collection was seized, and he was charged with crimes after he was mistakenly linked to a theft of assault weapons from a Fresno-area military base.\n\nThe National Rifle Association then lent legal assistance to both men as part of its aggressive legal and political campaign to blunt gun controls across the nation.\n\nEmboldened by a seminal U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2008 that upstanding Americans have the fundamental right to keep guns in their homes, the NRA has involved itself in hundreds of legal cases, many in California.\n\nThat case \u201cunleashed a torrent of litigation,\u201d said University of California, Los Angeles Law School professor Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment expert.\n\nMuch of it is either started by the NRA or supported by the organization, which offers financial assistance and legal help to people embroiled in lawsuits and legal trouble because they own guns.\n\nWinkler said the latest legal battle over the Second Amendment centers on expanding the right to carry guns outside the home, which is why the NRA is representing Peruta and several other gun owners who are challenging restrictions blocking permission to carry concealed firearms in public.\n\nPeruta filed a lawsuit in 2009 after the San Diego County sheriff rejected his application for a concealed-weapons permit because Peruta failed to show he had a \u201cgood cause\u201d to carry a gun outside his home. Peruta owns a motocross track in Connecticut, but he and his wife spend many months each year in San Diego living in their recreational vehicle.\n\nPeruta said he wanted permission to carry a gun weapon for protection, but the sheriff and California law said he needed a better reason, such as that his occupation exposes him to robbery.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a hunter. I\u2019m not a collector or a target shooter,\u201d Peruta said. \u201cI\u2019m not a gun crazy. But I do want to protect myself.\u201d\n\nAfter a federal judge refused to toss out the lawsuit in 2010, the NRA took over the case for Peruta. \u201cThe NRA is the 800-pound gorilla in this fight,\u201d he said.\n\nIn February, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s 2008 ruling, struck down California\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement, ruling that self-defense was a good enough reason to issue a concealed-weapons permit.\n\nThe California attorney general and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence are seeking to overturn that decision after San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said he would abide by the court decision.\n\n\u201cThe issue is important: As a result of the decision, residents and visitors will be subjected to the increased risk posed by the carrying of loaded, hidden handguns on the streets of San Diego County by persons with no good cause to do so,\u201d a lawyer for the Brady organization wrote in a court filing seeking permission to formally oppose Peruta and the NRA in an appeal.\n\nThe 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut \u2014where a gunman used an assault rifle to kill 20 children and six others\u2014 led some and states to enact laws banning high-capacity magazines enacted by cities and states, and the NRA countered with lawsuits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NRA\u2019s quest to expand gun rights takes it to court", "title": "NRA\u2019s quest to expand gun rights takes it to court", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "NRA\u2019s quest to expand gun rights takes it to court", "title": "NRA\u2019s quest to expand gun rights takes it to court", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/05/nras_quest_to_expand_gun_rights_takes_it_to_court/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/nras-courtroom-battles.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NRA\u2019s quest to expand gun rights takes it to court", "title": "NRA\u2019s quest to expand gun rights takes it to court", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/nras-courtroom-battles.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Paul Elias", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe604e\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsThe San Diego County sheriff denied Edward Peruta a permit to carry a concealed weapon.\nPeruta owns a motocross track in Connecticut, but he and his wife spend many months each year in San Diego living in their recreational vehicle.\nThe California attorney general and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence are seeking to overturn that decision after San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said he would abide by the court decision.\nThe National Rifle Association then lent legal assistance to both men as part of its aggressive legal and political campaign to blunt gun controls across the nation.\nChristopher Haga\u2019s gun collection was seized, and he was charged with crimes after he was mistakenly linked to a theft of assault weapons from a Fresno-area military base."}
