After visiting with the Broncos on Monday, center Will Montgomery left Dove Valley without a contract.

The two sides negotiated but couldn’t reach an agreement. The Broncos will continue their search for an interior offensive lineman who can replace left guard Zane Beadles, who became a free agent and signed a six-year, $30 million deal with Jacksonville.

Had the Broncos signed Montgomery, who started all 16 games in each of the previous three seasons with the Washington Redskins, he would have been the leading candidate to become the starting center while Manny Ramirez or right tackle Orlando Franklin could have moved to left guard.

The Broncos can now either try to sign another free-agent center like Samson Satele or Brian De La Punte, or try to sign an older guard like Travelle Wharton or Willie Colon.

Or the Broncos can use their No. 31 overall pick on Colorado State’s Weston Richburg, who is considered by many to be the best center in draft.
