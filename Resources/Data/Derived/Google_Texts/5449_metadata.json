The bill came just days after 110 House Dems sent a letter urging the chamber\u2019s leaders to end a longstanding ban through the Dickey Amendments on federal funding for gun research study as a health care issue.\n\n\u201cSome of the smartest problem-solvers in our nation work for our government, doing critical research,\u201d said the bill\u2019s sponsor, U.S. Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.), in a statement. \u201cMany are investigating health issues at the CDC. Our nation faces a tremendous challenge in gun violence, but these brilliant Americans are not allowed to help that effort.\u201d\n\nHonda, who has in the past offered up dead-on-arrival legislation to restrict body armor sales to civilians, allow doctors to quiz their patients on guns, and increase restrictions on homemade firearms, blamed the National Rifle Association for Thursday\u2019s vote.\n\n\u201cWe are running into a fight we absolutely must win, with one hand tied behind our back,\u201d said the Silicon Valley lawmaker. \u201cNot one American would have their right to bear arms taken away if this law passed, yet not one Republican disobeyed their NRA masters to support this logical step.\u201d\n\nHonda\u2019s legislation, HR 3926, would strike protections in the Public Health Service Act barring federal funds for some types of studies on gun violence, which the bill describes as being an \u201cepidemic.\u201d\n\nFurther, the proposal includes a paragraph that uses the Affordable Care Act to codify a health care worker\u2019s ability to ask patients questions about ownership, possession, use, or storage of a firearm or ammunition in the home as well as counsel them on gun safety. This could shortcut federal court decisions in cases such as Florida\u2019s Docs vs. Glocks case where states have sought to tell physicians that gun questions were, in most cases, outside the scope of health care.\n\nThe NRA feels the government should not pursue gun research as a health care issue funded through the CDC.\n\n\u201cAmericans should be able to trust an organization that claims its goal is an unbiased approach to public health,\u201d wrote Chris Cox, head of the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action in an editorial last December. \u201cThat\u2019s why the gun control agenda they promoted in the 1990s was so offensive, and that\u2019s why the NRA is firmly against allowing the same agency to pursue the same agenda now.\u201d\n\nGun control lobby groups, including the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Campaign, back Honda\u2019s efforts and were dismayed at this week\u2019s continued rejection in Congress.\n\n\u201cIf this were any other issue \u2013 food poisoning, seat belts, anything else \u2013 this would be a non-issue, which speaks to the corporate gun lobby\u2019s stranglehold on Washington,\u201d said Brady President Dan Gross. \u201cCongressman Honda is listening to the voices of Americans who have had enough.\u201d\n\nHR 3926 remains in committee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A party line vote by GOP lawmakers blocked a fourth effort Thursday to bring a bill favored by gun control groups to fund federal research by the CDC to the floor", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Guns.com", "description": "A party line vote by GOP lawmakers blocked a fourth effort Thursday to bring a bill favored by gun control groups to fund federal research by the CDC to the floor", "title": "Republicans smoke House vote on CDC funds for gun research", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://14544-presscdn-0-64.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Republicans.smoke_.House_.vote_.on_.funds_.to_.study_.gun_.violence.jpg", "url": "http://www.guns.com/2016/02/12/republicans-smoke-house-vote-on-funds-to-study-gun-violence/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://14544-presscdn-0-64.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Republicans.smoke_.House_.vote_.on_.funds_.to_.study_.gun_.violence.jpg", "description": "A party line vote by GOP lawmakers blocked a fourth effort Thursday to bring a bill favored by gun control groups to fund federal research by the CDC to the floor", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Republicans smoke House vote on CDC funds for gun research"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 531059170241246}, "article": {"section": "Gun Laws", "tag": "Wollschlaeger v.
