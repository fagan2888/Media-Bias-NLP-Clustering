Former CEO of Hewlett-Packard and likely presidential candidate Carly Fiorina criticized the Democratic Party’s platform of abortion on demand during a recent speech.

Serving as the mistress of ceremonies at the Susan B. Anthony List’s Campaign for Life Gala in Washington, D.C. last week, Fiorina praised the organization and its supporters for their contributions to the pro-life movement.

Fiorina said that while some call the Republican Party’s pro-life platform “extreme,” the Democratic Party’s platform of abortion on demand is hardly mainstream:

Here is what it says: Any abortion, anytime, at any point in a woman’s pregnancy, for any reason, to be paid for by taxpayers. Now, there are Democrats who want to add, ‘to be performed by a non-doctor.’ And this policy has been succinctly summarized by Democrats, such as Barbara Boxer, as ‘it isn’t a life until it leaves the hospital.’ Do you agree with that? Nobody agrees with that! Even people who think they’re pro-choice don’t agree with that.

She pointed out that tattoo parlors are more “rigorously and routinely inspected” than abortion clinics, and signs in bars caution that the consumption of alcohol is harmful during pregnancy.

“Hazardous to what, or to whom?” she asked.

She encouraged pro-lifers to engage in “persuasive conversations” with those who support abortion “to get them to think–perhaps in a new way.”

“A woman facing a difficult choice always deserves our empathy and our support, never our judgement or our condemnation,” said Fiorina. “But if we can engage in a reasonable conversation with people we can change people’s minds.”
