The self-described \u201cbigger girl\u201d refused to complete the task; instead she packs a powerful one-two punch in a handwritten two-page essay \u2014 shared on Facebook by a proud family friend \u2014 blasting the shortcomings of BMI and taking a stand for body positivity.\n\n\"Now, I'm not going to even open my laptop to calculate my BMI. And I'll tell you why. Ever since I can remember, I've been a 'bigger girl' and I'm completely fine with that,\" Embry, a softball player on two teams, wrote. \"I'm strong and powerful. When you put a softball or a bat in my hand, they are considered lethal weapons.\"\n\nTessa Embry was assigned a take-home assignment asking her to calculate her BMI and give a definition for the term. Facebook/MacLeodCartoons\n\nThe assignment triggered the student athlete's response because just weeks earlier Embry was categorized as obese by her gym teacher based on her BMI, her mother Mindi Embry told Today. This news left the teen considerably upset, so her mother set up an appointment with a doctor who, after running some tests and checking blood sugar and cholesterol levels, deemed the teen healthy.\n\n\"The doctor told her, 'You have a good diet, you're very active, you're very strong. You're good to go. I give you a clean bill of health.' And that empowered her,\" Mindi said. \"I think she thought, 'I've got my doctor behind me. I've got my parents behind me. That (BMI) really doesn't matter.\"\n\nSo when this assignment came around, Embry had officially had it. \"She said, 'I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to put up with this,' and she asked me, 'Mom, is it OK if I get an 'F' on this assignment?' And I said absolutely,\" Embry recalled.\n\nIn the essay, the teen goes on to say that BMI is an outdated mode of measurement for gauging health, because it fails to discern between bone, fat and muscle proportions. This is a particularly assertive stance for Embry to take with her teacher who will give her a grade, but research says the young girl is on to something. In fact, studies have shown that using BMI to measure health miscategorizes more than 54 million Americans as \u201cunhealthy,\u201d and many others question its accuracy.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "middle, school, girl, pens, short, essay, explaining, why, she, refuses, calculate, bmi, asserts", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Tessa Embry, 14, is taking a stand for body positivity.", "title": "This Middle School Girl Says Her BMI Is 'None Of Your Concern'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tessa-embry-middle-school-short-essay-bmi-body-positivity-381286", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/10/scale.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tessa Embry, 14, is taking a stand for body positivity.", "title": "This Middle School Girl Says Her BMI Is 'None Of Your Concern'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tessa-embry-middle-school-short-essay-bmi-body-positivity-381286", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/10/scale.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/10/scale.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-04-10T13:55:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-10T13:55:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Tessa Embry, 14, is taking a stand for body positivity."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde47\"", "article_summary": "Tessa Embry was assigned a take-home assignment asking her to calculate her BMI and give a definition for the term.\n\"Now, I'm not going to even open my laptop to calculate my BMI.\nEver since I can remember, I've been a 'bigger girl' and I'm completely fine with that,\" Embry, a softball player on two teams, wrote.\nAn Indiana eighth grader is making headlines for refusing to share her \u201cperfect\u201d BMI (body mass index).\nIn fact, studies have shown that using BMI to measure health miscategorizes more than 54 million Americans as \u201cunhealthy,\u201d and many others question its accuracy."}
