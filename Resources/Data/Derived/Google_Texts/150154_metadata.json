Popular food blogger and advocate Vani Hari released a petition Wednesday urging big-named American beer companies Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors to release a complete list of their ingredients.\n\nShe reached out to her followers via her personal blog, FoodBabe.com, urging supporters to sign her petition. \u201cNearly every other food and beverage provider is legally required to make this information available \u2014 yet these two companies, which collectively sell more than $75 billion in beers each year, have not,\u201d she writes on her blog. \u201cI grew concerned about the beer after discovering there is a long list of additives the government has approved for use in beer during an investigation last fall.\u201d\n\nAfter only one day of petitioning, she received over 46k signatures and caught the attention of Terri Vogt, vice president, communications for Anheuser-Busch. They released a statement to Hari saying, \u201cWe are working to list our beer ingredients on our website, just as you would see for other food and non-alcohol beverage producers ... We are beginning immediately, having incorporated this information earlier today on www.tapintoyourbeer.com for our flagship brands Budweiser and Bud Light, and will be listing this for our other brands in the coming days.\"\n\nIf you look at the websites of both Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors, you\u2019ll find only basic ingredients listed like this: \u201cWater, Barley Malt, Rice, Yeast, Hops (ingredient listing is consistent with the FD&C Act).\" The FD&C Act is the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which sets a standard for food, drugs, and cosmetics.\n\nHowever, the beer industry is not required by the federal government to disclose its ingredients, and they are not regulated by the FDA. Its governing body is the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). Hari points out other ingredients she said are found in beer: \u201cHigh fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors, stabilizers that are linked to intestinal inflammation, artificial colors \u2014 like caramel coloring, ingredients found in airplane deicing liquid, genetically modified ingredients, and even fish swim bladders are allowed in beer.\"\n\nI just want full disclosure,\" Hari told ABC news, \"not to change labels and go through government labels \u2014 just to disclose it online so everyone can see.\" Hari says that by being fully candid these beer companies will not lose customers. Instead, they\u2019ll lead a more open business.\n\n\"Coca Cola has kept their secret formula under lock and key for years,\" she said. \"However, Coca Cola also releases the full set of ingredients on their labels \u2014 something beer manufacturers have kept hidden for years and our government has neglected to mandate.\" The beer industry is a multi-million dollar business and is the most popular alcoholic beverage in America, according to a 2013 Gallup Poll.\n\n\"Just like dairy manufacturers pump cows with antibiotics and growth hormones, the beer companies should be up front about their processing and disclose that they are using fish bladders,\" Hari said.\n\nHari is the brain behind getting Kraft Foods to remove a harmful yellow dye from its macaroni, and Subway from removing a \u201cyoga mat\u201d ingredient, azodicarbonamide, from its breads. The self-proclaimed Food Babe hopes her voice will help change the way the food industry shares information with consumers.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "vani hari, food babe", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Vani Hari tackles another food industry giant, and this time she's making changes happen quicker than ever.", "title": "Under Pressure, Beer Company To List Complete Ingredient Lists [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nutrition-facts-beer-be-listed-anheuser-busch-website-after-food-bloggers-petition-against-companies", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/12/food-babe.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vani Hari tackles another food industry giant, and this time she's making changes happen quicker than ever.", "title": "Under Pressure, Beer Company To List Complete Ingredient Lists [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nutrition-facts-beer-be-listed-anheuser-busch-website-after-food-bloggers-petition-against-companies", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/12/food-babe.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/12/food-babe.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-06-12T18:16:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-13T11:42:34-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Vani Hari tackles another food industry giant, and this time she's making changes happen quicker than ever."}, "article_summary": "The self-proclaimed Food Babe hopes her voice will help change the way the food industry shares information with consumers.\nPopular food blogger and advocate Vani Hari released a petition Wednesday urging big-named American beer companies Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors to release a complete list of their ingredients.\nThe beer industry is a multi-million dollar business and is the most popular alcoholic beverage in America, according to a 2013 Gallup Poll.\nHari says that by being fully candid these beer companies will not lose customers.\nHowever, the beer industry is not required by the federal government to disclose its ingredients, and they are not regulated by the FDA."}
