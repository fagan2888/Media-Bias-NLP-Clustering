He also argues that the drug war doesn't explain black-on-black violence and ending it won't transform urban America in the way libertarians insist. His book lays out the case against the minimum wage in a chapter called \"Mandating Unemployment\" and he argues that especially among African Americans, an intact family unit is the best anti-poverty program available.\n\nAbout 20 minutes.\n\nProduced by Anthony L.

The black underclass continues to face many challenges, but they have to do with values and habits, not oppression from a manifestly unjust society. Blacks have become their own worst enemy.\u201d And liberal leaders, you go on to say, are essentially abetting that. What is the typical black experience and is there this fixation on the black underclass that no longer exists, or is representative, or what does it mean?\n\nJason Riley: Well, I don\u2019t know that there is a typical black experience, which is progress in and of itself. You have a big black middle class now, most blacks are not poor in this country. But the problems of the black underclass continue to dominate the discussion and rightly so, and they do continue to be representative of blackness writ large, so to speak. We need to talk about these problems and what I\u2019m talking about is culture. One of the reasons I wrote this book is because I think there is a hesitancy, particularly among those on the left, to discuss black culture. And I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to address those problems if we\u2019re afraid to talk about them.\n\n1:45 - Achievements of Civil Rights\n\nreason: And I want to get to this, you say, \u201cMuch more disturbing is that half a century after the civil rights battles were fought and won, liberalism remains much more interested in making excuses for blacks than in reevaluating efforts to help them.\u201d And you talk about the civil rights acts of 1964 and 1965 as \u201cliberalism at its best.\u201d Civil rights activism set the stage for those victories, what did they achieve?\n\nJason Riley: Well, the 1964 Act gets at legal discrimination in the country. The 1965 voting rights act makes voter registration possible and actual voting possible. They made this country a more just society and I think with Thurgood Marshall, Martin Luther King, and Rosa Parks, and the Freedom Riders and those folks, what they were fighting for was worth fighting for.\n\nreason: Absolutely necessary?\n\nJason Riley: Absolutely necessary, and all Americans can be happy that they made this country more just. Then you get Lyndon Johnson coming in and saying, \u201cthat\u2019s not enough. Equal opportunity is not enough. We need equal results.\u201d And I question whether that is a legitimate or a reasonable goal, since you don\u2019t see equal results among groups historically in America or anywhere else in the world. Maybe the best you can hope for from government is equal opportunity. Then it\u2019s up to those groups to take advantage of those opportunities.\n\nreason: There is no question that the black experience, with the possible exception of the Native Americans, is infinitely more punishing and oppressive of an experience. So it\u2019s not completely out of bounds that you would say, you know what, equal opportunity is not enough. I mean, it may be wrong, but you can understand the impulse.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/09/03/well-intended-policies-fail-black-americ", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "\"My beef with the black left is that they want to keep the focus on what government or Washington or politicians or whites in general can do for blacks,", "title": "Black Americans Failed by Good Intentions: Q/A with Jason Riley"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"My beef with the black left is that they want to keep the focus\non what government or Washington or politicians or whites\nin general can do for blacks, instead of what blacks can do for\nthemselves,\" says Jason\nRiley, author of&nbsp;Please\nStop Helping Us: How Liberals Make it Harder for Blacks to\nSucceed&nbsp;and editorial board member of the Wall\nStreet Journal.&nbsp;\nIn a wide-ranging conversation with Reason TV's Nick Gillespie,\nRiley praises the Civil Rights acts of the 1960s even as he takes\naim at affirmative action in", "title": "Black Americans Failed by Good Intentions: Q/A with Jason Riley", "creator": "@anthonylfisher", "site": "@reason", "player": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://reason.com/embed/reasontv/2014/09/03/well-intended-policies-fail-black-americ", "height": 360}, "card": "player"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Reasontv", "published_time": "2014-09-03T14:06:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/anthony-l-fisher"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb3e\"", "article_summary": "Jason Riley: Well, I don\u2019t know that there is a typical black experience, which is progress in and of itself.\nWhat is the typical black experience and is there this fixation on the black underclass that no longer exists, or is representative, or what does it mean?\nreason: There is no question that the black experience, with the possible exception of the Native Americans, is infinitely more punishing and oppressive of an experience.\nThe black underclass continues to face many challenges, but they have to do with values and habits, not oppression from a manifestly unjust society.\nBut the problems of the black underclass continue to dominate the discussion and rightly so, and they do continue to be representative of blackness writ large, so to speak."}
