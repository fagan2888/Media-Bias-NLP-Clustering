He is being held at the Middlesex County Adult Correction Center in North Brunswick on $170,000 bail.\n\nOn May 29, a Jeffrey Circle resident alerted police to two suspicious men in the neighborhood. When police arrived, they spotted a man sitting in the passenger seat of a green van parked on the street. As police exited the patrol car, a second man emerged from the side of a house down the street.\n\nThe man was ordered to stop, but instead he ran and got into the driver's seat of the van and fled onto Georges Road, police said.\n\nA screwdriver, gloves and pry marks were found at the home. Police also found a second home at which the alleged burglars had pried open a window. In both cases, police said, entry was not gained.\n\nThe green van was found abandoned two blocks away on Benjamin Court. Police identified Napolitano as the man seen running from the side of the home. Police also allegedly found evidence in the van linked to Napolitano.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1SiPAWs", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A Monmouth Junction man sought in connection with two house burglaries on Jeffrey Circle surrendered at police headquarters Monday.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "A Monmouth Junction man sought in connection with two house burglaries on Jeffrey Circle surrendered at police headquarters Monday.", "title": "Man sought in South Brunswick burglaries surrenders", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/middlesex-county/2015/06/15/man-sought-south-brunswick-burglaries-surrenders/71270376/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Monmouth Junction man sought in connection with two house burglaries on Jeffrey Circle surrendered at police headquarters Monday.", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7c52ffa07d2c98dfa3753766f21275ff6b3aa021/c=0-38-300-338&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/15/Bridgewater/B9317739308Z.1_20150615173717_000_G8NB3B3L5.1-0.jpg", "title": "Man sought in South Brunswick burglaries surrenders", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Eugene Napolitano, South Brunswick, burglaries, surrender"}, "article_summary": "Eugene Napolitano (Photo: ~Courtesy of South Brunswick Police Department)A man from the Monmouth Junction section sought in connection with two house burglaries on Jeffrey Circle surrendered at police headquarters Monday.\nThe surrender came five days after police announced they were looking for Eugene Napolitano, 50.\nAs police exited the patrol car, a second man emerged from the side of a house down the street.\nWhen police arrived, they spotted a man sitting in the passenger seat of a green van parked on the street.\nOn May 29, a Jeffrey Circle resident alerted police to two suspicious men in the neighborhood."}
