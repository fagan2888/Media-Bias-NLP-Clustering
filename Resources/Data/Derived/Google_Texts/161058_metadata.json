In addition to the new enrollees, about 1.15 million existing consumers re-upped this year, officials said, for a total of about 1.57 million.\n\nPeter Lee, executive director of Covered California, said about 37 percent of the new enrollees are young adults aged 18-34, up from 34 percent from last year. That\u2019s good news for exchange officials, because younger, healthier adults help subsidize coverage for older Californians.\n\n\u201cWe continue to have a broad and healthy mix of those signing up for coverage \u2026 which means better rates and a more stable system, both for all of our enrollees, and for the entire individual health insurance marketplace in California,\u201d Lee said.\n\nLee declined to provide additional information on the ethnic and demographic breakdown of enrollees or the plans they chose, saying the numbers were still being analyzed.\n\nThe number of enrollees could still grow a bit this year, because the state last week extended the enrollment deadline for people who had officially begun the process by Jan. 31. Lee said \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of Californians are in that group.\n\nWith the end of open enrollment for 2016, consumers in California and nationwide can sign up for Affordable Care Act insurance only if they encounter a life-altering event such as having a baby, getting married or losing employer-based insurance. The next open enrollment period, for coverage in 2017, will start in November.\n\nMost people who fail to sign up by the deadline face tax penalties of $695 per adult, plus $347.50 per child, or 2.5 percent of family income in excess of 2015 income tax filing thresholds. Since Covered California launched, the exchange has served more than 2 million people, Lee said. Of the consumers who have left the exchange, about 85 percent found other insurance options, including through their jobs, he said.\n\nStill, California\u2019s health insurance exchange has struggled to reach the state\u2019s remaining uninsured, particularly Latinos and African-Americans.\n\nAbout 2.4 percent of the exchange\u2019s approximately 1.3 million enrollees are African-American. That\u2019s only about half of the blacks considered eligible for subsidies because of their income. Another 30 percent are Latino, although 37 percent are considered eligible for subsidies, according to Covered California data.\n\nWhen the 2016 open enrollment period started in November, the exchange promised deeper outreach in those communities, including more targeted advertising, events and storefront enrollment centers.\n\nConcerns also remain about Covered California\u2019s ability to rein in insurance costs, especially for consumers who make too much money to qualify for subsidies or Medi-Cal but not enough to afford full-fare premiums. Lee said that Covered California consumers saw an average 4 percent rate increase in 2016, slightly lower than in 2015. Nationally, however, the increase was higher: Obamacare premiums for \u201cbenchmark\u201d insurance plans were expected to rise by an average of 7.5 percent, according to federal data.\n\nBut because consumers can change plans during open enrollment, those who switched to the lowest-cost plan in their area could lower their premiums by an average of 4.5 percent this year, Lee said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than one million existing customers renewed during the 2016 open enrollment that ended last Sunday, bringing the total to more than 1.5 million.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"425,000 More People Sign Up for Covered California\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/02\\/05\\/425000-more-people-sign-up-for-covered-california\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-02-05 10:15:29\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-02-05 10:15:29\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":145415,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Covered California\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Obamacare\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/11\\/DSC_2466-e1446489354155.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "More than one million existing customers renewed during the 2016 open enrollment that ended last Sunday, bringing the total to more than 1.5 million.", "title": "425,000 More People Sign Up for Covered California", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/02/05/425000-more-people-sign-up-for-covered-california/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/11/DSC_2466-1440x954.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "covered california,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Lee said that Covered California consumers saw an average 4 percent rate increase in 2016, slightly lower than in 2015.\nAnother 30 percent are Latino, although 37 percent are considered eligible for subsidies, according to Covered California data.\nThe exchange, Covered California, had estimated it would attract between 295,000 and 450,000 new enrollees during its third open enrollment season since the Affordable Care Act took effect.\nSince Covered California launched, the exchange has served more than 2 million people, Lee said.\nPeter Lee, executive director of Covered California, said about 37 percent of the new enrollees are young adults aged 18-34, up from 34 percent from last year."}
