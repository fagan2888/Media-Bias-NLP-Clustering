But some still don\u2019t, and that\u2019s worrisome.\n\nEven if your organization has for decades been the dominant force in health care in your market, complacency is not an option. Geography matters less and less. You may be the only game in town, but people now are shopping for care much farther afield than they used to. In some cases, they\u2019re being encouraged to do so by employers and insurers who are building narrow networks of providers, negotiating on cost and quality, and flying their employees or plan members halfway across the country if the value proposition makes sense.\n\nThen there\u2019s the explosion of digital devices and apps that enable individuals to monitor themselves and to be monitored day and night whether they\u2019re sitting in the coffee shop next door to their provider or propped up in bed at home hundreds of miles away. Virtual office visits no doubt will be more common in the not-too-distant future and, as technology becomes more sophisticated and less costly, everything from pin-sized cameras to 3-D printers will allow certain types of care and medications to be delivered without the patient and provider being anywhere close to each other.\n\nThis month, we wrap up our series on The New Health Care Consumer. The last installment starts on Page 28 and is called \u201cAre You Connected to the Revolution?\u201d It echoes many of the themes contributing writer Lola Butcher has detailed throughout the year, including the swelling stampede of so-called disruptors \u2014 entrepreneurs, IT innovators and retailers salivating over the potential profits to be had by giving health care consumers what they want when they want it anywhere they want it.\n\nHospitals will always play a central role in our nation\u2019s health care delivery system; the question is what that role will encompass. No doubt, that will vary from hospital to hospital. But as Rich Umbdenstock says in a Q&A on Page 34, hospital leaders must \u201credefine the H,\u201d an imperative driven to a large degree by the emerging power of the health care consumer.\n\nWe all need to pay serious attention to this new reality and understand its many implications. Our health system is going to look very different from what you and I are used to.
