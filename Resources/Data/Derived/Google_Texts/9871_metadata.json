Start Fixing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPredictably, perhaps, the moment of packaged, stage-managed camaraderie proved fleeting. Some participants almost immediately returned to lobbing partisan attacks in the House. Florida Democrat Joe Garcia compared the Tea Party movement to the Taliban. North Carolina Republican Robert Pittenger branded President Obama a \u201cmonarch\u201d for refusing to alter his new health care law.\n\nSo much for bridge-building in Washington.\n\nNo Labels \u2014 which now counts 87 representatives and senators spanning the ideological spectrum as members \u2014 is among several tentative, sputtering efforts inside and outside of Congress formed to break down the capital\u2019s no-compromise mentality.\n\n\u201cThis is not a bunch of moderates intent on overtaking the world,\u2019\u2019 said former Utah governor Jon Huntsman, who ran in the Republican presidential primary in 2012 and is a cochairman of No Labels. \u201cThis is an attempt to get beyond the anger and the acrimony and the finger-pointing.\u201d\n\nIn many quarters of Washington, the response has been: Good luck with that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo Labels has been unable to advance, in any meaningful way, a single item from its relatively modest list of goals. Critics dismiss it as window dressing, with some congressional staffers comparing it to a high school civics project and going as far as drafting memos to their bosses urging them not to join.\n\nEven its own members admit the group has a long way to go. They say their most important accomplishment to date has been to simply convene both parties for monthly breakfast meetings at which Republicans and Democrats listen to each other \u2014 or at least feign to listen \u2014 instead of labeling the other side as crazy.\n\nSCOTT STEWART/AP/FILE 1985 The bipartisan group wants to see a return of the kind of relationship that House Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill and President Ronald Reagan had enjoyed, scrappy but ultimately cordial and productive.\n\n\u201cSome members are understandably skeptical of No Labels. It\u2019s not an answer, but it does reflect the heart of a problem, which is our inability to find common ground,\u201d said Representative Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat who helped form the group. \u201cIf we do some smaller things that are within reach, it\u2019s a lot better than doing nothing.\u2019\u2019\n\nOther lawmakers agree that baby steps are worthwhile, and there are several, less formal attempts to get people talking.\n\nA bipartisan group of 14 senators, called the Common Sense Coalition, led by Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican, sprang out of a regular dinner gathering of women senators and has continued to meet since the shutdown.\n\nSenator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, along with Senator Mike Johanns, a Nebraska Republican, and Senator Angus King, a Maine independent, have also organized a bipartisan group of 11 senators who are former governors accustomed to working across party lines and are expanding their group to include former mayors and county executives. And a growing number of moderate Blue Dog Democrats and The Tuesday Group of moderate Republicans are now meeting once a month.\n\nA captain of a bipartisan women\u2019s softball team, comprising both senators and representatives, says it all adds up to hope for a better atmosphere in Washington.\n\n\u201cThese bipartisan groups can only help the dialogue and encourage people in Washington to get out of their trenches,\u201d said Senator Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican, who led the fund-raising softball team in its annual game, in June. \u201cWe need to replicate that as much as we can.\u201d\n\nAwkward first meeting\n\nIn today\u2019s Washington, two men are lionized as beacons of bipartisanship, and both happen to be dead. No Labels pays life-size tribute to both former President Ronald Reagan and House speaker Tip O\u2019Neill with black-and-white photographs that hang in its modest Georgetown offices.\n\nO\u2019Neill, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, and Reagan, a Republican icon, sparred publicly. O\u2019Neill called Reagan the most ignorant man who had ever occupied the White House and \u201ca cheerleader for selfishness.\u201d Reagan returned the favor, likening O\u2019Neill to Pac-Man, a \u201cround thing that gobbles up money.\u201d\n\nBut privately, they were cordial \u2014 friends after 6 p.m. \u2014 who would drink together at the White House. Despite ideological differences, and their own bouts of government shutdowns, the two men were able to meet in the middle to pass legislation, including a landmark tax-code overhaul in 1986.\n\nIt speaks volumes about today\u2019s toxic Washington atmosphere that an organization needs to form around the idea of encouraging such relationships.\n\nNancy Jacobson, a powerful Democratic fund-raiser and Washington operative, recognized the need and founded No Labels in 2010. Things got off to an awkward start, with just eight members of Congress at the group\u2019s first meeting in 2012, high-profile lawmakers who didn\u2019t know each other or know what to expect.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a sixth-grade dance,\u201d said Jacobson, who in 2004 had also started Third Way, a think tank for moderate Democrats.\n\nTo recruit new members, Jacobson patiently explains to lawmakers that representatives and senators of vastly different ideological stripes can be cordial, even friends \u2014 if given the opportunity to shed their partisan armor and get to know one another.\n\nConfidential No Labels meetings are a place, she said, where open-minded leaders can discuss facts in a neutral way, without partisan spin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about people who are centrists,\u201d Jacobson explained during an interview in the staff kitchen of the No Labels office, where she is a full-time volunteer. \u201cThere\u2019s a new paradigm afoot. We really just got to have people of good will, who care deeply about the country no matter what their political stripes are, to want to be part of a process to build trust so they can negotiate and solve problems.\u201d\n\nNo member of the Massachusetts delegation \u2014 all Democrats \u2014 has joined, although Representative Stephen Lynch did take part in the photo op during the shutdown. Other recruits have opted out, a decision Jacobson says she understands.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s progress with other ways, I\u2019m all for it. In fact, we don\u2019t need to do all this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there is no progress. These problems are intractable right now. The old way is not working, and unless we figure out another path, we\u2019re going to be stuck.\u201d\n\nAs her alliance of lawmakers grew, Jacobson unveiled her agenda: a nine-point plan to make government work with legislation centered around seemingly modest fixes such as moving to a two-year budgeting cycle, withholding congressional pay if lawmakers fail to pass a budget, and curbing agency travel expenses by replacing meetings with video conferencing.\n\nThe only bill that has advanced so far is a weakened version of \u201cNo Budget, No Pay.\u201d The bill, which President Obama signed in February, directed each chamber to adopt a budget for fiscal 2014 but did not require a budget conference. Members\u2019 pay would be held in escrow if their chamber did not pass a budget, instead of being docked permanently, as the No Labels group originally proposed.\n\n\u201cThe bills we have are not nuclear medicine, that is true, but they are about things we\u2019ve said we wanted to do but haven\u2019t done for a long time,\u201d said Representative Kurt Schrader, an Oregon Democrat who cochairs a No Labels working group of lawmakers called the Problem Solvers. \u201cThey are things Republicans and Democrats can rally around and learn to work together on. They\u2019re pretty basic, and not threatening to anyone\u2019s election.\u201d\n\nJacobson said the group\u2019s ambitions will grow with time. Early next year, she said, No Labels will unveil a plan calling for leaders to set a strategic agenda for the country centering on shared goals. Jacobson recruited Huntsman to help lead the effort, along with her former boss, Evan Bayh, a Democrat and former senator from Indiana who, saying he was disgusted with Washington dysfunction, retired in 2011, and Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat.\n\nAlready the group, which raised $2.3 million in 2012, has enlisted more than 500,000 citizen activists to support the movement.\n\n\u201cPeople typically look at me cross-eyed, saying how could you pursue such a lofty aspiration?\u201d said Huntsman, who has recently begun hosting a Saturday morning radio show to give the group\u2019s message a national platform. \u201cIf you can\u2019t prove a concept by a group of bipartisan legislators coming together, building trust, and passing legislation, there\u2019s no way you can be effective as a movement.\u201d\n\nTaking a cue from the past\n\nOn a stifling hot morning in July, lawmakers paraded onto an outdoor stage, the Capitol dome looming in the background. One by one, like contestants in a Miss America pageant, congressmen and congresswomen from the Golden State, the Peach State, the Empire State and elsewhere proclaimed the pressing need for legislators to work together, as they wiped the sweat from their brows and upper lips, shirt sleeves rolled up to their elbows.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, help is on the way,\u201d Representative Reid Ribble, a Republican from the Badger State of Wisconsin and cochairman of the Problem Solvers group, told the audience.\n\n\u201cGetting something done is far more important than party or politics,\u201d said Jim Matheson, a Democrat from the Beehive State of Utah.\n\n\u201cThis is a sign that dysfunction in Washington is starting to thaw,\u201d said Sean Duffy, another Republican congressman from Wisconsin.\n\nDuffy, a former cast member of MTV\u2019s \u201cThe Real World: Boston\u201d who was elected to Congress in the 2010 Tea Party wave, turned out to be one of the most vocal Republican opponents of Obama\u2019s health care law. He is not the only No Labels member intent on gutting Obamacare.\n\nIn August, Representative Mark Meadows, a Tea Party Republican from North Carolina who touts his No Labels membership as evidence of his ability to work in a bipartisan manner, spearheaded an effort to tie the continued funding of government to dismantling the health law. That demand to link the two issues \u2014 adopted by scores of GOP lawmakers \u2014 led to the government shutdown.\n\nNo Labels leaders said the group\u2019s strength lies in the broad ideological spectrum of its members \u2014 its ability to accommodate lawmakers like Meadows and Vermont\u2019s Welch under the same roof.\n\nNo Labels is the \u201conly game in town\u201d for members of different political stripes to regularly come together for a meal \u2014 the modern-day solution to the tradition of lawmakers \u201cgoing to war on the floor and getting beers at night,\u201d Schrader said.\n\n\u201cWe frankly can get back to that kind of camaraderie,\u201d Schrader said. \u201cWe have some pretty extreme members that are pretty volatile, but they want to be Problem Solvers.\u201d\n\nEvery morning during the 16-day government shutdown, about two dozen members of the Problem Solvers would gather in the Rio Room in a windowless basement at the Tortilla Coast, a Tex-Mex restaurant three blocks from the Capitol.\n\nSome days, they met twice a day over coffee and fruit platters, brainstorming proposals to put forth, how they could help the other party save face, and ways to push leadership to end the gridlock. Smaller groups met in lawmakers\u2019 homes and offices.\n\nBut the Problem Solvers could not come to a consensus about a path forward. Some wanted to repeal a medical device tax required by the Affordable Care Act as a compromise to Republican demands to gut the president\u2019s health care law. Others thought that would be giving up too much \u2014 or not enough.\n\nAt one point during the impasse, Senator Collins, the moderate Maine Republican, was invited to meet with the group to discuss the medical device compromise proposal. She did not seem especially impressed.\n\n\u201cI think No Labels is very well intended, but I have not found them to be particularly effective in achieving their goals,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI think they\u2019re still finding their way.\u201d\n\nRepresentative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat and No Labels member who had started a similar, but much smaller bipartisan group of lawmakers in 2011, agreed that more substantive results would take time in such a diverse coalition.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we just very actively suggested that default would be a terrible thing for the country and that we had to reopen government,\u201d Cicilline said, referring to the hastily-arranged photo op amid the shutdown. \u201cWe kept it very general because there were some disagreements about specific proposals.\u201d\n\nMany of the members of this basement group of Problem Solvers were idealistic freshmen lawmakers elected with the mandate to break Washington\u2019s partisan politics, but who held too little clout to influence much of anything \u2014 a challenge they readily acknowledge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a new group of folks that are trying to carve some type of reasonable, pragmatic solution-driven thinking around here,\u201d said Ribble, the Wisconsin Republican.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a time and place for the Problem Solvers to begin to exert more pressure on leadership,\u201d Ribble said. \u201cHowever, we have to show and document first that we\u2019ve got trust amongst ourselves.\u2019\u2019\n\nSome rank-and-file members said that leadership on both sides were leaning hard on them not to \u201cget out front\u201d during the shutdown, stifling their fledging compromise efforts. But they promised to keep meeting, since that\u2019s about all they can do.\n\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s where the problem is, at the top, at the leadership level,\u201d said Dr. Ami Bera, a freshman Democratic congressman from California and No Labels member. \u201cSomebody has to pull this country together. If that isn\u2019t happening at the top, then certainly there are plenty of rank-and-file members of Congress that want to get something done and are not afraid to get out there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.988002328", "eomportal-id": 1636729, "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The group No Labels \u2014 which now counts 87 representatives and senators spanning the ideological spectrum as members \u2014 is among several efforts inside and outside of Congress formed to break down the capital\u2019s no-compromise mentality. \u201cThis is not a bunch of moderates intent on overtaking the world, said former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman, who ran in the Republican presidential primary in 2012 and is a leader of No Labels. \u201cThis is an attempt to get beyond the anger and the acrimony and the finger pointing.\u201d No Labels has been unable to advance, in any meaningful way, a single item from its relatively modest list of goals.
