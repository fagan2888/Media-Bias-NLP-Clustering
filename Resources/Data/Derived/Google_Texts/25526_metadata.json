But he asked the A/V gods if it was possible, and soon, the blood-soaked, expletive-laced trailer was playing again.\n\nIt seems fitting for a movie 11 years in the making that Reynolds said was only greenlit because of the enthusiasm of the fans.\n\nThe Marvel antihero, known for his salty language and off-humor, is given an origin story in this film, which comes out Feb. 12.\n\nPerhaps the main event of the Twentieth Century Fox presentation, which also included looks at \u201cFantastic Four,\u201d the \u201cMaze Runner\u201d sequel and \u201cVictor Frankenstein,\u201d was \u201cX-Men: Apocalypse.\u201d\n\nThe veil was stripped away from the highly secretive film as director Bryan Singer revealed that it takes place 10 years after the events of \u201cX-Men: Days of Future Past\u201d in 1983.\n\nThis is a world that has grown to accept mutants, mostly. But a mysterious and influential sect has risen that believes the mutants are gods.\n\nWhile Jennifer Lawrence said her character in this outing is more Raven than Mystique, Michael Fassbender stayed ambiguous about whether we\u2019d be seeing Erik or Magneto.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a guy who plays both sides. He\u2019s always that kind of ambiguous villain,\u201d said Fassbender. \u201cWhen we meet him, he\u2019s more of a simple guy, living a normal life. He\u2019s hung up his cape and his evil ways.\u201d\n\nThe footage also showed the first glimpse at Oscar Isaac\u2019s villain Apocalypse and Sophie Turner\u2019s young Jean Grey.\n\n\u201cX-Men: Apocalypse\u201d is only five weeks into shooting and will be released on May 27.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cThe Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,\u201d out Sept. 18, showcased a new trailer and an extended look at the new monster of the movie: the Cranks. In the film, they\u2019re terrifying, slimy, zombielike creatures.", "article_metadata": {"description": "First footage of \u2018X-Men: Apocalypse,\u2019 \u2018Deadpool\u2019 shown", "title": "First footage of \u2018X-Men: Apocalypse,\u2019 \u2018Deadpool\u2019 shown", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "First footage of \u2018X-Men: Apocalypse,\u2019 \u2018Deadpool\u2019 shown", "title": "First footage of \u2018X-Men: Apocalypse,\u2019 \u2018Deadpool\u2019 shown", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/12/first_footage_of_x_men_apocalypse_deadpool_shown/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/2015-comic-con-quot20th-century-foxquot-panels.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "First footage of \u2018X-Men: Apocalypse,\u2019 \u2018Deadpool\u2019 shown", "title": "First footage of \u2018X-Men: Apocalypse,\u2019 \u2018Deadpool\u2019 shown", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/2015-comic-con-quot20th-century-foxquot-panels.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsey Bahr", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a40\"", "article_summary": "\u201cX-Men: Apocalypse\u201d is only five weeks into shooting and will be released on May 27.\nHe\u2019s hung up his cape and his evil ways.\u201dThe footage also showed the first glimpse at Oscar Isaac\u2019s villain Apocalypse and Sophie Turner\u2019s young Jean Grey.\nBut he asked the A/V gods if it was possible, and soon, the blood-soaked, expletive-laced trailer was playing again.\nIt seems fitting for a movie 11 years in the making that Reynolds said was only greenlit because of the enthusiasm of the fans.\nThe Marvel antihero, known for his salty language and off-humor, is given an origin story in this film, which comes out Feb. 12."}
