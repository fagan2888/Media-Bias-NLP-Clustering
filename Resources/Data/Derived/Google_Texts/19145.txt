Natural and intuitive for kids

Monarch High librarian Beatrice Gerrish wanted to organize her books using a bookstore model.

But she couldn't find a classification system she liked for a school library, so she decided to create her own.

It took three years and the help of student and parent volunteers, but she recently completed the project and now is offering the Monarch Method free to other schools.

She said the traditional Dewey library classification system, published in the United States in 1876, doesn't meet the needs of students who want to browse books by category — like they would on Amazon or at a bookstore.

"I'm trying to make it as close to Amazon as I can, so kids can browse and easily find what they were looking for. I wanted to make sure it was really natural for the kids and intuitive."

She said Dewey's system, created largely for researchers, separates books on the same topic by genre. So a book on the history of football is in a different section than a fiction novel about football.

But students, she said, are used to searching for football books on a site like Amazon and getting a list of 25 books across genres.

Her system organizes the library's 15,000 books by subject instead of genre, with color coded labels to denote if a book is fiction, a biography, an autobiography, etc.

"It's much better for kids who don't like to read and casual library users, who don't know all the titles and author names," she said.

She said students have shared positive feedback, and she is seeing results.

She's doubled the number of checkouts in the past four years, to 9,797 last school year. The library also logged 65,000 student visits last school year — up from 23,000 visits 10 years ago.

"I'm appealing to all the students , not just the high end users," she said.
