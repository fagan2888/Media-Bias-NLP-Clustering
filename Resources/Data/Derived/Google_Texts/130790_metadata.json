Ted Cruz is defending ICE Officer Chris Crane, following Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s seeming attempt to denounce the war veteran as a \u201cconspiracy\u201d theorist for claiming law enforcement\u2019s concerns were ignored in the Obama-championed Gang of Eight bill co-authored by Sen. Rubio.\n\n\u201cThe brave agents of ICE and Border Patrol risk their lives every day keeping us safe,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt is troubling to the extent it appears that Marco shut out ICE and law enforcement leaders just to appease the Democrats on his Gang of Eight amnesty bill. That reflects a lack of judgment, and an alarming willingness to advance the interests of the Washington Cartel at the expense of public safety and national security.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOn Friday, Crane\u2014 whom Jeff Sessions has described as \u201can American hero\u201d for his courage to blow the whistle on immigration corruption\u2014 publicly detailed for the first time since the Presidential race began how Sen. Rubio treated law enforcement \u201clike absolute trash\u201d during Rubio\u2019s effort to pass his donor-backed amnesty bill.\n\nIn an effort to dismiss Crane\u2019s substantive criticisms, Sen. Rubio attacked Crane on national television\u2014 implicitly denouncing Crane\u2019s 13 years of service as an ICE officer. \u201cHe\u2019s not an ICE official. He\u2019s the head of a union,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI literally don\u2019t even talk about the things they [i.e. Breitbart News] report because they\u2019re basically conspiracy theories and often times manipulated. And that individual is not an ICE official. He\u2019s the head of a union.\u201d\n\nHowever, this directly contradicts Rubio\u2019s prior statements in 2013 about Crane when it was politically expedient for Rubio to tout having met with \u201claw enforcement official\u201d and \u201cICE agent\u201d Chris Crane.\n\n\u201cSenator Rubio did meet with Mr. Crane, and we welcome his suggestions to improve the bill,\u201d Rubio\u2019s spokesman Alex Conant wrote in an April 2013 email to Breitbart News. \u201cOur legislation is not a take-it or leave-it proposition \u2013 we welcome input and ideas from Mr. Crane and other law enforcement officials as the Senate works to improve the proposal\u2026 Ultimately, we share Mr. Crane\u2019s frustrations with the current, broken immigration system and his frustrations with the current Administration\u2019s failure to enforce our laws. That is why we\u2019re working to fix the system, and why we want law enforcement\u2019s input.\u201d\n\nWhen one of Rubio\u2019s constituents from Melbourne, Florida asked Rubio \u201cWhy isn\u2019t your Gang of Eight calling on ICE for their input into border security,\u201d Rubio replied:\n\nWe did get input from ICE. I actually met with a gentleman named Chris Crane, he\u2019s the president of the union for the ICE agents. We met for about an hour, an hour and a half\u2026 His frustration, and the frustration of many ICE agents, is that they\u2019re not being allowed to enforce the law\u2026 These are valid points that we\u2019ve heard\u2026 We have taken their input, we continue to seek their input. And I have nothing but the highest respect for the men and women who are on the front lines of trying to enforce our laws even though sometimes the politicians get in the way.\n\nIn recent weeks, honesty has become a central issue of the 2016 race. Rubio has repeatedly hit Cruz as a liar. At the most recent Republican debate, Rubio said: \u201cThis is a disturbing pattern now, because for a number of weeks now, Ted Cruz has just been telling lies.\u201d\n\nRubio doubled down on his charge the following day on CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cThe bottom line is there\u2019s been this disturbing pattern over the last couple of weeks from Ted Cruz of just saying things that are not true.\u201d\n\nRubio then reiterated the accusation at a CNN moderated town hall last week. \u201cI said he\u2019s been lying because if you say something that isn\u2019t true and you say it over and over again and you know that it\u2019s not true, there\u2019s no other word for it.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Rubio took issue with Cruz\u2019s accusation that Rubio said on national television in Spanish that Rubio would not immediately end Obama\u2019s executive 2012 amnesty on day one of his presidency. Rubio claimed this was a lie\u2013 despite the fact that Rubio not only made this assertion in Spanish\u2014 but Rubio also reiterated his Spanish-language declaration that he wouldn\u2019t \u201cundo it [Obama\u2019s 2012 amnesty] immediately\u201d in English.\n\nIn an English-language interview, Rubio said of Obama\u2019s 2012 amnesty, \u201cI don\u2019t think we can immediately revoke that\u2026 I\u2019m not calling for it to be revoked tomorrow, or this week, or right away.\u201d Instead Rubio adopted President Obama\u2019s position on the matter, declaring that \u201cit will have to end at some point\u201d and that he hopes it \u201cwill end because of some reform to the immigration laws\u201d\u2014i.e. the President ought to leave the executive amnesty for DREAMers in place until Congress submits to the order by legislatively ratifying amnesty.\n\nRubio also criticized Cruz\u2019s campaign for putting out what appeared to be satirical photo of Rubio and Obama shaking hands\u2014 in an effort to highlight Rubio\u2019s effort to give Obama fast-track executive trade authority. Although the appearance of the photo could arguably have been labeled a caricature, Rubio sought to diffuse the substance of the attack\u2014which focused on Rubio\u2019s support for Obamatrade\u2014 by treating the satirically-minded photo as a serious transgression. \u201cThis is how phony and how deceitful the Cruz campaign has become,\u201d Rubio\u2019s senior adviser said.\n\n\u201cViolent street gangs were literally able to lobby Sen. Rubio and the Gang of Eight more effectively than law enforcement, they had more influence on the bill than we did,\u201d Crane said in his exclusive interview with Breitbart News published Friday.\n\nIn a 15-page memo outlining Rubio\u2019s \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the conservative movement, grassroots heroine and living legend Phyllis Schlafly documented Rubio record of \u201clying to conservative media\u201d and the many falsehoods he told at the time. \u201cHis deceptions about his immigration bill rivaled and exceeded Obama\u2019s claims about disastrous Obamacare,\u201d Schlafly wrote.\n\nFor instance, Rubio said border security would precede amnesty\u2013 a fact he later admitted was not the case in a 2013 Spanish language interview.\n\nRubio claimed his bill \u201ctransformed our immigration system from family-based to merit-based,\u201d Schlafly writes, yet this too was not true: \u201cdespite making the \u201cmerit-based\u201d system one of his central selling points, the bill substantially increased chain migration,\u201d Schlafly explained.\n\n\u201cRubio said, often and repeatedly, (and does to this day in pitching his immigration plans) that illegals would have to \u2018pay taxes and undergo a background check,\u2019\u201d Schlafly pointed out. However, \u201cthere is no such thing as \u2018back taxes,\u2019 for illegal immigrants as most have no net tax liability.\u201d Similarly, with regards to the background checks, Rubio\u2019s bill would have legalized criminal gang members and child sex offenders.\n\nRubio told conservatives that under his bill, \u201cthe size of the future population of the United States will not be significantly impacted by this legislation.\u201d However, Schlafly notes that the \u201cCBO, Migration Policy Institute, NumbersUSA, Center For Immigration Studies, and Senator Sessions\u2019 office all painstakingly documented the massive immigration increases in the bill.\u201d\n\nRubio claimed his bill was \u201cTHE TOUGHEST BORDER SECURITY AND ENFORCEMENT PLAN IN U.S. HISTORY,\u201d yet Schlafly writes, \u201cThe final product surely was one of the worst bills mashed together in the history of legislation itself\u2026 Rubio traded shamelessly on the affection and trust conservatives had placed in him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz Leaps To ICE Officer Chris Crane's Defense Following Marco Rubio\u2019s Smear", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ted Cruz Leaps To ICE Officer Chris Crane's Defense Following Marco Rubio\u2019s Smear", "title": "Ted Cruz Leaps To ICE Officer Chris Crane's Defense Following Marco Rubio\u2019s Smear - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/ted-cruz-first-baptist-spartanburg-south-carolina-AP.png", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/22/ted-cruz-leaps-ice-officer-chris-cranes-defense-following-marco-rubios-smear/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz Leaps To ICE Officer Chris Crane's Defense Following Marco Rubio\u2019s Smear", "title": "Ted Cruz Leaps To ICE Officer Chris Crane's Defense Following Marco Rubio\u2019s Smear - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/ted-cruz-first-baptist-spartanburg-south-carolina-AP.png", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Cruz", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2016-02-22T10:37:46-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt is troubling to the extent it appears that Marco shut out ICE and law enforcement leaders just to appease the Democrats on his Gang of Eight amnesty bill.\nIn an effort to dismiss Crane\u2019s substantive criticisms, Sen.
