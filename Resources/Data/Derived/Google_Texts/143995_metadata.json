Asa Hutchinson\u2019s Medicaid expansion plan, titled Arkansas Works.\n\nA complicated attempt to save the funding for Arkansas Works by removing it from the appropriation bill for the overall Medicaid program also failed Thursday.\n\nSenate Bill 121 by the Joint Budget Committee, which would fund the Department of Human Services\u2019 Medical Services Division, received 25 votes in support and 10 votes against in the Senate. That was the same margin by which Arkansas Works passed during last week\u2019s special session, but the appropriation bill requires a three-fourths majority vote for approval, or at least 27 votes in the 35-member Senate.\n\nArkansas Works would continue, with modifications, the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion program, which has provided government-subsidized private health insurance to more than 267,000 Arkansans since its creation in 2013 as an alternative to the expansion of Medicaid rolls envisioned in the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nHutchinson has said ending Medicaid expansion would create a hole of more than $100 million in the state budget. His plan is supported by Democratic legislators, but Republicans are divided on it.\n\nHutchinson said in a statement after Thursday\u2019s vote, \u201cThe first vote in the senate fell short of the three-fourths vote required, but I\u2019m pleased by the growing bipartisan recognition that the DHS Medical Services appropriation bill in the end will be fully funded. That is the responsibility of government and must be done. I\u2019ll continue to work with both Democrats and Republicans to achieve a successful resolution.\u201d\n\nAfter SB 121 failed, the Senate sent it back to the Joint Budget Committee, where Sen. Jim Hendren, R-Gravette, who supports the governor\u2019s plan, proposed an amendment to strip funding for Arkansas Works from the bill. He admitted that if the bill were to reach the governor\u2019s desk with the amendment, Hutchinson likely would remove the language with a line-item veto, thus restoring the funding.\n\n\u201cThis has to do with trying to find a path forward with regard to Arkansas Works,\u201d said Hendren, the governor\u2019s nephew.\n\nSen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, who opposes Arkansas Works, said Hendren\u2019s proposal would set a bad precedent.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re turning the power of the Legislature over to the executive branch,\u201d he said.\n\nHendren replied, \u201cI think what is a bad precedent is for us to continue to try to change policy during the appropriation process.\u201d\n\nSen. Jason Rapert, R-Conway, who has been a supporter of Arkansas Works, said he was reconsidering his support after learning that the Medicaid expansion program includes insurance coverage for the so-called morning-after pill.\n\nA motion to adopt the amendment failed in a 22-22 vote, with Democratic members mostly voting no, along with some Republicans. It needed 29 votes to pass.\n\n\u201cMy constituents want Arkansas Works to be funded,\u201d Sen. Linda Chesterfield, D-Little Rock, told reporters after the vote. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the governor\u2019s scheme is. I\u2019ve heard other people say (what it is), but I\u2019m not sure what the scheme really is. All I know is that the people I represent are not going to appreciate me voting not to fund Arkansas Works.\u201d\n\nHutchinson spokesman J.R. Davis said later, \u201cThe governor has made it clear to both Democrats and Republicans that if he receives a DHS Medical Services appropriation bill that defunds Arkansas Works, he will use the line-item veto.\u201d\n\nHendren said he would try again with the amendment.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of people missing today. We\u2019ll try to get there,\u201d he said.\n\nThe House, meanwhile, voted down the General Appropriation Act, which contains funding for expenses of the judicial branch and expense reimbursements for legislators. The state constitution requires that it be the first bill passed by the Legislature during a session.\n\nThe bill failed in a 68-0 vote, falling short of the 75 votes needed for passage. Eleven members, all of them Democrats, voted \u201cpresent,\u201d an option that allows a legislator to vote neither for nor against a bill.\n\n\u201cUntil we know where we\u2019re going to go with the Medicaid services portion of this budget, everything else is in limbo,\u201d House Minority Leader Michael John Gray, D-Augusta, said after the vote.\n\nSenate President Pro Tem Jonathan Dismang, R-Beebe, said that while the House and Senate take the next four days off, \u201cI hope to touch base with a number of members just to make sure we have a conversation about what the possibilities are, how to move forward.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Jeremy Gillam, R-Judsonia, said, \u201cMy hope, both from the House and Senate standpoint, is that everybody is able to go home, they\u2019re able to interact with folks in their district over the weekend, get some rest, really kind of find out what their constituents really feel about these issues that we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The Arkansas Legislature\u2019s fiscal session ground to a temporary halt Thursday, its second day, after the Senate rejected a bill to fund the state Medicaid program and the House rejected a bill that the Legislature is required to pass before it passes any other bills.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"site_name": "Arkansas News", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The Arkansas Legislature\u2019s fiscal session ground to a temporary halt Thursday, its second day, after the Senate rejected a bill to fund the state Medicaid program and the House rejected a bill that the Legislature is required to pass before it passes any other bills.", "title": "Medicaid funding bill fails in Senate", "url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/medicaid-funding-bill-fails-senate", "image": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_clark-hester_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/medicaid-funding-bill-fails-senate", "image": {"src": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_clark-hester_0.jpg"}, "title": "Medicaid funding bill fails in Senate", "card": "summary", "creator": "@arkansasnews"}, "keywords": "Arkansas,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-14T14:20:27-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "A complicated attempt to save the funding for Arkansas Works by removing it from the appropriation bill for the overall Medicaid program also failed Thursday.\nSenate Bill 121 by the Joint Budget Committee, which would fund the Department of Human Services\u2019 Medical Services Division, received 25 votes in support and 10 votes against in the Senate.\n\u201cThis has to do with trying to find a path forward with regard to Arkansas Works,\u201d said Hendren, the governor\u2019s nephew.\nSen.
