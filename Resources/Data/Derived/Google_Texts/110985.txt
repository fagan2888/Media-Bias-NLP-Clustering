Police are asking for the public's help to identify and locate a masked suspect who robbed a Phoenix Circle K at gunpoint.

Police said the suspect displayed a handgun as he entered the store on 12th Street south of Camelback Road at 9 p.m. on Nov. 13.

The suspect pointed the gun at the female clerk and ordered her to the ground, police said. He took cash from the register and multiple cartons of cigarettes before fleeing on foot.

"What worries us about this case is he came in immediately had the gun out so either he was scouting the location, sitting out in the parking lot and we're hoping someone may have seen him, or he just came in that brazen and started ordering people on the ground," said Sgt. Jamie Rothschild with Silent Witness.

The suspect is described as male, 23 years old, 5 feet 8 inches tall, 220 pounds with black hair and brown eyes. He was wearing a red mask and gloves during the robbery.

A reward of up to $1,000 is being offered for information that leads to an arrest.

"When they think that they may have seen the suspect in a parking lot with a vehicle, with similar clothing, those leads are helpful, certainly a build or if a suspect is talking to someone else and confessing these crimes to them, that's the kind of information we want," Rothschild said.

Anyone with information about the suspect is asked to call Silent Witness at 480-WITNESS or leave an anonymous tip at silentwitness.org.
