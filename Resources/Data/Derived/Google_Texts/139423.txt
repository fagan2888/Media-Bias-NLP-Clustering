Canadian rocker Neil Young argued on Howard Stern’s radio show Monday that the U.S. military is more harmful to the environment than the Islamic State group and that war will only further the damage.

“The things that we don’t know, you know, we can do little things to fight climate change,” Mr. Young said, Sun News first reported. “And yet our Army and our armed forces are the biggest CO2 providers into the world. It’s amazing. And yet we are fighting what? ISIS and al Qaeda.

“We are fighting these wars against these organizations and their carbon footprint has got to be like 1 percent of our huge Army and our Navy and all of this stuff that have with all our big machines,” he continued. “We’re doing more damage to the earth with our wars. And you try to find out? Hey, freedom! No freedom. You don’t get it. You can’t find out what that carbon footprint is of the military. It’s not available for us.”

Mr. Stern asked the famed musician if he is upset about what’s going on in the Middle East.

“You know, I don’t like war and I, you know, I think it’s all about energy. In the end, it’s all about energy. That’s what it’s about. And it’s going to be about water, because we’re using it all up,” he said. “We ought to just start getting smart and use what we have: renewable energy. There’s energy from the sun. Hello? It’s right there. You go outside and if you don’t wear a hat, you can burn a hole in your head. There’s something there. Let’s use it.”
