A leading health care system in Central Pennsylvania says it will stop hiring tobacco users and enforce the ban by testing all applicants for nicotine.

With the move, Holy Spirit Health System joins two other Central Pa. health care groups, Geisinger Health Systems and WellSpan Health, that already refuse to hire tobacco users.

"Our mission is healing and good health, so it is important for us to set a good example for our patients and community," Holy Spirit spokeswoman Lori Moran told PennLive's David Wenner.

An employer may face higher health insurance costs for employees who use tobacco, but the Affordable Care Act allows smokers to be charged higher rates.

Holy Spirit notes that Pennsylvania is one of 21 states where a no-hiring policy for tobacco users is legal. As for the possibility that non-smoking applicants will be disqualified by exposure to second-hand smoke, Holy Spirit says the nicotine tests will not detect such low-level doses.

What's your opinion of employers that refuse to hire tobacco users? Is it too much snooping into employees' private lives? A form of discrimination that should be outlawed? Or a common-sense policy for organizations whose goal is keeping people healthy?
