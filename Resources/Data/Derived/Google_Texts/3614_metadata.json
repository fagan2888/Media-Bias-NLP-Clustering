But any sense of optimism was deflated last week after reports surfaced that Goodell told teams interested in relocating that there would be no moves made in the 2015 season.\n\nBut do LA fans\u2014who have lost teams twice before for lack of support\u2014really want another football franchise in their city? Is the NFL actually serious about an LA return, or are they just using the city as a bargaining chip to make other localities pay up for stadium upgrades. And for a city that\u2019s chronically in debt and literally breaking at the seems (water main breaks seem to be a weekly occurrence here now), is it really a smart move to spend millions on a stadium to bring back the NFL?\n\n\u201cWhy No Smart City Would Want the NFL\u201d looks at the effort in LA to bring back a team and posits that maybe Los Angeles is better off by not having a franchise. Produced by Alexis Garcia. Original release date was January 31, 2014 and original writeup below.\n\n\u201cThe NFL is good at fleecing taxpayers,\u201d says ESPN columnist Gregg Easterbrook, author of The King of Sports: Football\u2019s Impact on America. \u201cIt\u2019s about a billion dollars a year I\u2019ve calculated in public subsidies to NFL owners and this is a group that consists almost entirely of billionaires and yet receiving significant public subsidies every year.\u201d\n\nThe NFL raked in over $9 billion in revenues last season and the league is pushing team owners to triple that mark over the next decade.\n\nWith the league\u2019s overwhelming success, many cities are eager to get a piece of the action, often offering billions in public subsidies to attract (or keep) football in their localities.\n\nBut with the NFL making record profits, is it right for cities to spend public money on these type of projects? Especially when over half of NFL team owners are ranked on the Forbes billionaire list?\n\nNo where is this illustrated more than in Los Angeles, which has been trying to lure the league back to the area ever since the Raiders and Rams left town 20 years ago. And though numerous economists have demonstrated that sports stadia don\u2019t increase local economic activity, it hasn\u2019t stopped debt-ridden cities like L.A. from approving a $1.2 billion dollar stadium deal that would be financed with nearly $350 million in taxpayer-backed bonds.\n\nLos Angeles City Councilman Tom LaBonge has been an advocate of bringing the NFL back to Los Angeles and voted along with the rest of his colleagues to approve the stadium deal (whether it ever gets built is remained to be seen). \u201cThere\u2019s a beauty to the game and I\u2019d like to see the beauty in Los Angeles. I like what it does for a city when their team wins,\u201d says LaBonge.\n\nThe irony is that even if Los Angeles did manage to build a stadium, there\u2019s no reason to think the NFL may bite. The league has remained notoriously vague on the subject, with NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy telling Reason: \u201cWe would like to return to the Los Angeles area, but only if it works for the community and the NFL. There is no timeline but we continue to monitor all stadium-related developments in the area.\u201d\n\nSports stadiums not only appear to be a bad deal for tax payers, but having a franchise could also hurt loyal fans by making it difficult to watch their hometown team play thanks to the expansion of sports broadcasts and the complexities of NFL blackout rules.\n\n\u201cIf you have a team in Los Angeles and it doesn\u2019t sell out, they can blackout the game in Los Angeles which means you often lose games\u2026and as a fan there\u2019s no payback in that,\u201d says Daniel Durbin, Director of the University of Southern California\u2019s Institute of Sports Media and Society.\n\nThough local boosters like LaBonge may continue to dream of having the NFL in the city, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that not having a team may be the best deal for tax payers and fans alike.\n\nAbout 7 minutes.\n\nProduced by Alexis Garcia.\n\nCamera by Tracy Oppenheimer, Zach Weissmueller, Paul Detrick, William Neff, Sharif Matar and Todd Krainin.\n\n\u201cScroll down for downloadable versions and subscribe to ReasonTV's YouTube Channelto receive notification when new material goes live.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/12/23/why-roger-goodell-saying-no-to-an-nfl-mo", "type": "article", "site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Since the Rams and Raiders left town almost 20 years ago this Christmas, Los Angeles has been desperately trying to put together a strategy to bring an", "title": "Why Roger Goodell Saying 'No' to an NFL Move to Los Angeles Next Season is a Good Thing for Fans"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "creator": "@heylexyg", "description": "Since the Rams and Raiders left town almost 20 years ago this\nChristmas, Los Angeles has been desperately trying to put together\na strategy to bring an NFL franchise (or \ntwo or three) back to one of the largest media markets in the\ncountry.&nbsp;\nAnd while there\u2019s been no progress whatsoever in developing a\nplan to finance and build stadium to house a team\u2014or even get the\nNFL to agree to move a franchise\u2014the city continues to court the\nleague.&nbsp;\nThings looked hopeful for fans earlier this year after\ncommissioner Roger Goodell", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why Roger Goodell Saying 'No' to an NFL Move to Los Angeles Next Season is a Good Thing for Fans"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-23T19:18:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/alexis-garcia"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Things looked hopeful for fans earlier this year after commissioner Roger Goodell stated he would like to see a team in Los Angeles.\nThe irony is that even if Los Angeles did manage to build a stadium, there\u2019s no reason to think the NFL may bite.\nEspecially when over half of NFL team owners are ranked on the Forbes billionaire list?\n\u201cThere\u2019s a beauty to the game and I\u2019d like to see the beauty in Los Angeles.\nLos Angeles City Councilman Tom LaBonge has been an advocate of bringing the NFL back to Los Angeles and voted along with the rest of his colleagues to approve the stadium deal (whether it ever gets built is remained to be seen)."}
