It\u2019s not just that he\u2019s made one stumble. It\u2019s also that he\u2019s living history, a walking, raging embodiment of all the old Clinton uproars.\n\nDemocratic operative James Carville?s attempt to tamp down talk of Hillary Clinton?s email scandal may have instead added more fuel to the fire.\n\nIs James Carville hurting Hillary Rodham Clinton more than he\u2019s helping her? That\u2019s the question rattling around the punditocracy this morning following Mr. Carville\u2019s inelegant defense of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of personal e-mail on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday.\n\nCarville\u2019s long been a staunch Clintonite and one of the former first couple\u2019s primary surrogate spokesmen on television. He\u2019s been all over the cable shout shows ever since news broke that as Secretary of State Clinton relied on a home-brew private e-mail server. His primary line: it\u2019s nothing, just business-as-usual; something Colin Powell and other Secretaries of State did too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s made up. You take pi, you subtract 3.1415 and you don\u2019t end up with very much,\u201d Carville told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos on Sunday.\n\nRecommended: How much do you know about Hillary Rodham Clinton? Take our quiz.\n\nBut Carville also said this, in a rare unguarded comment: \u201cI suspect she didn\u2019t want Louis Gohmert rifling through her e-mails, which seems to me to be a kind of reasonable position for someone to take.\u201d\n\nRepublicans pounced on this as an inadvertent admission that Clinton was just trying to avoid legitimate congressional oversight. You see, Representative Gohmert is a GOP member of the House from Texas, a member of the Judiciary Committee who\u2019s an outspoken conservative. To put it mildly.\n\nClinton might want to avoid Gohmert\u2019s scrutiny, but as an administration official she\u2019s not really supposed to do that, at least as far as members of Congress are concerned.\n\nAt the least, this is a sensitive subject that the Clinton camp would want Carville to avoid. Instead, he should have gone on a trademark rant, where he becomes red in the face and fires out an emotional defense of his subject in the Louisiana accent that earned him the nickname \u201cRaging Cajun.\u201d\n\nAs performance art these rants are really quite impressive. But his offhand comment will give Republicans a talking point they\u2019ll be waving around for days.\n\n\u201cTeam Clinton is going to have to ask their surrogates to stop helping, and soon. At this rate, Clinton\u2019s backers are going to help her right out of the race,\u201d writes Noah Rothman at right-leaning Hot Air.\n\nWe agree with that first sentence, partly. It\u2019s possible that Clinton may ask this particular surrogate to stop helping, at least for the moment. It\u2019s not just that he\u2019s made one stumble. It\u2019s also that he\u2019s living history, a walking, raging embodiment of all the old Clinton uproars, up to and including impeachment.\n\nThat\u2019s not the image Clinton wants to dwell on when she runs for president. She\u2019ll want to portray herself as modern, forward-looking candidate. Remember, her likely campaign manager Robby Mook is 35. Clinton is reaching for younger, tech-savvy leadership for her 2016 effort.\n\nAs to whether the e-mail uproar will upend her ambitions, and drive Clinton from the race, we remain unconvinced things are anywhere near that point. This is a classic partisan uproar, in which D.C. elites pay lots of attention, but the public doesn\u2019t, with the bottom line being that committed partisans are made more committed in their beliefs, on both sides.\n\nOn March 9, a Pew poll found Clinton\u2019s e-mails to be only the fifth-most followed news event of the week, a tick below the Supreme Court argument on the Affordable Care Act. Even this rating was based mostly on great interest among Republicans, who aren\u2019t going to vote for Clinton anyway.\n\nThirty-four percent of Republicans said they were following the story closely, according to Pew. The corresponding number for Democrats was 16 percent. That was the widest partisan divide on any news story rated in that particular Pew survey.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "e8ce0f331daa3aed4b15fee2688104bf", "sailthru.author": "Peter Grier", "description": "It\u2019s possible that Hillary Clinton may ask this particular surrogate to stop helping, at least for the moment.
