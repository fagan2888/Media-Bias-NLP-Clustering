The National Policy Alliance is composed of the nine primary organizations representing Black public officials from federal, state and local levels of government throughout the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe National School Boards Association\u2019s National Black Caucus of School Board Members is working closely with the National Policy Alliance to keep the lines of communication open with the White House,\u201d Keels said. \u201cSchool board members are in the trenches and understand the challenges that public schools face with continued reductions in state and federal funding. We have a fiscal responsibility to taxpayers. With a focus on student achievement, school board members lobby to ensure that unfunded mandates do not affect district operations and, ultimately, student achievement.\u201d\n\nThe group also met with David Agnew, deputy assistant to the President and director of Intergovernmental Affairs, and David Simas, deputy senior advisor for Communications and Strategy.\n\nThis year has been a busy year for Keels, a former president of the Ohio School Boards Association. She was seated on the National School Boards Association board of directors and began a two-year term as chair of the National Black Caucus of School Board Members in April in San Diego. Keels also became chair of education policy for the National Policy Alliance and chair of education policy for the World Conference of Mayors this year.\n\nIn addition, Keels in August participated in the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://thecincinnatiherald.com/news/2013/oct/17/princeton-school-board-president-meets-senior-whit/", "image": "http://epmgaa.media.lionheartdms.com/img/photos/2013/10/17/photo_1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Tawana Lynn Keels, president of the Princeton City Board of Education and a member of the National School Boards Association Board of Directors, recently met at the White House with a senior advisor to President Obama to discuss policy initiatives.", "title": "Princeton school board president meets with senior White House advisor"}, "msvalidate.01": "ED540F9D73DCA1D4EE74802D83584794", "description": "Tawana Lynn Keels, president of the Princeton City Board of Education and a member of the National School Boards Association Board of Directors, recently met at the White House with a senior advisor to President Obama to discuss policy initiatives.", "viewport": "width=1020", "google-site-verification": "VCr1unnFLWpEE_PjATImArfhLoCPjhzpPVHviwPNm8w"}, "article_summary": "Tawana Lynn Keels, president of the Princeton City Board of Education and a member of the National School Boards Association Board of Directors, recently met at the White House with a senior advisor to President Obama to discuss policy initiatives.\n\u201cSchool board members are in the trenches and understand the challenges that public schools face with continued reductions in state and federal funding.\nShe was seated on the National School Boards Association board of directors and began a two-year term as chair of the National Black Caucus of School Board Members in April in San Diego.\nThis year has been a busy year for Keels, a former president of the Ohio School Boards Association.\nKeels also became chair of education policy for the National Policy Alliance and chair of education policy for the World Conference of Mayors this year."}
