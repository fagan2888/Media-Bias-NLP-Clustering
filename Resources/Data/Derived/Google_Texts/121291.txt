Washington (CNN) Despite being backed by the monumental Right to Rise super PAC, Jeb Bush said Monday he would "eliminate" the Supreme Court decision that paved the way for super PACs.

"If I could do it all again I'd eliminate the Supreme Court ruling" Citizens United, Bush told CNN's Dana Bash. "This is a ridiculous system we have now where you have campaigns that struggle to raise money directly and they can't be held accountable for the spending of the super PAC that's their affiliate."

Not long after Bush made his comments, Donald Trump -- who often touts that he is not using a super PAC -- mocked Bush on Twitter.

"Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign, he says he would end super PACs. Sad!" Trump tweeted.
