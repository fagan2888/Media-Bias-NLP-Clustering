And let\u2019s say I own a software company that employs only vegetarians, because I don\u2019t believe I should be forced to subsidize meat-eating with the money I pay in salaries. Could I get away with that sort of discrimination?\n\nApparently I could, if you follow the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s logic in a ruling Monday that a company should not be forced to subsidize an activity that offends its owners\u2019 religious beliefs. The court ruled that Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. may be exempted from the federal government\u2019s mandate that for-profit corporations\u2019 employee health plans cover all 20 types of contraception. Their Christian owners believe life begins at conception and oppose four contraceptive methods that interfere with implantation of a fertilized egg. It makes no difference under the ruling if the employee shares those beliefs, or even that religion. \"It is not for the Court to say that the religious beliefs of the plaintiffs are mistaken or unreasonable,\" wrote Justice Samuel Alito in his majority opinion.\n\nSUE OGROCKI / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Rev. Bruce Prescott, left, applauds during a vigil outside a Hobby Lobby store in Edmond, Okla., Monday, June 30, 2014, in reaction to the Supreme Court's decision that some companies like the Oklahoma-based Hobby Lobby chain of arts-and-craft stores can avoid the contraceptives requirement in President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, if they have religious objections.\n\nThe impact of the ruling has been analyzed mostly through the prisms of birth control and the Affordable Care Act. But the implications of allowing private companies to opt out of certain laws for religious reasons are sweeping, and dangerous. If a company can dictate how employees spend their salary or benefits according to its owners\u2019 religious beliefs, at what point does religious accommodation of an employer end and religious discrimination against employees begin?\n\nThe court should have left religious exemptions to religious and non-profit organizations.\n\nThe court majority tried to tailor its ruling to \"closely held\" corporations and certain types of contraception. But the rationale could become precedent in ways that even Christian groups hailing the ruling in the name of religious freedom would take serious issue with. What if a conservative Muslim or Hasidic Jewish business owner believes women and men should not work in close physical proximity to each other so it won\u2019t hire women?\n\n\"Although the Court attempts to cabin its language to closely held corporations, its logic extends to corporations of any size, public or private,\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in a dissenting opinion. \"Little doubt that RFRA \u2014 the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act the majority opinion cited \u2014 claims will proliferate, for the Court\u2019s expansive notion of corporate personhood \u2014 combined with its other errors in construing RFRA \u2014 invites for-profit entities to seek religion-based exemptions from regulations they deem offensive to their faith.\"\n\nIt seems unlikely the court would have been as accepting of a case brought by employers from minority religions such as Judaism, Islam or Hinduism. But this ruling allows business owners of any faith to claim religious exemptions. \"In a decision of startling breadth, the Court holds that commercial enterprises, including corporations, along with partnerships and sole proprietorships, can opt out of any law (saving only tax laws) they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs,\" wrote Ginsburg.\n\nThe ruling will probably be used to justify anti-gay business policies such as those of the Gortz Haus in Grimes, Iowa, whose owners claimed the Iowa Civil Rights Commission was forcing them to violate their religious beliefs by accommodating a same-sex wedding. Ginsburg cited the case of a New Mexico photographer refusing to photograph a lesbian couple\u2019s commitment ceremony for religious reasons. And in a Minnesota case, the born-again Christian owners of health clubs cited biblical objections to employing people who live together unmarried, as well as \"fornicators and homosexuals.\"\n\n\"Would RFRA require exemptions in cases of this ilk?\" asked Ginsburg\u2019s dissent. \"And if not, how does the Court divine which religious beliefs are worthy of accommodation, and which are not?\" Under the Constitution\u2019s Establishment Clause, the government can\u2019t play favourites with religions.\n\nThe court\u2019s conservative majority may have thought it was protecting the religious rights of Christian-owned companies by contradicting an earlier ruling that upheld the firings and denial of unemployment benefits to two Native Americans who used peyote \u2014 illegal in Oregon \u2014 as part of their religious ceremony. That ruling said, \"An individual\u2019s religious beliefs (do not) excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the state is free to regulate\" In this case, as Ginsburg pointed out, the Affordable Care law is being broken.\n\nMuch as some might wish otherwise, America is a pluralistic nation without a state religion, and the government is not allowed to pick and choose which religions can claim certain rights or exemptions. The ironic result of this wrongheaded ruling may be that business-owners of every faith will claim a religious right to discriminate, in decisions from health coverage to employment to buying, selling and accommodations. That\u2019s a long way from how the founders conceived of religious freedom.\n\nRekha Basu is a columnist for the Des Moines Register.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Let\u2019s say that I\u2019m an observant Hindu who keeps a strict vegetarian diet because my reli... - Analysis - Winnipeg Free Press.", "og": {"article": {"author": "Rekha Basu"}, "image": "http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/707*432/HOBBY_LOBBY_17714165.jpg", "description": "Let\u2019s say that I\u2019m an observant Hindu who keeps a strict vegetarian diet because my religion frowns on killing animals.
