He also couldn\u2019t resist taking a holier-than-thou tone toward his tail-between-their-legs Tea Party foes. He assumed his favorite role of the shining knight hectoring the benighted: Sir Lecturealot.\n\n\u201cAll of us need to stop focusing on the lobbyists and the bloggers and the talking heads on radio and the professional activists who profit from conflict,\u201d he sermonized. (We have met the enemy and they are . . . bloggers?)\n\nCertainly, the House Republicans who held their breath until the country turned blue acted like foolhardy children on what John McCain called \u201ca fool\u2019s errand.\u201d\n\nThe country agreed. So it probably wasn\u2019t necessary for papa to preach, overacting the role of weary parent watching the irresponsible kids make their mistakes.\n\nSir Lecturealot, who hates selling and explaining and negotiating and cajoling and knocking noggins, always manages to convey tedium at the idea that he actually has to persuade people to come along with him, given the fact that he feels he\u2019s doing what\u2019s right.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nObama says he will now work for an immigration bill and a budget deal with deficit cuts. But as Peter Nicholas and Carol E. Lee pointed out in The Wall Street Journal, the president did not mention his more ambitious goals: hiking the minimum wage, widening access to preschool education, and shoring up bridges and roads.\n\n\u201cThose efforts require bipartisan consensus that may be even more elusive amid the ill will carried over from the budget fight,\u201d they wrote.\n\nSenator McCain, who excoriated the Tea Party zanies and voted with the president, indicated to The Journal that the president had poisoned the well. \u201cA lot of us are resentful that he didn\u2019t negotiate as hard as we think he could have or should have,\u201d he said. He told CNN that if Obama does not \u201cengage\u201d with his adversaries, \u201cobviously you\u2019re not going to be a successful president.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDemocrats, too, chided the president for being the diffident debutante.\n\n\u201cThis is a town where it\u2019s not enough to feel you have the right answers,\u201d Leon Panetta, the former congressman, Clinton chief of staff, C.I.A. director and defense chief, pointedly told Washington reporters. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to roll up your sleeves, and you\u2019ve got to really engage in the process.\u201d\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein also urged presidential leadership, noting that Obama \u201cstepped back\u201d partly because he felt \u201cburned\u201d by all the scabrous budget fights. But as Mark Twain said, \u201cWe should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove lid again and that is well but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.\u201d\n\nAnd if Obama is anything, he\u2019s a cold cat on a hot stove.\n\nWashington is surpassingly nutty right now, but the founding fathers did build a system designed for factional warfare. When sweet reasonableness doesn\u2019t work, Obama\u2019s default position is didactic disdain. He underuses the fear and charm cards. When he first saw the White House movie theater, he was surprised there were so many seats beyond what the first family would need. Bill Clinton, on the other hand, probably would have built a balcony and auctioned off seats, if he could have.\n\nAs Valerie Jarrett told David Remnick in \u201cThe Bridge,\u201d Obama\u2019s \u201cuncanny\u201d abilities need to be properly engaged, or he disengages. \u201cHe\u2019s been bored to death his whole life,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just too talented to do what ordinary people do.\u201d\n\nMatt Viser wrote in The Boston Globe that, while Obama soared talking about getting past blue-and-red slicing and dicing, the blue states are getting bluer and the red states redder. In his stateside travel schedule, political meetings, staffing and legislative accomplishments, Obama has cleaved to the blue side more than he has tried to reach out to the red side, Viser wrote.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter Sir Lecturealot admonished both parties on their divisiveness in his 2010 State of the Union address, Viser said, the president did not have his first one-on-one with John Boehner for another year and a half, and has only met individually with Mitch McConnell twice.\n\nWhen the president says \u201cwe\u2019ve all got a lot of work to do,\u201d he means Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi. Obamacare should really be called Pelosicare, as the historian Niall Ferguson noted. And an unyielding Reid made sure Obama didn\u2019t cave as in the past, which had emboldened Republicans to challenge the president this time. Obama is the anti-Lyndon Johnson.\n\nHe thinks he can come down from above, de haut en bas, and play the great reconciler, but you can\u2019t reconcile in absentia. You have to be there. You\u2019ve got to be all over these people.\n\nThe paradox of Obama is that he believes in his own magical powers, but then he doesn\u2019t turn up to use them.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a president breaking a sweat somewhere beyond the basketball court.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20131019143007, "twitter": {"description": "Sir Lecturealot admonishes the Mad Tea Party Hatters who turned America blue (emotionally and politically).", "creator": "NYTimesDowd", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/opinion/sunday/cat-on-a-hot-stove.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002507594"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Cat on a Hot Stove", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/dowd-circular/dowd-circular-thumbLarge-v8.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/opinion/sunday/cat-on-a-hot-stove.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002507594", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/opinion/sunday/cat-on-a-hot-stove.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/sunday", "hdl_p": "Cat on A Hot Stove", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 19, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/maureendowd/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-01-01", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Shutdowns (Institutional)", "published": "2013-10-19", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "keywords": "Obama  Barack,United States Politics and Government,Federal Budget (US),Republican Party,House of Representatives,Shutdowns (Institutional)", "description": "Sir Lecturealot admonishes the Mad Tea Party Hatters who turned America blue (emotionally and politically).", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Maureen Dowd", "SCG": "sunday", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "slug": "20dowd", "byl": "By MAUREEN DOWD", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Sir Lecturealot admonishes the Mad Tea Party Hatters who turned America blue (emotionally and politically).", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "utime": 20160101140423, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/dowd-circular/dowd-circular-thumbStandard-v6.jpg", "CN": "maureen-dowd", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 19, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "org": "House of Representatives", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "CT": "column", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/opinion/sunday/cat-on-a-hot-stove.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/dowd-circular/dowd-circular-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Sir Lecturealot admonishes the Mad Tea Party Hatters who turned America blue (emotionally and politically).", "title": "Cat on a Hot Stove"}, "pdate": 20131019, "des": "Shutdowns (Institutional)", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/maureen-dowd", "tagline": "American politics, popular culture and international affairs.", "uri": "/column/maureen-dowd", "display-name": "Maureen Dowd", "identifier": "maureen-dowd", "type": "column"}, "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "articleid": 100000002507594, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Cat on a Hot Stove", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/dowd-circular/dowd-circular-thumbLarge-v8.jpg", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd6e0\"", "article_summary": "She will never sit down on a hot stove lid again and that is well but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.\u201dAnd if Obama is anything, he\u2019s a cold cat on a hot stove.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 PRESIDENT OBAMA won big.\nBut as Mark Twain said, \u201cWe should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove lid.\nAs Valerie Jarrett told David Remnick in \u201cThe Bridge,\u201d Obama\u2019s \u201cuncanny\u201d abilities need to be properly engaged, or he disengages.\nWhen the president says \u201cwe\u2019ve all got a lot of work to do,\u201d he means Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi."}
