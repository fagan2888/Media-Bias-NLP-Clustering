And the Redskins, who coach Jay Gruden suggested could have been 7-2 going into this game, save for some bad breaks here and there, are now 3-7 and staring at a repeat of the 3-13 season last year that got Mike Shanahan fired.\n\nGriffin said the performance was a \u201ctravesty.\u201d Gruden said it was \u201ca horrific game.\u201d\n\nIt was also Gruden who has said that \u201cthe jury is still out\u201d on Griffin as an elite NFL quarterback, and Griffin\u2019s performance against Tampa only raised more doubts about his future.\n\nHow bad did he look before the jury Sunday?\n\nWell, just imagine if the glove had fit.\n\nGriffin completed 23 of 32 passes for just 207 yards, with one touchdown and two interceptions. He was sacked six times \u2014 a chronic problem with no evidence of improving.\n\nDeSean Jackson who came into the game leading the NFL averaging nearly 22 yards per catch \u2014 caught just four passes for only 35 yards. Pierre Garcon, who set a franchise record last season with league-leading 113 receptions? Just one catch for six yards.\n\nIf Griffin is judged by a jury of his peers \u2014 his teammates \u2014 I suspect Garcon, in particular, under oath, wouldn\u2019t be a character witness.\n\nThe seven measly points the Redskins could muster with Griffin at quarterback was damning evidence that this quarterback is so far removed from the 2012 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year who led Washington to the NFC East division title that, looking in the mirror, he probably wouldn\u2019t recognize himself.\n\nAnd, according to Griffin, he will be looking in the mirror a lot, and wants his teammates to as well.\n\n\u201cI need every man in that locker room, player and coach, to look themselves in the mirror and say, \u2018What can I do better,\u2019\u201d he told reporters. Later he added, \u201cWe are not a very good football team right now and we have a long way to go. Every guy has to look at himself in the mirror and say that.\u201d\n\nIf Griffin looked in a mirror Sunday, he would see one of the distorted funhouse mirror images.\n\nHe would not see an elite NFL quarterback.\n\nHe nearly saw Colt McCoy Sunday.\n\nWhen asked if he considered taking out the quarterback who had yet to win a game for the Redskins this year in favor of the quarterback who has not lost a game for this team this season, Gruden suggested the only reason he didn\u2019t was because, by that point, he had surrendered.\n\n\u201cOnce it got to be 27-7, with about nine or 10 minutes to go, then they had the long drive and we didn\u2019t get the ball back until five minutes to go, I didn\u2019t think there was any point, really,\u201d Gruden said. \u201d I thought it was smart to just run the clock out and get out of here and lick our wounds and move onto the next one.\u201d\n\nNot exactly glowing testimony of support.\n\nThe jury in the stands at FedEx Field may have thought there was a point. Some chanted, \u201cWe want Colt. We want Colt.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Griffin, though, who is on trial, and expect it to be a long one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to coach him up and find out what\u2019s holding him back,\u201d Gruden said. He went on to say that Griffin \u201chas got to continue to grow and get better, and I see every week that he is a great player that struggles at the quarterback position. We\u2019ve got to do a better job of coaching him up and getting in his brain and finding out what he knows and what he doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nGriffin once declared to the world what he knew when he famously adopted the hashtag \u201cknow your why\u201d and once told Fox Sports that wins on the field don\u2019t come if you don\u2019t \u201cknow your why.\u201d\n\nHe seems to have lost his why \u2014 and his way. Maybe he\u2019ll find it in the mirror.\n\n\u2022 Thom Loverro is co-host of \u201cThe Sports Fix,\u201d noon to 2 p.m. daily on ESPN 980 and espn980.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The trial of Robert Griffin III \u2014 whether or not he can be an elite NFL quarterback \u2014 took a dramatic turn for the worse Sunday when the defendant took the stand and crumbled like a deadbeat tenant before Judge Judy.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The trial of Robert Griffin III \u2014 whether or not he can be an elite NFL quarterback \u2014 took a dramatic turn for the worse Sunday when the defendant took the stand and crumbled like a deadbeat tenant before Judge Judy.", "title": "LOVERRO: Robert Griffin III due for some soul-searching after \u2018travesty\u2019 of a loss", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/16/robert-griffin-iii-due-for-some-soul-searching-aft/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/16/redskins_5169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/16/redskins_5169.jpg", "description": "The trial of Robert Griffin III \u2014 whether or not he can be an elite NFL quarterback \u2014 took a dramatic turn for the worse Sunday when the defendant took the stand and crumbled like a deadbeat tenant be", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "LOVERRO: Robert Griffin III due for some soul-searching after \u2018t"}, "Author": "Thom Loverro", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Robert Griffin Iii, Jay Gruden, NFL, Washington Redskins"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8ff\"", "article_summary": "He would not see an elite NFL quarterback.\nANALYSIS/OPINION:The trial of Robert Griffin III \u2014 whether or not he can be an elite NFL quarterback \u2014 took a dramatic turn for the worse Sunday when the defendant took the stand and crumbled like a deadbeat tenant before Judge Judy.\nAnd, according to Griffin, he will be looking in the mirror a lot, and wants his teammates to as well.\nGriffin completed 23 of 32 passes for just 207 yards, with one touchdown and two interceptions.\n\u2022 Thom Loverro is co-host of \u201cThe Sports Fix,\u201d noon to 2 p.m. daily on ESPN 980 and espn980.com"}
