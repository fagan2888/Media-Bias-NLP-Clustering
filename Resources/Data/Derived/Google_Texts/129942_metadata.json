What I \u2018got\u2019 is an STD from one of the many women who now get free birth control and a website I can\u2019t access. Now you Can to. Thanks Obamacare!\u201d The bottom of the cartoon reads #gotbrokencondom #gotherpes #gotpregnant #gotchildsupport.\n\nThe cartoon is a parody for an ad for Obamacare from DoYouGotInsurance.com that shows a girl giving a thumbs up while holding a pack of birth control pills next to her partner.\n\nThe artist A.F. Branco\u2019s work on the site also includes a drawing of President Barack Obama murdering a doctor with a giant sword.\n\nThere is no evidence that access to health insurance or birth control leads to an increase in STDs.\n\nBranco gave the following statement about the cartoon early Wednesday morning, according to the Huffington Post:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not against birth control nor do I feel that it is any of my business what people do sexually. However, I do feel that contraceptives are inexpensive and accessible enough that I shouldn\u2019t have to pay for them through my taxes. I also feel that my government shouldn\u2019t be promoting promiscuous sex as though condoms are the answer to all STDs and promiscuous behavior.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An anti-Obamcare cartoon posted on the website Comically Incorrect claims that men will get more sexually transmitted diseases from \"women who now get free birth control\" thanks to the health care reform law.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://swampland.time.com/2013/11/27/cartoon-claims-obamacare-will-give-men-stds-because-women-can-afford-birth-control-now/", "type": "article", "image": "https://timeswampland.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/o-obamacare-570.jpg?w=570", "site_name": "TIME.com", "title": "Cartoon Claims Obamacare Will Give Men STDs because Women Can Afford Birth Control Now | TIME.com"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Political insight from the Beltway and beyond", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://swampland.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/11d9978cfec7d5a71822113fdc067df5?s=16", "application-name": "Swampland", "keywords": "health care, uncategorized, birth control, condom, obamacare, patient protection and affordable care act, sexually transmitted disease", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "health care, uncategorized, birth control, condom, obamacare, patient protection and affordable care act, sexually transmitted disease"}, "article_summary": "There is no evidence that access to health insurance or birth control leads to an increase in STDs.\nThe cartoon shows a woman with sores on her mouth and birth control pills in her hand who asks the man next to her, \u201cGot insurance?\u201d The angry man replies, \u201cNo!\nWhat I \u2018got\u2019 is an STD from one of the many women who now get free birth control and a website I can\u2019t access.\n\u00a9 Antonio BrancoAn anti-Obamcare cartoon posted on the website Comically Incorrect claims that men will get more sexually transmitted diseases from \u201cwomen who now get free birth control\u201d thanks to the health care reform law.\nThe cartoon is a parody for an ad for Obamacare from DoYouGotInsurance.com that shows a girl giving a thumbs up while holding a pack of birth control pills next to her partner."}
