And that foot is me.\u201d\n\nAnd so it goes with Sen. Ted Cruz, at least when it comes to killing Obamacare. The first-term GOP Texan is the self-appointed executioner of a law Republicans despise. But truth be told, it\u2019s hard to figure out exactly what Cruz\u2019s faux filibuster on the Senate floor last night was really about. He\u2019s against big, bad Obamacare, we get it. Only he was asking Senate Republicans to vote against something that would actually kill Obamacare. Huh?\n\nNevermind. None of this has been about reality. Rather, it\u2019s about cementing a new definition of leadership: Positioning yourself as the spokesman for your political base by telling it exactly what it wants to hear. In Cruz\u2019s case, it\u2019s the tea party base. Lucky for him, there\u2019s a made-for-TV bully pulpit, plenty of time to talk and the talking points are easy and oh, so, predictable.\n\nConsider this sound bite extraordinaire: \u201cThis is a fight to restore freedom to the people,\u201d says Cruz, clearly not inhibited by any lack of self-importance. \u201cThis is a fight to get the Washington establishment, the empire, to listen to the people.\u201d\n\nNot exactly Abraham Lincoln, but it\u2019s a whammy of a bite. In it, Cruz gets to cuddle the tea party while taking on the evil establishment \u2014 and by that he means the awful folks in his own party who would not shut down the government over a doomed move to kill Obamacare. Imagine that: Republicans refusing to catapult a man they don\u2019t like into the presidential arena.\n\nMaybe they\u2019re part of Cruz\u2019s evil establishment, but if they are, they\u2019re trying to save him \u2014 and the party \u2014 from itself on the issue of shutting down the government. Cruz is thinking 2016, but they\u2019re thinking about the repercussions for the GOP if the government shuts down.\n\nWhile some polls show that two-thirds of tea party sympathizers are just fine with a shutdown over health care reform, a majority of independent voters are not. And last time I checked, those are the folks whom the GOP needs to win over if its going to win the White House. But I digress.\n\nRight now, Cruz has divided the Republican Party in a Palinesque way, only worse because he is an actual senator with actual authority who could have an actual presidential candidacy.\n\n\u201cWe have been beaten up by his so-called grassroots movement back home. They pound us with ads, we hear about what he wants at town halls. We don\u2019t like Obamacare, either. But there\u2019s another way to go about this,\u201d says a senior House Republican. \u201cHe [Cruz] won one primary in a red state in a Republican year, and now he\u2019s busy running for president.\u201d\n\nOh, and by the way, he adds, \u201che\u2019s all about raising money. And doing it at our expense.\u201d\n\nWhy is it at the GOP\u2019s expense? Because Republicans are now afraid of being challenged from the right in primaries. They\u2019re not worried about their Democratic opponents; they\u2019re worried about the opponents on their right whom, many believe, Cruz would support and throw them under the bus. They\u2019re against Obamacare, but are they against it enough?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a demagogue-and-a-half,\u201d complains the House Republican. \u201cThis is not what you do to your teammates.\u201d\n\nAh, but that\u2019s the crux of it all: Cruz doesn\u2019t need a team. He\u2019s got the floor to himself. And he\u2019s got the people, right?\n\nThat is, until he doesn\u2019t.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This isn't the idealism of 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.\" It isn't as dark as \"House of Cards,\" either.
