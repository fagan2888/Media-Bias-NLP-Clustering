The journal\u2019s February 2016 issue on vaccines will examine progress from 2010-2015 in accelerating vaccine introduction and the impact on child health and survival, the economic benefits of expanded coverage, and policy lessons from experience.\n\nWhile the submission deadline for traditional research manuscripts for this theme issue has passed, the Narrative Matters section of the journal is still accepting essay submissions on this topic, with the goal of selecting one for publication in the February issue.\n\nRemember, Narrative Matters features personal stories about experiences with the health care system and the people in it, using the power of literary nonfiction to highlight an important public policy issue. We\u2019re interested in well-written policy narratives, told as first-person stories.\n\nIf you have a policy narrative on the topic of vaccines that you\u2019d like us to consider for publication in the theme issue, send it our way.
