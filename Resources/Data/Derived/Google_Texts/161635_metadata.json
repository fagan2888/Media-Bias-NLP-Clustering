U.S. oil production has leveled off but has not dramatically declined. Meanwhile, oil prices are at their lowest levels since the financial crisis and the revenues of OPEC members have fallen precipitously along with the price of crude.\n\nAll of that is true, and in fact, Saudi Arabia is under tremendous pressure. The Saudi government is considering slashing spending by a staggering 10 percent as it seeks to stop the budget deficit from growing any bigger. The IMF predicts that Saudi Arabia could run a budget deficit that amounts to about 20 percent of GDP.\n\nThe pain is manifesting itself in different ways. Not only will the Kingdom have to cut spending, but it has also turned to the bond markets in a big way. Low oil prices have forced Saudi Arabia to issue bonds with maturities over 12 months for the first time in eight years, raising 35 billion riyals (around $10 billion) so far in 2015.\n\nRelated: As Oil Prices Fall, Putin\u2019s Russia Faces a Long, Cold Winter\n\nAt the same time, the currency is coming under increasing pressure. Saudi Arabia pegs the riyal to the dollar at a rate of about 3.75:1, but speculation is rising that the currency may need to be devalued, given that the oil producer won\u2019t be able to defend that ratio indefinitely. On one-year forward markets, the riyal has alreadyweakened to 3.79, according to the FT. That forced the government to issue a statement, saying that the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency \u201cis committed to the policy of pegging the Saudi riyal with the American dollar.\u201d But if oil prices do not rebound, the government will have to continue to draw down on its foreign exchange in order to keep the currency steady.\n\nAll the damage inflicted upon Saudi Arabia has the world looking back towards Riyadh, especially after oil prices crashed on \u201cMeltdown Monday.\u201d The markets are trying to figure out if Saudi Arabia may switch tactics in order to stop the crash from worsening.\n\nPressure is actually the greatest within the oil cartel. Algeria\u2019s oil minister wrote a letter to OPEC\u2019s secretariat requesting action, although the letter stopped short of a call for a production cut. Months earlier, before OPEC\u2019s last meeting in June, Venezuelan officials pressed for a change in strategy to shore up oil prices. Venezuela is arguably the worst off member, as its economic and financial crisis worsens by the day.\n\nMore recently, Iran\u2019s oil minister said that his country would increase oil production \u201cat any cost,\u201d but also supported an emergency OPEC meeting before the scheduled summit in December in order to discuss the group\u2019s strategy. More and more members are clamoring for a cutback in the cartel\u2019s production.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Oil Prices Are Suddenly Soaring\n\nIf Saudi Arabia\u2019s strategy of pursuing market share has not worked, and even its colleagues inside OPEC want a policy change, perhaps Riyadh would reconsider and now decide to restrict production in order to boost prices?\n\nThat is more wishful thinking than a likely possibility. There is little chance that Riyadh would retreat now just as the worst pain is really beginning to set in for rival producers. Sure, Saudi Arabia is suffering from low prices, but its competitors are hurting worse. U.S. oil production, after years of blistering growth, has not only ground to a halt, but has started to decline. Output peaked in March at 9.69 million barrels per day (mb/d), dropping to 9.51 mb/d in May (the latest month for which accurate data is available). In all likelihood, the decline has picked up pace in the intervening months.\n\nAnd more to the point, U.S. oil production will continue to decline the longer Saudi Arabia holds out. Several companies have already gone bankrupt, and more are no doubt coming down the pike. That will allow Saudi Arabia to achieve its goal of holding onto market share, and letting prices adjust on the back of rival producers.\n\nTo highlight this point, Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to cut its budget should be seen not as evidence that it is buckling under crushing weight of low prices, but that it is in the game for the long haul. It is shrinking its budget to fit a world of depressed oil prices, positioning itself to ride the wave as far as it goes. Cutting spending is actually a signal of the government\u2019s resolve in regards to its current oil strategy, not a sign of wavering.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com\n\nRead more from OilPrice.com:\n\nWhy Today\u2019s Oil Bust Is Not Like The 1980s\n\nNuclear Utility Suffers Setback As DC Pursues Clean Energy\n\nA Winter Of Discontent For Russia", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Nine months after OPEC decided to leave its production target unchanged and pursue mar", "title": "Here\u2019s Why Saudi Arabia Can\u2019t Cut Oil Production", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/28/Here-s-Why-Saudi-Arabia-Can-t-Cut-Oil-Production", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/oil-energy-oil_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/28/Here-s-Why-Saudi-Arabia-Can-t-Cut-Oil-Production", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/oil-energy-oil_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Nine months after OPEC decided to leave its production target unchanged and pursue mar", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "And more to the point, U.S. oil production will continue to decline the longer Saudi Arabia holds out.\nU.S. oil production, after years of blistering growth, has not only ground to a halt, but has started to decline.\nAll of that is true, and in fact, Saudi Arabia is under tremendous pressure.\nThe IMF predicts that Saudi Arabia could run a budget deficit that amounts to about 20 percent of GDP.\nU.S. oil production has leveled off but has not dramatically declined."}
