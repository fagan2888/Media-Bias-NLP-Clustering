T he National Health Interview Survey finds that the number of uninsured people has declined from 44.8 million in 2013, before ObamaCare\u2019s coverage expansion took effect, to 29 million in the first quarter of 2015. The uninsured rate fell from 14.4 percent in 2013 to 9.2 percent in 2015, according to the CDC.\n\nTo be sure, it\u2019s an arbitrary threshold, but the fact that the uninsured rate has dropped to single digits is both encouraging and historic \u2013 since public officials began keeping track, it\u2019s never been this low in the United States.\n\nLooking closer at the data, note that the CDC data is based on surveys conducted between January and March.

But it\u2019s not the only metric that helps prove the system\u2019s efficacy.\n\nAt last week\u2019s big Fox News debate for the Republican presidential candidates, Obamacare barely came up \u2013 which only helped reinforce the fact that the controversy surrounding the law has lost its political potency.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "If you're desperately waiting for the Affordable Care Act to fail, and for the entire Obamacare-based American system to collapse, this week must be crushing.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obamacare-opponents-fall-hard-times", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "If you're desperately waiting for the Affordable Care Act to fail, and for the entire Obamacare-based American system to collapse, this week must be crushing.", "title": "'Obamacare' opponents fall on hard times", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obamacare-opponents-fall-hard-times", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/ap156717931519_copy.jpg?itok=RZEMVkHH", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obamacare-opponents-fall-hard-times", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/ap156717931519_copy.jpg?itok=STUITm5q", "height": 553}, "title": "'Obamacare' opponents fall on hard times", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "If you're desperately waiting for the Affordable Care Act to fail, and for the entire Obamacare-based American system to collapse, this week must be crushing."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-08-13T10:22:23-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "'Obamacare' opponents fall on hard times", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care,health-care-reform,obamacare,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "08/13/2015 10:22:23 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obamacare-opponents-fall-hard-times"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "If you're desperately waiting for the Affordable Care Act to fail, and for the entire Obamacare-based American system to collapse, this week must be crushing.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Affordable Care Act, Health Care, Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "The uninsured rate fell from 14.4 percent in 2013 to 9.2 percent in 2015, according to the CDC.\nIn the five months since then, it\u2019s likely the uninsured rate has improved a little more \u2013 Charles Gaba pegs the figure at about 8.8%And this wasn\u2019t the only bit of good news.\nT he National Health Interview Survey finds that the number of uninsured people has declined from 44.8 million in 2013, before ObamaCare\u2019s coverage expansion took effect, to 29 million in the first quarter of 2015.\nTo be sure, it\u2019s an arbitrary threshold, but the fact that the uninsured rate has dropped to single digits is both encouraging and historic \u2013 since public officials began keeping track, it\u2019s never been this low in the United States.\nLooking closer at the data, note that the CDC data is based on surveys conducted between January and March."}
