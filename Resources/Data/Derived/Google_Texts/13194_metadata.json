They hope the state rankings will serve as a guide to inform their decisions on where to set up practice. A wrong move could make or break their medical careers.\n\nOn its surface, California\u2019s ranking seems \u2018fair-to-middling\u2019 but upon close examination it may be prescient of difficult days ahead for patients, and the potential for a critical physician labor shortage.\n\nHere\u2019s why. The ranking is based on two scores: Opportunity and Competition, and Medical Quality.\n\nSadly, California ranks in the bottom third of all states when it comes to \u2018Opportunity and Competition,\u2019 earning the number 31 spot on the list. Researchers calculated their findings based on things like annual wages, starting salaries, insured population, number of hospitals, and current and future competition. Mississippi ranked number 1; the District of Columbia was dead last at 51.\n\nThe criteria to determine \u2018Medical Quality\u2019 were punitive medical boards, malpractice payouts and the cost of malpractice liability insurance. In this category, California ranks at number 5. Minnesota has the best score and New York\u2019s rank is the worst.\n\nBack in 2004, a study at UC Berkeley titled Is There A Doctor In The House painted a rosy picture of the state when it came to patient/doctor ratios. Nonetheless, it warned that California could face a physician shortage in the future because the numbers of young doctors entering the market was not keeping apace with the rate of retiring physicians.\n\nWith the onset of the Affordable Care Act, and expansion Medi-Cal, it appears that future is now. The once Golden State for the medical profession is facing a real shortage of doctors. The Wallet Hub study drives home how difficult it will be to avert a crisis if young doctors find it just too costly and competitive to live here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California was once one of the best places in the country for doctors to live and practice medicine, but those days seem long gone.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/03/28/california-no-longer-the-golden-state-for-young-doctors-who-want-to-practice-medicine/", "image": {"width": 714, "secure_url": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/thinkstockphotos-472119826.jpg?w=714", "identifier": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/thinkstockphotos-472119826.jpg?w=714", "height": 494}, "type": "article", "description": "California was once one of the best places in the country for doctors to live and practice medicine, but those days seem long gone.", "title": "California No Longer Golden State For Young Doctors Who Want To Practice Medicine"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/thinkstockphotos-472119826.jpg?w=714", "title": "California No Longer Golden State For Young Doctors Who Want To Practice Medicine", "site": "cbssf", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "California was once one of the best places in the country for doctors to live and practice medicine, but those days seem long gone."}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of SF", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS San Francisco", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "keywords": "business, local, news, syndicated local, california, doctors, medi-cal, medical practice, physician shortage, wallet hub", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSSanFrancisco", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSSanFrancisco"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/73943609873d357bc6a7462619ad7be9?s=16", "news_keywords": "california, doctors, medi-cal, medical practice, physician shortage, wallet hub"}, "article_summary": "The Wallet Hub study drives home how difficult it will be to avert a crisis if young doctors find it just too costly and competitive to live here.\nA new study by the online financial gurus at Wallet Hub ranks the Golden State at #20 on 2016\u2019s Best and Worst States for Doctors.\nThe once Golden State for the medical profession is facing a real shortage of doctors.\nIn this category, California ranks at number 5.\nSAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) \u2014 California was once one of the best places in the country for doctors to live and practice medicine, but those days may be long gone."}
