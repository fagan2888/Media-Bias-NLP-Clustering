Earlier this week, the first case was identified in Hong Kong, and now a second has been confirmed as well.\n\nAn 80-year-old man living in Hong Kong was hospitalized at Tuen Mun Hospital with the flu after developing a fever. Originally from the border city of Shenzhen in the mainland of China, the man moved to Hong Kong just this week. The city government will reportedly move the patient to the isolation ward at Princess Margaret Hospital, as well as tighten controls over travelers entering the city, making sure to observe their health conditions and any sign of fever. The avian flu, though it is difficult to transfer from human to human, can be fatal. Typically humans contract the virus from handling birds, dead animals, or from being in contaminated environments.\n\nOn Dec. 2, a 30-year-old man with a \u201chistory of poultry contact\u201d came down with the H7N9 bird flu in Hong Kong. Since then, the city has been attempting to bolster its defenses to prevent an outbreak. \u201cWe cannot afford to take it easy or relax, as we are facing a new virus,\u201d said Premier Li Keqiang, who was touring China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention with reporters, according to CNN.\n\nCases of H7N9 found in humans first began sprouting in February of this year, according to Chinese officials. In April, they began to surge; and in the summer the number of cases dropped to five. As of Nov. 6, there have been a total of 139 confirmed cases, according to the World Health Organization. \u201cAs yet, there is limited information about the scope of the disease the virus causes and about the source of exposure,\u201d the WHO writes on its website. \u201cThere is no indication thus far that it can be transmitted between people, but both animal-to-human and human-to-human routes of transmission are being actively investigated.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wrote a report on its website, noting that the number of cases dropped off in the summer because the avian virus has a seasonal cycle. \u201cThe decrease in H7N9 cases over the summer likely resulted from a combination of control measures taken by Chinese authorities \u2014 like closing live bird markets \u2014 and a change in weather,\u201d the CDC stated. \u201cStudies indicate that avian influenza viruses, like seasonal influenza viruses, have a seasonal pattern: they circulate at higher levels in cold weather and at lower levels in warm weather.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hong kong, h7n9, bird flu, avian flu, china, health, cdc", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The new strain of bird flu found in China has hospitalized an 80-year-old man, the second case in Hong Kong.", "title": "Second H7N9 Bird Flu Case Confirmed In Hong Kong", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/second-h7n9-bird-flu-case-confirmed-hong-kong-chinese-officials-scramble-prevent-pandemic-264556", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/07/birds.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The new strain of bird flu found in China has hospitalized an 80-year-old man, the second case in Hong Kong.", "title": "Second H7N9 Bird Flu Case Confirmed In Hong Kong", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/second-h7n9-bird-flu-case-confirmed-hong-kong-chinese-officials-scramble-prevent-pandemic-264556", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/07/birds.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/07/birds.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-12-07T13:53:50-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-07T13:53:49-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The new strain of bird flu found in China has hospitalized an 80-year-old man, the second case in Hong Kong."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7eca\"", "article_summary": "Earlier this week, the first case was identified in Hong Kong, and now a second has been confirmed as well.\nAn 80-year-old man living in Hong Kong was hospitalized at Tuen Mun Hospital with the flu after developing a fever.\nOn Dec. 2, a 30-year-old man with a \u201chistory of poultry contact\u201d came down with the H7N9 bird flu in Hong Kong.\nOriginally from the border city of Shenzhen in the mainland of China, the man moved to Hong Kong just this week.\nCases of H7N9 found in humans first began sprouting in February of this year, according to Chinese officials."}
