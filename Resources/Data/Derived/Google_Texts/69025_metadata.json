And its roots dig deep.\n\nIn the 1990s, Air Force Academy superintendent Lt. Gen. Tad Oelstrom and his wife spent more than $220,000 of taxpayer money on home improvements to their already lavish (and free) house at the academy.\n\nIncluded in the taxpayers\u2019 bill was a $20,000 dishwasher that cleaned and dried a load of dishes in 90 seconds.\n\nAfter the story of the misspent money came out, nothing much happened. Oelstrom was given a slap on the wrist by the Air Force. He retired early, with his huge military pension intact, and went to work at Harvard.\n\nThen there are the academy\u2019s roads.\n\nIn 2005 I uncovered and wrote stories for other media about the academy\u2019s practice of making sure no money was left in its drawer at the end of each fiscal year. Sometimes, spending all that taxpayer money allocated by Congress takes imagination.\n\nSo that year, in a frantic effort to throw money away, the academy repaved a mile of road \u2014 Pine Drive \u2014 that had been repaved just 20 months earlier. There was hardly a crack in the asphalt surface when it was torn up.\n\nThe cost to repave that 1-mile stretch of two-lane road: $250,000. It was part of a 6-mile repaving project \u2014 all totally unnecessary \u2014 that cost us $1.5 million.\n\nGreg Danis, owner of Danis Asphalt in Colorado Springs, knew all about it.\n\n\u201cI was contacted to bid on an Air Force Academy paving job,\u201d Danis told me back then. \u201cSo I looked at the road and told them the asphalt was fine and the road definitely didn\u2019t need to be repaved. They told me they\u2019d find someone else. And they did.\u201d\n\nNothing changed because of the stories. The mindless paving continues today.\n\nEntitled. Macho. Arrogant. Untouchable.\n\nFrom former AFA football player Ben Garland, now with the Broncos, on last week\u2019s startling sexual assault story: \u201cThey will work through this adversity, fix the problem and own up to their responsibilities.\u201d\n\nOh, look. A monkey just flew by.\n\nContact Rich Tosches at richtosches@gmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tosches: Air Force Academy misdeeds?
