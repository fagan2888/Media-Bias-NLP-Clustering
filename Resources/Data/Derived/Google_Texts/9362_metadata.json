REUTERS/Jason Reed - RTR16K4I\n\n4004179\n\nThe head of one of Washington\u2019s most staunchly anti-Obamacare organizations had his health insurance plan canceled due to Obamacare.\n\nFormer Republican congressman Chris Chocola, president of the conservative Club for Growth, was notified Thursday that he would be losing coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI have an individual policy, my wife and I. We got our letter today. It\u2019s, I guess, classic language,\u201d Chocola told The Daily Caller, noting with a laugh that the letter tells him \u201cDon\u2019t Worry.\u201d\n\nChocola, who resides in Indiana, was until recently covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield, which is closely partnering with the Obama White House on Obamacare implementation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a search now for what the best options are. The deductibles are crazy, and we already have a high deductible,\u201d Chocola said. \u201cThey\u2019ve offered me a plan that\u2019s a 31 percent [price] increase but I don\u2019t know what the deductible is. I have a $3,000 deductible now.\u201d\n\nChocola said that new plans feature on his insurance company\u2019s website offer $12,000 and $6,000 deductibles.\n\nChocola noted that he\u2019s at least glad he can look for a plan on his insurance company\u2019s website and will not have to visit HealthCare.Gov.\n\nClub for Growth fought hard this summer to prevent Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell from agreeing to fund Obamacare, and the group\u2019s fight continues. Chocola noted that while he\u2019s worried about his plan, Democrats like Mark Pryor who voted for Obamacare should be even more worried come 2014.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Letter said \"Don't Worry\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The head of one of Washington's most staunchly anti-Obamacare organizations had his health insurance plan canceled due to Obamacare.
