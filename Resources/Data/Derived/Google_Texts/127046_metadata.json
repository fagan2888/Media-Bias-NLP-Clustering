As a result of the ACA Excise Tax on high-value health care plans that becomes effective in 2018, employers are continuing to employ benefits strategies that shift more costs to employees. Nearly two-thirds of large employers (63 percent) plan to increase employees' share of costs through changes to employee deductibles, employee co-pays or employer contributions.\n\nAs a result of the ACA Excise Tax on high-value health care plans that becomes effective in 2018, employers are continuing to employ benefits strategies that shift more costs to employees. Nearly two-thirds of large employers (63 percent) plan to increase employees' share of costs through changes to employee deductibles, employee co-pays or employer contributions. Reduce costs by emphasizing consumerism through plan design. More than one-third of large employers have introduced a high deductible plan. Of these employers, more than half (57 percent) have decided to offer a \u201cconsumer driven health plan\u201d to actively engage employees and their dependents in making smart health care decisions, which can ultimately help to reduce costs.\n\nMore than one-third of large employers have introduced a high deductible plan.

Expand benefits coverage beyond the ACA\u2019s full-time mandate . A majority of large organizations have or plan to extend benefits coverage beyond the mandated ACA full-time employee population (30 or more hours of service per week). The study found 61 percent have already extended such coverage or plan to do so. Of those who have already or plan to extend benefits coverage, the top reasons include: talent acquisition, talent retention and avoiding penalties.\n\n.

About two out of five large employers have limited or are planning to limit hours for some employees, but the majority of employers are not planning to change employee hours in response to ACA requirements. Most employers in the study offer coverage to all employees averaging at least 30 hours of service per week.\n\n\"The ACA has impacted many elements of workforce management, including HR, benefits, time, leaves of absence and payroll,\" said David Marini, division vice president and managing director, strategic advisory services at ADP. \"As employers continue to work toward ACA compliance, they should consider forming cross-functional teams equipped with the right tools and expertise to monitor and record employee hours, the affordability of coverage and rising health care costs.\"\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nHackensack University Health Network, Seton Hall to create medical school on former Roche campus\n\nIzod Center to close for at least 2 years, move some events to Pru Center\n\nMillennial Minded: Why you should rethink a no-pet policy at the office", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "Roseland-based ADP, a leading global provider of human resources and payroll services to employers, on Thursday released research that showed more than half of large employers \u2014 those with 1,00", "title": "Companies are still struggling to fully comply with the ACA, ADP report shows | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20150115/NJBIZ01/150119868/companies-are-still-struggling-to-fully-comply-with-the-aca-adp-report-shows", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20150115/NJBIZ01/150119868/AR/0/AR-150119868.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "Roseland-based ADP, a leading global provider of human resources and payroll services to employers, on Thursday released research that showed more than half of large employers \u2014 those with 1,00", "title": "Companies are still struggling to fully comply with the ACA, ADP report shows | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20150115/NJBIZ01/150119868/AR/0/AR-150119868.jpg"}, "creator": "@bethfitzgerald8", "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Roseland-based ADP, a leading global provider of human resources and payroll services to employers, on Thursday released research that showed more than half of large employers \u2014 those with 1,000 or more workers \u2014 are not prepared to comply with all ACA regulatory requirements.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd44ed\"", "article_summary": "Modify employee hours.\nIn response to ACA compliance requirements, the study found large employers plan to take a number of strategic workforce management and cost containment actions, including:Change employee benefits plans.\nOf those who have already or plan to extend benefits coverage, the top reasons include: talent acquisition, talent retention and avoiding penalties.\nExpand benefits coverage beyond the ACA\u2019s full-time mandate .\nNearly two-thirds of large employers (63 percent) plan to increase employees' share of costs through changes to employee deductibles, employee co-pays or employer contributions."}
