Prices for West Texas Intermediate oil slipped below the $30-a-barrel mark late Monday, after settling with a loss of nearly 6%. "Talk that the [Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries] will wait for non-OPEC assistance in raising prices is discouraging traders," said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research. Abdullah el-Badri, OPEC's secretary general, said at a conference in London that the cartel is ready to work with rivals to come up with a compromise following the crash in oil prices since the middle of 2014, according to The Telegraph. His comments were similar to remarks he has made in the past. March WTI oil clh6 traded at $29.74 a barrel in electronic trading, down from an earlier settlement at $30.34.
