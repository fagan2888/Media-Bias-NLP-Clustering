therefore, residents can access information, applications and enrollment through the federal market place at www.healthcare.gov.\n\nA team of Carteret County navigators will be working in the community to assist residents with the application and plan selection process.\n\n\u201cLast year we targeted food banks, libraries, the Broad Street Clinic,\u201d navigator Holly Powell with Legal Aid of NC Inc. told the News-Times in a phone interview Wednesday. \u201cThis year we\u2019re trying to target people who don\u2019t get insurance through their employer, but have jobs.\u201d\n\nMs. Powell and fellow navigator Hilary Schultz will be making appointments at the Carteret County Public Library in Beaufort, Mondays through Thursdays and Saturdays.\n\nNavigator Barbara Thomas will be on hand at the Broad Street Clinic in Morehead City Monday afternoons and Wednesdays, trying to reach out to those interested in getting covered.\n\nSeveral other volunteers with Get Covered Carteret are working to become certified as well, noted Ms. Powell.\n\nArea insurance agents are also setting appointments to help Carteret County residents through enrollment.\n\n\u201cWe are all booked next week,\u201d said Valerie Styron of Styron & Styron Insurance. \u201cThe marketplace was down \u2026 earlier this week, for improvements I would assume, but we\u2019re hopeful everything will be good to go.\u201d\n\nThough she said enrollment saw a somewhat lethargic response, a number of Carteret County residents enrolled in health insurance coverage during the inaugural year of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAccording to a report out of the federal Health and Human Services Planning and Evaluation Department, more than 2,500 Carteret County residents became covered through the exchange last year.\n\nThis year\u2019s strategy will work to target those who do not fall into the Medicaid gap, Ms. Powell said of work with Legal Aid of NC and Get Covered Carteret.\n\nThe gap, created by North Carolina\u2019s officials in turning down the federal Medicaid expansion, leaves no subsidies or relief for those families making less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, equating to an income of $27,310 for a family a three.\n\nMedicaid in North Carolina picks up through 50 percent or less of the federal poverty level, roughly $9,900 for a family of three, while subsidies assist individuals with affordable coverage between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, $11,670-$46,680.\n\n\u201cThis year we\u2019re trying to target small businesses, civic groups, chamber groups, small business roundtables,\u201d Ms. Powell said of accessing those in the 100 to 400 percent bracket.\n\nThe group also looks to partner with various organizations in the coming months to get the word out about enrollment, including Carteret Community College and the clinic.\n\nThe Carteret County Health Department will have navigator Shirley Johnson on hand beginning Monday, according to a press release.\n\nCarteret General Hospital officials could not say whether they would be able to connect interested patients with a navigator.\n\nIn addition to the state\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid and cover workers and families in the Medicaid gap, navigators also face several challenges in determining subsidy eligibility.\n\n\u201cWhat you have to do when you enroll is project your income for the next year,\u201d Ms. Powell explained. \u201cFor most people that\u2019s relatively easy, but for someone who works part-time, is self-employed or moves from job to job that can be a challenge.\u201d\n\nDetermining taxable household size can also be tricky, she noted and both weigh heavily on subsidy estimations during the application process.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten a lot of training and resources to help us and we\u2019re hoping this year it will be a bit less complicated,\u201d she said.\n\nIn other news, networks serving Carteret are expanding \u2013 Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina will still be the only provider for the area, but companies offering dental coverage have grown from one to four, with an expanded repertoire of area dentists.\n\nOnly three insurance providers opted into the federal marketplace for North Carolina, BCBS, Coventry Healthcare, which offered in more metropolitan areas, and FirstCarolinaCare, which operated in just six counties.\n\nClients who obtained coverage last year won\u2019t have to endure the application process again if they wish to simply renew, said Ms. Styron.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to get two mailings. The first, an overview of their subsidy, in case there was any discrepancy with their tax filing \u2026 the other is a renewal letter from Blue Cross with their new rates,\u201d she told the News-Times via phone. \u201cWe hope we don\u2019t have to see everyone we saw (last year) again because we just don\u2019t have the time. We\u2019re hoping renewal is transparent.\u201d\n\nFederal officials are banking on renewals going smoothly, as well. Democrats hope the Affordable Care Act\u2019s second year will be more successful than last year\u2019s launch \u2013 a botched rollout and buggy website that plagued the enrollment process, went down for hours at a time and forced the federal government to extend the period through March.\n\n\u201cThings will not be perfect,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell told the Associated Press. \u201cWe are aiming for strong consumer experience and it will be better.\u201d\n\nIn the fallout of the 2013 exchange launch, former health and human services secretary Kathleen Sebelius tendered her resignation over the website failure.\n\nStakes continue to be high this year, with federal officials projecting the insurance exchanges will cover a projected 13 million people in 2015.\n\nThe penalty for not having health insurance, a provision of the Affordable Care Act, is on the rise, as well.\n\nFor the uninsured in Carteret County that comes down to $295 or two percent of your income, whichever is greater, due with your tax bill.\n\n\u201cIt is a larger penalty, but it still isn\u2019t more than a couple months premium,\u201d Ms. Styron noted. \u201cSo there still isn\u2019t a big urge yet to enroll. It\u2019s not like people are clamoring to get signed up.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nContact Jackie Starkey at 726-7081, ext. 232; email jackie@thenewstimes.com; or follow on Twitter @jackieccnt.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Carolina Coast Online", "description": "MOREHEAD CITY \u2014\u00a0Carteret County residents interested in obtaining health coverage for 2015 will have a number of resources to get assistance as area navigators and insurance representatives prepare for a busy season enrolling.", "title": "Navigators, insurers prep for enrollment", "url": "http://www.carolinacoastonline.com/news_times/article_234fecc2-6c13-11e4-a10a-83e0c3cc9169.html", "image": "http://www.carolinacoastonline.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/facebook_share_img-2.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "MOREHEAD CITY \u2014\u00a0Carteret County residents interested in obtaining health coverage for 2015 will have a number of resources to get assistance as area navigators and insurance representatives prepare for a busy season enrolling.", "keywords": "obamacare,affordable care act,health care,insurance,health insurance,federal exchange,open enrollment,healthcare.gov,news_times,news", "news_keywords": "obamacare,affordable care act,health care,insurance,health insurance,federal exchange,open enrollment,healthcare.gov,news_times,news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9840\"", "article_summary": "The Carteret County Health Department will have navigator Shirley Johnson on hand beginning Monday, according to a press release.\nArea insurance agents are also setting appointments to help Carteret County residents through enrollment.\nA team of Carteret County navigators will be working in the community to assist residents with the application and plan selection process.\nThe penalty for not having health insurance, a provision of the Affordable Care Act, is on the rise, as well.\n\u201cWhat you have to do when you enroll is project your income for the next year,\u201d Ms. Powell explained."}
