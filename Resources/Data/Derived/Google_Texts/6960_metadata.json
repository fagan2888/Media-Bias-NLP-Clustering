No, what denizens of St. Louis and New York City ought to be worried about right now is . . . the crime wave overtaking Seattle.\n\nIf you don\u2019t understand why, then you probably thought Obamacare was about covering the uninsured. Like its health-care \u201creform\u201d campaign, the Obama Left\u2019s civil-rights crusade is about control \u2014 central control of state law enforcement by Washington.\n\nThe deaths of Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York are each tragic in their own way. But in neither is there a federal civil-rights case to be had. To think otherwise, you have to be getting your advice from Al Sharpton \u2014 the huckster confidant of President Obama and Attorney General Holder.\n\nThe law of civil rights requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, usually driven by racial prejudice, willfully acted \u2014 violently in these cases \u2014 with the evil purpose to deprive a person of specific federal rights. Let\u2019s put aside the utter absence of proof that race had any bearing on what happened in Staten Island, for example, where police supervised by an African-American officer came to the scene because of complaints about Garner by local business owners. It is virtually impossible to prove a civil-rights violation when there is no denying that police were engaged in a good-faith arrest and were put in the position of using force because a suspect resisted.\n\nIn Ferguson, Michael Brown did not merely resist arrest. Having just robbed a store, he was the aggressor in a confrontation with a police officer, who was made to fear for his life. And in Staten Island, there may be a real question about whether one police officer used excessive force under the circumstances; but there is no question that some quantum of force was appropriate in arresting a physically imposing suspect who insisted he would not be taken into custody and waved his arms to prevent the cops from cuffing him.\n\nFederal civil-rights cases are much harder to make than state homicide cases. They are supposed to be. They were conceived as a rare federal intrusion on the sovereign police power a state exercises within its territory. When police are engaged in an arrest because a crime really has been committed, and they use force because the suspect really does resist, the claim that they were actually scheming to deprive the suspect of his civil rights is asinine. The time to worry about the deprivation of civil rights, as Messrs. Williamson, Cooke, and Goldberg point out, is when progressives enact overbearing laws that criminalize things like untaxed cigarette sales, not when police dutifully carry them out.\n\nEric Holder knows this as well as anyone. The bloviating he is doing today about Ferguson and Staten Island is of a piece with the bloviating he was doing two years ago about Sanford, Fla. As I observed of the Trayvon Martin killing at the time, the attorney general huffed and puffed about bringing a civil-rights case against \u201cwhite Hispanic\u201d George Zimmerman, but he was never actually going to file one. It would have been even more embarrassing than the trumped-up murder case he and Sharpton browbeat Florida into charging \u2014 the one the jury threw out in nothing flat.\n\nHolder and his constitutional-scholar boss are not banging the civil-rights drum because they believe these are prosecutable cases. It is just a pretext for unleashing Justice Department community organizers on state and municipal police departments.\n\nThe government cannot win a standalone loser of a civil-rights prosecution by crying, \u201cDisparate impact!\u201d Individual cases that have been demagogued by the racial-grievance industry become high profile. Once public attention is riveted, the legal and logical flaws become obvious. When people start looking long and hard, the \u201cinstitutionalized racism\u201d canard is exposed. For guys like Sharpton, that\u2019s bad for business.\n\nBut the Justice Department civil-rights investigations Holder is fond of announcing are not like public trials. They occur out of the public eye, where feverish Justice Department claims are not aired and scrutinized. More significant, they happen with the air of extortion created by the nearly $28 billion in funding Congress keeps giving Justice every year, no matter how many congressional investigations it obstructs, how many false statements its officials make, and how much it politicizes law enforcement. The investigations are taxpayer-funded jihads that states, cities, and towns know they lack the resources to fight off.\n\nHere is how the game works. Holder streams in behind a tragedy that Sharpton and Obama have demagogued. He announces a civil-rights investigation. Eventually, he backs down from the threat of an indictment in the individual case, never conceding that the supporting evidence was not there, usually citing some strawman injustice that has nothing to do with the matter at hand \u2014 in Florida, for example, it was \u201cstand your ground\u201d gun laws that purportedly needed reforming. But, the attorney general is pleased to add, the original civil-rights probe of the non-crime has metastasized into a thoroughgoing civil-rights probe of the state or local police department\u2019s training, practices, and . . . drumroll . . . institutional racism.\n\nYou never get to see what that investigation turns up. States and their subdivisions know they cannot afford to go toe-to-toe with the Beltway behemoth. Big cities, moreover, are governed by Democrats sympathetic to the Obama/Holder race obsessions \u2014 they\u2019re happy to have the feds come in and hamstring police with \u201csocial justice\u201d guidelines that would be a hard sell politically. So the Justice Department makes the locals an offer they can\u2019t refuse: A consent decree that makes the Treaty of Versailles look like a slap on the wrist. This device is the license by which the Obama administration is remaking state law enforcement in its own image.\n\nHow do they get away with this? Well, Obamacare may be the most notorious \u201creform\u201d progressives have foisted on an unsuspecting nation in modern times, but it\u2019s not the only one. In 1994 \u2014 the last time before 2009 that Democrats controlled the White House and both congressional chambers \u2014 they rammed through a monstrosity known as the \u201cViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.\u201d A Clinton deputy attorney general named Eric Holder was among the first to exploit it.\n\nConsistent with the Left\u2019s view of the states as cauldrons of racism, the statute criminalizes \u201cany government authority\u201d that \u201cengage[s] in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers . . . that deprives persons of [federal] rights, privileges, or immunities.\u201d It is the civil-rights laws writ large \u2014 imposed on whole cities rather than threatened against individual police officers and citizens. And for good measure, the act encourages the attorney general to file civil lawsuits in federal court to \u201cobtain appropriate equitable and declaratory relief to eliminate the [offensive] pattern or practice.\u201d\n\nUnder this scheme, there are now more than 20 major American cities and their police departments beholden to the Obama Justice Department. On Thursday, in fact, Holder took time out from stirring the Staten Island pot to pounce on Cleveland, which is still reeling from last month\u2019s racially charged case involving the death of twelve-year-old Tamir Rice.\n\nThe boy was reportedly pointing a gun at people in a park, prompting an emergency call to police, one of whom tragically shot him to death only to find that the gun was a BB gun. Again, other than the happenstance that the boy was black and the officer was white, race had no bearing on the case. But that didn\u2019t stop Holder from invoking the boy, along with Garner\u2019s death in Staten Island, in announcing that Justice\u2019s investigation had found a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of excessive force used by Cleveland police. As he spoke, he was flanked by Mayor Frank Jackson, the Democrat who presided over this allegedly rogue police regime for the last decade \u2014 upon inheriting it from Jane Campbell, the last mayor . . . a Democrat who, you\u2019ll be shocked to learn, moved on to Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School to teach how cities should be run. Mayor Jackson has, of course, agreed to the installation of a \u201cmonitor,\u201d who will see to it that Cleveland police conduct themselves in an Obama-compliant manner.\n\nSeattle is another of the big cities that has been snagged by the DOJ. It has been under a consent decree since the Justice Department targeted it in 2012 for a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of violations, allegedly including \u201csubjecting individuals to excessive force\u201d \u2014 in particular, \u201cusing excessive force against persons of color,\u201d and \u201cescalating situations and using excessive force when arresting individuals for minor offenses.\u201d\n\nYou may recall that the tide of rampant crime in New York City was turned when, under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, the police began cracking down on minor offenses \u2014 not untaxed cigarette sales but real violations that had nearly destroyed the city\u2019s quality of life. What ensued was a miraculous transformation, with the Big Apple becoming the safest big city in America.\n\nThat policing model is under attack now \u2014 just as the NYPD\u2019s extraordinarily successful counterterrorism model has been undermined by Obama\u2019s Homeland Security Advisory Council. As Holder was making his Cleveland splash, Bill de Blasio, New York City\u2019s hard-left mayor, opportunistically \u2014 and in the absence of any evidence \u2014 pointed to Garner\u2019s death as proof that \u201cthe way we go about policing has to change. . . . People need to know that black lives and brown lives matter as much as white lives.\u201d\n\nHolder announced that the Justice Department, which is already monitoring the NYPD, will conduct a civil-rights investigation into Garner\u2019s death. Yes, that\u2019s how it always starts.\n\nMeanwhile, Seattle has been making announcements, too. It seems crime in the Emerald City has been skyrocketing since the Justice Department came in to, er, help. Homicides up 21 percent, car theft up 44 percent, aggravated assaults up 14 percent, and so on.\n\nWelcome to Change: produced and directed by the Obama Justice Department and coming soon to a town near you.\n\n\u2014 Andrew C.

No, what denizens of St. Louis and New York City ought to be worried about right now is\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0the crime wave overtaking Seattle.\n\nIf you don\u2019t understand why, then you probably thought Obamacare was about covering the uninsured. Like its health-care \u201creform\u201d campaign, the Obama Left\u2019s civil-rights crusade is about control \u2014 central control of state law enforcement by Washington.\n\nThe deaths of Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York are each tragic in their own way. But in neither is there a federal civil-rights case to be had. To think otherwise, you have to be getting your advice from Al Sharpton \u2014 the huckster confidant of President Obama and Attorney General Holder.#ad#\n\nThe law of civil rights requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, usually driven by racial prejudice, willfully acted \u2014 violently in these cases \u2014 with the evil purpose to deprive a person of specific federal rights. Let\u2019s put aside the utter absence of proof that race had any bearing on what happened in Staten Island, for example, where police supervised by an African-American officer came to the scene because of complaints about Garner by local business owners. It is virtually impossible to prove a civil-rights violation when there is no denying that police were engaged in a good-faith arrest and were put in the position of using force because a suspect resisted.\n\nIn Ferguson, Michael Brown did not merely resist arrest. Having just robbed a store, he was the aggressor in a confrontation with a police officer, who was made to fear for his life. And in Staten Island, there may be a real question about whether one police officer used excessive force under the circumstances; but there is no question that some quantum of force was appropriate in arresting a physically imposing suspect who insisted he would not be taken into custody and waved his arms to prevent the cops from cuffing him.\n\nFederal civil-rights cases are much harder to make than state homicide cases. They are supposed to be. They were conceived as a rare federal intrusion on the sovereign police power a state exercises within its territory. When police are engaged in an arrest because a crime really has been committed, and they use force because the suspect really does resist, the claim that they were actually scheming to deprive the suspect of his civil rights is asinine. The time to worry about the deprivation of civil rights, as Messrs. Williamson, Cooke, and Goldberg point out, is when progressives enact overbearing laws that criminalize things like untaxed cigarette sales, not when police dutifully carry them out.\n\nEric Holder knows this as well as anyone. The bloviating he is doing today about Ferguson and Staten Island is of a piece with the bloviating he was doing two years ago about Sanford, Fla. As I observed of the Trayvon Martin killing at the time, the attorney general huffed and puffed about bringing a civil-rights case against \u201cwhite Hispanic\u201d George Zimmerman, but he was never actually going to file one. It would have been even more embarrassing than the trumped-up murder case he and Sharpton browbeat Florida into charging \u2014 the one the jury threw out in nothing flat.\n\nHolder and his constitutional-scholar boss are not banging the civil-rights drum because they believe these are prosecutable cases. It is just a pretext for unleashing Justice Department community organizers on state and municipal police departments.\n\nThe government cannot win a standalone loser of a civil-rights prosecution by crying, \u201cDisparate impact!\u201d Individual cases that have been demagogued by the racial-grievance industry become high profile. Once public attention is riveted, the legal and logical flaws become obvious. When people start looking long and hard, the \u201cinstitutionalized racism\u201d canard is exposed. For guys like Sharpton, that\u2019s bad for business.\n\nBut the Justice Department civil-rights investigations Holder is fond of announcing are not like public trials. They occur out of the public eye, where feverish Justice Department claims are not aired and scrutinized. More significant, they happen with the air of extortion created by the nearly $28 billion in funding Congress keeps giving Justice every year, no matter how many congressional investigations it obstructs, how many false statements its officials make, and how much it politicizes law enforcement. The investigations are taxpayer-funded jihads that states, cities, and towns know they lack the resources to fight off.\n\nHere is how the game works. Holder streams in behind a tragedy that Sharpton and Obama have demagogued. He announces a civil-rights investigation. Eventually, he backs down from the threat of an indictment in the individual case, never conceding that the supporting evidence was not there, usually citing some strawman injustice that has nothing to do with the matter at hand \u2014 in Florida, for example, it was \u201cstand your ground\u201d gun laws that purportedly needed reforming. But, the attorney general is pleased to add, the original civil-rights probe of the non-crime has metastasized into a thoroughgoing civil-rights probe of the state or local police department\u2019s training, practices, and\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0drumroll\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0institutional racism.\n\nYou never get to see what that investigation turns up. States and their subdivisions know they cannot afford to go toe-to-toe with the Beltway behemoth. Big cities, moreover, are governed by Democrats sympathetic to the Obama/Holder race obsessions \u2014 they\u2019re happy to have the feds come in and hamstring police with \u201csocial justice\u201d guidelines that would be a hard sell politically. So the Justice Department makes the locals an offer they can\u2019t refuse: A consent decree that makes the Treaty of Versailles look like a slap on the wrist. This device is the license by which the Obama administration is remaking state law enforcement in its own image.\n\nHow do they get away with this? Well, Obamacare may be the most notorious \u201creform\u201d progressives have foisted on an unsuspecting nation in modern times, but it\u2019s not the only one. In 1994 \u2014 the last time before 2009 that Democrats controlled the White House and both congressional chambers \u2014 they rammed through a monstrosity known as the \u201cViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.\u201d A Clinton deputy attorney general named Eric Holder was among the first to exploit it.#page#\n\nConsistent with the Left\u2019s view of the states as cauldrons of racism, the statute criminalizes \u201cany government authority\u201d that \u201cengage[s] in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0that deprives persons of [federal] rights, privileges, or immunities.\u201d It is the civil-rights laws writ large \u2014 imposed on whole cities rather than threatened against individual police officers and citizens. And for good measure, the act encourages the attorney general to file civil lawsuits in federal court to \u201cobtain appropriate equitable and declaratory relief to eliminate the [offensive] pattern or practice.\u201d\n\nUnder this scheme, there are now more than 20 major American cities and their police departments beholden to the Obama Justice Department. On Thursday, in fact, Holder took time out from stirring the Staten Island pot to pounce on Cleveland, which is still reeling from last month\u2019s racially charged case involving the death of twelve-year-old Tamir Rice.#ad#\n\nThe boy was reportedly pointing a gun at people in a park, prompting an emergency call to police, one of whom tragically shot him to death only to find that the gun was a BB gun. Again, other than the happenstance that the boy was black and the officer was white, race had no bearing on the case. But that didn\u2019t stop Holder from invoking the boy, along with Garner\u2019s death in Staten Island, in announcing that Justice\u2019s investigation had found a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of excessive force used by Cleveland police. As he spoke, he was flanked by Mayor Frank Jackson, the Democrat who presided over this allegedly rogue police regime for the last decade \u2014 upon inheriting it from Jane Campbell, the last mayor\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0a Democrat who, you\u2019ll be shocked to learn, moved on to Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School to teach how cities should be run. Mayor Jackson has, of course, agreed to the installation of a \u201cmonitor,\u201d who will see to it that Cleveland police conduct themselves in an Obama-compliant manner.\n\nSeattle is another of the big cities that has been snagged by the DOJ. It has been under a consent decree since the Justice Department targeted it in 2012 for a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of violations, allegedly including \u201csubjecting individuals to excessive force\u201d \u2014 in particular, \u201cusing excessive force against persons of color,\u201d and \u201cescalating situations and using excessive force when arresting individuals for minor offenses.\u201d\n\nYou may recall that the tide of rampant crime in New York City was turned when, under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, the police began cracking down on minor offenses \u2014 not untaxed cigarette sales but real violations that had nearly destroyed the city\u2019s quality of life. What ensued was a miraculous transformation, with the Big Apple becoming the safest big city in America.\n\nThat policing model is under attack now \u2014 just as the NYPD\u2019s extraordinarily successful counterterrorism model has been undermined by Obama\u2019s Homeland Security Advisory Council. As Holder was making his Cleveland splash, Bill de Blasio, New York City\u2019s hard-left mayor, opportunistically \u2014 and in the absence of any evidence \u2014 pointed to Garner\u2019s death as proof that \u201cthe way we go about policing has to change.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0People need to know that black lives and brown lives matter as much as white lives.\u201d\n\nHolder announced that the Justice Department, which is already monitoring the NYPD, will conduct a civil-rights investigation into Garner\u2019s death. Yes, that\u2019s how it always starts.\n\nMeanwhile, Seattle has been making announcements, too. It seems crime in the Emerald City has been skyrocketing since the Justice Department came in to, er, help. Homicides up 21 percent, car theft up 44 percent, aggravated assaults up 14 percent, and so on.\n\nWelcome to Change: produced and directed by the Obama Justice Department and coming soon to a town near you.\n\n\u2014 Andrew C.
