Members of Congress are denouncing the president\u2019s contempt for constitutional law, while the president is raising money to fight the effort to remove him. But this time, the money pouring in would be just as well spent on defense against Bigfoot. Much of the debate has been more mythological than constitutional.\n\n1. An impeachable offense is anything Congress says it is.\n\nPeople pushing for President Obama\u2019s impeachment have cited rationales ranging from the border crisis to Benghazi to Obamacare to the dismantling of \u201cour constitutional republic, our national security, our electoral system, our economic strength, our rights and liberties.\u201d In other words, anything goes. This echoes the characterization by Gerald Ford, who as House minority leader in 1970 made the ill-considered statement that \u201can impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.\u201d (This interpretation was, not surprisingly, part of a frivolous effort to impeach Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, whom Ford denounced for espousing \u201cliberal opinions,\u201d for defending the \u201cfilthy\u201d Swedish film \u201cI Am Curious (Yellow)\u201d and for writing a magazine article that \u201cpraises the lusty, lurid, and risque along with the social protest of left-wing folk singers.\u201d)\n\nBut Congress\u2019s exclusive power to impeach does not license it to abuse that power, any more than the Supreme Court\u2019s final say on laws gives it license to deliver arbitrary rulings. The framers carefully defined the grounds for impeachment as \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d \u2014 language with British legal precedent. They clearly did not want removal of the president subject to congressional whim. Indeed, they rejected the addition of \u201cmaladministration\u201d after James Madison cautioned that \u201cso vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate.\u201d\n\n1 of 18 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Myths of 2014 View Photos Fact or fiction?

MYTH: Sanctions never work. \u201cThe most complete academic studies on the matter show that sanctions lead to concessions from the targeted government in one out of every three or four cases,\u201d writes Daniel W. Drezner in \u201c Five myths about sanctions . \u201cThat is a far cry from never working.\u201d Here, President Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel leave a joint news conference at the White House in May. The leaders discussed additional sanctions to punish Russia for its incursion into Ukraine.

The fact that only two presidents have been impeached, and none have been removed, suggests that most members of Congress take the impeachment standard seriously.\n\n2. An impeachable offense must involve a violation of criminal law.\n\nWhile there\u2019s a high bar for what constitutes grounds for impeachment, an offense does not have to be indictable. Serious misconduct or a violation of public trust is enough. Madison saw impeachment as \u201cdefending the community against the incapacity, negligence or perfidy of the chief magistrate.\u201d And the founders emphasized that impeachments were about what happened in the political arena: involving \u201cpolitical crimes and misdemeanors\u201d and resulting in \u201cpolitical punishments.\u201d\n\nSo consider the $454 million Obama shifted out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Prevention and Public Health Fund. He wouldn\u2019t have to pocket that money to warrant impeachment. But he\u2019d have to do more than he did: redirect it to another purpose without congressional approval and offer a faulty interpretation of the act. If the president were to openly defy clear federal authority and order unlawful acts, he would move from the realm of using arguable discretion to that of being a danger to the system as a whole.\n\n3. History establishes a clear precedent for impeachable conduct.\n\nDemocrats can\u2019t stop talking about it, and some Republicans would like to drop the issue all together. Here\u2019s the back and forth on whether the GOP is really trying to impeach the president. (Pamela Kirkland/The Washington Post)\n\nRegrettably, this is also untrue. Bill Clinton was impeached primarily for criminal conduct: lying under oath and misleading a federal grand jury about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Nixon would have been impeached for a wide array of criminal acts, as well as abuses of power.\n\nPresident Andrew Johnson\u2019s impeachment in 1868 may be the most relevant to the current controversy. Like Obama, Johnson was accused of unconstitutional executive appointments, misuse of federal funds and violating federal law. Most significantly, he replaced Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton in open defiance of the Tenure of Office Act \u2014 a law passed over his veto and later found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The feeble merits of his impeachment were captured best in the 10th article, charging Johnson with delivering three speeches that disrespected Congress.\n\n4. Impeaching a president is like recalling a governor.\n\nMany people discuss impeachment as a way to express dissatisfaction or as a mechanism allowing for a change in leadership. \u201cImpeachment is no more or less than the recall of an elected official who isn\u2019t up to the job,\u201d conservative columnists Floyd and Mary Beth Brown wrote. \u201cObama deserves recall much more than Gov. Gray Davis, and he was replaced by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in a special recall election Oct. 7, 2003, in California.\u201d\n\nIn Britain and other parliamentary systems, the legislature can end the term of a head of government early with a no-confidence vote, showing that he or she has lost the support of the country. But the United States rejected that approach in favor of greater stability and the predictability of a four-year presidential term.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that polls show more than 50 percent of Americans disapprove of the job Obama is doing. Unpopularity is not an impeachable offense. And impeachment was not designed as relief for voter remorse.\n\n5. Obama is in danger of impeachment.\n\nHouse Republicans on Wednesday voted to sue Obama for exceeding his constitutional authority when implementing the Affordable Care Act. The idea that the lawsuit is a prelude to impeachment, however, is primarily coming from the White House and its allies as they try to rally the Democratic base ahead of the midterms. House Speaker John Boehner has done everything short of hiring blimps to say that there will be no impeachment.\n\nObama is as likely to be impeached as he is to be installed as the next pontiff. And I say that as someone who has testified in Congress that this president has violated federal laws, unconstitutionally appointed various executive-branch officers and improperly transferred money. Nevertheless, many of these disputes have divided judges on the merits. Presidents are allowed to challenge Congress in such conflicts without being subject to impeachment. Where they cross the line is when they ignore final judicial rulings in acts of contempt of both courts and Congress. Obama has not done that.\n\nThere are, however, serious questions raised by the president\u2019s pledge to go it alone in areas ranging from health care to immigration. And there is a real crisis in how our system is changing with the rise of the uber-presidency. That\u2019s the threat that deserves attention and debate. We can leave this Bigfoot sighting in the wilderness.\n\njturley@law.gwu.edu\n\nFive myths is a weekly feature from The Post\u2019s Outlook section challenging everything you think you know.
