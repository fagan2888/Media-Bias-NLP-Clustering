People were considered Bible-minded if they had read the Bible in the last week and believe strongly in the accuracy of the Bible.\n\nWith Chattanooga found to be first in Bible-minded cities, we can be proud Tennessee is probably the No. 1 fan of the best-selling book in history \u2014 the Holy Bible.\n\nI was saddened that last year efforts to make the Holy Bible the official book of Tennessee while passing the state House, failed in the state Senate. I am happy to hear Sen. Southerland has renewed his push this year to make the Bible the official book of Tennessee. I support making the Gideon Bible the official book of Tennessee to honor both the Gideons and the Bible.\n\nThe New Testament they gave me in school has changed my life. They are headquartered in Nashville and have given out over 2 billion Bibles and New Testaments over more than 100 years.\n\nOther books inform; only the Bible transforms. Millions have given up drugs and crime after reading the Bible.\n\nGod has given us truth in every word of the Bible and the truth can't be improved on. Reading, believing and living up to the Bible commands such as \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\" is the only sure way to live up to Tennessee's official slogan: \"Tennessee \u2014America at its best.\u201d\n\nD.D. Nave, Elizabethton 37643\n\nAn effort to make the Bible the state\u2019s official book is back in the Tennessee General Assembly. (Photo: Thinkstock.com )\n\nLegislature highlights contradictions\n\nDoes the Tennessee Legislature understand irony? Or are its members completely oblivious to the messages they send?\n\nI read Wednesday\u2019s Tennessean articles about two bills presently advancing in our legislature, one making the Bible the state book and the other permitting guns on college campuses, with great interest.\n\nThankfully, the promoters of the Bible as the state book have agreed that the Bible is only a historical and not a religious book. After all, the gun bill eviscerates everything of value in the Bible.\n\nTurn the other cheek. Heck no. Pull out your .38. Put your trust in the Lord. Why bother? The Bible is only historical, just pack your 9mm. The world is a dangerous place in which God of the Bible cannot protect you. Protection comes only from being able to carry weapons.\n\nWhat to teach the children in Sunday school? Everything we teach you here is just historical nonsense. If you really want to be safe you must carry a loaded handgun.\n\nVery interesting messages from the buckle of the Bible Belt.\n\nDon Dawson, Nashville 37212\n\nBlack gun (Photo: SKapl, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nMarijuana misinformation\n\nRe: \"Cannabis prohibition does more harm than good,\" by Cecily Friday Shamim, and \"Patients deserve access to medical marijuana,\" by Allison Barker Watson, Sunday Insight, March 27.\n\nPlease be more objective and honest in your selection of guest editorial writers than your March 27 \"Point/Counterpoint,\" which contained two letters from pot lobbyists who used emotion rather than science to encourage our society toward addiction and brain damage.\n\nGoogle: \"Harvard Pot Study\" to learn of the long-term damage in casual pot users to \"...the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala \u2014 key regions for emotion and motivation, and associated with addiction.\u201d\n\nMedical science has access to drugs which provide more relief with less damage than does pot. This Harvard/Northwestern/Mass General study is certainly not \"...deceit and misinformation\" as an op-ed claims.\n\nReason and honesty are crucial in our public discourse.\n\nBob Alley, Nashville 37215\n\nMarijuana in a coffee shop in The Netherlands (Photo: Ingram Publishing, Getty Images/Ingram Publishing)\n\nMinimum wage in California (Photo: Cagle Cartoons)\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1SKYmNu", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Readers sound off on the debate over the Bible for state book and marijuana legalization.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Readers sound off on the debate over the Bible for state book and marijuana legalization.", "title": "Letters to the editor, April 3: Bible, marijuana", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/04/03/letters-editor-april-3-bible-marijuana/82433786/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Readers sound off on the debate over the Bible for state book and marijuana legalization.", "title": "Letters to the editor, April 3: Bible, marijuana", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d1018987167a29ed85043434549545ae2e2f6f4e/c=0-89-534-623&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/19/Nashville/B9320578955Z.1_20160119184703_000_GL7D72RTF.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Bible", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Bible", "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Letters to the editor, April 3: Bible, marijuana", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c7e6945626ebe0d253725263318a2e7c9389806c/c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2016/01/19/Nashville/B9320578955Z.1_20160119184703_000_GL7D72RTF.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68886e1d3b73e7ccc59253069a1d37b76fba6987/c=0-89-534-623/local/-/media/2016/01/19/Nashville/B9320578955Z.1_20160119184703_000_GL7D72RTF.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fa671b2e61320c603162e22f003c763f485eac88/c=0-156-534-556/local/-/media/2016/01/19/Nashville/B9320578955Z.1_20160119184703_000_GL7D72RTF.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2fe2471184649d1cc217f2492ce28a57a087b856/c=0-206-534-506&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/01/19/Nashville/B9320578955Z.1_20160119184703_000_GL7D72RTF.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-03T06:03:36.770000-05:00", "shorthed": "Letters, April 3: Bible, marijuana", "articleid": 82433786, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5ca1f55b3fb743e03597e9f17ac0b0eed27fbacd/c=0-206-534-506/local/-/media/2016/01/19/Nashville/B9320578955Z.1_20160119184703_000_GL7D72RTF.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/97206c2dcf4cd44619c7b05a62a6a93f53f3c482/c=67-0-467-712/local/-/media/2016/01/19/Nashville/B9320578955Z.1_20160119184703_000_GL7D72RTF.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "The Bible, Gideon Bible, Tennessee state legislature, marijuana legalization, pot legalization, pot"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0df9\"", "article_summary": "Letters to the editor: letters@tennessean.com (Photo: The Tennessean.com)Gideon Bible should be official bookThe Tri-Cities in Tennessee was named America's fifth-most Bible-minded city.\nI support making the Gideon Bible the official book of Tennessee to honor both the Gideons and the Bible.\nI am happy to hear Sen.
