The troubled website, health care.gov. What advice would you have for the president on his poor website? ZUCKERBERG: You know, sometimes stuff doesn\u2019t work when you want it to. We\u2019ve certainly had plenty of mistakes and things that haven\u2019t worked the way that we want to. The right thing here is just to keep on focusing on building the service that you think is right in the long-term.\n\nWell, that certainly wasn\u2019t the answer that ABC News was looking for. Notice the bias in the ABC News piece. ABC called the website troubled without admitting that most of the problems have already been fixed. ABC was hoping that Zuckerberg would feed into their narrative that website is a horrible disaster, but instead the Facebook founder told them the truth.\n\nThe problems that the website had really aren\u2019t a big deal. Anyone who works online knows that sometimes things break. Sometimes things don\u2019t work the way you want them to, but people don\u2019t abandon their long term goals because of a tech problem. You fix the problem, and move on.\n\nThe media refuses to move on.\n\nTo them, the website hasn\u2019t changed at all since the first week of October. They keep acting like the ACA website is still broken even though it isn\u2019t. The issues with the website were never going to be the end of the ACA. The website was always going to be fixed. People were and are going to sign up.\n\nZuckerberg was right. The problems with the website rollout have nothing to do with reforming the health insurance system. The media is wrong. The Republicans are wrong. The goal is still there, and Democrats are close to making the historic reform of our broken healthcare system a reality.\n\nThe media is rooting for the ACA to fail, but just like the Republicans that they are taking their lead from, they will be the ones who live with the bitter taste of failure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It took just a couple of sentences for Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg to destroy the media myth that the Affordable Care Act is doomed on ABC's This Week.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "It took just a couple of sentences for Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg to destroy the media myth that the Affordable Care Act is doomed on ABC's This Week.", "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Smacks Down the Media Myth That The Website Rollout Has Doomed the ACA", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/11/24/mark-zuckerberg-smacks-media-myth-website-rollout-doomed-aca.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Obama-laptop.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-24T13:30:19+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,ACA,mark zuckerberg,mark zuckerberg aca,mark zuckerberg this week,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-11-24T13:27:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-24T13:30:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ACA, mark zuckerberg, mark zuckerberg aca, mark zuckerberg this week"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ea3\"", "article_summary": "They keep acting like the ACA website is still broken even though it isn\u2019t.\nIt took just a couple of sentences for Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg to destroy the media myth that the Affordable Care Act is doomed on ABC\u2019s This Week.\nThe problems with the website rollout have nothing to do with reforming the health insurance system.\nThe issues with the website were never going to be the end of the ACA.\nABC called the website troubled without admitting that most of the problems have already been fixed."}
