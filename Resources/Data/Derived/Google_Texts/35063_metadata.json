For both Florida Republicans, the state is a promising venue for a surge, but the New Hampshire primary did little to settle the question of which one has the advantage in taking on businessman Donald Trump, who trounced the rest of the field in New Hampshire. Before they get to that showdown, the senator and former governor will first have to get past the disparate campaigns of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the Iowa caucus winner who draws evangelicals, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who came in second in New Hampshire with a centrist appeal. In South Carolina, the contest will play out in a state that is much more populous and conservative, and where mudslinging is as much a part of political culture as retail politicking is in New Hampshire. Janet Hook and Beth Reinhard report.\n\nMEET THE MAN WHO HELPS TRUMP BE TRUMP: In a stairwell behind the stage as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke at a packed rally recently, campaign manager Corey R. Lewandowski lashed out at his New Hampshire state director. \u201cMy boss is working 20-hour days; you\u2019re not,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said. \u201cYou\u2019re not meeting any of your metrics with the primary three weeks away.\u201d In the motorcade afterward, Mr. Lewandowski called a longtime aide supervising another state: \u201cFly here tonight and take over.\u201d With that and other late moves, the 41-year-old campaign manager helped assure Mr. Trump\u2019s decisive victory Tuesday in the nation\u2019s first primary. It was a crucial win for the billionaire businessman after a disappointing second-place finish in Iowa, but it was a do-or-die moment for the relatively anonymous Mr. Lewandowski, who calls the state home and was prepared to resign if his boss lost the primary. Monica Langley reports.\n\nQUESTIONS DOG DEMOCRATS AFTER N.H. PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY: Democrats headed south and west after Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s resounding New Hampshire victory over Hillary Clinton, facing the twin questions of whether his appeal is broad enough to replicate his performance elsewhere\u2014and whether her support is strong enough to reverse the tide. Lying at the crossroads of those two questions are the minority voters who have transformed the Democratic Party in the past few decades and hold the promise of sustained success in the future. Peter Nicholas and Siobhan Hughes report.\n\nMore on election 2016: Mr. Sanders raised $5.2 million in the 18 hours since the polls closed Tuesday night in New Hampshire, his campaign said \u2026 Mr. Trump faces a new kind of test as the presidential nominating contest moves to the South, where many of the blue-collar voters that have formed his base of support are also evangelical Christians open to appeals from social conservatives \u2026 Sen.

Mr. Obama\u2019s administration has pushed rules on everything from emissions to waterways to fracking. But the courts have begun to question whether it has exceeded its legal authority, and their final decisions will determine whether Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental legacy will be monumental or more modest. The Supreme Court\u2019s stay of the rule limiting carbon emissions by power plants\u2014which will remain in place while courts consider more than 30 lawsuits\u2014is the third instance since last fall that federal courts have halted major new environmental rules. Amy Harder and Brent Kendall report.\n\nYELLEN SIGNALS CAUTION ON RATES: Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen flagged risks to the economic outlook that could delay the central bank\u2019s plans for raising short-term interest rates, in her semiannual testimony to Congress on U.S. monetary policy. In the first of two days of semiannual testimony before House and Senate committees, Ms. Yellen on Wednesday said falling stock prices and other financial-market turbulence could impede economic growth, as could stresses in China and other foreign economies. Further complicating matters for the Fed, she also pointed out that market expectations for consumer prices are sinking, a sign investors might be losing faith in the Fed\u2019s ability to lift inflation to the 2% target it has undershot for more than three years.
