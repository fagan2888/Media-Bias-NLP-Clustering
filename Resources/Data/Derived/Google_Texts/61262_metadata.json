Convention Center.\n\nBelieve it or not, this is the 20th annual conference and trade show the ATA has staged, which ought to be a sign that telemedicine and telehealth \u2014 let\u2019s not squabble over definitions here \u2014 are mature disciplines. (Then again, EHRs have been around in one form or another since the 1960s, and some still believe the technology is experimental.)\n\nA lot has happened in telemedicine since the ATA last convened, some positive and some negative.\n\nNotably, Texas regulators gave into the old-guard physician lobby last month by banning doctors from making diagnoses or prescribing drugs via telephone or the Internet for any patient they do not have a previously existing, face-to-face relationship with. You can bet that telemedicine proponents will be talking this week about how to prevent this type of restriction from spreading to other states.\n\nAt the federal level, the two U.S. senators from Mississippi, where more than half the population is rural, are pushing for legislation to broaden Medicare coverage for telehealth services. Yes, that\u2019s right, the promise of telehealth for improving access to care has led two Republicans to support an expansion of Medicare.\n\nOn Friday, UnitedHealthcare announced that it was teaming up telehealth providers Doctor On Demand, NowClinic and American Well to offer virtual physician consultations to beneficiaries it serves at self-insured corporations.\n\nStill, less than 20 percent of healthcare professionals surveyed last fall said that they were getting paid for delivering telemedicine services, so the reimbursement issue lingers. Elsewhere in rural America, South Dakota-based Avera Health has had mixed results with the \u201ceCare\u201d program it runs in eight states.\n\nVerizon Communications walked away from its Virtual Visits program, but denied giving up on telemedicine. But money continues to flow into the sector, including from the likes of Richard Branson.\n\nThe ATA itself launched an accreditation program for telehealth providers near the end of 2014, and reported receiving more than 200 applications in the first three months.\n\nAt the 2015 conference, we expect to hear Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, scheduled to keynote on Monday morning, provide some more clarity about what his NantHealth is actually doing with the $1 billion or so Soon-Shiong has committed to the effort. He has kept the company mostly out of the public eye since making a splash at HIMSS14.\n\nOn the show floor, we will have the usual plethora of product announcements. We already reported on the debut of iC LovedOnes, a telehealth communicator for seniors that was invented by a Spokane, Wash., teenager.\n\nLast week brought the news that Teladoc filed a draft registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a preliminary step toward an initial public offering, and that IBM and Apple were teaming up on a monitoring service for elderly people in Japan.\n\nOf course, our inboxes have been spilling over with requests for vendor meetings. We can\u2019t fulfill them all, but we know that the following companies and organizations will be making announcements, of various newsworthiness, at ATA 2015: MDLive; HealthSpot (in partnership with Xerox), the Scripps Translational Science Institute and Anthem subsidiary CareMore; Honeywell Life Care Solutions (formerly Honeywell HomMed); German firm Emperra; Cisco spinoff Avizia; WoundMatrix; and Vitaphone e-Health Solutions.\n\nMercy Virtual, the telehealth arm of Chesterfield, Mo.-based health system Mercy, is giving a preview of what it calls the world\u2019s first virtual care center, which will open later this year. And in another sign the industry is maturing, a new magazine called Telemedicine is launching with a party on Monday. Invitees have been told that they will have an opportunity to \u201cpitch your own story.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The American Telemedicine Association is getting ready to open its 20th annual conference and trade show, a sign that telehealth is maturing, but questions about reimbursement and state regulations still linger about the industry.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "The American Telemedicine Association is getting ready to open its 20th annual conference and trade show, a sign that telehealth is maturing, but questions about reimbursement and state regulations still linger about the industry.", "title": "20th ATA opens amid growth, uncertainty in telemedicine", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/telemed-phone-art.png", "updated_time": "2015-09-17T10:56:25-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/05/20th-ata-opens-amid-growth-uncertainty-telemedicine/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/telemed-phone-art.png", "creator": "@nversel", "description": "The American Telemedicine Association is getting ready to open its 20th annual conference and trade show, a sign that telehealth is maturing, but questions about reimbursement and state regulations still linger about the industry.", "card": "summary", "title": "20th ATA opens amid growth, uncertainty in telemedicine - MedCity News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,American Telemedicine Association, ata conference, California, Los Angeles, MedCity News, telehealth, Telemedicine, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Telemedicine", "published_time": "2015-05-02T18:08:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-17T10:56:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37d2\"", "article_summary": "A lot has happened in telemedicine since the ATA last convened, some positive and some negative.\nAnd in another sign the industry is maturing, a new magazine called Telemedicine is launching with a party on Monday.\nMercy Virtual, the telehealth arm of Chesterfield, Mo.-based health system Mercy, is giving a preview of what it calls the world\u2019s first virtual care center, which will open later this year.\nVerizon Communications walked away from its Virtual Visits program, but denied giving up on telemedicine.\nBelieve it or not, this is the 20th annual conference and trade show the ATA has staged, which ought to be a sign that telemedicine and telehealth \u2014 let\u2019s not squabble over definitions here \u2014 are mature disciplines."}
