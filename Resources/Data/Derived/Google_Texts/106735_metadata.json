Mary Landrieu and her GOP challenger Rep. Bill Cassidy sparred over which candidate has committed the greater crime.\n\nWhile Landrieu made the case that Cassidy has padded his own payroll at the expense of the poor patients who he was supposed to help as a part-time professor of medicine at LSU, Cassidy batted back that Landrieu caused greater harm with her use of taxpayer funds to charter flights to campaign events.\n\n\u201cMy opponent has told us he is a doctor for the poor, but he is not a doctor for the poor, he\u2019s a doctor for himself,\u201d said Landrieu, who sought to distinguish her misuse of taxpayer funds on campaign related expenses \u2013 a mishap revealed earlier this year, which Landrieu has since corrected by reimbursing the misspent funds \u2013 as a book-keeping error compared to what she said was an intentional lack of record-keeping on Cassidy\u2019s part.\n\n\u201cOne was a book-keeping error, which I took full responsibility and turned over a complete set of records \u2026 and the other is a situation of a congressman whose take $20,000 a year in addition to his Congressional salary, and it may be even more than that if they paid for his medical malpractice insurance, without reporting it properly, without handing over any records.\u201d\n\nLandrieu, who is widely considered the underdog headed into Saturday\u2019s election, repeatedly called on Cassidy to release the full records of his 63 months working at LSU to supplement the 16 months of time sheets that were made public in a surprise document release a week ago. But Cassidy said Landrieu is the one who needs to be more forthcoming with voters.\n\n\u201cIf what Sen. Landrieu wants is transparency, then I\u2019ll ask the question: When I treat patients in the public hospital system, clearly those patients benefit. When she takes chartered jets on taxpayer dime to campaign events, who is it that benefits?\u201d Cassidy said.\n\nJust hours before the debate began Monday night, LSU announced that it would conduct \u201ca review\u201d of Cassidy\u2019s employment with the university.\n\n\u201cBased on concerns that have surfaced in the news media, we will review any information we have regarding Dr. Bill Cassidy's employment with LSU, just as we would any other employee,\u201d LSU Director of Media Relations Ernie Ballard told ABC News in a statement.\n\nCassidy, who has been on a leave of absence from LSU since April, defended his work as a part-time professor in the debate and called the allegations that he was paid for work he didn\u2019t do \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese charges are false and my direct supervisor and I have made numerous statements regarding this,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cThe work I\u2019ve done working with LSU, teaching medical students, actually benefits the poor and uninsured. There\u2019s an irony here: Sen. Landrieu justifies her vote for Obamacare, it would not have passed without her, by saying she\u2019s for the poor and uninsured, even though demonstrably Obamacare has hurt the economic prospects of the poor.\u201d\n\nAnother heated exchange in the debate was on whether race relations have improved in the United States over the last several decades.\n\nWhile Landrieu cited Ferguson as a recent example of race relations having \u201cdeteriorated a bit\u201d in the country, Cassidy disagreed and said there has been progress. Cassidy then went on to criticize Landrieu for an interview with NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd in the days before November\u2019s election, during which she said that President Obama\u2019s unpopularity in the South is attributable, in part, to the color of his skin. She also cited the president\u2019s energy policies as a reason for his unpopularity.\n\n\u201cSen. Landrieu made statement that somehow Barack Obama wasn\u2019t being viewed favorably because we have a history of racism in the South,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cI think just because you disagree with the president doesn\u2019t make you a racist. And I will point out that when Landrieu said by implication that we\u2019re racist and sexist, she\u2019s been elected to public office since I was in college, so I think we\u2019ve made progress.\u201d\n\nLandrieu fired back, saying that Cassidy was misconstruing her comments and pivoted back to the allegations against Cassidy\u2019s position at LSU.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems that Bill Cassidy has is he makes things up as he goes along,\u201d Landrieu said. \u201cHe\u2019s made up this story about him being a doctor for the poor when he\u2019s padding his own payroll and he\u2019s made up the statement that I\u2019ve said that anyone was a racist. Do you know what I said? I said the South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans, and it\u2019s also been a region that\u2019s not quickly recognized the leadership of women. I will make no apology for something that is a historical fact.\u201d\n\nCassidy then attempted to follow up, but Landrieu quickly silenced him. \u201cExcuse me Bill, that is what I said,\u201d and went on to remind Cassidy that she also discussed Obama\u2019s energy policies in the interview. \u201cI am not the only one tired of listening to his rhetoric.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what he would want to do if elected to Congress, Cassidy said that repealing Obamacare would be one of his top priorities.\n\nBut when asked if there are some aspects of the Affordable Care Act worth keeping, Cassidy said the measure that allows adult children to stay on the parents\u2019 healthcare plan until age 26 should stay \u2013 and claimed the GOP deserves credit for that particular idea. \u201cThe provision for someone who\u2019s 26 and younger to stay on their parents was actually a Republican idea,\u201d Cassidy postured.\n\nBut Landrieu quipped that fighting the Affordable Care Act will be the least of Cassidy\u2019s concerns if he is elected. \u201cIf he is [elected] he\u2019ll be doing a lot more than fighting President Obama. He\u2019ll be fighting subpoenas, because he padded his payroll,\u201d Landrieu said.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Landrieu and Cassidy Sling Mud in Final Debate", "description": "Sen.
