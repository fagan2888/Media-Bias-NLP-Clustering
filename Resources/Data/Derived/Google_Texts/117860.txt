SACRAMENTO-

18,000 Kaiser Permanente nurses throughout Northern California are getting ready to strike this Tuesday and Wednesday.

3,500 nurses in Sacramento will take part, but all Kaiser hospitals will remain open during the strike.

"They’re profiting 12 million dollars a day right now and we'd like to see them put that money back into patient care,” said Kaiser nurse, Diane McClure.

McClure will take part in the strike organized by National Nurses United.

"There has been a massive influx of patients due to the affordable care act over the last few months and the staffing hasn't increased and we need extra resources in order to take care of our patients appropriately,” McClure said.

Relatives of patients in the ICU at Kaiser South Sacramento tell FOX40 they were worried about what a strike means for their loved ones.

"She’s very critical right now and she’s disabled so who is going to take care of her if they’re gonna go on strike?" said Lynne Sanabria.

Kaiser ensures that patients are the priority and that hospitals will remain open throughout the strike. The hospital released a statement reading in part:

"We have contingency plans in place and will be ready to operate with normal business hours and services during the walkout called by the union. Some elective procedures and non-urgent appointments will be rescheduled."

The union cites lack of Ebola safety precautions as an example of its patient care concerns, especially after someone was tested for the virus at Kaiser’s South Sacramento hospital in August.

The hospital insists its teams have been working nonstop on Ebola preparations.

Tuesday and Wednesday nurses will strike all day.

They will also be protesting at Kaiser’s headquarters in Oakland as part of a national day of action.

The nurses union’s contract has expired.

They’ve been bargaining with Kaiser for about three months. They say this two day walkout and strike was their last resort.
