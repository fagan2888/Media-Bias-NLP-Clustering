Simmons\u2019 reported fabrications helped him secure a position as a commentator on Fox News, where he discussed terrorism.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe Washington Post summarized his false record:\n\n\u201cOn his Web site, Simmons, 62, of Annapolis, claimed he was recruited to the CIA from the Navy, and he soon became part of the agency\u2019s \u2018Outside Paramilitary Special Operations Group,\u2019 leading \u2018Deep Cover Intel Ops against some of the world\u2019s most dangerous Drug Cartels and arms smugglers from Central and South American and the Middle East.\u2019 Simmons claimed on the site he was one the first \u2018outside Intelligence officers\u2019 to visit the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, and he served as a consultant to the Bush White House on the Military Commissions Act of 2006.\u201d\n\nWhile the prosecutors do not dispute that Simmons worked for the government at some points, they contend he only attained the positions by lying about his history with the CIA.\n\nSimmons was hired in 2008 as a \u201cHuman Terrain System Team Leader\u201d for a government contractor, which was unnamed in the indictment. The prosecutors accuse him of attaining this job and the accompanying security clearance by \u201cfalsely stating that he had been recruited to the CIA in 1973, that he had not previously been charged with or convicted of a felony offense, that his prior arrests and criminal convictions were directly related to his supposed intelligence work for the CIA, and that he had held a top secret security clearance from 1973 to 2000.\u201d\n\nTwo years after receiving the 2008 position, he was hired by another subcontractor and worked overseas as an adviser to senior military personnel. Prosecutors allege he also earned this job based on his misrepresentations. He now faces charges of false statements, major fraud against the United States, and wire fraud.\n\nSimmons faces up to 35 years in prison if he is convicted of the charges.\n\nWhile working as a commentator for Fox News, Simmons expressed opinions in line with the network\u2019s right-wing narrative. Asked by pundits on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d in 2009 if America had become soft on terror since President Obama took office that same year, Simmons said,\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard me say this many times before, nothing has changed, it\u2019s only getting worse since the coronation of the boy king 15 months ago. It is again, not an accident that every third world despot \u2014 every third world despot \u2014 from Venezuela through Cuba to North Korea \u2014 virtually anyone in the Middle East that decides they want to take a shot at the U.S. and our allies \u2014 is doing just that. These guys now that are starting to come out of the woodwork are emboldened, they recognize, as do the third world nations \u2014 the dictators \u2014 that there will be no repercussions from the Obama administration.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, he contended that Muslims in America must be profiled to stop terrorist attacks. \u201cWithout profiling, we are never going to be able to stop this the way we should,\u201d Simmons said on \u201cYour World with Neil Cavuto.\u201d\n\nA Fox spokesperson told the Wrap that \u201cHe was never employed by Fox or paid by the network\u201d and he contributed only as a \u201cguest.\u201d Though Fox News is no stranger to perpetuating manipulated information and outright lies, its lack of ability to so much as verify the credentials of a so-called expert drives its reputation to new depths of incompetence and deceit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though Fox News is no stranger to perpetuating manipulated information and outright lies, its lack of ability to so much as verify the credentials of a so-called expert drives its reputation to new depths of incompetence and deceit., CIA, FOX News, media, propaganda, terrorism,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Carey Wedler | AntiMedia", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Though Fox News is no stranger to perpetuating manipulated information and outright lies, its lack of ability to so much as verify the credentials of a so-called expert drives its reputation to new depths of incompetence and deceit., CIA, FOX News, media, propaganda, terrorism,", "title": "Fox News\u2019 CIA Expert Arrested for Lying About Being in CIA", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/fox-news-cia-expert-arrested-for-lying-about-being-in-cia/210427/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Wayne-Simmons-Fox-800x408.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-16T11:58:13-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Though Fox News is no stranger to perpetuating manipulated information and outright lies, its lack of ability to so much as verify the credentials of a so-called expert drives its reputation to new depths of incompetence and deceit., CIA, FOX News, media, propaganda, terrorism,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Wayne-Simmons-Fox.jpg", "title": "Fox News\u2019 CIA Expert Arrested for Lying About Being in CIA", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-10-17T05:00:49-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-16T11:58:13-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Fox News\u2019 CIA Expert Arrested for Lying About Being in CIAThough Fox News is no stranger to perpetuating manipulated information and outright lies, its lack of ability to so much as verify the credentials of a so-called expert drives its reputation to new depths of incompetence and deceit.\n(ANTIMEDIA) A Fox News commentator was arrested and charged for falsely promoting himself as a former CIA agent, according to a federal indictment unsealed on Thursday.\nWhile working as a commentator for Fox News, Simmons expressed opinions in line with the network\u2019s right-wing narrative.\nSimmons\u2019 reported fabrications helped him secure a position as a commentator on Fox News, where he discussed terrorism.\nThe suit against Wayne Simmons alleges he asserted he was a CIA agent for 27 years, dishonestly claiming he was recruited from the Navy and worked on special operations throughout his career."}
