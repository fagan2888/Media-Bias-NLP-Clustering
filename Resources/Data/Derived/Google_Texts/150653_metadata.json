Peter Shumlin prepares to use the economist\u2019s math for single-payer health care.\n\nAs Vermonters anxiously await a Gruber-modeled financing plan for Green Mountain Care, modeling done for Colorado\u2019s health exchange by Jonathan Gruber Associates has proven wildly erroneous.\n\nIn 2011, following Colorado\u2019s decision to set up a state health exchange for Obamacare, the state hired Gruber to forecast enrollment trends from which the state and federal government could estimate costs.\n\nAccording to a presentation delivered to the Colorado Health Benefit Exchange Board on Sept. 16, 2011, and provided to Watchdog.org, Gruber predicted Medicaid enrollment in Colorado would grow from 440,000 enrollees in 2011 to 710,000 enrollees in 2016.\n\nActual 2014 data reported by the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing shows the number of people enrolled in the state\u2019s Medicaid program has grown to more than 1.1 million \u2014 a miscalculation of about 400,000 enrollees.\n\nThe miscalculation is growing rapidly, as the state reported 12,533 new Medicaid sign-ups in the two-week period between Nov. 15 and Nov. 30.\n\n\u201cMedicaid and CHP+ enrollments over the last few weeks show that we are still finding and enrolling low-income Coloradans into coverage,\u201d Susan Birch, executive director of the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, said in a Dec. 2 news release.\n\nThe errors are significant for Vermont. While Shumlin has denounced Gruber for video statements disparaging American voters and rejecting government transparency, he has continued to defend Gruber\u2019s math.\n\nIn November, Shumlin said Gruber would continue to serve as \u201ca calculator\u201d for single-payer financing options, despite not receiving additional pay. State health officials assert Gruber is one of only a few people in the nation capable of providing customized health care forecasting data for states. Importantly, the Gruber Microsimulation Model (GMSIM) used for Colorado also is being used to create financing scenarios for Green Mountain Care.\n\n\u201cHis models can\u2019t be relied on for policy. They\u2019re not ready for prime time,\u201d Linda Gorman, director of the Health Care Policy Center at the Independence Institute in Colorado, told Vermont Watchdog.\n\nGorman, an economist who serves as a member of Colorado\u2019s Blue Ribbon Commission for Health Care Reform, recalled that the Gruber Microsimulation Model was hailed as a breakthrough methodology for forecasting health care data, despite its use of surveys and small samples to predict Coloradans\u2019 health insurance choices.\n\n\u201cThey said the great thing about using the Gruber model instead of the standard econometric model is that we\u2019re going to use a lot of survey data. They basically set up a representative population and said this is how people behave based on surveys. That kind of thing works really badly for a small state like Colorado,\u201d Gorman said.\n\nAccording to Gorman, a miscalculation of 400,000 people is a costly error since each Medicaid enrollee costs taxpayers about $2,000. Gruber\u2019s Medicaid enrollment error means Colorado\u2019s cost estimates for Medicaid expansion are presently off by about $800 million.\n\n\u201cRemember, they were trying to make the law come in as saving money \u2014 so they\u2019ve way underestimated the cost of insuring these additional Medicaid people,\u201d she said.\n\nMedicaid enrollment wasn\u2019t the only error in Gruber\u2019s presentation. Gruber also wrongly estimated sign-ups for the state\u2019s subsidized and unsubsidized commercial plans under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAccording to Gruber\u2019s simulations, Colorado could expect to have 470,000 people enrolled in the subsidized plan and 150,000 in the unsubsidized plan by 2016. However, actual data for 2014 shows 75,067 individuals are enrolled in the exchange subsidized plan and 52,165 in the exchange unsubsidized plan \u2014 a underestimate that indicates paying customers aren\u2019t signing up through the state exchange.\n\n\u201cSo far, the data suggest that the exchange is a lot less popular than predicted,\u201d Gorman said.\n\n\u201cWhat that is showing is the model has not so far done a very good job of predicting enrollment in these health benefit exchanges that were supposed to be the centerpiece of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe Gruber Microsimulation Model also provided flawed predictions to the federal government. A 2012 article in Forbes notes that Gruber erred in predicting that insurance premiums would go down once the Affordable Care Act became law:\n\nBefore the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act became law, Gruber published a widely-cited analysis, using his Gruber Microsimulation Model, in which he asserted that in 2016, young people would save 13 percent, and older people 31 percent, on their insurance premiums. Gruber\u2019s numbers were used to rebut an October 2009 analysis from PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which projected that non-group (a.k.a. individual-market) premiums would increase by 47 percent over the same period.\n\nBy 2012, however, Gruber reversed course and began informing Wisconsin, Minnesota and Colorado that the law would increase non-group premiums by 19 percent to 30 percent, according to the Forbes article.\n\nSince early November, when a series of Jonathan Gruber videos revealed the economist crafted policy in a \u201ctortured way\u201d to conceal costs, several Vermont lawmakers have attacked the credibility of Gruber as a calculator for Vermont\u2019s new single-payer health program.\n\nThis week, Gruber was called to Capitol Hill to explain his comments to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. While the MIT professor apologized for making \u201cglib\u201d and \u201cdemeaning\u201d comments, he did not suggest his work was compromised.\n\nGruber\u2019s continued defense of his consulting work didn\u2019t escape Darcie Johnston, founder of Vermonters for Health Care Freedom, a group that opposes single-payer health care.\n\n\u201cJonathan Gruber\u2019s answers to the Oversight Committee should give Vermonters pause. Governor Shumlin should fully terminate Prof. Gruber from his Vermont contract. Now that Gov. Shumlin and Vermonters have seen how deceitful and calculating he is, there is no way to trust his professional judgment or his economic modeling,\u201d Johnston said in an email to Vermont Watchdog.\n\nContact Bruce Parker at bparker@watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Jonathan Gruber\u2019s health care forecasting is failing Colorado as Gov.
