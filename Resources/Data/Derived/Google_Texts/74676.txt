The Consumer Product Safety Commission is delaying new safety rules for recreational off-road vehicles.

Following two requests from industry groups, the commission has decided to extend the public comment period from April 8 to June 19.

This is the second time the rules for all-terrain vehicles (ATV), first proposed on Nov. 19, have been delayed. Comments were originally due February 2.

The Recreational Off-Highway Vehicle Association asked for more time to review documents provided by the commission. The Outdoor Power Equipment Institute said it needed more time to review the reproducibility and repeatability of the tests the commission has proposed.

The rules would impose safety standards including lateral stability measures, a minimum level of rollover resistance and speed controls. The commission is trying to keep ATVs from being able to flip over and crush their drivers and/or passengers.

Manufacturers would be required to limit the maximum speed of these vehicles to no more than 15 miles per hour when seat belts for both the driver and front passenger are not fastened.

“The commission believes that when rollovers do occur, improving occupant protection performance by increasing seat belt use will mitigate injury severity,” the proposed rulemaking said.

“CPSC’s analysis of ROV [recreational off-highway vehicles] incidents indicates that 91 percent of fatally ejected victims were not wearing a seat belt at the time of the incident.”
