Witnesses reported seeing at least 40 workers.\n\nSoldiers and firefighters listened for movement or cries from the wreckage as they worked overnight to clear the debris, said a state official, Venancio Furtado.\n\nAt least 10 people were pulled out alive overnight, but the chance of finding survivors was dwindling, Mr. Furtado said. By Sunday afternoon, the death toll had reached 15, according to the state government.\n\nGoa\u2019s chief minister, Manohar Parrikar, said he ordered a review of the construction project, after seeing cracks that developed in an adjacent apartment building constructed by the same company, Bharat Developers and Realtors, based in Mumbai.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe design is faulty, which is why the tragedy happened,\u201d Mr. Parrikar said.\n\nThe police have begun an investigation of the building company and city officials who approved the construction on a patch of marshland in Canacona, about 44 miles from the state capital, Panaji. But they have been unable to track down the construction manager and building contractor.\n\n\u201cWithout the contractor, it is impossible for us to know how many laborers were on the shift,\u201d said a state official, Ajit Panchwadkar, who was supervising the rescue effort on Sunday.\n\nMany of the workers had come from other, poorer states, including Jharkhand, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, in search of jobs in India\u2019s thriving construction business. One worker who was not at the scene when the building collapsed said he earned about 300 rupees, or $4.80, for a day\u2019s work, according to the news agency Press Trust of India.\n\nBuilding collapses are common in India, as lax regulations and the demand for housing often encourage builders to cut corners by using substandard materials or adding unauthorized extra floors.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140105194142, "twitter": {"description": "Dozens more might be trapped under rubble, but the authorities were still trying to determine how many workers were at the site when the five-story structure crumpled Saturday.", "title": "At Least 15 Die in India Building Collapse", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/06/world/asia/at-least-15-die-in-india-building-collapse.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002633919"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/06/world/INDIA/INDIA-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/06/world/asia/at-least-15-die-in-india-building-collapse.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002633919", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/06/world/asia/at-least-15-die-in-india-building-collapse.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "world/asia", "hdl_p": "At Least 15 Die in India Building Collapse", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/asia/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 5, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Accidents and Safety,Building (Construction),Deaths (Fatalities),Goa (India),Rescues,India", "news_keywords": "Rescue,India", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Associated Press", "SCG": "asia", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Dozens more might be trapped under rubble, but the authorities were still trying to determine how many workers were at the site when the five-story structure crumpled Saturday.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/06/world/INDIA/INDIA-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Dozens more might be trapped under rubble, but the authorities were still trying to determine how many workers were at the site when the five-story structure crumpled Saturday.", "CG": "world", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 5, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section": "Asia Pacific", "modified": "2014-01-07", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/asia/index.jsonp", "tag": "India", "published": "2014-01-05", "section-taxonomy-id": "9A43D8FC-F4CF-44D9-9B34-138D30468F8F"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "India", "slug": "06india", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140107111946, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/06/world/asia/at-least-15-die-in-india-building-collapse.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/06/world/INDIA/INDIA-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Dozens more might be trapped under rubble, but the authorities were still trying to determine how many workers were at the site when the five-story structure crumpled Saturday.", "title": "At Least 15 Die in India Building Collapse"}, "pdate": 20140105, "des": "Rescues", "articleid": 100000002633919, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "At Least 15 Die in India Building Collapse", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/06/world/INDIA/INDIA-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "PhotoPANAJI, India \u2014 Rescuers using backhoes and shovels searched for survivors on Sunday under a huge pile of broken concrete after a residential building under construction collapsed in southern India, killing at least 15 workers.\nBuilding collapses are common in India, as lax regulations and the demand for housing often encourage builders to cut corners by using substandard materials or adding unauthorized extra floors.\nBut they have been unable to track down the construction manager and building contractor.\nAt least 10 people were pulled out alive overnight, but the chance of finding survivors was dwindling, Mr. Furtado said.\nOne worker who was not at the scene when the building collapsed said he earned about 300 rupees, or $4.80, for a day\u2019s work, according to the news agency Press Trust of India."}
