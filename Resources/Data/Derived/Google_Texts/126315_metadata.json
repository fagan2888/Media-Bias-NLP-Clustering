Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that limited regulation of abortion, were \"pretended legislation.\"\n\nThe Founding Fathers, Peroutka said, used that term in the Declaration of Independence to describe unjust parliamentary actions.\n\n\"The purpose of civil government is to protect God-given rights, not to redistribute wealth,\" said Peroutka, R-Millersville. \"It's not to take from one and give to another, even if one has it and one really needs it.\"\n\nA checklist he had developed to evaluate legislation before the council was distributed to attendees.\n\n\"I'm trying to be transparent and complete about what I'm doing as a councilman,\" Peroutka said.\n\nThe checklist includes whether legislation is \"in accordance with biblical standards for law and government,\" and whether it aligns with the U.S. and Maryland constitutions and the County Charter.\n\n\"A lot of what we do, we don't have the authority to do, in my view,\" Peroutka said. \"(I'm) chipping away at that and working at that.\"\n\nPeroutka is the co-founder of Institute on the Constitution, which offers training on his interpretation of national, state and local law. He encouraged those at the meeting to check out the organization's website.\n\nDavid Zwald, the president of the North County Republican Club, said that \"bringing forth and educating the citizens about the founders \u2014 I think that's healthy that we are reminded of those principles as we are reminded of our own modern problems.\"\n\nOne of those at the meeting, Marie Dyke of Pasadena, said today's children don't get a thorough grounding on the U.S. Constitution and American history.\n\n\"We learned history, geography and government, and now they throw three subjects together in a 45-minute period and call it social studies,\" Dyke said. \"It's unfortunate how little young people know about our country.\"\n\nSuch problems, Peroutka said, come about because \"government schools\" neglect the Bible, the foundation of American government. He said parents need the freedom to teach students beliefs they will not get in their state-mandated education.\n\nPeroutka ran for president on the Constitution Party ticket in 2004. He donated fossils to a creationist museum and was a longtime member of the League of the South, with has advocated Southern secession.\n\nAsked about race, Peroutka said \"there's only one race and that's the human race.\"\n\nHe said that during his campaign last year for a council seat in District 5, which covers the Broadneck Peninsula, many people told him \"we're taxed out.\"\n\nPeroutka said that he hopes the fight against county stormwater fees \u2014 which he and other opponents have called \"the rain tax\" \u2014 is not over.\n\nHe also supports County Executive Steve Schuh's 4.2 percent income tax cut, which would return about $19 million to taxpayers, according to a press release.\n\nPeroutka urged club members to show their support for the tax cut.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Peroutka talks God, country and council", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Capital Gazette", "author": "Capital Gazette", "og": {"site_name": "capitalgazette.com", "description": "God's word determines right and wrong \u2014 but that doesn't necessarily mean mixing church and state, County Councilman Michael Peroutka said Thursday night.", "title": "Peroutka talks God, country and council", "url": "http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/ph-ac-cn-peroutka-0612-20150611-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-557a4435/turbine/ph-ac-cn-peroutka-0612-20150611", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp08.10", "twitter": {"site": "@capgaznews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "michael peroutka, county council, anne arundel county, republicans, north county republican club", "fb": {"page_id": 324858467568005, "app_id": 290392664473911}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-06-11", "Description": "God's word determines right and wrong \u2014 but that doesn't necessarily mean mixing church and state, County Councilman Michael Peroutka said Thursday night.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "michael peroutka, county council, anne arundel county, republicans, north county republican club"}, "article_summary": "God's word determines right and wrong \u2014 but that doesn't necessarily mean mixing church and state, County Councilman Michael Peroutka said Thursday night.\nPeroutka urged club members to show their support for the tax cut.\nPeroutka said that he hopes the fight against county stormwater fees \u2014 which he and other opponents have called \"the rain tax\" \u2014 is not over.\nThe Founding Fathers, Peroutka said, used that term in the Declaration of Independence to describe unjust parliamentary actions.\nPeroutka is the co-founder of Institute on the Constitution, which offers training on his interpretation of national, state and local law."}
