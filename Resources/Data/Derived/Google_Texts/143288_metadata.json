That includes basic needs such as housing, health care, food and transportation.\n\nAn elderly renter would need at least $28,000 a year in Santa Barbara County to cover those expenses, and many people come up short.\n\nHunger and food insecurity among elders is a growing concern, and one in four use meal and food support.\n\nMost of those people are living on less than $15,000 a year, Finch said.\n\nHealth and safety is also a huge issue for seniors, with a high rate among them for using emergency room transports.\n\nFinch said seniors accounted for almost half of total hospital transports last year, even though they only made up 14 percent of the total population.\n\nLack of geriatric mental-health services is also an issue. When St. Francis Hospital closed in 2003, the 14 geriatric psychiatric beds at the facility went with it, Finch said.\n\nThe Adult and Aging Network also recommended that an additional public health nurse be hired, since only one is available now to see clients throughout the county.\n\nThe county\u2019s public health nurse, Nancy Allen, sees about 60 patients a month throughout the entire county, and the need for in-home visits will likely increase.\n\n\u201cIt might be in a motel, a shelter or in someone\u2019s home,\u201d she said. \u201cOur clients are complicated. Seniors have a lot of medical issues and that means our cases take a lot of time.\u201d\n\nForty percent of referrals to adult protective services are because of self-neglect, she said.\n\nAllen described visiting patients who live in deplorable conditions, and noted that the population was a vulnerable one. A 88-year-old woman, one of her patients, was resistant to health care when the nurse arrived and hadn\u2019t bathed in months.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018I can handle everything,\u2019\u201d Allen said.\n\nIt took time to gain the woman\u2019s trust so that she could eventually seek medical care.\n\nWithout that, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that woman would be alive today,\u201d Allen said.\n\nOutside of county departments, increased demand but decreased or stagnant funding is making it harder for local community organizations to reach out to seniors.\n\nWith transportation, \u201cseniors are not concentrated in particular neighborhoods,\u201d Finch said, and distance to public transportation, prohibitive fees and schedules remain issues.\n\nOne transportation provider reported a large increase of seniors seeking transportation since the Affordable Care Act was implemented, as an influx of people sought transport to medical appointments.\n\nThe Community Action Commission prepares 150,000 meals a year for seniors, said head Fran Forman. The group distributes meals and asks for a $3 donation from seniors.\n\n\u201cMost are only able to contribute about 80 cents,\u201d she said, adding that most of the seniors make less than $1,200 a month.\n\nOne of the supervisors who spoke was Steve Lavagnino, who said that caring for an 86-year-old family member has opened his eyes to the planning it takes to manage daily medications, doctors visits and the like.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a full-time job just to keep your life moving in the right direction,\u201d he said, adding that he would support an additional nurse position at budget workshops next spring.\n\n\u201cTo only have one in the whole county isn\u2019t acceptable as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk staff writer Lara Cooper can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) .
