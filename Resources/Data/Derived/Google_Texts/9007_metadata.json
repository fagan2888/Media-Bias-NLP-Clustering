They certainly did not understand that he did not believe in America\u2019s exceptionalism and greatness. They were also unaware of his past Marxist indoctrination, blaming America for many of the world\u2019s problems. Therefore, anything that undercuts and withdraws America\u2019s power and influence is seen as being objectively progressive. This is fundamental to understanding why President Obama shows empathy with American\u2019s enemies, e.g., Iran, Cuba, Russia, and China.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIt is also key to understanding our precipitous withdrawal from Iraq, as well as the loss of our influence in the region with the rise of Islam. President Obama apparently shares the view that the colonial powers unjustifiably suppressed Islam for the better part of two centuries. Therefore, the best way to rectify that situation is to withdraw the U.S. and let Islam rise again. Of course, this actually started under the Carter administration with the rise of Islamic fundamentalism when the Ayatollah Khomeini overthrew the Shah of Iran in 1979.\n\nComplicating the current Mid-East chaos is the fact that the administration has great difficulty in identifying the enemy. The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said it best, \u201cThere is no moderate or immoderate Islam. Islam is Islam and that\u2019s it.\u201d Make no mistake \u2013 ISIS is Islam. The barbarism and atrocities they commit are sanctioned by the Quran and Islam\u2019s Shariah law. We must face facts, ISIS is impervious to any rational dialogue. They must be killed into submission.\n\nAs I have previously stated, symbols matter throughout the world, but no more so than in the Middle East. When President Obama delivered his June 4, 2009 Cairo \u201cOutreach to Muslims\u201d speech, with the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood leadership sitting in the front row, and declared that it was part of his responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear \u2013 that said it all!\n\nFurthermore, there should have been no doubt remaining after his September 2012 UN General Assembly speech when he stated in reference to the Benghazi tragedy, \u201cthe future must not belong to those who slander the prophet Islam.\u201d No matter how many excuses President Obama makes for Islam and Muslim sensitivities, freedom of speech for the civilized world will not be silenced.\n\nIn yet another indication, the Obama Administration continues to embrace the Muslim Brotherhood even though their creed is to destroy the United States from within (silent jihad) by our own hands and substitute our Constitution with Islam\u2019s Shariah law. The Muslim Brotherhood have been able to successfully penetrate all our national security and intelligence agencies. They are now institutionalized. Their impact on our policies cannot be overstated.\n\nThe Kabuki dance just completed in Switzerland produced a \u201cframework\u201d of \u201cunderstandings\u201d which is supposed to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program is already being disputed by Iran. Of course, this is to be expected with no agreed upon text.\n\nAccording to Fred Fleitz of the Center For Security Policy, the framework as now understood legitimizes and actually advances Iran\u2019s uranium-enrichment program. All the core elements of Iran\u2019s program remain in place. They do not have to dismantle anything and be allowed to keep their heavily fortified Fordow underground enrichment facilities \u2014 a major, unbelievable, concession by the United States. In effect, we have rewarded Iran for ignoring (plus lying and cheating) UN Security Council resolutions for a decade. They do not have to destroy any of their ICBMs nor stop their aggression throughout the Middle East. More importantly, the Obama administration has dismissed the fact that the Iranian government has caused the loss of life of thousands of Americans. At the end of the day, there is only one option that guarantees Iran will not achieve a nuclear weapon capability, and that is a military strike.\n\nTo show their disdain for President Obama, an Iranian spokesperson stated that the destruction of Israel is \u201cnon-negotiable.\u201d So much for the two state peace process! Of course, death to America is a recurring theme.\n\nThe Middle East is not the only place our influence is being challenged. We are being challenged by China in the Western Pacific. In Europe, we are standing idly by as NATO is being emasculated by Putin\u2019s aggression in the Ukraine. Many believe the \u201creset button\u201d with Russia has failed. Actually, it is working quite well \u2013 for Russia.\n\nThe Obama administration has allowed the KGB thug Putin to conduct a policy of aggression in the Ukraine unopposed. President Obama\u2019s refusal to provide legitimate defensive military equipment to Kiev appears to be part of the reset button \u201cunderstanding.\u201d It is the same understanding that applies to the withdrawal of our commitment to place anti-ballistic missile systems in Poland and the Czech Republic. Furthermore, President Obama\u2019s refusal to meet with NATO\u2019s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (during his 3 days visit to Washington) was another signal to Putin.\n\nThere is no doubt our influence and status as a great power and reliable ally is being challenged. Our enemies don\u2019t fear us and our allies don\u2019t trust us \u2013 a formula for disaster. President Obama\u2019s refusal to call for a reformation of Islam, plus his empathy with our enemies, combined with our unilateral disarmament, place our national security in jeopardy. The greatest threat to our national security today clearly is the Obama administration policies, which must be reversed. Americans must stand up and demand that Congress act now.\n\nJames A.
