It was created because some are dangerously violent toward other inmates and prison staff and need to be kept under tight control \u2014 which in Colorado meant 23 hours of cell time each day. Over the years, however, the use of solitary expanded as it came to be used to solve other problems, too, such as what to do with the seriously mental ill.\n\nNor was there any assurance a prisoner would ever emerge from solitary. As the report notes, as recently as 2013, \u201cThere were still offenders who had been housed within administrative segregation for over 24 years.\u201d\n\nTwenty four years!\n\nRaemisch and Wasco seem to acknowledge that critics might quibble with how the department defines the status of some prisoners, such as those in residential treatment programs who would rather stay in their cells. But the apparently sincere desire on their part to end the isolation of as many prisoners as possible is clear in the report.\n\n\u201cWe offer our offenders in Residential Treatment Programs out-of-cell opportunities for both therapeutic and non-therapeutic time,\u201d they write. \u201cWe don\u2019t force them to come out if they don\u2019t want to. This has brought us ridicule and critique but we feel that we are reaching these offenders through time and patience and consistent dose and frequency of treatment availability.\u201d\n\nLegislation last year outlawed placement of the seriously mentally ill in long-term solitary, although the department had already committed to such a policy on its own.\n\nSince we\u2019d been critical of the department\u2019s reliance on solitary, it\u2019s only right to acknowledge significant progress. And it\u2019s also worth noting the progress extends to public safety. No prisoner today is released directly from the most highly restrictive status directly into the community, as was done in the past. The release in 2013 of Evan Ebel was the most notorious mistake in that regard, as he went on to commit two heinous murders, including the shooting of Raemisch\u2019s reform-minded predecessor, Tom Clements.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Moving beyond solitary confinement", "title": "Moving beyond solitary confinement", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/31/moving-beyond-solitary-confinement/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151231__OP03EDITp1.jpg", "height": 443}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151231__OP03EDITp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-31T15:18:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:02:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Solitary wasn\u2019t invented out of sadistic desire to inflict emotional damage on prisoners.\nIt wasn\u2019t so long ago that Colorado kept prisoners in solitary confinement \u2014 what the system calls administrative segregation \u2014 at a much higher rate than most states.\nBy 2011, in fact, more than 1,500 prisoners in Colorado, or 7 percent of the total inmate population, were languishing in solitary.\nBy contrast, today that figure has shrunk to about 160, or less than 1 percent of the prison population, according to an encouraging report released the other day by the Colorado Department of Corrections.\nSince we\u2019d been critical of the department\u2019s reliance on solitary, it\u2019s only right to acknowledge significant progress."}
