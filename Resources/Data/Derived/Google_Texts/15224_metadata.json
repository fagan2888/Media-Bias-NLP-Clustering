Bluhm, who works for the city of Denver\u2019s Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, is helping distribute the survey.\n\nShe and her family were evacuated in the Black Forest fire.\n\nBluhm said the project started in response to wildfires that struck California in 2012.\n\nParticipants and their children each will receive a $5 online gift certificate for the first survey, increasing to $10 for the second and $15 gift certificate for the third. Parents will also be entered into a drawing for a $200 gift certificate for each survey.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Research study seeks input from families recovering from Colorado\u2019s devastating wildfires", "title": "Research study seeks input from families recovering from Colorado\u2019s devastating wildfires", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/05/research-study-seeks-input-from-families-recovering-from-colorados-devastating-wildfires/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130831__20130901_A16_cd01wildfirejp1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130831__20130901_A16_cd01wildfirejp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-05T16:48:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:26:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4073\"", "article_summary": "Parents will also be entered into a drawing for a $200 gift certificate for each survey.\nParticipants and their children each will receive a $5 online gift certificate for the first survey, increasing to $10 for the second and $15 gift certificate for the third.\nThe study is hoping for input from victims of the Waldo Canyon fire in 2012 as well as the 2013 Black Forest fire.\nThe University of Colorado at Colorado Springs is joining the University of Iowa and the University of California-Santa Barbara in a research study attempting to understand the long-term impact of disasters on families.\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to find ways to help families become more resilient in the face of these disasters,\u201d Carolyn Hughes Bluhm said."}
