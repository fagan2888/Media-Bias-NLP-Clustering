That honor goes to a 24-year-old Swede named Felix Kjellberg, better known by his YouTube handle, PewDiePie. PewDiePie doesn\u2019t sing or dance, no. PewDiePie has made his name\u2014and a fortune\u2014posting videos of himself playing video games. In one November video, for instance, he plays the Xbox Indie game \u201cTechno Kitten Adventure,\u201d helping a feline avatar navigate dangerous terrain filled with unicorns and narwhals, and shrieking in frustration each time his cat crashes into an obstacle. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d he wails shortly before his grey kitten with a jetpack dies. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get more hardcore than this.\u201d In another, featuring the game \u201cTrouble in Terrorist Town,\u201d PewDiePie controls a military gunman who gleefully mows down other soldiers. Together, these two clips have attracted nearly 7 million views.\n\nIn his videos, PewDiePie laughs, swears, and goofs around as if he were hanging out with his best friend. But 23 million people subscribe to his YouTube channel. The top five Let\u2019s Players collectively have more YouTube subscribers than Peru has people. PewDiePie is a Let\u2019s Player, one of hundreds of gamers who post \u201cLet\u2019s Plays\u201d online (as in \u201cLet\u2019s Play Super Mario Bros.\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s Play Grand Theft Auto\u201d), videos that are part \u201cMystery Science Theater,\u201d part Siskel and Ebert reviews. As a Let\u2019s Player navigates a game, he (or more rarely, she) provides running commentary, usually funny and profane. Difficult as it may be to believe that online audiences throng to watch strangers play video games, Let\u2019s Plays have surged in popularity. The top five Let\u2019s Players collectively have more YouTube subscribers than Peru has people. A user-generated Wikia page tracking current Let\u2019s Players, their subscriber totals, and their videographies lists about 950 players with active YouTube channels, collectively followed by more than 60 million subscribers. And the Wikia page acknowledges that this isn\u2019t a comprehensive list. Let\u2019s Players aren\u2019t driven only by love of gaming. Many hope to one day make a living playing games on YouTube; a few already do. PewDiePie\u2019s estimated monthly revenue from YouTube ads fluctuates between $140,000 and $1.4 million depending on viewership, according to Social Blade, a company that monitors YouTube channels. Other players bank much smaller paychecks. Matthew Varrone, 20, makes between $600 and $1,000 a month in ad revenue from his videos\u2014not enough to rent an apartment, so he still lives with his parents in Milford, Connecticut\u2014but still impressive considering he earns it doing something millions of people do every day for fun, for free. His YouTube channel, \u201cAwesomefaceprod,\u201d has drawn 20,000 subscribers since he started Let\u2019s Playing in 2011. He\u2019s otherwise unemployed, and hopes eventually to support himself by playing video games. Because YouTube\u2019s advent eight years ago made it possible, albeit unlikely, for young gamers to become millionaires, online talent agencies, dubbed \u201cnetworks,\u201d have sprouted around the Let\u2019s Play phenomenon. PewDiePie\u2019s network, Maker Studios, a Hollywood media company, provides marketing and publicity exclusively for \u201cYouTube artists,\u201d taking a cut of the proceeds. Maker Studios, like the company that represents Varonne, Fullscreen, Inc., represents various kinds of YouTube content creators, such as gamers and musicians.*\n\nAlthough players realize that their chances of making millions are slim, many plan to parlay the skills they\u2019ve acquired on YouTube into careers in video editing, game testing, or software design. Typical of Let\u2019s Players, Varrone\u2019s interactions with viewers, other players, and Fullscreen take place entirely online. He has never visited the Fullscreen office in Los Angeles, met an employee in person, or even talked to one by phone. \u201cA lot of my life now exists online,\u201d Varrone told me. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty weird. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good thing or not.\u201d He does hang out with other Let\u2019s Players at gaming conventions\u2014such as the upcoming Penny Arcade Expo East (PAX) in April in Boston, which drew 80,000 visitors last year\u2014and considers some his closest friends despite almost never encountering them in real life. Also typical of most Let\u2019s Players, Varrone was on the receiving end of a copyright claim. Over three years, Nintendo filed Content ID claims against 15 of his videos, and those videos\u2019 ad revenues now go to the company instead of him. Publishers use YouTube\u2019s Content ID system to identify use of their intellectual property. If a video contains content that matches a publisher\u2019s ID, owners reserve the right to monetize, block or track the user-generated video. In more extreme cases, YouTube will remove a video, or an entire channel, if a publisher files a Digital Media Copyright Act (DMCA) complaint. Players often face such threats of legal action. Although their videos help promote companies like Nintendo, and Let\u2019s Players argue that they\u2019re protected by fair use, the gaming industry isn\u2019t thrilled about Let\u2019s Players siphoning ad dollars from its intellectual property. But murky legal issues haven\u2019t prevented gaming videos from drawing a huge chunk of YouTube\u2019s audience. Four of the top 10 YouTube channels ranked by Social Blade are gaming channels run by Let\u2019s Players. Players started uploading gaming videos to YouTube almost as soon as the site launched in February 2005. As its popularity swelled, so did Let\u2019s Plays; today 95 percent of all gamers flock to YouTube for information and entertainment, according to a Google report last year.\n\nOutsiders might assume these players are lonely nerds, but the audience for Let\u2019s Play videos is broader than they might expect. Varrone\u2019s viewers, for example, range in age from 12 to 25, and 46 percent of them are female. * * * The chance to earn money, let alone a living, by playing video games was an adolescent fantasy until YouTube launched its Partner Program in 2007. It allows eligible YouTube users to make money through Google AdSense, which runs targeted commercials alongside user-generated video. Users who join the partner program get 55 percent of advertising revenues\u2014the amount determined by the type of ad, its price, and how often the video is viewed\u2014while YouTube keeps the remaining 45 percent. A few hundred views per month hardly generates pocket change; tens of thousands might pay the rent. The millionaire PewDiePie is an outlier, but a few Let\u2019s Players do earn a modest living. Emile Rosales, the popular Let\u2019s Player ChuggaaConroy with over 750,000 subscribers, rents an apartment in suburban Atlanta and lives off Let\u2019s Plays, which provide his only source of income. Players partnered with networks aren\u2019t allowed to disclose their income, but Social Blade conservatively estimates Rosales\u2019s yearly earnings at $62,000. As an alternative to YouTube\u2019s Partner Program, users may seek membership in multi-channel networks (MCNs), like Maker Studios or Fullscreen, companies that manage YouTube channels and offer members such benefits as cross-promotion, product merchandising, tech support and perhaps a more desirable revenue split. Details are hammered out in individual contracts. Varrone, a Fullscreen member, says his subscriber count has quadrupled since he joined. \u201cAs a partner I\u2019m sort of obliged to say Fullscreen is a good network,\u201d Varrone said, laughing. \u201cBut I can honestly say that.\u201d Once a YouTube video is monetized, as long as the players can woo eyeballs to their channels, they receive a reliable income stream\u2014unless the video gets slapped with a copyright claim. In most cases Let\u2019s Players don\u2019t own the copyright to the games they record and profit from. Whether or not this is legal remains unclear.\n\nLet\u2019s Play videos exist in a gray area of the law. On the one hand, players appropriate footage\u2014sometimes wholesale\u2014from copyrighted video games and run ads on them. Game developers argue that this amounts to intellectual property theft, and is illegal without a license from the games\u2019 publishers. On the other had, a Let\u2019s Play video isn\u2019t simply a recording of a game; the player adds his narration and changes the experience for viewers. In legal language this is called \u201ctransformative fair use,\u201d and players believe that because they repurpose an original work, they should be allowed to continue. Let\u2019s Plays also provide free advertising for the games developers wish to sell. Since game developers and Let\u2019s Players have never gone to court, there\u2019s no precedent to shed light on the legality of Let\u2019s Plays. Greg Lastowka, who teaches Internet and property law at the Rutgers School of Law-Camden, finds the players\u2019 transformative fair use argument a solid one. He predicts that as Let\u2019s Players gain economic power, they may start challenging developers in court. Or developers may start to bring Let\u2019s Players into the fold, offering them licenses to make Let\u2019s Plays while taking a cut of ad revenue. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have these authorized amateur creators that are out there, and then we\u2019re going to have other people not realizing you need a license,\u201d Lastowka said. \u201cAs the market matures there\u2019s going to be a need to really clear up what the lines are.\u201d * * * When they\u2019re not at conventions like PAX, Let\u2019s Players stay in touch online, Skyping and Tweeting, drawn together by how much they love gaming. For players like Varrone, online activities have become a full-time job. He spends up to 30 hours every week playing games and recording, editing and rendering video on YouTube. He records his videos out of his makeshift recording studio\u2014his bedroom in Connecticut\u2014where he placed a red light outside his door that he switches on whenever he\u2019s recording to alert his parents and sister not to bug him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What?!", "author": "Christopher Zoia", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "What?!", "title": "This Guy Makes Millions Playing Video Games on YouTube", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/09/RTX15V0E/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/03/this-guy-makes-millions-playing-video-games-on-youtube/284402/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd31dc\"", "article_summary": "Difficult as it may be to believe that online audiences throng to watch strangers play video games, Let\u2019s Plays have surged in popularity.\nHe\u2019s otherwise unemployed, and hopes eventually to support himself by playing video games.\n* * * The chance to earn money, let alone a living, by playing video games was an adolescent fantasy until YouTube launched its Partner Program in 2007.\nHe spends up to 30 hours every week playing games and recording, editing and rendering video on YouTube.\nPewDiePie has made his name\u2014and a fortune\u2014posting videos of himself playing video games."}
