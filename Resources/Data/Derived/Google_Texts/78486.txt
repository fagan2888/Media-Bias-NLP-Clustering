Derek Jeter's golf game is apparently pretty good. (USATSI)

President Obama was in Las Vegas recently at the home of Las Vegas Sun owner Brian Greenspun. Obama was there for a fundraiser. In the process, he told a really great Derek Jeter story.

Apparently, Obama and Greenspun played golf with Jeter and The Captain took some dough off the most powerful man in the world.

“He and Derek Jeter stole money from me at Shadow Creek,” Obama said of Greenspun, referring to the course in North Las Vegas. “It was clearly a set up, because when we got to the practice range, he was shanking balls everywhere. I said, ‘You play golf Derek?' And he said, ‘I just started two weeks ago.'” They gave Jeter 30 strokes, Obama said, but he realized that was a mistake as soon as they were on the first hole. Jeter crushed him, he said. “We had to take a picture of me handing Derek Jeter money at the end of the game. Despite that, Brian is a great friend.”

Maybe if Obama read more Eye on Golf he would have known Jeter has been working on his game.
