Is it owning a house and having a job you love? Perhaps you want to be able to have children and send them off to school? Well, this year at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, members of the Republican Party are promising to help you make your dreams come true. On Thursday morning, CPAC\u2014an annual gathering at which a broad range of right-wing constituencies are represented\u2014officially started as presidential hopefuls, political pundits, conservative activists and college students filled the Gaylord National Convention Center at National Harbor, Maryland, just outside of the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nBecause both political parties go through great lengths to win over the powerhouse voting bloc\u2014millenials\u2014it was no surprise that \u201cReclaiming the American Dream: Millennials Look Toward Their Future\u201d was on the agenda. And who better to sit on that panel than U.S. Representative Mia Love of Utah?\n\nLove never misses a chance to remind people about her parents\u2019 humble beginnings. Jean and Mary Bordeaux immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, and Love has crafted a touching narrative about her parents\u2019 arrival in this country with only $10 to their name. But they still managed, as she tells it, to pull themselves up by their bootstraps; it\u2019s the Republican fairytale.\n\nDespite having their salaries paid by tax dollars, Republican politicians are rarely shy about expressing some hatred of the government, and Mia Love is no exception. Presenting government as nothing more than a hindrance to lives of Americans, Love explained to the CPAC audience that \u201cthe American people will rise to the occasion on their own. No nanny state needed, no big government required.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must advance the conservative principles that have lifted more people out of poverty and fueled more freedom and driven more dreams than any set of principles in the history of world,\u201d Love said. Of course, if conservative policies are supposed to help Americans achieve the dream that she speaks so fondly of\u2014I\u2019ve got a lot of questions.\n\nIn 2013, Frank Lucas sponsored the FARM bill that would have cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by $21 billion over the next 10 years. Nearly 2 million people, comprising mostly working families with children and the elderly, would have lost their food assistance.\n\nThe bill failed in the House, though\u2014Democrats thought the cuts were too deep while Tea Party Republicans believed they didn\u2019t go far enough. (Two million hungry people are just not enough.) The farm bill eventually passed in 2014 with \u201cmodest\u201d cuts of only $9 billion.\n\nHow exactly does cutting food assistance for millions of food insecure Americans lift them out of poverty?\n\nNot only do conservative policies send kids to school hungry, they send them to schools that routinely face budget cuts. On February 5, Republican Governor of Kansas, Sam Brownback, announced cuts to the education budget to the tune of $44.5 million dollars. Nothing says \u201chelping children succeed\u201d like forcing their schools to scrape for resources.\n\nNo Republican star missed their chance to criticize Obamacare. Referencing the supposed failure of the Affordable Care Act, Mia Love asked the audience to \u201cimagine a healthcare system that is centered on service and measured by outcomes. Not dictated by Washington.\u201d If conservatives have it their way, the Supreme Court will rule in their favor in the King v. Burwell case. According to Joshua Green, writing at Bloomberg News:\n\nIf the plaintiffs prevail, millions of people in 34 states who bought insurance on federal exchanges would suddenly lose the subsidies that make it affordable. Consequently, most would lose their coverage.\n\nMillions of people will lose their health insurance\u2026making them one medical emergency away from bankruptcy\u2014or worse, death.
