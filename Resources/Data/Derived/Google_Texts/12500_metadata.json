Some editorial pages and supporters have criticized the Obama administration and lawmakers for easing off on Medicare Advantage cuts ordered by the president's health-care law.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act calls for cuts to the Medicare Advantage program, which critics say subsidizes private insurers to cover Medicare beneficiaries at a higher cost to taxpayers. But the politics of cutting Medicare are no doubt getting in the way.\n\nAs a quick refresher: Last Monday, the Obama administration turned a proposed 1.9 percent cut to 2015 Medicare Advantage health plans into a .4 percent increase after heavy lobbying from insurers and the Hill. It was the second-straight year that the Medicare agency transformed a proposed rate cut into a raise.\n\nDespite last year\u2019s reversal on the proposed rate cut, insurers say they still saw their Medicare Advantage reimbursements shrink about 6 percent in 2014 plans. And today, Moody\u2019s Investor Service said even after last week\u2019s payment boost, the final 2015 rates are a \u201ccredit negative\u201d for Medicare Advantage insurers, who are anticipating an average reimbursement reduction between 3 percent to 4.5 percent next year.\n\nStill, Medicare Advantage enrollment has grown every year since the ACA passed in 2010. In fact, enrollment has increased more than 9 percent each year since 2012, when the ACA\u2019s cuts to the Medicare Advantage started to take effect.\n\nMoody\u2019s cites two reasons for the growth. First, health plans are effectively managing care and designing attractive benefit packages. Secondly, people enrolled in the program \u2013 almost one-third of all Medicare beneficiaries \u2014 tend to favor it over the traditional Medicare benefit.\n\nMoody\u2019s said it still expects membership growth in 2015, but not \u201cas robust\u201d as the growth rates the past two years.\n\nSo, why does Ombacare cut Medicare Advantage in the first place? The law is supposed to cut payments by $156 billion over 10 years because the program has historically reimbursed private insurers at a higher rate than the traditional Medicare program. Private plans are reimbursed at 106 percent of the traditional program, and Obamacare aims to close this gap.\n\nThe law\u2019s cuts to Medicare Advantage also helped fund the ACA's coverage expansion, which you might remember was a central part of the GOP attack during the 2012 campaign \u2013 that the Obama administration raided Medicare to pay for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIf that was a bad plan, we certainly didn\u2019t hear that from many ACA advocates circa 2010,\u201d writes Austin Frakt at the Incidental Economist today. \u201cWhy is it a bad plan today?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bad plan today because the politics are bad, as the Morning Consult captured this Sunday. Caving to political pressure on Medicare Advantage raises concerns about government\u2019s larger health-care efforts, Bloomberg View editors recently wrote.\n\n\u201cIf the government has this much trouble trimming a useless subsidy for the insurance industry, it will have a hard time being frugal when it comes to health spending that actually matters,\u201d they wrote late last week.\n\nAs the Moody\u2019s note today points out, Medicare cuts could have been steeper in 2015. The Medicare agency abandoned a home visit requirement that insurers say would have cut reimbursements by another 1-2 percent.\n\n\u201cAlthough [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] decided not to implement this proposal in 2015, it indicated that it may reconsider the reduction for 2016,\u201d Moody\u2019s writes.\n\nLet the lobbying begin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Analysts say insurers will still see payment reductions, and ACA supporters wonder why Medicare is backing down against the cuts.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Analysts say insurers will still see payment reductions, and ACA supporters wonder why Medicare is backing down against the cuts.", "title": "Medicare reversed payment cuts, and not many are happy about it", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/14/medicare-reversed-payment-cuts-and-not-many-are-happy-about-it/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2012/11/medicare.jpeg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jasonmillman"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/14/medicare-reversed-payment-cuts-and-not-many-are-happy-about-it/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e11\"", "article_summary": "Some editorial pages and supporters have criticized the Obama administration and lawmakers for easing off on Medicare Advantage cuts ordered by the president's health-care law.\nThe Affordable Care Act calls for cuts to the Medicare Advantage program, which critics say subsidizes private insurers to cover Medicare beneficiaries at a higher cost to taxpayers.\nInsurance analysts say they still anticipate lower payments to private Medicare Advantage plans in 2015.\nCaving to political pressure on Medicare Advantage raises concerns about government\u2019s larger health-care efforts, Bloomberg View editors recently wrote.\nSo, why does Ombacare cut Medicare Advantage in the first place?"}
