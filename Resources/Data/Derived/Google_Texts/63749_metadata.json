The tax accelerated the trend to get costs more under control,\u201d Ms. Umland said.\n\nOther steps more employers are taking include beefing up their wellness programs and adding telemedicine programs in which plan participants can call a toll-free number to get help from a medical professional \u2014 a far less costly alternative to going to an emergency room or even a traditional office visit.\n\n\u201cYou are talking about a $40 charge rather than $125 for an office visit,\u201d Ms. Umland said.\n\nThe survey findings are based on the responses of more than 1,200 employers who replied by Sept. 1. Complete survey findings, including how much group health care premiums increased in 2015, will be released later this year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "Employers expect health care plan cost increases next year to remain moderate, according to a Mercer L.L.C. survey released Wednesday.On average, after design changes, employers predict that in 2016 group plan costs will rise by an average of 4.2%, just slightly more than last year's actual average ...", "title": "Moderate health plan cost uptick predicted for 2016 - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20150916/NEWS03/150919856", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "Employers expect health care plan cost increases next year to remain moderate, according to a Mercer L.L.C. survey released Wednesday.On average, after design changes, employers predict that in 2016 group plan costs will rise by an average of 4.2%, just slightly more than last year's actual average ...", "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Moderate health plan cost uptick predicted for 2016 - Business Insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce9b1\"", "article_summary": "Employers expect health care plan cost increases next year to remain moderate, according to a Mercer L.L.C.\nThere are several strategies employers have deployed, with success, to keep plan cost increases at more moderate levels compared with the start of the decade, when double-digit annual cost increases \u2014 even after plan design changes \u2014 were the norm.\nIn addition, employers expect lower average cost increases before design changes in 2016.\nEmployers predict average costs before plan design changes, such as raising plan deductibles and coinsurance requirements, to increase by an average of 6.4% in 2016, down from 7.1% employers projected for 2015.\nThrough greater exposure to health expenses before plan coverage kicks in, CDHPs give employees a significant financial incentive to be better consumers of health care services, experts say."}
