HGGC Backs Auto IT Retailer Dealer-FX, Leveraging Acceleration in Car Sales

The PE firm, which also owns AutoAlert, expects to follow our successful playbook of taking growing companies global, says HGGC co-founder Steve Young, former 49ers quarterback

Middle-market private equity firm HGGC is investing in automotive software provider Dealer-FX, following its purchase of AutoAlert in 2014.

Dealer-FX, based in Las Vegas and Toronto, provides online services such as making appointments and service check-ins.

This is a great opportunity for HGGC to leverage our auto technology experience and follow our success playbook of taking growing companies global, says Steve Young, HGGC managing partnerand former San Francisco 49ers quarterback.

Were confident that they can capture greater market share in North America and continue to extend their footprint into international markets.

Financial terms of HGGCs investment are not disclosed.

Tech-focused HGGC closed its second fund valued at $1.3 billion in March 2015. The Palo Alto, California firm closed an impressive nine acquisitions and one exit in 2014, earning the firm Mergers and Acquisitions 2014 M&A Mid-Mark Private Equity Firm of the Year.

HGGC also owns automotive software company AutoAlert, which it backed in April 2014.

A pickup in global car sales continues to drive automotive M&A. In July, Lexington, Massachusetts-based Watermill Group purchased Quality Metalcraft Inc., a Livonia, Michigan-based maker of metal parts for vehicles.

Also in July, Chicago-based LKQ Corp. (Nasdaq: LKQ) said it will buy replacement parts distributor Coast Distribution System Inc. (NYSE: CRV) of Morgan Hill, California for $29 million.

Evercore is advising HGGC, and Vaquero Capital LLC is serving as financial adviser for Dealer-FX.
