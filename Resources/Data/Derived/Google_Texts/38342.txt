President Obama's approval rating is just 36 points higher than the total of number of people who signed up for Obamacare on the first day of the website launch.

Obama's approval rating's so low, Biden's considering dumping him as a running mate in favor of Hillary when he runs for President.

Obama has the same Gitmo policy as Bush, the same domestic surveillance policy as Bush and now, he has the same approval rating as Bush.
