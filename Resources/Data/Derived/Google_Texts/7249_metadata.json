Most of what Pat Vaillancourt says here will be familiar to you but the bit about Old Faithful is new to me. Evidently it wasn\u2019t enough to effectively lock elderly tourists inside their hotel. To make doubly sure that no one snuck up to the geyser for a pic while it was erupting, they drove down to the site 10-15 minutes beforehand and stood guard. That\u2019s how petty this was. Presumably even the tourists taking photos from the windows of the hotel ended up with their Old Faithful memento effectively being photobombed by the NPS. Take that, America.\n\nJonathan Last calls this the biggest scandal of Obama\u2019s presidency, just because of what it says about the nature of the government\u2019s relationship to the citizenry it allegedly answers to:\n\nIt\u2019s one thing for politicians to play shutdown theater. It\u2019s another thing entirely for a civil bureaucracy entrusted with the privilege of caring for our national heritage to wage war against the citizenry on behalf of a political party. This is how deep the politicization of Barack Obama\u2019s administration goes. The Park Service falls under the Department of the Interior, and its director is a political appointee. Historically, the directorship has been nonpartisan and the service has functioned as a civil, not a political, unit. Before the current director, Jonathan Jarvis, was nominated by President Obama, he\u2019d spent 30 years as a civil servant. But he has taken to his political duties with all the fervor of a third-tier hack from the DNC, marrying the disinterested contempt of a meter maid with the zeal of an ambitious party apparatchik.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re witnessing the end of the civil service,\u201d says David French at NRO. On that note, take your pick: You can watch four minutes of Vaillancourt recounting her experience below or, via Mark Steyn, listen to an eight-minute extended interview she gave to Michael Graham yesterday by clicking here. (\u201cAfter the shutdown, the only rangers we saw were the armed ones.\u201d) The most distressing part of her story, ironically, isn\u2019t how American citizens were treated, it\u2019s how the non-citizens in the group, some of whom didn\u2019t speak English, perceived what was happening to them. Money quote: \u201cIt really was concerning. You could feel the element of fear.\u201d They need a lawyer. I hope they get one.\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cPeople felt like they were in prison.\u201d", "title": "Tourist harassed by Park Rangers at Yellowstone: They patrolled in front of Old Faithful to keep people away whenever it was about to erupt", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/10/09/tourist-harassed-by-park-rangers-at-yellowstone-they-parked-suvs-in-front-of-old-faithful-whenever-it-was-about-to-erupt/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-09T15:21:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-09T16:01:37+00:00"}, "keywords": "Budget, dude ranch, hotel, national park service, rangers, shutdown, Vaillancourt, yellowstone,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9950\"", "article_summary": "Most of what Pat Vaillancourt says here will be familiar to you but the bit about Old Faithful is new to me.\nPresumably even the tourists taking photos from the windows of the hotel ended up with their Old Faithful memento effectively being photobombed by the NPS.\n\u201cWe\u2019re witnessing the end of the civil service,\u201d says David French at NRO.\nThe Park Service falls under the Department of the Interior, and its director is a political appointee.\nHistorically, the directorship has been nonpartisan and the service has functioned as a civil, not a political, unit."}
