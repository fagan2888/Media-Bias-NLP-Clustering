We celebrate a book that reminds us of what a great read can do to light up your life. Will Schwalbe, author of The End of Your Life Book Club, found a way to write about the books he and his mother read together as her life drew to a close. It makes you want to set aside a year to read what they did, because such wise and caring people have to reflect the stories they read. This is a tribute to the power of reading in our lives, the way it opens conversation, touches the deepest parts of ourselves, entertains and enlightens us. It turns out that The End of Your Life Book Club is very much about living in the best possible way.

Will's memoir is a beautiful book. You will long remember Will's wise mother, Mary Anne, and you just might feel as I do, that you can't wait to dive into the titles they chose to read together, from classic literature to current best sellers, from poetry to mysteries, from the fantastic to the spiritual.

This memoir reminds us how books can be comforting, astonishing, and illuminating, changing the way we connect with the world around us.

It is Will's love letter to his mother, yes, but also a love letter from Will and his late mother to us. They are saying this to us: through reading we have the chance to create meaning out of our unpredictable lives.
