In medicine, the usual answer is \u201cslowly.\u201d Clinical trials can show the efficacy of a new practice \u2014 yet, decades later, many physicians still haven\u2019t gotten the message.\n\nUntil four years ago, it seemed like early elective delivery was a textbook example of evidence widely ignored. These are induced or cesarean section deliveries after 37 completed weeks but before 39 completed weeks of gestation, when not medically necessary. The reason is usually convenience \u2014 the family is coming in for Christmas or the obstetrician will be off next week.\n\nDelivery at 37 or 38 weeks was widely considered benign \u2014 but it is not. Infant mortality is at least 50 percent higher for babies at 37 or 38 weeks than at 39 or 40 (at 41 weeks the rate rises again). These babies are also more likely to suffer breathing, feeding and developmental problems.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists had been warning against early elective delivery since 1979. The March of Dimes, one of the most respected advocacy groups in America, had long campaigned to discourage the practice.\n\n\n\nReducing these deliveries shouldn\u2019t have been hard \u2014 at least, they should have been easier to change than many other harmful practices. For one thing, a reduction in these deliveries saves money. An elective C-section costs a lot more than letting the baby choose the birth date. And fewer early deliveries mean fewer babies in the neonatal intensive care unit \u2014 one of the most expensive rooms in the hospital. (Average charge: $76,000, according to the March of Dimes (pdf).)\n\nAnother advantage was that the practice was clearly defined \u2014 there was relatively little debate about what \u201cmedically necessary\u201d means. The message from advocacy groups and medical societies was unified and unambiguous. Nor were the steps needed to reduce such deliveries complex: hospitals could simply bar them unless a doctor could show medical necessity. This is rare for safety improvements. Bringing down infection rates, for example, requires an entire hospital work force to adopt time-consuming new behaviors and routines.\n\nDespite the expert warnings, nothing happened. In 2010, these deliveries accounted for 17 percent of births. In some states, such as South Carolina, they represented more than a quarter of all deliveries.\n\nBut 2010 began a vertiginous drop, according to a survey of hospitals released last week by The Leapfrog Group, an organization funded by businesses that are large purchasers of health care to work for quality and safety improvement. Last year the national average was down to 4.6 percent \u2014 a fall of 73 percent in three years. \u201cIn health care, we talk about a 1 to 2 percent change as spectacular \u2014 wow, we\u2019ve really improved,\u201d said Leah Binder, the president and chief executive of The Leapfrog Group. \u201cI have never in my career seen anything like the progress we\u2019re seeing on early elective deliveries.\u201d\n\nSomething happened in 2010 that didn\u2019t happen before with these deliveries \u2014 and doesn\u2019t happen with other harmful practices. And that something may offer important clues to how to speed things up elsewhere.\n\n* Models for change. Elliott Main teaches obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University and is medical director of the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative. He\u2019s studied the drop in early elective deliveries, and said that the spark for it most likely came from a pair of articles published in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology in 2009. They described programs in a hospital in Pennsylvania and a group of hospitals in Utah that produced dramatic reductions in early elective deliveries. \u201cThose certainly made everybody sit up and say, yes we can improve obstetric care,\u201d said Main. \u201cIt showed there was a pressure point that was reducible.\u201d\n\n* Measurement. In 2010, the Leapfrog Group began asking hospitals to report early elective deliveries. About 750 hospitals, accounting for about half the births in the United States, complied. The rates they found shocked a lot of people. \u201cEven hospitals themselves didn\u2019t know they themselves have high rates,\u201d said Binder. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many medical directors called me and said, \u2018this can\u2019t be right.'\u201d\n\nThe hospitals Leapfrog count reported voluntarily, which means there could be some selection bias. But in 2013, the government\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 which under this administration has introduced glasnost to health care statistics \u2014 began requiring hospitals to report. The data coming in is consistent with Leapfrog\u2019s. The Joint Commission, an influential nonprofit that accredits hospitals, also recently began including this measure.\n\nMeasuring and publicizing rates of early elective delivery has helped in several ways. It revealed the dimensions of the problem. It tells hospitals how they are doing. It allows patients to choose safer hospitals, which exerts pressure for more safety. And it creates the basis for reimbursing hospitals in a way that discourages these deliveries.\n\n* Payment reform. The pioneers have been Texas and South Carolina. Texas in 2011 barred Medicaid (that\u2019s a state program; Medicare is federal), which pays for 55 percent of births, from reimbursing hospitals for early elective deliveries.\n\nIn 2011, South Carolina began the Birth Outcomes Initiative, a program designed to reduce prematurity, increase breast-feeding and make other changes for healthier babies. Those were not the only goals. Medicaid spending accounted for more than a quarter of the entire state budget. \u201cWe were looking to improve health outcomes and at the same time reduce our cost,\u201d said Melanie Giese, the program\u2019s director. The state\u2019s 43 hospitals that did births came together and signed a pledge to reduce these deliveries.\n\nTony Keck, the state\u2019s health and human services director, announced that if the voluntary effort was insufficient, the state would stop reimbursing hospitals for these deliveries. The only payments that South Carolina\u2019s government directly controlled were Medicaid ones. But the state was unusual in that its commercial market was dominated by one huge insurer: Blue Cross Blue Shield. Between them, Medicaid and Blue Cross covered 85 percent of the state\u2019s births. So when Blue Cross agreed to go along, hospitals listened. \u201cEven the hint that payment reform was coming meant that hospitals put that on the top of their priority list,\u201d said Binder.\n\nEvery hospital appointed one person to lead the drive to stop early elective deliveries. There were \u2014 still are \u2014 monthly meetings attended by more than 100 people. Each meeting begins with a success story from an individual hospital. Then attendees go to work on specific strategies and tactics. (For details see this case study by the group Catalyst for Payment Reform.)\n\nA year later, there was good progress, but South Carolina had started with one of the country\u2019s highest rates, and officials worried that progress had reached a plateau. Keck announced that the state would cut off payments the next year. The state\u2019s program gradually prepared hospitals to make the switch.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 2013, payments stopped. Data from that quarter shows that early elective inductions dropped by more than 45 percent since 2011. (Since reasons for C-sections are harder to collect and interpret, the state doesn\u2019t have good data for the program\u2019s effects on early elective C-sections.) NICU admissions were down. The state saved $6 million that quarter \u2014 25 percent of it from cheaper deliveries and 75 percent from fewer NICU admissions.\n\nSouth Carolina is the only state to halt reimbursements from Medicaid and private insurers. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have the all-payer approach,\u201d said Main. \u201cMedicaid doesn\u2019t pay very much for births. Doctors are much more sensitive to what commercial plans pay.\u201d The state is now a national model. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to 20 different states who have called us and asked how we did it,\u201d said Giese.\n\nRelated More From Fixes Read previous contributions to this series.\n\nThe federal government is also starting to reform payments for early elective deliveries \u2014 through Medicare. It might seem odd that Medicare has anything to say about this issue. (How many 65-year-olds have babies?) But Medicare does pay for some births, to disabled women. More to the point, it\u2019s the big stick, accounting for 35 to 55 percent of hospitals\u2019 revenue. Medicare is now linking 1.25 percent of its reimbursement to how well hospitals score on a basket of safety measures. Now that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requires hospitals to report early elective deliveries, that measure is likely to be added to the basket next year.\n\nMedicare reimburses hospitals less than commercial payers do, so even 1.25 percent can determine whether a hospital breaks even on Medicare or not. Still, it could be a lot more \u2014 the bigger the percentage, the more hospitals will prioritize safety.\n\nOne argument for raising the percentage is that it has to be big enough to make up for revenue lost due to healthier babies. NICUs are a major profit center for hospitals. Main said some hospitals complained that when they cracked down on early elective deliveries, their NICU revenues dropped. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to complain about that publicly,\u201d he said. (Those who do should fire their P.R. advisers; those who complain even in private need some serious soul-searching.) \u201cThey know that at the end of the day. But they\u2019re still trying to take care of their bottom line.\u201d\n\n* Collaboration. Transparency and payment reform create incentive for change. But they are not a strategy. South Carolina created a strategy through its monthly meetings to share and support best practices. Obamacare is trying to do something similar across the country with two programs. Partnership for Patients funds and supports networks of hospitals to improve safety. These networks get hospitals to agree to standards, provide model policies, training, technical assistance and monitoring. And Strong Start funds hospitals as they test ways to reduce early elective deliveries and spread those practices.\n\nWhat was most important in reducing early elective deliveries? All these pieces together. Plus strong public advocacy, good tools to help hospitals improve quality, and local leadership. \u201cMany improvement efforts don\u2019t get such a good response because they\u2019re approached from one dimension or direction,\u201d said Main. \u201cIt really comes down to having multiple different strategies at the same time.\u201d\n\nNote: An earlier version of this article got the name of The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wrong.
