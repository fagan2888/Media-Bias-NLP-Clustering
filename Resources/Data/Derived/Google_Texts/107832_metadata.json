Backroom deal making in Tennessee saw delegates loyal to other candidates selected to fill seats won by Donald Trump. The North Dakota State convention was roiled by arguments over how its delegates would vote. And Trump surrogate Roger Stone continued to promise \u201cDays of Rage\u201d style demonstrations in Cleveland if his candidate is deprived of the nomination by intraparty scheming.\n\nRelated: Cruz Could Win Big in Wisconsin as Trump\u2019s Numbers Drop\n\nPriebus, meanwhile, also had to address the issue of the leading candidate\u2019s electability, after a scandal-filled week involving his campaign manager\u2019s arrest, and his own controversial statements about issues from abortion to nuclear weapons. According to the latest polling, Trump is wildly unpopular with key demographic groups, including women, Hispanics, and African Americans.\n\n\u201cLook, every candidate has positives and every candidate has challenges that you have to overcome in the general election,\u201d Priebus said, before giving Trump credit for what he called \u201chistoric\u201d voter turnout numbers.\n\n\u201cI understand that we\u2019ve got some drama on our side of the aisle that we\u2019re going to have to contend with, and we\u2019ll be prepared to like never before,\u201d he promised.\n\nBut the drama within the party itself is going to play out long before the general election gets underway.\n\nRelated: More Legal Trouble for Team Trump as Protesters File Suit\n\nOver the weekend, the Trump campaign accused the Tennessee Republican Party of giving at least five delegates won by the New York billionaire to people who are actually supporters of Ted Cruz, the Texas senator currently in second place. Those delegates will be bound by state rules to vote for Trump on the first two ballots. But in a convention that looks more and more likely to go to multiple ballots, they would be allowed to vote their own preference after that.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign director for the state, Darren Morris, told The Tennessean newspaper that delegate slots that were supposed to go to people nominated directly by the Trump campaign were instead being filled by \u201cestablishment picks\u201d and said similar shenanigans are taking place across the country \u201cto steal a vote here, steal a delegate there, to affect the outcome of the convention in July and take the nomination away from Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in North Dakota over the weekend, the state Republican Party convention ground to a halt in a dispute over whom its delegates would support. North Dakota sends 28 delegates to the national convention, but there is no primary election. Instead of voting for a candidate at the polls, party members vote for individuals, who go to the convention with no obligation to support a specific candidate.\n\nIn a raucous session on the floor, the state party beat back a movement to force individuals named to a slate of delegates to declare their preferred candidate. It remained unclear Sunday afternoon just who would benefit from the confusion in North Dakota, but there was concern among some Trump supporters that the state party\u2019s insiders would try to engineer an outcome more favorable to an establishment candidate than to a brash outsider like Trump.\n\nRelated: The Worst Political Ad Ever Gets nosy with Ted Cruz\n\nThe complaints about Tennessee and North Dakota came just days after it was revealed that despite losing to Trump in Louisiana, Cruz would come away with more delegates than his rival because of post-primary horse-trading in which his representatives outmaneuvered Trump\u2019s.\n\nOn Sunday, Priebus tried to make the point that this was business-as-usual for a presidential primary, and made it clear that part of the job of a serious candidate is to develop a ground game in each state with skilled representatives familiar with their individual rules and idiosyncrasies.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not likely to fly with Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters. Stone, trump\u2019s former campaign manager who has retained close toes to the billionaire, has called for massive protests in Cleveland against what he\u2019s calling \u201cthe Big Steal.\u201d He repeatedly referred to the demonstrations as comparable to the \u201cDays of Rage\u201d Vietnam War protests that roiled Chicago in October 1969.\n\n\u201cCome to Cleveland,\u201d Stone urged Trump supporters in an appearance on the radio show hosted by conspiracy theorist and Trump supporter Alex Jones. \u201cDon\u2019t let the big steal go forward without massive protest. Peaceful, nonviolent protest. So, as they used to say, don\u2019t wait for orders from headquarters. Ride to the sound of the guns.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to imply violence on that. I mean, ride to where the action will be. We have to let the Republican bosses and the kingmakers and the insiders and the lobbyists know that we\u2019re not going to stand for the big steal. So if you are a Trump supporter, make plans now. Take a bus! Hitchhike! Carpool! Take a train! Fly, if you can afford it. We need you in Cleveland.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus made the rounds of all five major Sunday talk shows today, selling the line that all is going swimmingly in the GOP\u2019s primary elections.
