Washington (CNN)Chief Justice John Roberts — nominated by President George W. Bush in 2005 — is the jurist Republicans love to hate, most notably due to his decisive vote to uphold Obamacare.

GOP presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have criticized Roberts during the campaign. And Tuesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley took to the Senate floor and told Roberts to stay away from politics, because if Americans feel the court is political, it’s the court’s fault.

“The confirmation process has gotten political precisely because the court itself has drifted from the constitutional text and rendered decisions based instead on policy preferences … the chief justice is part of the problem,” Grassley said.
