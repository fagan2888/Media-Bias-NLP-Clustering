The monks are Catholic Cistercians, and are renowned for making some of the best beer in the world.\n\nUntil now Trappist beer has been brewed in only eight monasteries worldwide; six in Belgium, one in Holland and one in Austria. Their beer is recognized by the International Trappist Association as authentic.\n\nBut, as with most things, America doesn\u2019t want to get left behind \u2013 so as of today, 63 monks from St. Joseph\u2019s Abbey in Boston are about to try their hand at brewing some of the amber nectar.\n\nIt will mark the first time Trappist beer has been officially brewed outside of Europe, and the Boston monks, among others, are very excited about the prospect.\n\nA couple of years ago St. Joseph\u2019s decided to sent a couple of monks on a scouting mission to the Belgian beer fest in Boston. Their fact-finding mission was met with much skepticism though by their European \u2018brothers.\u2019\n\nFather Isaac Keeley said: \u201cThe original skepticism was because we were outside of Europe\u2026 and Americans. And the fear we would go too big too fast.\u201d\n\nFather Keeley, and another monk friend of his, decided to move to Belgium temporarily in order to find out out the Trappist beer was made.\n\nThe Europeans weren\u2019t the only ones skeptical about the move to brew. At the time there was more than a little concern from the members of abbey who were worried about the massive initial outlay of funds to start brewing.\n\nNevertheless, as the monastery buildings aren\u2019t cheap to maintain, an extra source of income, especially a lucrative one, was welcomed. The head of St Joseph\u2019s Abbey, Father Damian Carr said:\n\n\u201cWe see it as a 50-100 year project. (Just) as we\u2019re standing on the shoulders of those who came before us and built these building and supported the way of life, hopefully future generations will be able to stand on our shoulders, what we are doing \u2013 and we see the brewery as part of that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trappist beer has been uniquely brewed in Europe for more than a century by monks known as 'Trappists'.
