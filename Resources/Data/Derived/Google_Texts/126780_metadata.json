REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nRepublicans have fallen into a pattern during the Obama presidency.\n\nFirst, they seize opportunities to draw contrast with Democrats, often provoking conflict in Washington. Once the country\u2019s attention has been turned to disagreement about the pressing issues of the day, left-leaning media accuse Republicans of fomenting a crisis. Like clockwork, Republicans panic. They step back from legislative confrontation and aim instead to project \u201cresponsible\u201d governance, often by working across the aisle on what they bill as major accomplishments.\n\nBut a curious thing happens at the end of this cycle. After all the hand-wringing over dysfunction and the self-congratulation about turning a corner, just as Republicans believe things are going well for them politically, President Obama somehow rebounds in the polls.\n\nWe see it today.\n\nAt the close of the purportedly dysfunctional 113th Congress, congressional leaders promised an end to legislative cliffs and high-profile showdowns. Indeed, the emphasis this Congress has been on items like a permanent \u201cdoc fix\u201d and fast-track trade authority. In the words of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, this is \u201ca new Congress that\u2019s back to work on behalf of the American people.\u201d\n\nThe result? According to Gallup, Obama\u2019s favorability ratings have just hit an 18-month high\u201453 percent. And it\u2019s not the first time Republicans have watched his numbers get a boost just as they\u2019ve hit what they believed to be a stride.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t, of course, tell the whole story of the president\u2019s and the GOP\u2019s relative fortunes. But the contrast between the lift Obama gets during periods of bipartisan cooperation and the slide of his approval numbers when Congress takes a more oppositional posture is striking.\n\nFollowing Obama\u2019s post-bin Laden bounce in May 2011, his approval rating steadily declined as House Republicans seized on the issue of overspending. That August, following the debt-ceiling showdown, Obama\u2019s approval rating dipped below 40 percent. And during the 2013 Obamacare funding debate, the president\u2019s numbers steadily declined.\n\nThe takeaway is that when the action in Washington exposes\u2014and doesn\u2019t smooth over\u2014the fundamental differences between Republicans and Democrats, Obama\u2019s favorability suffers. But when legislators accommodate the White House for the sake of avoiding \u201cdysfunction,\u201d the president benefits.\n\nThe impact on congressional Republicans is less obvious. For much of 2011, the party\u2019s favorability hovered in the mid-30s even as it was consistently leading the generic congressional ballot. The reason is fairly straightforward according to Gallup: a president\u2019s standing with voters \u201cis usually a significant predictor of election outcomes.\u201d\n\nAnd this is where legislative conflict comes into play. As The Post\u2019s Chris Cillizza notes, \u201cin the absence of bad news,\u201d the trend among unaffiliated voters is \u201cto want to give Obama the benefit of the doubt.\u201d As the New Yorker\u2019s Jeffrey Toobin suggests, \u201cFor many people, the President of the United States is the government of the United States.\u201d\n\nBut even if this thesis\u2014that the public blames the president when it thinks Washington can\u2019t function\u2014accounts, at least in part, for this general trend, conservatives suspect there\u2019s another factor. The political battles in which Obama has fared most poorly have been notable, not merely because they generated perceived dysfunction in Washington, but also because they\u2019ve served to crack the veneer of centrism that President Obama and his party present to the electorate.\n\nSo if Republican politicians really want to advance conservative legislation, they have to embrace the reality that the only way to win a debate is to have one.\n\nWhen Republicans draw meaningful distinctions between their priorities and Democrats\u2019 priorities\u2014like they have with spending, Obamacare and immigration\u2014voters have been forced to confront the ideological differences between the parties and choose between them. When Republicans acquiesce to the president\u2019s agenda\u2014like they\u2019ve done with his nominees, funding unlawful executive actions and insurance industry subsidies\u2014and allow Democrats to present themselves as reasonable governing partners, there\u2019s no contrast for voters to observe.\n\nThese two explanations are complementary, of course, not completely distinct. Legislative gridlock doesn\u2019t occur arbitrarily; it\u2019s our political system\u2019s built-in method of addressing debates in which the country is far from consensus. Conservatives win when we expose those fault lines.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t a new concept for the GOP. In \u201cDo Not Ask What Good We Do: Inside the U.S. House of Representatives,\u201d Robert Draper quotes then-chief deputy whip, now-House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy as saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta challenge them on every single bill and challenge them on every single campaign.\u201d Exactly right.\n\nGoverning does not just mean passing bills. It means showing how those bills fit into a coherent vision for the nation. Conservatives and progressives have different visions and the path to the White House in 2016 requires showing how ours is superior to theirs.\n\nWhen the opportunity for debate presents itself\u2014as is now the case with the fight over the Democrat-supported corporate-welfare fund known as the Export-Import Bank\u2014approval numbers offer a corrective to any temptation GOP legislators might have to buckle. Debate sometimes leads to gridlock but always provides the opportunity to gain voters\u2019 support.
