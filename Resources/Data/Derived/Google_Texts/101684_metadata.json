(NYSE: MTU) and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (NYSE: SMFG) are reportedly among the expected bidders for General Electric (NYSE: GE)\u0092s $5 billion GE Capital Asia, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Japanese unit makes loans for equipment purchases. The fleet-management business, which helps Japanese trucking and logistics companies finance purchases of trucks, is considered particularly attractive. Japan\u0092s financial services companies have been active acquirers of assets that have come up for sale on the global market in the wake of post-recession regulations. For example, in February, Mizuho Financial Group Inc. agreed to buy Royal Bank of Scotland Group.\n\nOn April 10, GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt said that the company would divest GE Capital as a move to shed its status as a Systematically Important Financial Institution and to refocus on industrial businesses. When Mergers & Acquisitions asked GE to comment on the Journal report about the sale process for GE Capital Asia, a spokesperson said it was \u0093consistent\u0094 with the company\u0092s April announcement.\n\nMeanwhile, in the middle market, all eyes are focused on GE Capital\u0092s private equity lending unit, GE Capital Sponsor Finance, which includes sought-after GE Antares group. GE Capital Sponsor Finance is expected to sell first and quickly, a source inside GE told Mergers & Acquisitions previously. Bidders for the PE loan group may include Apollo Global Management (NYSE: APO), Ares Management (NYSE: ARES), Blackstone Group (NYSE: BX), Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. LLP (NYSE: KKR), Mitsubishi UFJ and SunTrust Banks (NYSE: STI).\n\nGE Capital Sponsor Finance -- which, in addition to Antares includes TMT, GE Equity and the Bank Loan Group -- has long played a powerful role in middle-market dealmaking. GE Capital is the largest lender in the space by a wide margin, making an estimated 25 percent of all loans made to companies with revenues between $25 million and $500 million. GE Capital has won Mergers & Acquisitions M&A Mid-Market Lender of the Year award twice \u0096 first for 2010 and most recently for 2014.\n\nFor more on GE Antares and the current lending climate, read Mergers & Acquisitions' recent Q&A with GE Antares CEO David Brackett.\n\nLike many of today\u0092s middle-market firms, GE Capital Sponsor Finance traces many of its roots back to Heller Financial, the Chicago-based finance firm that rose to prominence in the '80s and '90s by focusing exclusively on the middle market. Heller Financial was born in 1985, out of the phoenix's ashes of Walter E. Heller, which had been founded in 1919 and was acquired by Fuji Bank in 1984. Fuji poached a pair of executives from GE, Norm Blake and Bob Koe, to run the new firm, christened Heller Financial. Blake and Koe quickly changed the firm's focus from a leasing and asset-based commercial real estate lending company to a broader lending institution to serve the middle market -- which was becoming increasingly important to the private equity community as middle-market firms and divisions started to sprout.\n\nHeller developed a culture of nurturing talent. In 1996, a dozen Heller executives, including Brackett, left to form their own firm, Antares Capital, which was backed by Mass Mutual Life Insurance Co. Both Heller and Antares thrived and became attractive targets in their own rights. GE Capital bought Heller in 2001 for $5.3 billion in cash. Then in 2005, GE Capital bought Antares. The Antares acquisition roughly doubled the size of GE Capital\u0092s middle-market lending business at the time.\n\nToday, Antares has about $14 billion in assets under management. It is considered the jewel in the crown of GE Capital Sponsor Finance.\n\nOverall, interest in the Commercial Lending division has been very high since GE announced the sale of GE Capital on April 10. Commercial Lending consists of six units: GE Capital Corporate Finance, GE Capital Sponsor Finance, GE Capital Franchise Finance, GE Capital Healthcare Finance, GE Capital Equipment Finance and GE Capital Commercial Distribution Finance. (See related graphic). Apollo, Blackstone, Mitshibishi, and Wells Fargo & Co. have reportedly considered bids on the Commercial Lending division.\n\nMeanwhile, one piece of GE Capital outside the Commercial Lending division already has buyers, with Blackstone and Wells Fargo snatching up real estate operations for about $26.5 billion. That deal was announced the same day GE said it would divest GE Capital to focus on its industrial business. GE has cited the successful initial public offering of its retail finance business, Synchrony Financial, as evidence that its financial services assets could be more valuable to others. The business model for large, wholesale-funded financial companies changed, and that would make it harder to generate acceptable returns going forward, says GE. The company also hopes the sale will free it from increased regulation by removing its designation as a Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI). Previously, GE said in March that it would sell its Australia and New Zealand consumer lending operation as part of a plan to reduce GE Capital's overall share of GE earnings.\n\n--Mary Kathleen Flynn and Danielle Fugazy contributed to this report.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/financial_services/general-electric-said-to-sell-ge-capital-asias-japanese-commercial-256248-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/ge_capital_building.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "GE Capital Asia\u2019s Japanese Commercial Finance Unit Said to Interest Mitsubishi UFJ and Sumitomo Mitsui"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd19b8\"", "article_summary": "Commercial Lending consists of six units: GE Capital Corporate Finance, GE Capital Sponsor Finance, GE Capital Franchise Finance, GE Capital Healthcare Finance, GE Capital Equipment Finance and GE Capital Commercial Distribution Finance.\nFor more on GE Antares and the current lending climate, read Mergers & Acquisitions' recent Q&A with GE Antares CEO David Brackett.\nMeanwhile, in the middle market, all eyes are focused on GE Capital\u0092s private equity lending unit, GE Capital Sponsor Finance, which includes sought-after GE Antares group.\nOverall, interest in the Commercial Lending division has been very high since GE announced the sale of GE Capital on April 10.\nThat deal was announced the same day GE said it would divest GE Capital to focus on its industrial business."}
