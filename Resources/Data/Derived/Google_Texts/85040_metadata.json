They include billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott Management and Aurelius Capital Management.\n\n\"There might be a chance that in the next few days they come on board,\" Prat-Gay told Radio Mitre. \"They're looking at the offer. They've been getting closer to our position.\"\n\nHURDLES REMAIN\n\nMacri's pursuit of a swift settlement contrasts with the defiant position of his leftist predecessor, Cristina Fernandez, who refused to offer better terms than the steep writedown accepted by most creditors in earlier bond restructurings.\n\nShe labeled the holdout investors \"vultures\".\n\nMacri needs a quick settlement to restore foreign investors' battered confidence and return Argentina to global debt markets. Foreign credit is sorely needed to bolster Argentina's thin central bank reserves and to finance a gaping fiscal deficit.\n\nObstacles to a final deal remain, however.\n\nArgentina's offer represents a roughly 25 percent discount on what they claim, and debt strategists expect the remaining holdouts to demand better terms.\n\nMacri will also need approval from Congress, where he lacks a majority.\n\nIf negotiations were to drag into the second half of the year, it might make it more difficult for Macri to make good on election promises to revive the spluttering economy.\n\nBut for now, many investors are optimistic.\n\n\"A deal will totally change the outlook. It will be extraordinary for this country,\" Cristiano Rattazzi, president of Fiat Argentina, told newspaper La Nacion, welcoming the prospect of lower sovereign and corporate borrowing costs.\n\nAlejo Costa, chief strategist at Buenos Aires-based brokerage Puente, said he expected bond prices to stage a modest rally of up to one cent on the dollar on Monday following news of the offer. More sustained gains would come with a final deal, he said.\n\n\"We expect a three to four points once Elliott and Aurelius accept, and five more points at least once Congress approves it,\" Costa said.\n\n(Editing by Helen Popper and Nick Zieminski)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors on Saturday praised the speed with which n", "title": "Investors cheer Argentina's swift offer to holdouts", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/06/Investors-welcome-Argentinas-swift-offer-holdouts", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/argentina-debt_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/06/Investors-welcome-Argentinas-swift-offer-holdouts", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/argentina-debt_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "BUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors on Saturday praised the speed with which n", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"We're hopeful this government will have a much more conciliatory relationship with all of its creditors,\" Shahida said.\nArgentina's offer represents a roughly 25 percent discount on what they claim, and debt strategists expect the remaining holdouts to demand better terms.\nIt will be extraordinary for this country,\" Cristiano Rattazzi, president of Fiat Argentina, told newspaper La Nacion, welcoming the prospect of lower sovereign and corporate borrowing costs.\nMacri needs a quick settlement to restore foreign investors' battered confidence and return Argentina to global debt markets.\nForeign credit is sorely needed to bolster Argentina's thin central bank reserves and to finance a gaping fiscal deficit."}
