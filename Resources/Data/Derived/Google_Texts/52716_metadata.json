For the Republican establishment, it seems, history begins and ends in the 1990s: No matter how times have perilously changed, any talk of shutdowns or impeachment is bad, bad, bad. Yes, the Obama \u201cuber-presidency,\u201d as left-of-center law professor Jonathan Turley called it, has enveloped the nation in what he conceded is \u201cthe most serious constitutional crisis . . . of my lifetime,\u201d but GOP strategists would just as soon have us chattering about immigration \u201creform\u201d and bravely balancing the federal budget by, oh, around 2040.\n\nBut as we discussed in this August column \u2014 back when the first anniversary of the Benghazi massacre loomed, back when many Americans still believed that if they liked their health-insurance plans, they could keep their health-insurance plans \u2014 it is not crazy to talk about impeaching President Obama. And if you\u2019re going to have a congressional hearing about systematic presidential lawlessness, it is only natural that the word \u201cimpeachment\u201d gets bandied about. Not only is impeachment the intended constitutional remedy for systematic presidential lawlessness; it is, practically speaking, the only remedy.\n\nIt is beyond cavil that the president is willfully undermining the constitutional system that he swore to preserve, protect, and defend. He presumes to rewrite, and dramatically alter, the laws he vowed to execute faithfully \u2014 not once in a blue moon but as a deliberate scheme of governance.\n\nBefore he took office, Obama boldly promised supporters that he would \u201cfundamentally transform the United States of America.\u201d That is just what he is doing. There is fraud in the uber-presidency, but no mystery: Most of Obama\u2019s unconstitutional usurpations are happening in broad daylight. He brags that his \u201cwaivers\u201d \u2014 i.e., his unilateral amending, repealing, or non-enforcement \u2014 of statutory provisions show him to be far-seeing and pragmatic, not lawless. That, of course, is the standard dictatorial self-image. Obama is the answer to Tom Friedman\u2019s China-envying prayers.\n\nJust as there is no mystery in Obama\u2019s disregard for the Constitution, there is no secret about the Constitution\u2019s answer to executive imperialism. The Framers recognized that presidential abuse of power carried the greatest potential to wreck the republic. Adamant that the presidency they were creating must not become a monarchy, they carried on debates over the Constitution that were consumed with precluding this very real possibility. In the end, the Framers armed Congress with two responsive weapons: the power of the purse and the power of impeachment.\n\nAs we have seen through the years, the power of the purse is not a practical check on Obama. In the main, this is because the Framers, notwithstanding their prescient alarm over the problem of factions, did not anticipate the modern Left.\n\nThe Constitution assumes that the different branches of government will protect their institutional turf. That is, the Framers calculated that, faced with a Democratic president who usurps legislative prerogatives, a Democratic congressman would see himself, first and foremost, as a congressman. Valuing the duties of his office over party loyalty, he would join with other legislators to rein in executive excess.\n\nToday\u2019s Democrats, however, are less members of a party than of the movement Left. Their objective, like Obama\u2019s, is fundamental transformation of a society rooted in individual liberty and private property to one modeled on top-down, redistributionist statism. Since statism advances by concentrating governmental power, Democrats \u2014 regardless of what governmental branch they happen to inhabit \u2014 rally to whatever branch holds the greatest transformative potential. Right now, that is the presidency. Thus, congressional Democrats do not insist that the president must comply with congressional statutes. Laws, after all, must be consistent with the Constitution to be valid, and are thus apt to reflect the very constitutional values the Left is trying to supplant. Democrats want the president to use the enormous raw power vested in his office by Article II to achieve statist transformation. If he does so, they will support him. They\u2019ll get back to obsessing over the \u201crule of law\u201d if, by some misfortune, the Republicans someday win another presidential election.\n\nWhile Democrats quite intentionally defy the Framers\u2019 design, Republicans frustrate it by aggressive passivity. The Constitution divides power by subject matter, not percentage of governmental control. The party that controls the House has full primacy over taxing and spending, every bit as much as the party that controls the executive branch has plenary control over prosecution decisions. Constitutional authorities are not contingent on how much, if any, control the party in question has over the rest of government. In theory, then, nothing in government can happen unless the House, with ultimate power over the purse, agrees to fund it. If a corrupt administration uses the IRS as a partisan weapon to audit and harass its detractors, the House can refuse to fund the IRS \u2014 or other parts of the executive branch \u2014 to quell executive overreach.\n\nNevertheless, Republicans incessantly tell supporters that, since they control only the House (just \u201cone-half of one-third of the government,\u201d as the tired refrain goes), they are impotent to rein in Obama\u2019s excesses. And when conservatives in the House or Senate urge that Republicans use their command over the purse to stop Obama\u2019s excesses \u2014 just as congressional Democrats have historically used the power of the purse to stop Republican presidents from prosecuting the Vietnam War and aiding the Nicaraguan Contras \u2014 Republican leadership turns on those conservatives with a ferocity rarely evident in their dealings with the president.\n\nWith Democrats energized by Obama\u2019s lawbreaking, and Republicans paralyzed by the prospect of government shutdowns, there is no realistic prospect that Congress will starve Obama of funding. That leaves impeachment as the sole remaining constitutional safeguard against executive imperialism.\n\nThere is nothing else.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Judiciary Committee hearing was enlightening. To the extent that members needed educating on impeachment standards, the experts affirmed the principles we outlined in August. \u201cHigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d the Constitution\u2019s standard for impeachment, are the misdeeds of high officials \u2014 what Hamilton referred to as abuses of the \u201cpublic trust,\u201d violations of a \u201cpolitical\u201d nature in the sense that \u201cthey relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.\u201d\n\nHamilton\u2019s emphasis on \u201cpolitical\u201d is salient. It is the point that Republican leaders, still licking their wounds 13 years after Bill Clinton left the Oval Office, must grasp if they are ever to take the right lesson from the Nineties.\n\nImpeachment is a political remedy, not a legal one. Thus the quasi-legal component \u2014 proving high crimes and misdemeanors \u2014 is the easy part. As a practical matter, fundamental transformation cannot occur without high crimes and misdemeanors being committed against the constitutional order that is being transformed. That\u2019s the whole point.\n\nSo, as one would expect, President Obama is intentionally and sweepingly violating his oath of office. He is not faithfully executing federal law \u2014 he picks, chooses, \u201cwaives,\u201d and generally makes up law as he goes along. He has willfully and materially misled the American people \u2014 his Obamacare and Benghazi lies being only the most notorious examples. He has been woefully derelict in his duty to protect and defend Americans overseas. His administration trumped up a shameful prosecution (under the guise of a \u201csupervised release violation\u201d) against a filmmaker in order to bolster the \u201cBenghazi massacre was caused by an anti-Muslim video\u201d charade. His administration has used the federal bureaucracy to usurp Congress\u2019s legislative powers and to punish political enemies. Obama has presumed to make recess appointments when Congress was not in recess. His administration intentionally allowed firearms to be transferred to Mexican drug cartels, predictably resulting in numerous violent crimes, including the murder of a Border Patrol agent. His administration \u2014 and, in particular, the Justice Department \u2014 has routinely stonewalled lawmakers and frustrated their capacity to perform agency oversight, to the point that the attorney general has been held in contempt of Congress. The Obama Justice Department, moreover, has filed vexatious lawsuits against sovereign states over their attempts to vindicate their constitutional authorities (and, indeed, to enforce federal immigration laws), while the Justice Department itself adheres to racially discriminatory enforcement policies in violation of the Constitution and federal civil-rights laws.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list of Obama abuses, but you get the idea. If the only issue were commission of high crimes and misdemeanors, the Constitution requires only one for impeachment \u2014 not the Obama pace, which is more like one per week.\n\nBut here is the important thing: High crimes and misdemeanors are a subordinate consideration. In an impeachment case, they are necessary but they are not close to being sufficient. Because impeachment is a political remedy, its most essential component is the popular political will to remove a president from power.\n\nThe charges against Bill Clinton plainly satisfied the \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d threshold, and he was clearly guilty of them. But the American people obviously did not want Clinton removed over them. That is the lesson of the Clinton impeachment. It doesn\u2019t matter what can be proved. You can have a hundred articles of impeachment; what counts is what Americans think of their president. The question is not whether the president has done wrong \u2014 that will rarely be in dispute. The question is how convinced the public is that a president\u2019s continued hold on power profoundly threatens their safety, prosperity, and sense of what kind of country we should be.\n\nAs things now stand, the public is not convinced. There is no political will to remove the president.\n\nCould things change? Of course they could. Richard Nixon won a landslide reelection in 1972 \u2014 prevailing by 503 electoral votes and 18 million popular votes \u2014 and resigned to avoid certain impeachment and removal less than two years later. Obama, by contrast, won a fairly close reelection (in which his popular-vote tally dropped by about 4 million from his initial election), and his approval ratings are now tanking. Yet, he remains defiant about his agenda \u2014 desperately pivoting this week from the Obamacare debacle to that old class-warfare favorite, U.S. \u201cincome inequality.\u201d He has signaled every intention to plow ahead for the next three years with unpopular edicts. As he does so, the hard truths about his legacy health-care \u201creform\u201d will be visited on tens of millions of Americans. Concurrently, his stewardship is making the world an increasingly unstable place. Obama is causing pain, and pain can change people\u2019s minds.\n\nTwo things, however, are certain. Absent the political will to remove the president, he will remain president no matter how many high crimes and misdemeanors he stacks up. And absent the removal of the president, the United States will be fundamentally transformed.\n\n\u2014 Andrew C. McCarthy is a senior fellow at the National Review Institute.

His administration intentionally allowed firearms to be transferred to Mexican drug cartels, predictably resulting in numerous violent crimes, including the murder of a Border Patrol agent. His administration \u2014 and, in particular, the Justice Department \u2014 has routinely stonewalled lawmakers and frustrated their capacity to perform agency oversight, to the point that the attorney general has been held in contempt of Congress. The Obama Justice Department, moreover, has filed vexatious lawsuits against sovereign states over their attempts to vindicate their constitutional authorities (and, indeed, to enforce federal immigration laws), while the Justice Department itself adheres to racially discriminatory enforcement policies in violation of the Constitution and federal civil-rights laws.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list of Obama abuses, but you get the idea. If the only issue were commission of high crimes and misdemeanors, the Constitution requires only one for impeachment \u2014 not the Obama pace, which is more like one per week.\n\nBut here is the important thing: High crimes and misdemeanors are a subordinate consideration. In an impeachment case, they are necessary but they are not close to being sufficient. Because impeachment is a political remedy, its most essential component is the popular political will to remove a president from power.\n\nThe charges against Bill Clinton plainly satisfied the \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d threshold, and he was clearly guilty of them. But the American people obviously did not want Clinton removed over them. That is the lesson of the Clinton impeachment. It doesn\u2019t matter what can be proved. You can have a hundred articles of impeachment; what counts is what Americans think of their president. The question is not whether the president has done wrong \u2014 that will rarely be in dispute. The question is how convinced the public is that a president\u2019s continued hold on power profoundly threatens their safety, prosperity, and sense of what kind of country we should be.\n\nAs things now stand, the public is not convinced. There is no political will to remove the president.\n\nCould things change? Of course they could. Richard Nixon won a landslide reelection in 1972 \u2014 prevailing by 503 electoral votes and 18 million popular votes \u2014 and resigned to avoid certain impeachment and removal less than two years later. Obama, by contrast, won a fairly close reelection (in which his popular-vote tally dropped by about 4 million from his initial election), and his approval ratings are now tanking. Yet, he remains defiant about his agenda \u2014 desperately pivoting this week from the Obamacare debacle to that old class-warfare favorite, U.S. \u201cincome inequality.\u201d He has signaled every intention to plow ahead for the next three years with unpopular edicts. As he does so, the hard truths about his legacy health-care \u201creform\u201d will be visited on tens of millions of Americans. Concurrently, his stewardship is making the world an increasingly unstable place. Obama is causing pain, and pain can change people\u2019s minds.\n\nTwo things, however, are certain. Absent the political will to remove the president, he will remain president no matter how many high crimes and misdemeanors he stacks up. And absent the removal of the president, the United States will be fundamentally transformed.\n\n\u2014 Andrew C. McCarthy is a senior fellow at the National Review Institute.

For the Republican establishment, it seems, history begins and ends in the 1990s: No matter how times have perilously changed, any talk of shutdowns or impeachment is bad, bad, bad. Yes, the Obama \u201cuber-presidency,\u201d as left-of-center law professor Jonathan Turley called it, has enveloped the nation in what he conceded is \u201cthe most serious constitutional crisis\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0of my lifetime,\u201d but GOP strategists would just as soon have us chattering about immigration \u201creform\u201d and bravely balancing the federal budget by, oh, around 2040.\n\nBut as we discussed in this August column \u2014 back when the first anniversary of the Benghazi massacre loomed, back when many Americans still believed that if they liked their health-insurance plans, they could keep their health-insurance plans \u2014 it is not crazy to talk about impeaching President Obama. And if you\u2019re going to have a congressional hearing about systematic presidential lawlessness, it is only natural that the word \u201cimpeachment\u201d gets bandied about. Not only is impeachment the intended constitutional remedy for systematic presidential lawlessness; it is, practically speaking, the only remedy.\n\nIt is beyond cavil that the president is willfully undermining the constitutional system that he swore to preserve, protect, and defend. He presumes to rewrite, and dramatically alter, the laws he vowed to execute faithfully \u2014 not once in a blue moon but as a deliberate scheme of governance.\n\n#ad#Before he took office, Obama boldly promised supporters that he would \u201cfundamentally transform the United States of America.\u201d That is just what he is doing. There is fraud in the uber-presidency, but no mystery: Most of Obama\u2019s unconstitutional usurpations are happening in broad daylight. He brags that his \u201cwaivers\u201d \u2014 i.e., his unilateral amending, repealing, or non-enforcement \u2014 of statutory provisions show him to be far-seeing and pragmatic, not lawless. That, of course, is the standard dictatorial self-image. Obama is the answer to Tom Friedman\u2019s China-envying prayers.\n\nJust as there is no mystery in Obama\u2019s disregard for the Constitution, there is no secret about the Constitution\u2019s answer to executive imperialism. The Framers recognized that presidential abuse of power carried the greatest potential to wreck the republic. Adamant that the presidency they were creating must not become a monarchy, they carried on\u00a0debates over the Constitution that were consumed with precluding this very real possibility. In the end, the Framers armed Congress with two responsive weapons: the power of the purse and the power of impeachment.\n\nAs we have seen through the years, the power of the purse is not a practical check on Obama. In the main, this is because the Framers, notwithstanding their prescient alarm over the problem of factions, did not anticipate the modern Left.\n\nThe Constitution assumes that the different branches of government will protect their institutional turf. That is, the Framers calculated that, faced with a Democratic president who usurps legislative prerogatives, a Democratic congressman would see himself, first and foremost, as a congressman. Valuing the duties of his office over party loyalty, he would join with other legislators to rein in executive excess.\n\nToday\u2019s Democrats, however, are less members of a party than of the movement Left. Their objective, like Obama\u2019s, is fundamental transformation of a society rooted in individual liberty and private property to one modeled on top-down, redistributionist statism. Since statism advances by concentrating governmental power, Democrats \u2014 regardless of what governmental branch they happen to inhabit \u2014 rally to whatever branch holds the greatest transformative potential. Right now, that is the presidency. Thus, congressional Democrats do not insist that the president must comply with congressional statutes. Laws, after all, must be consistent with the Constitution to be valid, and are thus apt to reflect the very constitutional values the Left is trying to supplant. Democrats want the president to use the enormous raw power vested in his office by Article II to achieve statist transformation. If he does so, they will support him. They\u2019ll get back to obsessing over the \u201crule of law\u201d if, by some misfortune, the Republicans someday win another presidential election.#page#\n\nWhile Democrats quite intentionally defy the Framers\u2019 design, Republicans frustrate it by aggressive passivity. The Constitution divides power by subject matter, not percentage of governmental control. The party that controls the House has full primacy over taxing and spending, every bit as much as the party that controls the executive branch has plenary control over prosecution decisions. Constitutional authorities are not contingent on how much, if any, control the party in question has over the rest of government. In theory, then, nothing in government can happen unless the House, with ultimate power over the purse, agrees to fund it. If a corrupt administration uses the IRS as a partisan weapon to audit and harass its detractors, the House can refuse to fund the IRS \u2014 or other parts of the executive branch \u2014 to quell executive overreach.#ad#\n\nNevertheless, Republicans incessantly tell supporters that, since they control only the House (just \u201cone-half of one-third of the government,\u201d as the tired refrain goes), they are impotent to rein in Obama\u2019s excesses. And when conservatives in the House or Senate urge that Republicans use their command over the purse to stop Obama\u2019s excesses \u2014 just as congressional Democrats have historically used the power of the purse to stop Republican presidents from prosecuting the Vietnam War and aiding the Nicaraguan Contras \u2014 Republican leadership turns on those conservatives with a ferocity rarely evident in their dealings with the president.\n\nWith Democrats energized by Obama\u2019s lawbreaking, and Republicans paralyzed by the prospect of government shutdowns, there is no realistic prospect that Congress will starve Obama of funding. That leaves impeachment as the sole remaining constitutional safeguard against executive imperialism.\n\nThere is nothing else.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Judiciary Committee hearing was enlightening. To the extent that members needed educating on impeachment standards, the experts affirmed the principles we outlined in August. \u201cHigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d the Constitution\u2019s standard for impeachment, are the misdeeds of high officials \u2014 what Hamilton referred to as abuses of the \u201cpublic trust,\u201d violations of a \u201cpolitical\u201d nature in the sense that \u201cthey relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.\u201d\n\nHamilton\u2019s emphasis on \u201cpolitical\u201d is salient. It is the point that Republican leaders, still licking their wounds 13 years after Bill Clinton left the Oval Office, must grasp if they are ever to take the right lesson from the Nineties.\n\nImpeachment is a political remedy, not a legal one. Thus the quasi-legal component \u2014 proving high crimes and misdemeanors \u2014 is the easy part. As a practical matter, fundamental transformation cannot occur without high crimes and misdemeanors being committed against the constitutional order that is being transformed. That\u2019s the whole point.\n\nSo, as one would expect, President Obama is intentionally and sweepingly violating his oath of office. He is not faithfully executing federal law \u2014 he picks, chooses, \u201cwaives,\u201d and generally makes up law as he goes along. He has willfully and materially misled the American people \u2014 his Obamacare and Benghazi lies being only the most notorious examples. He has been woefully derelict in his duty to protect and defend Americans overseas. His administration trumped up a shameful prosecution (under the guise of a \u201csupervised release violation\u201d) against a filmmaker in order to bolster the \u201cBenghazi massacre was caused by an anti-Muslim video\u201d charade. His administration has used the federal bureaucracy to usurp Congress\u2019s legislative powers and to punish political enemies. Obama has presumed to make recess appointments when Congress was not in recess. His administration intentionally allowed firearms to be transferred to Mexican drug cartels, predictably resulting in numerous violent crimes, including the murder of a Border Patrol agent. His administration \u2014 and, in particular, the Justice Department \u2014 has routinely stonewalled lawmakers and frustrated their capacity to perform agency oversight, to the point that the attorney general has been held in contempt of Congress. The Obama Justice Department, moreover, has filed vexatious lawsuits against sovereign states over their attempts to vindicate their constitutional authorities (and, indeed, to enforce federal immigration laws), while the Justice Department itself adheres to racially discriminatory enforcement policies in violation of the Constitution and federal civil-rights laws.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list of Obama abuses, but you get the idea.
