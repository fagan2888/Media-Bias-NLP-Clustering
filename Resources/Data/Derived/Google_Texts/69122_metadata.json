He \u201cwould rather you not have\u201d a semi-automatic weapon if you live in a city, for example. (And 5 million NRA members would rather you just stopped right there, please.)\n\nHis knowledge of Israeli politics, of particular importance to many Republicans and especially now, is so shallow that he recently suggested \u2014 to an actual Israeli person \u2014 that Israel\u2019s current system of government sounds too complex, and so \u201cwhy don\u2019t they just adopt the system we have?\u201d\n\nHe admits he only joined the Republican Party because he is planning to run for office.\n\nNevertheless, Ben Carson is inexplicably a crowd favorite among many conservatives, finishing fourth (out of 17) in the 2015 Conservative Political Action Committee straw poll. And lest you think polls are meaningless, take note: The Draft Carson Super PAC has raised more than $13 million.\n\nIn case you\u2019ve never heard of him \u2014 he\u2019s also made news for defending Ray Rice, the Baltimore Ravens running back who punched his wife, and for regularly comparing Obamacare to slavery and America to Nazi Germany \u2014 Ben Carson is a medical doctor, and a gifted one at that. He is well known for performing the first successful separation of twins joined at the head.\n\nAt last year\u2019s national prayer breakfast, Carson decided to embarrass the president, who was sitting mere feet away, with a rousing polemic against Obamacare. Conservatives went wild for it and a star was born.\n\nBut instead of using his newfound fame to, I don\u2019t know, raise money to cure pediatric cancer or even help draft better health care legislation, Carson decided he might like to be the next leader of the free world. And why not? He is a neurosurgeon, after all.\n\nCarson will tell anyone who listens how smart and accomplished he is. In a recent profile in GQ magazine, he boasted about the high school in Detroit that\u2019s named after him and acknowledged his own impressive background. But for someone so smart, it\u2019s hard to imagine dumber stuff coming out of a doctor\u2019s mouth than the nonsensical pap he\u2019s recently uttered ... out loud, to members of the media.\n\nHe told Chris Cuomo on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d that homosexuality must be a choice \u201cbecause a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight, and when they come out, they\u2019re gay.\u201d What?\n\nAnd in GQ, he says he can tell President Obama is a \u201cpsychopath,\u201d because he is well dressed.\n\nCarson\u2019s hardly the only smart guy who thought he could solve complex social problems without really thinking hard about them. But I\u2019m worried that my fellow conservatives don\u2019t seem to care all that much that Carson is neither politically curious nor especially conservative. Is it really enough that he\u2019s a black doctor who stuck it to the president? If so, that\u2019s pretty sad.\n\nHis popularity is particularly vexing considering that we have actual contenders \u2014 good candidates with real experience who don\u2019t think they should be president just \u2019cuz. Ben Carson\u2019s arrogance and ignorance are dangerous, and conservatives should be offended, not aroused, by his cavalier attitude toward the political problems that affect our daily lives.\n\nSo let\u2019s get serious, guys.
