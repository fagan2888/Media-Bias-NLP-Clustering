However, after China took control of Scarborough Shoal following a tense naval standoff with the Philippines near its coastline, Manila filed a case with a tribunal operating under the U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea. It provides a regulatory framework for the use of the world\u2019s seas and oceans.\n\nXu Hong, director general of the Foreign Ministry\u2019s Department of Treaty and Law, said the Philippines was \u201cobstinately pushing forward arbitration procedures\u201d and urged it to negotiate with Beijing instead. He told reporters that China was committed to rejecting and not participating in the arbitration proceedings.\n\nHowever the arbitration works, \u201cit won\u2019t change the history or the facts of China\u2019s sovereignty over the South China Sea islands as well as the adjacent waters,\u201d Xu said.\n\nThe document released Sunday elaborates on China\u2019s previous arguments that territorial sovereignty is beyond the scope of the tribunal. It said China\u2019s rejection of arbitration is in line with international law and that China and the Philippines have previously agreed to settle territorial disputes through negotiations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "China slams Philippines over South China Sea case", "author": "Louise Watt", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "China slams Philippines over South China Sea case", "title": "China slams Philippines over South China Sea case", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/07/china_slams_philippines_over_south_china_sea_case/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/china-south-china-sea.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "China slams Philippines over South China Sea case", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/china-south-china-sea.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "China slams Philippines over South China Sea case", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "China slams Philippines over South China Sea case", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1837\"", "article_summary": "However the arbitration works, \u201cit won\u2019t change the history or the facts of China\u2019s sovereignty over the South China Sea islands as well as the adjacent waters,\u201d Xu said.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsBEIJING (AP) \u2014 China on Sunday again rejected an attempt by the Philippines to challenge its vast territorial claims over the South China Sea through international arbitration, a week before a deadline for Beijing to respond to the case.\nThe document released Sunday elaborates on China\u2019s previous arguments that territorial sovereignty is beyond the scope of the tribunal.\nIt said China\u2019s rejection of arbitration is in line with international law and that China and the Philippines have previously agreed to settle territorial disputes through negotiations.\nHowever, after China took control of Scarborough Shoal following a tense naval standoff with the Philippines near its coastline, Manila filed a case with a tribunal operating under the U.N.
