He reaches out to those going through losses or transitions offering support and care.\u201d\n\nMorris, who has been a chaplain since 1991 and a member of the association since 1995, explained his duties go beyond the traditional aspect of chaplaincy \u2014 the in-house responsibilities of a minister in a medical setting. They have now expanded to include community integration of the faith health movement which has come about since the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe collaborate with the faith community by ensuring that when people leave the hospital they are part of a faith community, a church,\u201d Morris explained. \u201cWe want to make sure there is a set of eyes on them. Many are elderly with children living out of town. When these patients leave the hospital they may think they are getting along pretty well, but do need that set of eyes on them.\n\n\u201cThis new program is designed to work with people at local churches to know how to care for these folks and to work with us when they are released from the hospital. If a patient is not associated with a local church, they become a part of the faith community and the trained people at the local church are notified to check on them and work with the hospital to ensure their continued healing.\u201d\n\nMorris, who has worked at Randolph Hospital for 14 years, said he has been challenged by this new position and credits his background with giving him a unique perspective on how to make all the pieces work.\n\nA graduate of Mars Hill College (now Mars Hill University) and the South East Baptist Theological Seminary, he pastored a a small mission start-up in Delaware. Later, while pastoring a church in South Carolina he started his clinical training at Baptist Hospital in Columbia, S.C., which is where he found his passion for the chaplaincy in a medical setting.\n\nAn active man who enjoys cycling, hiking and gardening, Morris said his upbringing also gave him an appreciation for dealing with many different kinds of people.\n\n\u201cI am the child of a career military man, born in Europe and living in Germany as a dependent and a soldier for a combined seven years may have influenced my passion for working with a diverse group of people. Helping people individually, through a broad look at spirituality, is a large part of the diversity that is expanding into the community that I really enjoy,\u201d he said.\n\nIn June, Morris will travel with colleagues to Florida and give a presentation to chaplains on Randolph County\u2019s integrated health care approach.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ASHEBORO \u2014 Barry Morris, director of Spiritual Care and Community Integration at Randolph Hospital, has been named Chaplain of the Year for North Carolina.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Bobbie Frazier Special to The Courier-Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Tribune", "description": "ASHEBORO \u2014 Barry Morris, director of Spiritual Care and Community Integration at Randolph Hospital, has been named Chaplain of the Year for North Carolina.", "title": "Randolph Hospital\u2019s Barry Morris wins top chaplain honor", "url": "http://courier-tribune.com/living/features/randolph-hospital-s-barry-morris-wins-top-chaplain-honor", "image": "http://courier-tribune.com/sites/courier-tribune.com/files/field/media/web1_Barry-Morris_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://courier-tribune.com/living/features/randolph-hospital-s-barry-morris-wins-top-chaplain-honor", "image": {"src": "http://courier-tribune.com/sites/courier-tribune.com/files/field/media/web1_Barry-Morris_0.jpg"}, "title": "Randolph Hospital\u2019s Barry Morris wins top chaplain honor", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Courier_Tribune"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "courier-tribune://?eid=569560", "app_name": "courier-tribune", "package": "com.stephensmedia.couriertribune"}, "ios": {"url": "courier-tribune://?eid=569560", "app_store_id": 964469617, "app_name": "courier-tribune"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964469617", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.couriertribune", "keywords": "Features,Living,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-19T10:16:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "ASHEBORO \u2014 Barry Morris, director of Spiritual Care and Community Integration at Randolph Hospital, has been named Chaplain of the Year for North Carolina.\n\u201cWe collaborate with the faith community by ensuring that when people leave the hospital they are part of a faith community, a church,\u201d Morris explained.\nIn June, Morris will travel with colleagues to Florida and give a presentation to chaplains on Randolph County\u2019s integrated health care approach.\nSix letters of nomination were sent to the association on Morris\u2019 behalf detailing his excellence in service and especially his work in the faith health movement in Randolph County.\n\u201cBarry has extended compassion and support to his colleagues as well as to the staff of his hospital."}
