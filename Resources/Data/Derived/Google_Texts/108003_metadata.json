Footage of animals rescued from these factory farms show creatures with matted fur, festering sores and covered in their own urine and faeces.\n\nAnd authorities say the problem is worsening, as internet sales of pets become increasingly popular.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Queensland\u2019s new Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, will make good on her pre-election promise to crack down on such operations by introducing a registration plan for breeders with more than 20 dogs.\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen over the last few years is a heightened trade in illegal puppy farms,\u201d Palaszczuk said in December. \u201cLabor will end this cruel practice.\u201d\n\nNew laws have already gone before the ACT Legislative Assembly on Thursday to ban puppy farms and require breeders to be inspected and licensed, with hopes other states and territories will follow suit.\n\nA few months ago, I adopted my own dog Alfie from \u2013 weirdly enough \u2013 a cat shelter and couldn\u2019t be happier with the decision.\n\nEveryone who meets him falls in love with his friendly, cheeky personality and I\u2019m constantly fielding questions about his breed and where I got him from; many are surprised he is a rescued dog and to learn that shelters not only have older \u201cmutts\u201d, but puppies and dumped purebreds.\n\nEach day across Australia, a perfectly healthy dog is put down at a council pound at taxpayer expense simply because it has failed to be rehomed. I\u2019d urge every person ready and willing to care for an animal to go to these shelters first and shun pet stores and commercial breeding operations.\n\nEven better, after the horrors brought to light this week, why not check out greyhound adoption programs and give a retired racing dog a loving alternative to the needle.\n\nCaroline Marcus is a journalist with A Current Affair.\n\nTwitter: @carolinemarcus", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "ANYONE who has picked up a newspaper or caught the TV headlines in the past week is, by now, aware of the stomach-turning scandal engulfing the greyhound industry.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/opinion/opinion-cruel-puppy-farms-and-commercial-dog-breeders-should-be-tightly-regulated/news-story/099fc18b11ba232002f5e196565e917a", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cebe11255792f26f40e1e020f6f6b1eb", "type": "article", "description": "ANYONE who has picked up a newspaper or caught the TV headlines in the past week is, by now, aware of the stomach-turning scandal engulfing the greyhound industry.", "title": "Not just greyhound industry gone to the dogs"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cebe11255792f26f40e1e020f6f6b1eb", "description": "ANYONE who has picked up a newspaper or caught the TV headlines in the past week is, by now, aware of the stomach-turning scandal engulfing the greyhound industry.", "site": "@couriermail", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Not just greyhound industry gone to the dogs"}, "robots": "noarchive", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/099fc18b11ba232002f5e196565e917a?domain=couriermail.com.au"}, "articleid": "099fc18b11ba232002f5e196565e917a", "keywords": "puppy farms, live baiting, rogue greyhound trainers, greyhound racing, registration plan, greyhound industry, greyhound adoption, illegal puppy farms, armchair animal lovers, backyard operations, person ready, puppy factories, cat shelter, state board, lifetime bans, savage beginnings, taxpayer expense, family dog, veterinary care, criminal prosecution, sadist trainers, pre-election promise, explosive revelations, commercial pet, factory farms, designer dogs, stomach-turning scandal, festering sores, pet stores, meaningful action, Australia, Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk, Bill Byrne", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-21T12:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2015-02-21T15:48:49.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24ce\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhat we have seen over the last few years is a heightened trade in illegal puppy farms,\u201d Palaszczuk said in December.\nIn NSW, the entire Greyhound Racing state board has been dismissed due to the irreparable damage to its integrity.\nMany animals sold online and in pet shops start life in ghastly conditions in illegal animal farms.\n\u201cLabor will end this cruel practice.\u201dNew laws have already gone before the ACT Legislative Assembly on Thursday to ban puppy farms and require breeders to be inspected and licensed, with hopes other states and territories will follow suit.\nANYONE who has picked up a newspaper or caught the TV headlines in the past week is, by now, aware of the stomach-turning scandal engulfing the greyhound industry."}
