He fled U.S. authorities and eventually landed in Russia , where he remains.Gordon-Levitt argued on Friday that Snowden acted ethically by exposing the NSA\u2019s spying two years ago.\u201cI left knowing that without a doubt that what [Snowden] did, he did because he believed it was the right thing to do, that he believed it would help the country he loves,\u201d Gordon-Levitt said.He added that he hopes viewers of \u201cSnowden\" reach their own conclusions about his motivations and whether they see him as hero or a traitor.\u201cNow, as he would say, it\u2019s not for him to say whether it was right or wrong,\u201d Gordon-Levitt said.\u201cThat\u2019s really for people to decide on their own, and I would encourage anybody to decide that on their own,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the actor guy who\u2019s like, \u2018You should listen me! What he did was right!'\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s my place,\u201d Gordon-Levitt added. \u201cEven though that is what I believe \u2014 that what he did was right.\u201dSnowden\u2019s leak sparked a national debate over how the U.S. government collects its intelligence. The USA Freedom Act passed last June curtailed some of the NSA\u2019s more controversial spying practices, namely the bulk collection of phone metadata from people in the U.S.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"What he did was right,\" says the actor, who is playing the NSA whistleblower.", "description": "\"What he did was right,\" says the actor, who is playing the NSA whistleblower.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "In The Know"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\"What he did was right,\" says the actor, who is playing the NSA whistleblower.", "title": "Gordon-Levitt defends Snowden", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/254185-gordon-levitt-defends-snowden", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/snowdenmovie04072015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-18T12:41:07-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-09-18T12:41-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/254185-gordon-levitt-defends-snowden", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-18T12:31-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Tristan Lejeune", "author": "Mark Hensch", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Edward Snowden, Joseph Gordon-Levitt,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-18T12:31:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-18T12:41:07-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/254185-gordon-levitt-defends-snowden", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\"What he did was right,\" says the actor, who is playing the NSA whistleblower.", "card": "summary", "title": "Gordon-Levitt defends Snowden"}, "dcterms.title": "Gordon-Levitt defends Snowden"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to live in Russia at all,\u201d Gordon-Levitt told The Guardian of Snowden, whom he met earlier this year.\nActor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Edward Snowden in an upcoming Oliver Stone film, said on Friday that the NSA whistleblower deeply wishes he could return to the United States.\nADVERTISEMENTIn 2013 Snowden leaked troves of information about the NSA\u2019s global surveillance programs.\n'\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s my place,\u201d Gordon-Levitt added.\n\u201cWhat I found was someone warm, kind, thoughtful.\u201d Gordon-Levitt added."}
