A pedestrian was killed after he was hit by a car in Forest Hill Friday night.

Forest Hill police spokesman Jerry Cozby said the crash happened about 9:22 p.m. in the 5000 block of Mansfield Highway.

It appears the man was walking in the roadway and stepped in front of a moving SUV, Cozby said.

The driver of the SUV stopped after the crash. Cozby said police do not plan to file charges against him.
