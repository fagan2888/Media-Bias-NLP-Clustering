In Washington, there are already ACOs and ACO-like options for residents. including Medicare participants and Boeing workers.\n\nThe goal of an ACO is to control medical and insurance costs by setting spending targets. But to make sure patients also receive good care, doctors and other providers must meet health and satisfaction goals as well. If clinics and hospitals hit their targets, they reap financial rewards. If they don\u2019t, they can be on the hook for the extra costs or penalties.\n\n\u201cAs we continue our efforts to improve our health care system, we want to make sure we\u2019re emphasizing quality and coordinated care,\u201d said Gov. Jay Inslee in a statement issued Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re bringing new health care options to our state employees that will provide the choices and high-quality care they deserve.\u201d\n\nThe use of accountable care programs for public workers is part of a broader effort by the state to shift away from coverage that pays for every doctor\u2019s visit and procedure to one that links medical costs and health outcomes. The state\u2019s goal by 2019 is for 80 percent of its health-care coverage, including Medicaid participants, to be ACO or \u201cvalue-based\u201d vs. the \u201cfee-for-service\u201d model.\n\nBeginning in November, PEBB members can choose one of the accountable care programs among a variety of insurance options. The coverage will begin in 2016.\n\nThe accountable care options initially are limited to workers in King, Snohomish, Kitsap, Pierce and Thurston counties. The state\u2019s goal is to enroll 50,000 PEBB employees in one of the new programs, officials said.\n\nThe program is expected to expand statewide in 2017. PEBB covers about 355,000 public workers and family members.\n\nBoth networks include MultiCare Connected Care, Overlake Hospital Medical Center and Seattle Children\u2019s hospital.\n\nThe UW network also includes UW Medicine, Capital Medical Center, Cascade Valley Hospitals and Clinics, Children\u2019s University Medical Group, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and Skagit Regional Health.\n\nAdditional members of the Puget Sound High Value Network include Edmonds Family Medicine, EvergreenHealth Partners, Lakeshore Clinic and Virginia Mason.\n\nIt was almost a year ago that Boeing announced the creation of accountable care programs for its workers. That deal involves partnerships with UW Medicine, as well as Providence Health & Services and Swedish Health Services.\n\nThe aerospace company hasn\u2019t said how many of the 30,000 Puget Sound-area workers and retirees eligible for the ACOs have signed up. But in an interview this spring, Dr. Joe Gifford, chief executive of the Providence-Swedish Health Alliance ACO, was positive about the deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s made Boeing very happy, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Gifford said, and added, \u201cwe think it\u2019s going very well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new health-benefit offerings would emphasize cost targets and care quality over the traditional fee-for-service model that prevails today.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "The new health-benefit offerings would emphasize cost targets and care quality over the traditional fee-for-service model that prevails today.", "title": "Some state workers to see new option for health-care coverage", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/some-state-workers-to-see-new-option-for-health-care-coverage/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-facebook.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The new health-benefit offerings would emphasize cost targets and care quality over the traditional fee-for-service model that prevails today.", "site": "@seattletimes", "card": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-twitter.png", "title": "Some state workers to see new option for health-care coverage"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Local News", "published_time": "2015-06-08 18:45:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-08 18:45:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Local News, Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d95\"", "article_summary": "It was almost a year ago that Boeing announced the creation of accountable care programs for its workers.\nThe arrangements are similar to an accountable care organization or ACO \u2014 a strategy for delivering health care that has taken off under the Affordable Care Act and is growing nationwide.\nThe accountable care options initially are limited to workers in King, Snohomish, Kitsap, Pierce and Thurston counties.\nBeginning in November, PEBB members can choose one of the accountable care programs among a variety of insurance options.\n\u201cAs we continue our efforts to improve our health care system, we want to make sure we\u2019re emphasizing quality and coordinated care,\u201d said Gov."}
