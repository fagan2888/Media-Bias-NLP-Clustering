It\u2019s simply a statement of fact. At its core, the government exists to do certain things that people aren\u2019t equipped to do on their own. The list of those things has gotten longer and longer over the years. In 1776, the federal government\u2019s portfolio could have easily fit in a file folder: maintain an army and navy, a few federal courts, the post office, the patent office and maybe a dozen or two other pretty obvious things.\n\nNow, the file folder of things the federal government does is much bigger. To paraphrase Dr. Egon Spengler from \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d let\u2019s imagine that the federal government in 1776 was the size of this Twinkie (take my word for it, I\u2019m holding a normal-sized Twinkie). Today that Twinkie would be 35 feet long, weighing approximately 600 pounds. Or, if that illustration doesn\u2019t work for you, consider this: The number of civilians (i.e., not counting the military) who work for the executive branch alone is today nearly equal to the entire population of the United States in 1776. The Federal Register, the government\u2019s fun-filled journal of new rules, regulations and the like, was about 2,600 pages in 1936 (a year after it was created). Today it\u2019s over 80,000 pages.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just at the federal level. Each state government is a pretty giant-sized Twinkie, too. In Massachusetts, all kids in day care are required by law to brush their teeth after lunch. In Texas \u2014 Texas! \u2014 if you don\u2019t have an interior-design license, you can\u2019t call yourself an interior designer, lest some unsuspecting consumer trust your opinion on throw-pillow placement without the backing of the state. Almost everywhere, Americans need a license to open a business \u2014 sometimes even a lemonade stand \u2014 but in Milwaukee, you even need a license to go out of business.\n\nThe justifications for all of these laws and all of these workers \u2014 the good, the bad and the ugly \u2014 have one thing in common: the assumption that the rest of us couldn\u2019t get by without them, whether we like it or not.\n\nThis week the feds took the first steps to ban trans fats. Why? Because trans fats are bad for you and you can\u2019t be trusted to avoid them on your own. I bring this up not because it is such an outrageous illustration of my point, but to demonstrate how typical it is. This is what the government does, day in, day out.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the reaction to ObamaCare so interesting. Several times now, the president has endeavored to explain that it\u2019s not that big a deal millions of Americans are losing their health-insurance plans against their will. The people who had plans they liked didn\u2019t understand that the plans they liked were no good \u2014 they were the actuarial equivalent of trans fats, don\u2019t you know? The fact that the people who held them liked them, thought they were good and wanted to keep them doesn\u2019t count for much, because the government knows best.\n\nThe president can\u2019t say it as plainly as he would like, because to do so would be to admit not only that he lied to the American people, but that he thinks the complainers are ignorant about their own needs and interests.\n\nThe president\u2019s more intellectually honest defenders have said exactly that. \u201cVast swathes of policy are based on the correct presumption that people don\u2019t know what\u2019s best for them. Nothing new,\u201d tweeted Josh Barro, politics editor for Business Insider.\n\nBarro\u2019s fairly liberal, but I\u2019d be dishonest if I said that he was wrong from a conservative perspective. The difference, however, is that conservatives tend to see government as a necessary evil, and therefore see policymaking with some humility. Liberals tend to see government as a necessary good, and see ordering people to do things \u201cfor their own good\u201d as a source of pride, even hubris.\n\nFrom a conservative perspective, telling people how to run their lives when not absolutely necessary is an abuse of power. For liberals, telling people how to run their lives is one of the really fun perks of working for the government.\n\nYou can see the frustration on the president\u2019s face.
