CNN’s Jake Tapper really pressed Ben Carson today on why he’s singling out Muslims for criticism and assuming all U.S. Muslims favor theocracy over the law of the land.

Carson continued to clarify his remarks about not supporting any Muslim for president as Tapper told him, “I don’t assume that because somebody’s Muslim that they would put their religion ahead of the U.S. Constitution.”

He said that plenty of patriotic Muslims are offended at the suggestion that they just automatically, as a testament of the faith they belong to, “would put their religion ahead of the country.”

Carson said that there are plenty of patriotic Muslims and dismissed the controversy as just a media invention.

But Tapper still hammered away, pointing to Carson’s own faith and saying, “You know what it’s like for people to make false assumptions about you and you seem to be doing the same thing with Muslims.”
