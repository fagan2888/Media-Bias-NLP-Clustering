Even the album\u2019s lengthy title reveals her as she is: a lover and a fighter.\n\nAnd one of the many fights in Case\u2019s life is the one for reproductive rights. Famously known for saying she should have been aborted because her parents weren\u2019t ready to be parents, Case has been an outspoken pro-choice advocate throughout her career. In a 2009 interview with the New York Times, Case expounded on movies like \u201cJuno\u201d which center on unplanned pregnancies and suggested that abortion would have been the gentlest way to solve the plot problem. Her song \u201cPretty Girls\u201d describes a scene she once witnessed in a Planned Parenthood waiting room: \u201cYour hearts are so tried and so innocent / Wind your flimsy blue gowns tight around you / Around curves so comely and sinister / They blame it on you pretty girls.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Case is still speaking her mind about abortion rights at this point in her career, especially given today\u2019s prevalent anti-choice legislation. Asked what it would take to truly transform the political climate into a more choice-friendly one, Case was full of candid wisdom: \u201cPeople will have to stop talking about things in a sensationalist, tabloid-style way. Nobody listens. It\u2019s just an irritant. Religion needs to be removed from the discussions as our constitution promises. We need a big-picture recalibration.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThe men who have gotten women pregnant need to be accountable if we are. If we are going to jail, the men are coming too. Religious rhetoric will bite its own ass trying to nail only women in a two-person process. I\u2019d like to hear people talk about that way more. More to shut up the sexist assholes, women included, who think we \u2018acted alone\u2019 than actually putting anyone in jail which is obviously just as ludicrous as abortion being illegal and stigmatized in the first place. I don\u2019t want anyone punished for it, men or women.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The singer talked to Salon about her new album, reproductive rights, and what her song \"Man\" says about gender", "title": "Neko Case on reproductive rights: \u201cIf we are going to jail, the men are coming too\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The singer talked to Salon about her new album, reproductive rights, and what her song \"Man\" says about gender", "title": "Neko Case on reproductive rights: \u201cIf we are going to jail, the men are coming too\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/01/neko_case_on_reproductive_rights_if_we_are_going_to_jail_the_men_are_coming_too/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/neko_case.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The singer talked to Salon about her new album, reproductive rights, and what her song \"Man\" says about gender", "title": "Neko Case on reproductive rights: \u201cIf we are going to jail, the men are coming too\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/neko_case.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Erin Lyndal Martin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, man, Music, Neko Case, Reproductive Rights", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And one of the many fights in Case\u2019s life is the one for reproductive rights.\nFamously known for saying she should have been aborted because her parents weren\u2019t ready to be parents, Case has been an outspoken pro-choice advocate throughout her career.\nTopics: Editor's Picks, man, Music, Neko Case, Reproductive Rights, Entertainment NewsOn her new album, \u201cThe Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You,\u201d Neko Case delivers some of her most revealing and personal songs yet.\nIf we are going to jail, the men are coming too.\nWe need a big-picture recalibration.\u201dShe added, \u201cThe men who have gotten women pregnant need to be accountable if we are."}
