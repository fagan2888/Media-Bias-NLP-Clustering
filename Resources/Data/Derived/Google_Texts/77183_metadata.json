The campaign ends at noon today \u2014 and if the goal isn't reached, the money will be refunded.\n\nScheiner founded Chabad of Boulder together with her husband, Rabbi Pesach Scheiner, 23 years ago. Since then, the Boulder County Center for Judaism has served the community from a small space in a residential neighborhood.\n\nThe September 2013 floods damaged the center and, as they made repairs, they began to talk about building a new, larger space, Chany Scheiner said.\n\n\"It sparked us to work harder and better,\" she said. \"We wanted to have something positive come out of the flood.\"\n\nThey raised enough money, about $400,000, to pay for permits and to start construction, with the framing under way. The new center will be located at 2810 Jay Road in Boulder, a property that was purchased about 10 years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's been a long journey,\" Scheiner said.\n\nNow, with the promise of a match by each of three donors, they're trying to raise $92,500 in just 24 hours. Each dollar given is multiplied by four, so $25 becomes $100, $125 becomes $500 and so on.\n\nThe matching donations are from the M.B. Shana Glassman Foundation, Bob and Dodi Klutznick, and R' Moshe and Dini Scheiner.\n\nThe total cost of the new center, including furnishing, is estimated at $1.5 million. The plans call for about 2,000 square feet of indoor space, as well as another 1,000 square feet of courtyard space, in phase one. Another 2,000 square feet of indoor space is planned for phase two\n\nThe center will include a large room designated for children's programs and displays, along with a second large room for prayers, lectures and holiday parties. Plans also include a commercial kosher kitchen and small kosher store.\n\n\"The amount of donors involved has been really amazing,\" Scheiner said. \"If we meet this challenge, it really will help us get over the hump. It will give us the momentum we need.\"\n\nAmy Bounds: 303-473-1341, boundsa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/boundsa", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_27487683/chabad-boulder-turns-crowdfunding-raise-money-new-community", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27487683:view"}, "startDate": "2015-02-08T21:01:57-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "For more information or to donate, go to  https://www.charidy.com/boulder\n.\nChany Scheiner was anxiously glued to a screen on Sunday, watching as donations came in for a 24-hour, online fundraising campaign for a new Jewish community center.", "title": "Chabad of Boulder turns to crowdfunding to raise money for new community center", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_27487683/chabad-boulder-turns-crowdfunding-raise-money-new-community", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-02-08T21:03:23-0700", "endDate": "2025-02-08T21:01:57-0700", "news_keywords": "Boulder County,Colorado,news,events,weather,breaking news,lifestyles,things to do,", "byline": "By Amy BoundsStaff", "pubDate": "2015-02-08T21:04:41-0700", "sailthru.date": "2015-02-08T21:01:57-0700", "sailthru.title": "Chabad of Boulder turns to crowdfunding to raise money for new community center", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County News", "description": "For more information or to donate, go to  https://www.charidy.com/boulder\n.\nChany Scheiner was anxiously glued to a screen on Sunday, watching as donations came in for a 24-hour, online fundraising campaign for a new Jewish community center.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_27487683/chabad-boulder-turns-crowdfunding-raise-money-new-community", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "For more information or to donate, go to  https://www.charidy.com/boulder\n.\nChany Scheiner was anxiously glued to a screen on Sunday, watching as donations came in for a 24-hour, online fundraising campaign for a new Jewish community center.", "title": "Chabad of Boulder turns to crowdfunding to raise money for new community center"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "article_summary": "Since then, the Boulder County Center for Judaism has served the community from a small space in a residential neighborhood.\nThe plans call for about 2,000 square feet of indoor space, as well as another 1,000 square feet of courtyard space, in phase one.\nScheiner founded Chabad of Boulder together with her husband, Rabbi Pesach Scheiner, 23 years ago.\nThe new center will be located at 2810 Jay Road in Boulder, a property that was purchased about 10 years ago.\nChany Scheiner was anxiously glued to a screen on Sunday, watching as donations came in for a 24-hour, online fundraising campaign for a new Jewish community center."}
