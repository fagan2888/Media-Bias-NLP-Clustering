While peak season varies by region, home asking prices peak nationally in May and inventory peaks in the summer \u2013 but buyers tend to start searching for homes as early as March, according to Trulia data.\n\nRelated: Why Buying a Home Still Beats Renting \u2026 for Now\n\n\u201cBuyers wake up from hibernation before sellers do,\u201d says Trulia housing analyst Jed Kolko. \u201cSellers who list earlier may get higher prices and face less competition.\u201d\n\nThough it\u2019s easier to sell a home earlier in the season, you\u2019ll still need to put in some prep time so that your home is in prime selling condition before you host your open house. There will likely be more competition this year, as sellers who have been sitting on the sidelines digest the news that this year\u2019s housing rebound is real.\n\nRising homes prices \u2013 they increased 11.3 percent last year \u2013 have also put more potential sellers in a position to move without bringing money to the table. The percentage of homeowners with positive equity grew to 83 percent last year, up from 75 percent in 2011.\n\nFollow these 5 steps to prepare your home as quickly as possible for a spring listing.\n\n1. Start decluttering now. Realtors agree that the secret to staging a home is decluttering the property. Most homeowners know they\u2019ll need to clean up their home and put personal items out of sight so that potential buyers can more easily picture themselves living there. Yet most homeowners underestimate how long this process takes and how much they should be clearing out.\n\nRelated: Real Estate in 2014: A Need-to-Know Guide\n\nAs a starting point, plan on removing 50 percent of your belongings, says Lisa West, a Coldwell Banker realtor in Coronado, Calif. Begin by trashing or giving away things you haven\u2019t used in a year, then find a place to store additional furniture and other belongings throughout the selling process. You should be able to see every inch of your countertops and the floors of the kitchen. This may seem overwhelming, but think of it as getting a head start on packing for your move.\n\n2. Make some minor upgrades. You won\u2019t get a dollar-for-dollar return on investment for major renovations like a kitchen or bathroom remodel, but there are smaller projects that can freshen up your home and help set it apart from the competition.\n\nIf you live in an area of the country still covered with snow, focus on indoor projects first. Take care of any minor repairs that could turn off a buyer \u2013 now\u2019s the time, for example, to fix that leaky faucet or re-grout the shower. \u201cIf you think there might be bigger issues, it could be worth it to pay for a home inspection before you list the house,\u201d says realtor Gary Rogers of Waltham, Mass. \u201cThat way you\u2019re not surprised by something when the buyer does his inspection.\u201d\n\nOnce basic repairs are out of the way, a coat of paint, fresh kitchen or bathroom fixtures, or updated appliances are low-cost changes that can boost a home\u2019s first impression to buyers.\n\n3. Choose the right realtor. One key to a quick sale is having the right pro guiding you through the process and paying attention to the details of your listing. Before you pick someone, Interview at least three realtors with experience selling homes in your neighborhood.\n\nRelated: 5 Reasons the Luxury Real Estate Market Is Booming\n\nAsk them about their marketing plan for your property and make sure their listings appear on all the major online real estate sites. More than 9 in 10 home shoppers start their house search online, but they don\u2019t all use the same sites. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to miss out on a buyer because your listing wasn\u2019t on the site that she uses,\u201d says Zillow\u2019s real estate expert Brendon DeSimone.\n\n4. Be realistic about prices. Yes, it\u2019s still a buyers\u2019 market out there, but experts say the mini-boom and accompanying bidding wars seen last summer won\u2019t return. This summer, more competition, higher interest rates, and less investor demand will likely produce more modest home price increases and give buyers more breathing room to negotiate. Mortgage rates are currently at 4.43 percent, more than a full percentage point higher than they were this time last year.\n\nThe key to getting your house sold quickly is to price it right at the outset. Ask your realtor to carefully look over comp sales with you, and be prepared for the recommended asking price to be less than you had imagined.\n\n5. Stage a photo shoot. Web appeal is the new curb appeal. Having a lot of high-quality images accompanying your listing is the secret to boosting online interest in your home. You\u2019ll want to use a high-quality camera (borrow or rent one if you don\u2019t own one), and take as many pictures as possible \u2013 including both wide-room shots and close-up images of noteworthy details like molding or tile work.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A polar vortex may still have much of the country singing the winter blues, but real estate experts say it\u2019s not too early to be thinking about \u2013 and prepping for \u2013 the busy spring and summer selling season.", "title": "5 Ways to Sell Your Home Faster This Spring", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/27/5-Ways-Sell-Your-Home-Faster-Spring", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04252011_home_sale_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/27/5-Ways-Sell-Your-Home-Faster-Spring", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04252011_home_sale_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A polar vortex may still have much of the country singing the winter blues, but real estate experts say it\u2019s not too early to be thinking about \u2013 and prepping for \u2013 the busy spring and summer selling season.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: 5 Reasons the Luxury Real Estate Market Is BoomingAsk them about their marketing plan for your property and make sure their listings appear on all the major online real estate sites.\nBefore you pick someone, Interview at least three realtors with experience selling homes in your neighborhood.\nA polar vortex may still have much of the country singing the winter blues, but real estate experts say it\u2019s not too early to prep for \u2013 the busy spring and summer selling season.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to miss out on a buyer because your listing wasn\u2019t on the site that she uses,\u201d says Zillow\u2019s real estate expert Brendon DeSimone.\nRising homes prices \u2013 they increased 11.3 percent last year \u2013 have also put more potential sellers in a position to move without bringing money to the table."}
