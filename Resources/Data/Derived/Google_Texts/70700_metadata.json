That was tough. But you move on.\u201d\n\nThe next stop is Washington for Game 3 on Monday, and if it is like the first two, it should be fun. Both games have been decided by a goal.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play good enough to win this hockey game,\u201d Capitals coach Barry Trotz said. \u201cThe Rangers deserved to win this hockey game. We didn\u2019t play our best game.\u201d\n\nDan Boyle and Derick Brassard also scored for New York in the entertaining game that featured a highlight-reel goal by Alexander Ovechkin that made the final 10 minutes exciting.\n\nEvgeny Kuznetsov also scored for Washington and Braden Holtby made 32 saves and prevented the Capitals from being blown out early.\n\nGame 2 will be remembered for Kreider\u2019s early goal and Ovechkin\u2019s spectacular tally in the third period, when the NHL\u2019s top goal scorer got past top defensemen Dan Girardi and Ryan McDonagh and beat Lundqvist with a top-shelf shot as he was falling to the ice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an instinct situation,\u201d Ovechkin said.\n\nRangers coach Alain Vigneault was impressed.\n\n\u201cThe guys pushed him to the outside and there were almost three guys around him and he still got the shot off from his knees. He\u2019s a great player.\u201d\n\nThe Rangers were looking for a response after losing Game 1 on a goal by Joel Ward with 1.3 seconds left.\n\nAnd they came out so fast the sellout crowd at Madison Square Garden hadn\u2019t even settled comfortably into their seats after the national anthem before they were jumping to celebrate.\n\nIt was similar to Game 1 against the Penguins when Brassard scored 28 seconds after the opening-round series started.\n\nThis time it was Kreider. He deflected a pass by defenseman Kevin Klein into the Washington zone and then went to the net and fired the rebound of Jesper Fast\u2019s shot into an open net for a quick lead.\n\nKreider felt the win was the perfect response to the Game 1 loss, but the goal was a stepping stone.\n\n\u201cWe needed to answer and now it\u2019s the best of five,\u201d Kreider said.\n\nWashington didn\u2019t go away after falling behind 2-0 and 3-1, and they had chances in the closing minutes to tie the game.\n\nAfter killing off a late penalty, Washington pulled Holtby and came close to tying the game, but Lundqvist stopped Troy Brouwer in close in the final minute.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a better start,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cThe physical game was not at the level we want. We gave them too much confidence, too much freedom to their skill guys.\u201d\n\nThe Rangers had a dominant first period, outshooting Capitals 15-4 and taking a 2-0 lead.\n\nBoyle got the second goal with a shot from the point on a power play after the puck hit one of the officials and stayed in the Washington zone. His shot eluded Holtby, who was being distracted by Rick Nash in the crease.\n\nHoltby was the major reason the Capitals were still in the game after 40 minutes. He stopped 25 of 27 shots, including early second-period stops in close on Fast and James Sheppard that could have given New York a bigger lead.\n\nKuznetsov scored on a rebound with 6:01 left in the second period to cut the lead to 2-1, but Brassard stretched the lead to 3-1 at 6:07 of the third period, just 10 seconds after he came out of the penalty box.\n\nOvechkin narrowed the lead to 3-2 with his fourth goal of the playoffs and second in as many games against the Rangers.\n\nNOTES: Kreider leads the Rangers in playoff goals (13) since he made his NHL debut in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals at Ottawa on April 16, 2012. \u2026 Capitals C Eric Fehr missed his sixth straight game with an upper-body injury. C Michael Latta was a healthy scratch. \u2026 Rangers RW Mats Zuccarello missed his second straight game after being hit in the head by a shot in Game 5 against Pittsburgh. \u2026 New York recalled LW Ryan Bourque from Hartford (AHL) before the game. He did not play. \u2026 Ovechkin led the Capitals with nine hits. \u2026 Girardi had a game-high five blocks.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chris Kreider\u2019s early goal leads Rangers over Capitals in Game 2", "title": "Chris Kreider\u2019s early goal leads Rangers over Capitals in Game 2", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/02/chris-kreiders-early-goal-leads-rangers-over-capitals-in-game-2/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150502__RANGERSp1.jpg", "height": 389}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150502__RANGERSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-02T17:58:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T06:11:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "NEW YORK \u2014 The New York Rangers needed to bounce back after a tough loss to the Washington Capitals.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play good enough to win this hockey game,\u201d Capitals coach Barry Trotz said.\n\u2026 Rangers RW Mats Zuccarello missed his second straight game after being hit in the head by a shot in Game 5 against Pittsburgh.\nEvgeny Kuznetsov also scored for Washington and Braden Holtby made 32 saves and prevented the Capitals from being blown out early.\nKreider scored 38 seconds after the opening faceoff and the Rangers defeated the Capitals 3-2 Saturday, tying their Eastern Conference semifinal series at 1-1."}
