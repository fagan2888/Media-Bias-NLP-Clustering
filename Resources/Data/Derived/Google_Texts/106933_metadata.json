General and Family Research Council Vice President Jerry Boykin was caught on a \u201chot mic\u201d\u2014following a panel on \u201cBenghazigate: The Ugly Truth and the Cover-up\u201d at the National Security Action Summit\u2014claiming that President Obama uses \u201csubliminal messages\u201d to communicate his support for al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood. Boykin also responded to an interview request from an Israeli News outlet by saying, \u201cthe Jews are the problem. The Jews are the cause of all the problems in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile there\u2019s no dispute over whether Boykin said these outrageous and offensive things (his words and the laughter they received can be heard on a video recording of the event here) the reports of Boykin\u2019s comments miss one minor, though arguably crucial, point. Contrary to reports, Boykin says this wasn\u2019t a \u201chot mic\u201d situation at all. For those disturbed by Boykin\u2019s belief that Obama is a secret mouthpiece for Islamic terrorists or by his anti-Semitic jokes, perhaps more disturbing is the fact\u2014clarified by a post on his Facebook page\u2014that those things weren\u2019t said under the presumption of privacy.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that I was asked to do an interview with an Israeli news service and I joked with the reporter that Jews were the source of all problems worldwide, which was satirical because so many countries and people blame the Jews for everything,\u201d Boykin wrote on his Facebook page. \u201cThe reporter laughed since he knew the intent was to reflect the silliness of this reasoning by so many anti-Semites. He responded that he knew what I meant and that he was trying to fix it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Boykin, he wasn\u2019t caught saying something he\u2019d later regret. He was recorded saying something he would have said whether he knew the mic was on or not.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s probably necessary to give some background on Boykin, the Israeli news outlet that requested the interview, and the event where this all went down\u2014not for justification but to better understand who and what we\u2019re dealing with here.\n\nWilliam \u201cJerry\u201d Boykin is a retired Army Lieutenant General who served under President George W. Bush as the U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence from 2002 to 2007, during which time he was determined to have broken Pentagon rules in multiple public speeches by depicting the war on terror as a religious battle against Islamic militants akin to Christians\u2019 fight against Satan, with a God-appointed Bush at the helm. Now he serves as Executive Vice President of the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian lobbying group which the liberal SPLC has labeled a hate group since 2010 for spreading false anti-LGBT propaganda.\n\nBoykin\u2019s anti-Muslim reputation has continued to blossom over the years, as he\u2019s said things like \u201cIslam should not be protected by the First Amendment.\u201d But his vitriol isn\u2019t limited to Muslims. He\u2019s also made some questionable comments about Jews, deriding pastors who are \u201cdestroying the efforts\u2026to lead Jews to Christ,\u201d and complaining that not enough American Jews identify with the Republican party because they associate \u201cthe extreme right\u201d with Hitler. Last year, Boykin accused President Obama of using the Affordable Care Act to establish his own personal \u201cBrownshirt\u201d army. If that\u2019s not enough, last fall the retired General warned members of the WallBuilders Pro-Family Legislative Network that Jesus will be wielding an AR-15 assault rifle when he returns to Earth.\n\nBut enough about Boykin. If the above sampling doesn\u2019t provide a better understanding of who he is, perhaps a closer look at the event where he stirred up his controversy will. Last week, the traditionally conservative members of the Republican party gathered at the National Harbor outside Washington, D.C. to bash Obamacare and hail Rand Paul at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. At the same time, at a different hotel around the corner, Breitbart News Network and EMPact America, a non-profit dedicated to preparing citizens against the disputed threat of nuclear electromagnetic pulse attack, hosted its own event featuring conservative figures presumably considered too extreme for the CPAC guest list. That event was the National Security Summit.\n\nThe conference was like a Fringe Factor reunion special with Rep. Louie Gohmert, conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, and former House Speaker and past presidential wannabe Newt Gingrich, among the top-billed panelists.\n\nHenry Schwartz, the man who approached Boykin about an interview for IsraelNationalNews.com, is also the founder of EMPact America (the event\u2019s co-sponsor). IsraelNationalNews.com is owned by the politically and religiously conservative Israeli news organization ArutzSheva. Neither Schwartz nor a spokesperson for ArutzSheva responded to request for comment on Boykin\u2019s joke by print time, but in a video interview posted on IsraelNationalNews.com following the event, Schwartz gave his impression of the Summit from what looks like the inside of a private jet. He warned that Israel is under threat of nuclear attack by Iran, thanks to President Obama, who he said is \u201ceffectively an enemy,\u201d and encouraged Israel to \u201cprepare for armageddon\u201d and find new alliances outside the U.S.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "CEDickson"}, "keywords": "The Fringe Factor, Republican Party, u.s. poli, American military", "publicationDate": 201403131915, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Jerry Boykin, a retired Lieutenant General and rightwinger, spouted anti-Semitic \u201cjokes\u201d and accused Obama of supporting al-Qaeda at a conservative Christian conference.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Rightwing Ex- General: Jews Are The Problem", "tags": "entity:product/the_fringe_factor,entity:organization/republican_party,topic:politics,entity:organization/american_military", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Rightwing Ex- General: \u2018Jews Are The Problem\u2019\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/13/rightwing-ex-general-jews-are-the-problem.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/13/rightwing-ex-general-jews-are-the-problem/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46491444.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/13/rightwing-ex-general-jews-are-the-problem\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-13T19:15:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Caitlin Dickson\",\"tags\":[\"the_fringe_factor\",\"republican_party\",\"politics\",\"american_military\"]}", "news_keywords": "The Fringe Factor, Republican Party, US Politics, American military", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Caitlin Dickson", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-03-13T19:15:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/caitlin-dicksonhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/13/rightwing-ex-general-jews-are-the-problem", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Jerry Boykin, a retired Lieutenant General and rightwinger, spouted anti-Semitic \u201cjokes\u201d and accused Obama of supporting al-Qaeda at a conservative Christian conference.", "title": "Rightwing Ex- General: \u2018Jews Are The Problem\u2019", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/13/rightwing-ex-general-jews-are-the-problem.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/13/rightwing-ex-general-jews-are-the-problem/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1394743336020.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/c/caitlin-dickson", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0cb6\"", "article_summary": "Boykin also responded to an interview request from an Israeli News outlet by saying, \u201cthe Jews are the problem.\nLast year, Boykin accused President Obama of using the Affordable Care Act to establish his own personal \u201cBrownshirt\u201d army.\nIsraelNationalNews.com is owned by the politically and religiously conservative Israeli news organization ArutzSheva.\nIf that\u2019s not enough, last fall the retired General warned members of the WallBuilders Pro-Family Legislative Network that Jesus will be wielding an AR-15 assault rifle when he returns to Earth.\nFringe FactorJerry Boykin, a retired Lieutenant General and rightwinger, spouted anti-Semitic \u201cjokes\u201d and accused Obama of supporting al-Qaeda at a conservative Christian conference."}
