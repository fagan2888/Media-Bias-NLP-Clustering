You have to take it gradually, and that\u2019s exactly what they are doing,\u201d Marker said.\n\n\u201cThey are smart. They are super savvy people, and they know exactly how to deal with the political landscape.\u201d\n\nMarker said the Belgian law is a logical progression, because it\u2019s hard to argue that people should maintain their personal autonomy and have the right to avoid suffering, but children should be excluded.\n\n\u201cOnce you have passed any law permitting euthanasia or doctor-prescribed suicide, you have essentially taken down all barriers,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ones that are up are just window dressing.\u201d\n\nSean Crowley, spokesman for Compassion and Choices, told WND he didn\u2019t want to engage in any discussion about the Belgian law, because his group doesn\u2019t support euthanasia and it advocates physician-assisted suicide, or what it calls \u201caid in dying,\u201d only for adults.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all about patient control,\u201d he explained, \u201cIn euthanasia, the patient loses control; they\u2019re not calling the shots.\u201d\n\nBelgium\u2019s medical community is split over the issue, with proponents of the law arguing that children in rare cases of unbearable and irreversible suffering should have the same right as an adult.\n\nThe new amendment permits euthanasia for terminally ill children near death who are experiencing \u201cconstant and unbearable suffering\u201d and can demonstrate a \u201ccapacity of discernment.\u201d\n\nReligious groups opposed the law, and more than 170 Belgian pediatricians signed an open letter to parliament asking for a delay in the vote.\n\nA recent poll, however, found 75 percent of Belgians in favor of extending the law to children.\n\nAlong with the Netherlands, euthanasia is also legal in neighboring Luxembourg. Switzerland has passed an assisted-suicide law.\n\nIn the U.S., the first victory for activists in a state-by-state strategy came with a ballot initiative in 1994 in Oregon. While the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that physician-assisted suicide is not a constitutional right, the court left open the door for states to address the issue. Washington state passed its Death with Dignity Act in 2008, 17 years after a ballot initiative sponsored by the Hemlock Society failed. Vermont passed a law last year based on Oregon\u2019s, and a Montana Supreme Court decision brought de facto legalization to the state. In January, a district court judge in New Mexico a ban on \u201caid in dying\u201d violated the state constitution.\n\n\u2018Anyone can be manipulated\u2019\n\nOne of the primary arguments for restricting euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide to adults is that children can be easily manipulated, but Marker argues adults can be manipulated as well.\n\n\u201cAnyone can be manipulated. You can have adults be manipulated because they feel as though they are a burden on others,\u201d she said.\n\nRight-to-die activists have persuaded many with emotional arguments. A Belgian doctor cited by Time magazine as a proponent of the new law pointed to the case of a child with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy who faced a degeneration of muscles that would eventually cause suffocation.\n\nBut Marker argued that proponents base their arguments on rare, worst-case scenarios while the Belgian law has in mind any child who is considered terminally ill.\n\n\u201cThe way terminal illness and suffering is defined is very, very broad,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know in Belgium already it can include emotional suffering, mental suffering and physical suffering.\n\nMarker said there is \u201cno question that we have to do everything to end suffering, but to say that you then give doctors the power to prescribe a lethal injection or to prescribe a deadly overdose of drugs is like saying we must end unemployment by making sure anybody who is unemployed dies.\u201d\n\nShe noted a Newsweek story in December that told of a professor in Belgium who had \u201cthe talk\u201d with a 10-year-old son. Not the sex talk, but a talk about the \u201coption\u201d of euthanasia, even though the child was not sick.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of message does that send?\u201d Marker asked.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a doctor telling you, \u2018I can provide you with pain control, here is your treatment, and I can provide you with lethal pain injection, or a prescription for phenobarbital \u2026 it\u2019s laid out as if they are all equal,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen a doctor is essentially saying it\u2019s just as good if I care for you or kill you, what does that say?\u201d\n\nShe pointed to further problems when people are faced with mounting medical costs.\n\n\u201cWe know that people who pay for medical care or people who are sick are much more apt to authorize payment for the least expensive treatment,\u201d she said.\n\nStep by step\n\nMaker offered evidence that \u201caid in dying\u201d advocates are employing an incremental approach.\n\nShe noted that when Compassion and Choices proposed Initiative 119 in Washington state in 1991, it advocated both lethal injection and assisted suicide. The measure failed 54 to 46 percent.\n\nA similar bill in California the next year, Proposition 161, also failed.\n\nMarker said that television commercials in California and Washington showing syringe-wielding physicians were effective, and when a measure finally passed in Oregon in 1994, it was physician-assisted suicide only.\n\nAfter the Oregon bill passed, the then-legal counsel for Compassion and Choices, Kathryn Tucker, acknowledged in a speech at Seattle Pacific University that to pass assisted-suicide laws, some restrictions are necessary to \u201cconvince people\u201d that the law is \u201csuitably protective.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey know that you can\u2019t push it too fast,\u201d Marker said. \u201cYou have to take it step by step, and that is exactly what they are doing.\u201d\n\nThe first advocates of euthanasia in the U.S. in the 20th century proposed allowing it for children.\n\nA year after the Euthanasia Society of America was formed in 1938, it urged legalizing \u201cthe termination of human life by painless means for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary suffering.\u201d\n\nCharles Nixdorff, the society\u2019s treasurer, acknowledged the measure was limited to voluntary euthanasia because the public couldn\u2019t accept incorporating children and \u201cincompetents,\u201d the New York Times reported at the time.\n\nHowever, the article noted that the society \u201choped eventually to legalize the putting to death of non-volunteers beyond the help of medical science.\u201d\n\nThe euthanasia society\u2019s president, Dr. Foster Kennedy, insisted euthanasia was \u201cneeded mainly for defectives\u201d and advocated the \u201clegalizing of euthanasia primarily in cases of born defectives who are doomed to remain defective, rather than for normal persons who have become miserable through incurable illness.\u201d\n\nIn 1942, Kennedy proposed a plan for child euthanasia in an article in the American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\n\u201cI believe when the defective child shall have reached the age of five years \u2013 and on the application of his guardians \u2013 that the case should be considered under law by a competent medical board.\u201d\n\nHe said if the board determined the child had \u201cno future or hope of one \u2026 then I believe it is a merciful and kindly thing to relieve that defective \u2013 often tortured and convulsed, grotesque and absurd, useless and foolish, and entirely undesirable \u2013 of the agony of living.\u201d\n\nMarker noted that the idea of mercy killing for children became part of \u201crespectable debate\u201d in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn 1989, the influential University of Iowa College of Law drafted a model law in which \u201caid-in-dying\u201d could be demanded for terminally ill children by their parents or by terminally ill children along with their parents.\n\nIn 1993, 900 parents whose children were patients at several Cleveland area health facilities were asked to fill out a \u201cPediatrics Ethics Survey\u201d that offered the \u201coptions\u201d of lethal injections and mercy killing.\n\nIn 1999, Princeton University, a Presbyterian Church institution, hired Australian philosopher Peter Singer as a professor in bioethics.\n\nA well-known advocate of infanticide and euthanasia, Singer infamously declared in a 1983 article that a pig had greater value than a handicapped newborn.\n\nResponding to a flood of criticism for the hire, Princeton\u2019s president issued a statement saying that while faculty members \u201cmay disagree with him on some issues \u2026 they have deep respect for his scholarship and invariably find his work instructive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "When Belgium, on the heels of the Netherlands, passed a measure in 2002 legalizing euthanasia amid fierce opposition, it limited the practice to adults.
