That translates to an annual retirement income of less than $7,000.\n\nRelated: The Best States for Retirement 2016\n\nThose dismal figures explain why just 24 percent of Boomers are confident they\u2019ll have enough savings to last them through their retirement years. That\u2019s down from 27 percent last year and 36 percent in 2012.\n\nSome Boomers are also making moves that could make it even more difficult to catch up on retirement savings. Three in 10 Boomers said they had stopped contributing to their retirement accounts, and 16 percent took early withdrawals. Both percentages are up from last year\u2019s survey.\n\n\u201cTime is running out,\u201d IRI president and CEO Cathy Weatherford said in a statement. \u201cUnless Boomers begin to focus on their long-term needs now and commit to savings, they will need to work longer and make steep cutbacks to make ends meet in retirement.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s already starting to happen, with nearly a third of Boomers saying that they postponed their retirement plans in the past year, the highest percentage in the six years since IRI has conducted the survey. The survey found that nearly 60 percent planned to retire at age 65 or later, and 26 percent said they\u2019ll work past age 70.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Most financial planners recommend that workers have enough cash saved to replace 70 pe", "title": "Could You Live on $7,000 a Year?
