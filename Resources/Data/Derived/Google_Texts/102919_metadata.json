A growing body of political science literature actually finds that voting is an incredibly important lever of policy change. To understand why, though, we need to start with the matter of class.\n\nThe class bias in voter turnout in America is strong. A recent study estimates that in 2008, voter turnout among the wealthiest 1 percent of the population was an astronomical 99 percent. It\u2019s not surprising that this level of participation doesn\u2019t hold for all tax brackets; yet the chart below still shows a startling trend. There is only a single instance over the past three election cycles of a lower income bracket having higher turnout than a higher bracket.\n\nFor a long time, political scientists weren\u2019t worried about turnout disparities. In their seminal 1980 study on the question (using data from 1972), Raymond Wolfinger and Steven Rosenstone argued that, \u201cvoters are virtually a carbon copy of the citizen population.\u201d Later, in a 1999 study, Wolfinger and Benjamin Highton find a slightly larger gap between voters and non-voters, but still conclude that \u201cnon-voters appear well represented by those who vote.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a more recent review of the data, Jan Leighley and Jonathan Nagler find \u201cenduring and increasing\u201d differences between voters and non-voters on issues relating to class-based issues. They find that non-voters are far more likely to support union organizing, a job guarantee and universal health insurance.\n\nWhy the differences in the studies? It turns out, the reason is historical. Difference between voters and non-voters with regards to the size of government and redistribution weren\u2019t as strong in the 1970s and 1980s, when the earlier studies were conducted; since then, according to Larry Bartels, the U.S. has become a world leader in class conflict over government spending. These biases began accelerating at the end of the 1980s.\n\nSince then, the Leighley and Nagler thesis has enjoyed increasing support. A 2012 Pew survey revealed similar differences, with non-voters far more supportive of government intervention in the economy and far more supportive of the Affordable Care Act. A Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) study of Californians from 2006 finds that non-voters are also more likely to support higher taxes and more services. They were more likely to oppose Proposition 13 \u2014 a constitutional amendment that limits property taxes \u2014 and to support affordable housing.\n\nGiven all of this, it\u2019s unsurprising that the current Republican electoral strategy is based around disenfranchisement through means like voter ID laws. Consider a Pew poll taken from before the 2012 election: Among \u201clikely voters,\u201d Obama and Romney were split, with 47 percent of voters each. Among non-voters, however, Obama had 59 percent support, compared with Romney\u2019s 24 percent support.\n\nOne problem with this is that turnout inequality affects both parties \u2014 pulling the Democrats and Republicans to the right. The corollary is that voter suppression efforts pursued by Republican partisans also affect the behavior of Democrats. And there is strong evidence that voter suppression efforts increase turnout inequality.\n\nFor instance, one study finds that \u201cstate voter registration laws pose a substantial barrier\u201d to the mobilization of low-income voters. While 63.2 percent of citizens in the lowest income bracket (less than $10,000) are registered, a full 87.1 percent of those in the top bracket ($150,000 or more) are. Research shows that same-day registration decreases the class bias of the electorate, so rollbacks of same day registration will also harm low-income voters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The British comedian and aspiring anarchist famously refuses to vote.
