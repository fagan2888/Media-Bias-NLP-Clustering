Sen. Marco Rubio is preparing a campaign similar to that of defeated Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

In an interview following his Iowa top finish among the so-called Republican establishment candidates, Rubio was asked his position on the litmus test issue of undocumented residents. He predictably set up a near impossible predicate of a fully sealed Mexican border complete with walls and electronic detection devices. When prodded by the interviewer to assume all preconditions were achieved, without hesitation he said he would then see what the people wanted. He carefully held out the possibility of the familiar path he once endorsed and rejected the Donald Trump notion of sending 11 or 12 million people out of the U.S. However, he treated the circumstance as if he never seriously considered it.

If that inconclusive plan on a critical topic seems familiar, it is because Romney did all he could to avoid specificity on controversial issues within his party. It is evidence of a hopelessly fractured Republican Party that prevents unity on all but guns, expanded military, abortion, tax cuts and Obamacare repeal. However, where policy is required to be crafted and defended, Rubio and all Republican hopefuls have adopted the failed tactic of deferring details until after elected to the presidency.

It is clear that with the almost endless cable coverage of the candidates and almost nine months left before election, the candidates will be urged to give birth to fully formed ideas, unless they choose to initiate a policy, and then amend or terminate it as they proceed.

It seems Republican disapproval of choice is limited to women.
