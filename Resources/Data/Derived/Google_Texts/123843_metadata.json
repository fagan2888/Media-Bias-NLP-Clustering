The most common tree identified in the study, a variety of palm known to scientists as Iriartea, was also found to hold the most carbon. But the other 181 species identified as the most important for carbon storage weren\u2019t necessarily the most common species in the rainforest. They were species that shared combinations of important features, being relatively abundant, long-living and large-growing.\n\n\u201cThere are a few species that seem to grow big\u2014and those are the ones you\u2019d want to emphasize in conservation,\u201d said University of California at Berkeley forest ecology professor John Battles, who was not involved with the research. \u201cIf you were managing these forests, you would leave these trees.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research reveals a relatively small number of the jungle's tree species store more than half the planet's carbon", "title": "The Amazon is trying to save us: Why deforestation may spell our demise", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Research reveals a relatively small number of the jungle's tree species store more than half the planet's carbon", "title": "The Amazon is trying to save us: Why deforestation may spell our demise", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/03/the_amazon_is_trying_to_save_us_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/shutterstock_128451140.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Research reveals a relatively small number of the jungle's tree species store more than half the planet's carbon", "title": "The Amazon is trying to save us: Why deforestation may spell our demise", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/shutterstock_128451140.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "John Upton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, amazon rainforest, carbon, Climate Central, Climate Change", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ffe\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe Amazon is a massively important carbon stock, and it\u2019s currently acting as a carbon sink,\u201d Leeds University\u2019s Sophie Fauset, who led the research, said.\nBut the other 181 species identified as the most important for carbon storage weren\u2019t necessarily the most common species in the rainforest.\nThey were species that shared combinations of important features, being relatively abundant, long-living and large-growing.\nThe most common tree identified in the study, a variety of palm known to scientists as Iriartea, was also found to hold the most carbon.\n\u201cIf you were managing these forests, you would leave these trees.\u201d"}
