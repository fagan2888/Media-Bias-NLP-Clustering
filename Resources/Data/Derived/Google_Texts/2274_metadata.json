While other states have used child protection laws to arrest and prosecute pregnant women, Tennessee broke new ground in the alarming trend when it passed a law allowing prosecutors to charge a woman with criminal assault if she uses narcotics during her pregnancy and her fetus or newborn is considered \u201caddicted to or harmed by the narcotic drug.\u201d\n\nThe law was passed against the advice of medical and addiction experts within Tennessee and across the country, so it\u2019s little surprise that its implementation has further compromised the health and safety of the women it targets. And as a report from Lindsay Beyerstein in Al Jazeera America makes clear, women in the state are frightened \u2014 for themselves, their pregnancies and their children.\n\nThe Republican state representative behind the law, Terri Lynn Weaver, previously told me, \u201cWe\u2019re not about jailing a bunch of women and throwing away the key \u2014 we\u2019re about getting them help.\u201d But as Beyerstein points out, SB1391 did not create any new treatment programs or provide additional funding to already strained treatment centers across the state. Options can be even more limited for pregnant women, as only 19 of the state\u2019s 177 addiction treatment facilities offer any addiction care specifically oriented toward pregnant women. And only a few state facilities that provide on-site prenatal care allow older children to stay with their mothers while they are undergoing treatment. The problem of access is further compounded by Tennessee\u2019s current refusal of the Medicaid expansion, with the uninsured rate for people aged 19-39 hovering around 25 percent in the state.\n\nThe new law also did not allocate state dollars to better equip hospitals to treat infants born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, a treatable condition in which babies born to mothers who use opiates experience withdrawal symptoms that can disrupt their sleep, make them irritable and cause gastrointestinal changes. And the push behind SB1391 didn\u2019t do a thing to lift the stigma that pregnant women using drugs face when seeking treatment. (In fact, stigma was a major driving force behind the measure. Weaver told me that the new law targets, in her view, \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d She continued, \u201cThese are coke and heroine ladies.\u201d)\n\nAll of this amounts to a dangerous set of circumstances for pregnant women in the state. \u201cWhat you would hope would happen is that when Mom comes in, that the hospital system would be prepared in knowing that there is an opioid exposure. This is kind of an expected issue that can happen with some babies that have been born prenatally exposed to opiates,\u201d Dr. Hendree Jones, Ph.D., a professor with the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and an expert on neonatal abstinence syndrome and other issues related to pregnancy and addiction, recently told me. \u201cMy fear is that more women will be shunning the medical system and then will not be getting prenatal care. They won\u2019t be engaging in drug treatment because they\u2019re scared that the drug treatment will potentially turn them in. I think that laws to criminalize pregnant women could actually make the situation worse, because the women will feel like they have no safe place to turn to if they do want treatment.\u201d\n\nBeyerstein met several women in Tennessee who told her exactly this:\n\nSharida Payne, 29, arrived at [Knoxville-based treatment program] Great Starts on May 12 with her 9-year-old daughter and an infant daughter. A longtime opiate addict, Payne used prescription pills throughout her pregnancy, seeking outpatient help when she was about six months along. Her caregivers warned her not to quit cold turkey while she was pregnant, so Payne looked into methadone treatment. But one clinic wasn\u2019t taking Medicaid patients like her, and the other had what she calls a \u201cridiculously long\u201d waiting list. The baby developed withdrawal symptoms, including muscle twitches, a few days after birth and spent three and a half weeks in the hospital. [\u2026] Payne says that if SB1391 had been in effect when she gave birth, it might have scared her away \u201cfrom going to the hospital and seeking care for my baby, because I wouldn\u2019t want to end up in jail.\u201d She wishes there were more treatment options available so that pregnant women could get help before they deliver.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A mother in New Jersey underwent a doctor-prescribed drug treatment, then ended up on the child abuse registry", "title": "Methadone treatment is the gold standard for pregnant opiate users.
