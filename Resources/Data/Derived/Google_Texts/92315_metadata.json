More money can be saved by reducing admissions than by reducing the length of stay for admissions,\" the report states. \"Many of these organizations still focus on the inpatient side rather than on ambulatory care with the specific intent to reduce admissions.\" Independent Physician Groups, which are owned by a single physician group and do not contract with other providers. A major disadvantage for these ACOs is that they cannot affect the delivery of inpatient care, and \"generally do not have ready access to capital,\" according to the report. Physician Group Alliances, which can be owned by multiple physician groups, but do not contract with other providers for further services. The model's biggest disadvantage is that all the groups must figure out how to work together, according to the report. Expanded Physician Groups, which only provide outpatient services directly, but may offer subspecialty or hospital services via contracts with other providers. Although the lack of hospital involvement means fewer revenue pressures, these ACOs are also left to set up operational arrangements with hospitals to better manage patient health, according to the report. Independent Hospital, ACOs with a single owner that provides direct inpatient services and, in the case of integrated health systems, outpatient services, but not subspecialty care. Although they provide fewer services than Full Spectrum Integrated ACOs, they do have lower cost structures. Hospital Alliance, ACOs with multiple owners, at least one of which directly provides inpatient services. \"With disparate providers, particularly when a significant number of different EMRs [electronic medical records] are in place, interoperability is a significant operational hurdle,\" the report states.\n\nDistinct classifications for ACOs will help healthcare leaders identify what does and doesn't work for their specific organizations and maximize care value, report co-author David Muhlestein, Ph.D., director of research at Leavitt Partners, told Becker's Hospital Review. \"Now organizations won't have to reinvent the wheel every time a new ACO comes along,\" he said.\n\nThe taxonomy will also help vendors, Muhlestein said, because \"vendors are trying to sell the same products to all ACOs, and the same products don't work for all ACOs.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the report (.pdf)\n\n- read the Becker's article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans have ACO access\n\nReport: ACOs expected to double by end of 2014\n\nMedicare ACOs grow faster than non-Medicare ACOs\n\n3 reasons for slowed ACO growth", "article_metadata": {"description": "Accountable care organizations vary widely in terms of ownership, patient care emphasis and organizational structure, according to a new report from Leavitt Partners.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Accountable care organizations vary widely in terms of ownership, patient care emphasis and organizational structure, according to a new report from Leavitt Partners.", "title": "6 ACO types,  6 different ways to transition to value-based care", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/6-aco-types-6-different-ways-transition-value-based-care/2014-06-04", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs),Care Delivery,inpatient care,Leavitt Partners,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,outpatient services,physician groups,value-based care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b2b\"", "article_summary": "Accountable care organizations (ACOs) vary widely in terms of ownership, patient care emphasis and organizational structure, according to a new report from Leavitt Partners.\nExpanded Physician Groups, which only provide outpatient services directly, but may offer subspecialty or hospital services via contracts with other providers.\nIndependent Hospital, ACOs with a single owner that provides direct inpatient services and, in the case of integrated health systems, outpatient services, but not subspecialty care.\n\"Now organizations won't have to reinvent the wheel every time a new ACO comes along,\" he said.\nThe six ACO types include:Full Spectrum Integrated, which provide all aspects of healthcare directly to their patients, and are commonly dominated by a large integrated delivery network."}
