The Journal reported that the culture agency had said in a statement that the program has been a success.\n\nConsoles were banned in 2000 because of worries over the effect the violent content of some video games had on children.\n\nThe program that tested lifting the ban was not without its restrictions. It required the console makers to establish manufacturing facilities in the free-trade zone, according to an earlier report in The Wall Street Journal. The Verge reported that manufacturers needed to obtain permissions from regulators to sell consoles, as well as get each device individually inspected.\n\nLast week\u2019s move opens up a valuable market for console manufacturers like Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft. Chinese gamers had turned to computer and mobile gaming in light of the console ban.\n\nNonetheless, the country has a significant gaming industry. A report last year found that the market for video games in China will surpass that of the U.S. by 2016.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Previously, foreign console makers could only operate in a free-trade zone in Shanghai.", "description": "Previously, foreign console makers could only operate in a free-trade zone in Shanghai.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "David McCabe", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Previously, foreign console makers could only operate in a free-trade zone in Shanghai.", "title": "China fully lifts ban on video-game consoles", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/249247-china-fully-lifts-restrictions-on-video-game-consoles", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/xboxplaystation07272015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/249247-china-fully-lifts-restrictions-on-video-game-consoles", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-27T10:01-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "David McCabe", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Video games,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-27T10:01:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/249247-china-fully-lifts-restrictions-on-video-game-consoles", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Previously, foreign console makers could only operate in a free-trade zone in Shanghai.", "card": "summary", "title": "China fully lifts ban on video-game consoles"}, "dcterms.title": "China fully lifts ban on video-game consoles"}, "article_summary": "Chinese gamers had turned to computer and mobile gaming in light of the console ban.\nThe Chinese government has fully lifted a 15-year ban on video-game consoles, it announced last week.\nLast week\u2019s move opens up a valuable market for console manufacturers like Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft.\nThe Journal reported that the culture agency had said in a statement that the program has been a success.\nIt required the console makers to establish manufacturing facilities in the free-trade zone, according to an earlier report in The Wall Street Journal."}
