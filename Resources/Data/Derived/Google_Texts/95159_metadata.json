Gov. Steve Bullock\u2019s (D) administration estimated 23,000 would enroll by June 2016, according to a report by KRTV in Montana.\n\nOn February 8, Bullock said more than 27,000 Montanans had enrolled, reports the Great Falls Tribune. As of March 1, 36,320 newly eligible Medicaid recipients had enrolled, according to a state Legislative Finance Committee report published March 10.\n\nUnder the Medicaid expansion provisions contained in the ACA, the federal government will pay for 100 percent of the costs of newly eligible enrollees through 2016, then gradually taper its share to 90 percent by 2020, with states paying the difference.\n\nOut of the Woodwork\n\nBrent Mead, the executive director of the Montana Policy Institute, says the greater-than-expected enrollment numbers will significantly increase the cost of the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cThe total number of projected enrollees [was] around 22,700 for expansion and 800 \u2018woodwork\u2019 enrollees,\u201d Mead said.\n\nThe \u201cwoodwork effect\u201d refers to the enrollment of individuals who were previously eligible for Medicaid but signed up after the program\u2019s expansion. Montana must pay for woodwork enrollees at the pre-Medicaid expansion rate, which the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2014 listed as 32 percent for Montana.\n\n\u201cThe state badly missed the ball on the woodwork clients,\u201d Mead said. \u201cThe latest numbers we have are for December 2015, but early indications show that both applications and enrollment for those previously eligible for Medicaid spiked when compared to 2014.\u201d\n\nMead says the inaccurate estimate of the woodwork effect will soon force Montana to choose between spending more tax dollars on Medicaid or funding non-entitlement programs at the desired levels.\n\n\u201cThe state will face a choice in 2017,\u201d Mead said. \u201cThis is going to ramp up mandatory spending at the same time that commodity prices like oil, coal, and cattle are low. Something will have to give, but if I were to wager, it would be other state programs like higher education or infrastructure spending that suffer, rather than restraining a new entitlement program.\u201d\n\nNo Magic Money Pot\n\nNicholas Horton, a senior research fellow at the Foundation for Government Accountability, says states that expand Medicaid because they are enticed by the federal government\u2019s 90\u2013100 percent share are banking on an empty promise.\n\n\u201cThe money for expansion isn\u2019t there, but that\u2019s one of the biggest fallacies expansion supporters have propagated,\u201d Horton said. \u201cThey say there\u2019s all this money in Washington[, DC] and if states don\u2019t expand Obamacare, that money will go to another state. It\u2019s simply not true. The Congressional Research Service has definitively said there\u2019s no magic pot of Obamacare money.\u201d\n\nHorton says those who are concerned about the national debt cannot justify expanding Medicaid.\n\n\u201cAll of the money the federal government is spending on Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is being added to the national debt,\u201d Horton said. \u201cSo, if you\u2019re concerned about the national debt, which is rapidly approaching $20 trillion, I don\u2019t see how you can justify supporting new deficit spending.\u201d\n\nAwaiting Elections\n\nHorton says the November elections may hold the key to curbing Montana\u2019s Medicaid expansion costs.\n\n\u201cBased on conversations we\u2019ve had with folks on the ground in Montana, there\u2019s a significant appetite for repeal,\u201d Horton said. \u201cAnd obviously, if the state gets a new conservative governor next year, the likelihood of repeal goes way up.\u201d\n\nBullock filed for reelection on February 29. Contenders include Republicans Mark Perea and Greg Gianforte, Libertarian Ron Vandevender, and independent Christopher Zarcone, ABCFoxMontana.com reports.\n\nPutting Hope in Term Limits\n\nMead says the cure for Montana\u2019s unpredictably expensive Medicaid expansion may lie in an election further down the road.\n\n\u201cConservatives will have an opportunity as the program sunsets in 2019,\u201d Mead said. \u201cMany legislators cycle in and out of office, and conservatives can make their voices heard on the issue.\u201d\n\nThe next class of legislators should be more amenable to reform than the current batch, Mead says.\n\n\u201cBy the time the 90 percent rate kicks in, many of the proponents of expansion will be term-limited out of office, including Bullock,\u201d Mead said. \u201cThey will never have to deal with the consequences of a ballooning program that has less financial support from the federal government.\u201d\n\nMead says however the composition of the legislature may change, he has \u201cno doubt that any attempt to roll back expansion will be a massive undertaking.\n\n\u201cJust because it is difficult does not mean conservatives in Montana should stop pressing for a sustainable health care system,\u201d said Mead.\n\nDustin Siggins (dustinsiggins@gmail.com) writes from Washington, DC.\n\nInternet Info:\n\nQuinn Holzer, The Montana Help Act, Medicaid Expansion Update, Legislative Finance Committee, Montana Legislative Fiscal Division, March 10, 2016: https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/montana-help-act-medicaid-expansion-update\n\nAn Estimate of the Economic Ramifications Attributable to the Potential Medicaid Expansion on the Montana Economy, The Bureau of Business and Economic Research, The University of Montana, January 8, 2013: https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/estimate-economic-ramifications-attributable-potential-medicaid-expansion-montana-e\n\nImage via Thinkstock\n\nThis article has been updated.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Internet Info:Quinn Holzer, The Montana Help Act, Medicaid Expansion Update, Legislative Finance Committee, Montana Legislative Fiscal Division, March 10, 2016: https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/montana-help-act-medicaid-expansion-updateAn Estimate of the Economic Ramifications Attributable to the Potential Medicaid Expansion on the Montana Economy, The Bureau of Business and Economic Research, The University of Montana, January 8, 2013: https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/estimate-economic-ramifications-attributable-potential-medicaid-expansion-montana-eImage via ThinkstockThis article has been updated.\nThe \u201cwoodwork effect\u201d refers to the enrollment of individuals who were previously eligible for Medicaid but signed up after the program\u2019s expansion.\nPutting Hope in Term LimitsMead says the cure for Montana\u2019s unpredictably expensive Medicaid expansion may lie in an election further down the road.\nOut of the WoodworkBrent Mead, the executive director of the Montana Policy Institute, says the greater-than-expected enrollment numbers will significantly increase the cost of the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\u201cAll of the money the federal government is spending on Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is being added to the national debt,\u201d Horton said."}
