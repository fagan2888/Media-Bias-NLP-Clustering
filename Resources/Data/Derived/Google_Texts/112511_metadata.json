Although ELIH was the last of the three East End hospitals to enter into an agreement with a larger organization, it had been in negotiations with both SBU and North Shore-LIJ for years.\n\n\u201cIt was not a tough call to make,\u201d said ELIH board chairman Thomas Murray. \u201cAt least, in the final weeks it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFollowing the Berger Commission report, ELIH, PBMC and Southampton Hospital formed the East End Health Alliance. But the Affordable Care Act \u2014 better known as Obamacare \u2014 has \u201cmade the effort toward focusing on the patient and the facility around the patient rather than the patient around the system,\u201d said the hospital\u2019s CEO, Paul Connor. Mergers have since ensued nationwide and the EEHA is being officially dissolved.\n\nStony Brook University Hospital and ELIH will now develop a \u201cdefinitive agreement\u201d that will lay out all the legal obligations each organization has to the other.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "top stories 2015,year in review 2015", "og": {"url": "http://suffolktimes.timesreview.com/2015/12/64628/top-stories-2015-elih-to-partner-with-stony-brook-university-hospital/", "image": "http://media.timesreview.com.s3.amazonaws.com/suffolktimes/files/ELIH-web.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Eastern Long Island Hospital\u2019s board of directors voted unanimously July 9 to begin the process of affiliating with\u00a0Stony Brook University Hospital, merging the small, rural Greenport facility with an organization that boasts a $1.1 billion annual bud", "title": "Top Stories 2015: ELIH to partner with Stony Brook University Hospital | Suffolk Times"}, "fb": {"admins": "64401241,16320909,508876025,591622321,114502230,100010605219656", "app_id": 115179118576729}, "description": "Eastern Long Island Hospital\u2019s board of directors voted unanimously July 9 to begin the process of affiliating with\u00a0Stony Brook University Hospital,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2cb1\"", "article_summary": "Stony Brook University Hospital and ELIH will now develop a \u201cdefinitive agreement\u201d that will lay out all the legal obligations each organization has to the other.\n\u201cAt least, in the final weeks it wasn\u2019t.\u201dFollowing the Berger Commission report, ELIH, PBMC and Southampton Hospital formed the East End Health Alliance.\nELIH\u2019s decision to merge with Stony Brook came after Riverhead\u2019s Peconic Bay Medical Center voted to start its own process of joining North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, one of the nation\u2019s largest health organizations, and about six months after Southampton Hospital also voted to affiliate with Stony Brook.\n\u201cIt was not a tough call to make,\u201d said ELIH board chairman Thomas Murray.\nEastern Long Island Hospital\u2019s board of directors voted unanimously July 9 to begin the process of affiliating with Stony Brook University Hospital, merging the small, rural Greenport facility with an organization that boasts a $1.1 billion annual budget and hosts Suffolk County\u2019s only level-one trauma center and academic medical center."}
