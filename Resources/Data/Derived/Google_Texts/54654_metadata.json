Layoffs and large budget cuts in Kentucky and elsewhere have gotten news coverage, but they are only part of the picture.\n\nThe volume-business ways that built revenue for decades are crumbling away as individuals consumers and insurers shift to cheaper outpatient treatments and wellness programs. Increasingly, revenue, profits and cash flow come to those who provide service best and at the least cost.\n\nConsumers are bearing more direct costs, paying more attention to prices and opting away from traditional profit-generating methods of providing care. At the same time, taxpayer-funded government compensation models are making better medical outcomes and financial efficiency important bottom-line issues.\n\nMaking healthcare more affordable, a namesake goal of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 and being enacted now, \u201cnaturally puts pressure on healthcare providers to keep costs in check,\u201d said Carl Herde, system chief financial officer for Baptist Health. \u201cHowever, many of the issues facing healthcare were in place before the ACA came into effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are moving from a system in which rewards are based on volume to one that rewards value,\u201d said Dr. Michael Karpf, the University of Kentucky executive vice president for health affairs and administrator of UK HealthCare. Since 2003 he\u2019s been responsible for UK\u2019s hospitals, College of Medicine, practice plans and the clinical activities of the other colleges of the academic medical center. And for years Karpf has been saying publicly that the healthcare industry is on an unsustainable financial course.\n\n\u201cThere is a real need to decrease utilization to get healthcare costs under control. It just puts pressure on institutions,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be doing business the same old-fashioned way we\u2019ve been doing it.\u201d\n\nEven those care providers whose revenues are growing healthily \u2013 such as UK HealthCare, whose $920 million hospital budget is producing 7 to 8 percent cash flow \u2013 are cutting costs and hunting efficiencies. For others, it\u2019s more drastic.\n\nKentuckyOne Health, which had 15,000 employees at 200 facilities, including 10 hospitals, after coming into existence through mergers and partnership deals two years ago, said early this year it expects a $218 million deficit in its $2.5 billion budget. Last month it laid off 500 workers and said it won\u2019t fill another 200 openings, plus the emergency room at Medical Center Jewish Northeast in Louisville will close April 1 \u201cdue to low demand for emergency services at that location.\u201d\n\nWithout suggesting which one, the company has said it might close an entire hospital.\n\nKentuckyOne Health is not an isolated case. New York City\u2019s 11 public hospitals face a reported $400 million deficit for fiscal 2015. According to USA Today, Indiana University Health laid off 900 toward a five-year goal of cutting its budget $1 billion. Vanderbilt University Medical Center eliminated nearly 1,000 jobs last year to cut costs. Internationally famous Cleveland Clinic is offering buyouts to 3,000 employees toward shaving its annual operating costs by $330 million.\n\nBaptist Health, a Louisville-based system that owns seven Kentucky hospitals plus a long-term, acute-care facility in Corbin and manages hospitals in Elizabethtown and Russell County, had a $22 million operating loss in fiscal 2013. But Baptist also had $78 million in investment income to erase that deficit, Herde said.\n\n\u201cThere is increasing pressure for hospitals to do more with less without sacrificing quality,\u201d he said, \u201cso we are exploring creative ways to contain costs, but we are financially sound now \u2013 and we are confident that we will remain so in the future.\u201d\n\nAchieving the common goal of containing expenses while maintaining excellence will require collective cooperation among the state\u2019s care-seeking public as well as members of the industry providing health service, Herde said.\n\nKentuckyOne CEO Ruth Brinkley noted the management challenges occurring nationally in describing the causes for major healthcare entities\u2019 current financial problems.\n\n\u201cThe recession has come to healthcare, and that is causing the industry to transform,\u201d said Brinkley. \u201cThere are many causes for the changes, among them: the economy, reduced payments from government and commercial payers, increasing consumerism, and shifts in how care is organized and delivered.\n\n\u201cWe have seen large and respected healthcare organizations announcing restructuring, budget cuts and layoffs. Among them are Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Cleveland Clinic. This situation is even more acute in Kentucky, with steep declines in inpatient volumes,\u201d she said.\n\nThe trend toward more outpatient treatment, which is less expensive, takes a bite out of the juiciest portion of many hospitals\u2019 operations.\n\n\u201cHospitals have traditionally made their margins on inpatient services,\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cNow, inpatient care will be paid (for by public and private insurers) at lower rates as the industry and Kentucky-One shift to keeping people healthy rather than treating them solely when they are ill and need inpatient hospitalization. We have seen declines in inpatient care volumes at KentuckyOne Health with a transition to higher volumes in outpatient care.\u201d\n\nLess inpatient treatment means fewer employees are necessary at Kentucky hospitals, which have been one of the nation\u2019s best job-creation engines during the past decade.\n\nThe Louisville region\u2019s biggest provider, non-profit Norton Healthcare, which has five Louisville area hospitals and affiliation with facilities in Carrollton, Hardinsburg, Horse Cave, Lebanon and Leitchfield, Ky., plus Corydon, Ind., is operating at a break-even level financially, said Michael W. Gough, the system\u2019s senior vice president and chief financial officer.\n\nThe healthcare industry is, indeed, in a financial squeeze in Gough\u2019s view \u201ccaused by cuts in reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid and the increasing number of uninsured and under-insured patients. The ACA is supposed to provide more coverage for individuals, but it\u2019s too early to tell if that will actually happen.\u201d\n\nPublic healthcare plan changes are creating higher administrative costs for hospitals, said John Hackbarth, chief financial officer for Owensboro Health, which in 2013 opened a new $385 million medical center.\n\n\u201cThree years ago we had one payor for Kentucky Medicaid patients and now, after movement to a managed care model, we have five insurance plans, plus some patients remaining on Kentucky Medicaid indemnity,\u201d Hackbarth said. \u201cThis has increased costs in many areas such as contracting, compliance, billing, IT and case management because we are dealing with five times the amount of rules and hoops to jump through for a slower payment and ultimately less reimbursement.\u201d\n\nGov. Steve Beshear accepted the federal government\u2019s offer to pay for the first several years of added costs to expand Medicaid eligibility in Kentucky to an additional 308,000 state residents \u2013 those with incomes up to 138 percent of the official federal poverty level. The state eventually must assume the cost, but before than happens the Medicaid program will pay an additional $15 billion for care to Kentucky providers, Beshear and Cabinet for Health and Family Services Secretary Audrey Haynes point out at every opportunity. That will create an estimated 17,000 new jobs, they say.\n\nBut not yet.\n\nThe most common response from five major hospital operators answering questions The Lane Report submitted about the their financial status was that Medicaid expansion eventually should lower their annual charity care and bad debt burden, which is hundreds of millions of dollars. For now, however, they are focused on adding access capacity to meet an increased demand for care by the formerly uninsured.\n\n\u201cWe believe the expansion of Medicaid is certainly good news for uninsured citizens who now have the opportunity to proactively manage their health,\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cAs health providers, however, we must have a system of care in place for them. We need to proactively work to reduce the use of emergency departments for non-emergency concerns and help individuals to seek care before they are significantly ill.\u201d\n\nBaptist Health reported the most proactive response to expansion. It increased employee training on coverage options, put financial counselors through Kentucky\u2019s program for Certified Application Counselors status to helping patients enroll in Medicaid via Kynect, and sent letters to former patients who are now eligible.\n\n\u201cWe have seen an increase of approximately 15 percent in Medicaid volume attributable to Medicaid expansion,\u201d said Donna Ghobadi, Baptist\u2019s assistant vice president of managed care and revenue cycle.\n\nNorton\u2019s Gough said there is an expectation that the state will have to cut Medicaid reimbursements to providers or the number of enrollees when the federal subsidy ends.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s overall impact to date, Gough said, is \u201cdecreases in Medicare reimbursements.\u201d\n\nRevenue trends vary at Kentucky\u2019s major hospital operators. KentuckyOne Health has experienced \u201ca significant decline in revenue.\u201d Baptist Health\u2019s \u201crevenue trend has been up, just not at the same pace it use to be\u201d \u2013 and less than the rate of increase in its expenses.\n\nUK HealthCare\u2019s \u201crevenues are the strongest they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cOur expenses are up, but compared to our volumes they are under control. We focused on cost efficiency long before the Affordable Care Act. We\u2019ve been working on efficiency for 10 years now. We knew this was coming. We could have our strongest bottom line ever this year.\u201d\n\nBut UK also faces $150 million in capital investment needs to complete the upper floors of its medical center. Its cash flow \u201cgets plowed back into resources for the commonwealth,\u201d he said.\n\nNorton\u2019s revenue has \u201cincreased slightly, but is not keeping pace with expenditures,\u201d Gough said. Owensboro Health reports steady revenue.\n\nThere has been a 5 to 10 percent decrease in inpatient admissions nationally, said Owensboro\u2019s Hackbarth, with outpatient business not increasing as fast as inpatient is falling.\n\n\u201cThis would indicate that the public demand is being filtered by economic barriers for high co-pays and deductibles,\u201d Hackbarth said. This \u201cself-rationing of care\u201d by consumers, he said, is more responsible for lower demand than the ACA. A worry, he added, is that patients\u2019 cost-cutting care avoidance today could cause worse and more expensive care needs in the future.\n\nKarpf, who administered the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles before coming to UK, also sees the Affordable Care Act being less influential for hospitals\u2019 fortunes than broad financial trends that have been at work for years.\n\n\u201cEvery provider will have to understand that they have to focus on value. That they have to provide the highest outcomes in the most cost-efficient way, and that volume isn\u2019t going to be the answer to their financial performance,\u201d Karpf said in response a question about the ACA\u2019s impact on Kentucky healthcare. \u201cFor some providers, as their volume goes down they\u2019re going to have to change. As their inpatient volume goes down they are going to have to become smaller inpatient operations and better providers of an outpatient system.\n\n\u201cVolume has to go down in Kentucky,\u201d he said. \u201cKentucky is a high-utilization state and that\u2019s unsustainable.\u201d\n\nUK HealthCare is benefitting from understanding and focusing on its role as the regional provider of the most complex types of care. Its Chandler Hospital does not compete with other commonwealth facilities for gall bladder surgeries; rather, it aims to provide organ transplants, high-dose chemotherapy with bone-marrow transplants for serious cancer patients and \u201crazzle dazzle neuroscience stuff\u201d that Kentuckians often left the state for in the past.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said, \u2018What is different about us? How do we survive? What do we provide for the commonwealth?\u2019 \u201d Karpf said. \u201cBy doing that we keep people in the commonwealth rather than them having to leave the commonwealth. So we\u2019re \u2026. for the commonwealth.\u201d\n\nUK HealthCare is working to build its competitiveness against other major university medical centers in Nashville, Pittsburg, St. Louis and Columbus, Ohio. In addition to the commonwealth, it wants to draw patients from east Tennessee, West Virginia and southern Ohio.\n\n\u201cAlthough we don\u2019t have competitors for that high-end stuff locally, we still focus on our cost structure, making sure that we\u2019re as efficient as possible because there ultimately will be regional competition for our patients,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cPeople will decide where they\u2019re going to get their liver transplants by how well the place does it and what the cost is. They\u2019re going to decide whether they\u2019re going to get their leukemia taken care of by outcomes and what the cost is. So we have to stay price sensitive even as we push for the highest quality.\u201d\n\nHe foresees true multistate regional competition within five years.\n\nBaptist Health\u2019s administration is \u201cworking on ways to navigate this new business model and ensure a balance that benefits everyone,\u201d Herde said. The inpatient-to-outpatient trend was underway prior to the ACA, he said, a result of improving technology that allows treatment without hospital stays as well as shifts in insurance plans that are producing consumers\u2019 cost awareness.\n\n\u201cWe plan to continue delivering the same level of high-quality care to our patients that we always have, while at the same time expanding initiatives that help steer people away from the hospital in the first place,\u201d Herde said. \u201cAfter all, our goal is to keep people healthy and, if they do get sick, make people well.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is to find the right balance so that revenue is sufficient. By summer 2014 we should have a blueprint that will identify partners, infrastructure and timeframes to implement our strategy.\u201d\n\nOne step Baptist and Norton have taken jointly is a purchasing agreement to buy and distribute medical and surgical supplies they estimate will save $15 million during the five-year life of their contract.\n\nNorton also expects its electronic medical records system \u201cwill be a tremendous help in accomplishing efficiencies in the delivery of care,\u201d Gough said.\n\nBrinkley said KentuckyOne is now examining how best to organize its programs and service; what configuration of facilities will provide optimal access to care; what level of staffing is needed; and maintaining and improving the safety and quality of services.\n\nUK HealthCare foresees no major additional changes. Its strategy is to \u201cstick to the basics,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cWe figure if we stick to the basics, whatever happens in healthcare we\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\n\nMark Green is editorial director of The Lane Report.
