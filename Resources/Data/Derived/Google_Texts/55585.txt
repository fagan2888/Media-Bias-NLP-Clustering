There have been countless adaptations of Charles Dickens’ tale of the mean-spirited miser Ebenezer Scrooge and his redemption after a harrowing night of ghostly visitations on the anniversary of his former business partner’s death. The story tells of Scrooge’s transformation from a greedy misanthrope who reviles Christmas and dismisses it as so much “humbug” to a benevolent, charitable man. Playwright Doris Baizley’s dramatic adaptation departs from the traditional story with a tale about a traveling company whose key cast members leave its production of A Christmas Carol, forcing crew members to fill in the missing roles. Santa Fe Playhouse’s production is based on Baizley’s script, a lighthearted romp that retains the key elements of the traditional story while adding a play-within-a-play twist.

This production, directed by actor and radio personality Dan Gerrity, almost didn’t happen. The death of Gerrity on Nov. 20, just a few weeks into rehearsals, left the cast and crew, as well as the community, shaken. Those involved in the production had a dilemma: move ahead with the play or cancel it. “We met that night, and obviously that was the first question on our minds,” said Carla Garcia, the show’s stage manager, who joined musical director Campbell Martin at the playhouse for an interview with Pasatiempo. “When I first called everybody, they were so stunned. Campbell even said he was not ready to move forward, but once we actually got together in the evening, we really felt we needed to move on. He would have wanted us to. So we did.”
