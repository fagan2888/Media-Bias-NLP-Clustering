NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Assurant, Inc. (NYSE:AIZ), a premier provider of specialty protection products and related services, today reported results for fourth quarter and full-year ended Dec. 31, 2015.

“Assurant made significant strides in 2015 as we realigned our business portfolio and evolved our organizational framework to support sustainable long-term, profitable growth,” said Assurant President and CEO Alan B. Colberg.

“While fourth quarter results were disappointing and fell short of our expectations, we believe our transformation strategy will improve results and drive shareholder value. We are focusing resources and investments in targeted markets and increasing operating efficiency across the company as we continue to return capital to shareholders,” Colberg added.

Reconciliation of Net Operating Income to Net Income

Beginning in second quarter 2015, Assurant revised its presentation of results to reflect the company’s previously announced strategic realignment to focus on specialty housing and lifestyle protection products and services. As the company continues to wind down its health insurance business, Assurant Health results have been removed from net operating income and now are reflected in net income as runoff operations. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the updated presentation. In the third quarter, the company announced the sale of Assurant Employee Benefits. Assurant will continue to report this business under operating results until the sale of the business is closed, which is expected to occur by the end of first quarter 2016.

Fourth Quarter 2015 Consolidated Results

Net operating income 2 decreased to $65.3 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2014 net operating income of $99.8 million, or $1.38 per diluted share. The decrease primarily reflects lower contributions from the mobile business at Assurant Solutions and ongoing normalization of lender-placed insurance business at Assurant Specialty Property.

The decrease primarily reflects lower contributions from the mobile business at Assurant Solutions and ongoing normalization of lender-placed insurance business at Assurant Specialty Property. Net income increased to $65.7 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2014 net income of $49.8 million, or $0.69 per diluted share. Results primarily benefited from a $10.0 million gain from the fourth quarter sale of an Assurant Specialty Property legacy auto title business, compared to a $19.4 million net loss on the sale of Assurant Specialty Property’s general agency business and associated insurance carrier, American Reliable Insurance Company (ARIC), recognized in fourth quarter 2014.

Fee income increased to $376.3 million, compared to $304.7 million in fourth quarter 2014, driven by expanded service offerings in mobile and mortgage solutions.

Net operating income decreased compared to fourth quarter 2014, primarily due to lower contributions from mobile, including the previously disclosed loss of a domestic tablet program and higher operating expenses to support existing programs and expected program launches. Results also were negatively affected by foreign exchange losses and approximately $8 million of prior-period accounting adjustments, partially offset by a decrease in legal reserves related to an outstanding matter.



Full-year 2015 net operating income, excluding disclosed items, decreased compared to 2014, primarily due to lower service contract volumes from North American retail clients and the loss of the domestic tablet program.

Assurant Health Runoff Operations

The company announced on June 10, 2015 that it was beginning the process to exit the health business, following a review of strategic options for Assurant Health. Related to these plans, the company established a premium deficiency reserve accrual in 2015 for claims and direct expenses on ACA-qualified policies. The company completed the sale of Assurant Health's supplemental and small group self-funded product lines and certain other assets to National General Holdings Corp. on Oct. 1, 2015 for $14 million.

Net loss in fourth quarter primarily reflects $11.2 million after-tax of severance and other exit-related costs as well as indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves. Actual operating losses were in line with the premium deficiency accrual estimate established in third quarter 2015.



Full-year 2015 results, compared to 2014, reflect unfavorable loss experience on ACA-qualified policies and charges related to the company’s exit of the health insurance market.

ACA risk-mitigation payments received from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as of Dec. 31, 2015 for 2014 ACA-qualified policies totaled a net $351.8 million with no further remaining receivables accrued for 2014 policies.



As of Dec. 31, 2015, ACA risk-mitigation estimated recoverables for 2015 ACA-qualified policies totaled $521.6 million, reflecting $225.2 million from the risk-adjustment program and $296.4 million from the reinsurance program. The company did not record any net recoverables for the 2015 risk-corridors program.

Capital Position

Corporate capital approximated $460 million as of Dec. 31, 2015. Adjusting for the company’s $250 million risk buffer, deployable capital totaled $210 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company’s operating performance for the periods presented in this news release. Because Assurant’s calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant’s non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.

(1) Assurant uses operating ROE, excluding AOCI and Assurant Health runoff operations, as an important measure of the company’s operating performance. Operating ROE equals net operating income for the periods presented divided by average stockholders’ equity for the year-to-date period, excluding AOCI and Assurant Health runoff operations. The company believes operating ROE, excluding AOCI and Assurant Health runoff operations, provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company’s ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period-to-period, other AOCI items, Assurant Health runoff operations and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. The comparable GAAP measure would be GAAP ROE, defined as net income, for the periods presented, divided by average stockholders’ equity for the year-to-date period. GAAP ROE for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2015 and 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2014 was 2.9 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively, as shown in the following reconciliation table.

12 Months 12 Months 2015 2014 Annual operating return on average equity (excluding AOCI and Assurant Health runoff operations) 11 .3% 12 .1% Assurant Health runoff operations (9 .2)% (1 .5)% Net realized gains on investments 0 .5% 1 .0% Gain (loss) on divested business 0 .3% (0 .5)% Change in tax liabilities 0 .4% 0 .3% Payment received related to previous sale of subsidiary 0 .2% - Change in derivative investment (0 .1)% (0 .1)% Change due to effect of including AOCI (0 .5)% (1 .9)% Annual GAAP return on average equity 2 .9% 9 .4%

(2) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company’s operating performance. As shown in the net operating income reconciliation table, net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments, other unusual and/or infrequent items and Assurant Health runoff operations. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company’s ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period-to-period, those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur and Assurant Health runoff operations. Please refer to page 2 of this release for a reconciliation of net operating income to net income. (3) Assurant uses a ratio of debt to total capital, excluding AOCI and Assurant Health runoff operations, as an important measure of the company’s financial leverage. Assurant’s debt to total capital ratio, excluding AOCI and Assurant Health runoff operations, equals debt divided by the sum of debt and total stockholders’ equity excluding AOCI and Assurant Health runoff operations. The company believes that the debt to total capital ratio, excluding AOCI and Assurant Health runoff operations, provides investors a valuable measure of financial leverage, because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments, which tend to be highly variable from period-to-period, other AOCI items and Assurant Health runoff operations. The comparable GAAP measure would be the ratio of debt to total capital. The debt to total capital ratio as of Dec. 31, 2015 and Dec. 31, 2014 was 20.6 percent and 18.4 percent, respectively, as shown in the following reconciliation table.

4Q 4Q 2015 2014 Debt to total capital ratio (excluding AOCI and Assurant Health runoff operations) 23.4 % 21.9 % Change due to effect of including AOCI (0.4 )% (1.8 )% Change due to effect of including Assurant Health runoff operations (2.4 )% (1.7 )% Debt to total capital ratio 20.6 % 18.4 %
