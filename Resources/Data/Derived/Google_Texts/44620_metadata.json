Despite modest successes in \u201cbending the cost curve,\u201d health care spending is expected to expand from 17 to 19 percent of GDP in less than a decade1, 2, 3. What\u2019s worse is that we\u2019re generally not getting our money\u2019s worth. According to a 2014 study from the Commonwealth Fund of 11 developed countries, the United States ranks last in overall care quality, while spending about twice as much per capita as high-ranking countries like the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia4.\n\nIn response to soaring costs and lagging quality, payers now are actively looking to deliver better outcomes at lower cost. This includes shifting risk to providers through alternative payment models and limiting access to, as well as reimbursement for, products and services that don\u2019t show sufficient economic and clinical value.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has made clear its intention to move from the current fee-for-service payment model \u2014 which encourages volume with little concern for outcomes \u2014 to one that links payment with performance. In early 2015, Health & Human Services announced a goal of increasing Medicare payments through value-based models \u2014 including bundles and accountable care arrangements \u2014 from 20 percent in 2014 to 50 percent in 20185. More recently, CMS released a plan that would require more than 800 hospitals in 75 geographic areas to participate in a new bundled payment program for hip and knee replacements6.\n\nThe private sector is also urging change. The Health Care Transformation Task Force, a 28-member alliance of providers, payers, employers and various other partners, recently committed to transitioning 75 percent of its members\u2019 health care payments to value-based arrangements by 20207.\n\nAt the same time, the expectations of consumers, who are paying more for their care, are evolving. According to America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, more than 17 million Americans now are covered through high-deductible plans, up from 3 million in 20068. They are sure to raise their expectations for the products and services they pay for9.\n\nEmergence of Population Health\n\nAlthough a universal definition for \u201cpopulation health\u201d hasn\u2019t yet arisen, it\u2019s generally focused on managing the health of a defined population by providing the right intervention at the least costly time and place.This is a significant departure from the current fee-for-service model that incentivizes high-cost procedures like imaging and surgery. The goal of population health management is to keep patients out of acute care settings, lowering overall costs and redefining \u201chealth care\u201d as more than just \u201csick care\u201d10.\n\nAlthough population health management has garnered significant attention, there has been little effort in tracking the actual progress that\u2019s been made toward value-based models of care. Recognizing the critical need for this work, our firm has partnered with David Nash, M.D., and the Jefferson School of Population Health on a multiphase study to define and track the \u201cstate of population health\u201d in the United States.\n\nIn the first phase of this work conducted between October 2014 and June 2015, we interviewed more than 100 executives and decision-makers at a wide range of provider organizations. We gave special consideration to collecting a variety of viewpoints based on such factors as region, organization type, organization size and individual role.\n\nTo further explore insights from the interviews, we launched an online survey in June 2015. The findings from the survey are expected in late 2015. We will conduct the survey annually to track the evolution of population health management over time.\n\nKey Insights from Interviews\n\nBased on the interview phase of our study, the following key insights emerged:\n\nDefinitions of population health vary greatly. Interviewees provided various definitions of \u201cpopulation health.\u201d Some defined it more narrowly (e.g., primarily focusing on wellness), while others saw it as a much broader initiative that includes full accountability for patient populations. Several interviewees even reported that multiple definitions are being used internally, resulting in heightened confusion across the organization. Talking about her recent struggles, a senior vice president of a large hospital system said, \u201cThere are many different definitions of population health in the organization, and this is part of the challenge.\u201d\n\nOverall, how population health is internally defined has real implications for the pace at which the organization can advance its value-based initiatives as well as what specific initiatives are prioritized. Not surprisingly, organizations with a focused approach to population health management are generally much further along than those without one.\n\nCulture is critical for success. Interviewees reported numerous reasons for engaging in population health management [see Figure 1], and the leading reasons could be broadly classified into concerns over the shifting landscape (threat of regulation, current model won\u2019t last forever) and alignment with the organization\u2019s mission or culture.\n\nThose belonging to the latter group typically have made the most progress toward value-based models of care, given that they\u2019ve often been engaged in these efforts for many years. Discussing this culture, the president of one of the leading medical institutions in the country said, \u201cHistorically, we\u2019ve been a leader in addressing the challenges facing health care \u2014 it\u2019s part of our culture and mission statement.\u201d These organizations also tend to face fewer challenges in achieving clinician \u201cbuy-in\u201d on population health management, given that it\u2019s widely viewed as \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, organizations are even able to make significant strides toward value in markets still dominated by fee for service. In the words of the chief executive of one such system, \u201cCurrently, only a small percentage of revenue is driven by at-risk agreements \u2014 most of the market is still fee for service \u2026 [but it\u2019s] part of our mission to provide the best care for patients.\u201d\n\nHowever, culture is a significant roadblock for many organizations. Without a strong existing culture, modifying behavior can be challenging, especially when the organization is still profitable under fee for service. Talking about culture, the CEO of a large academic system said, \u201cPeople will say \u2018We don\u2019t have time for a culture change!\u2019\u201d On this same topic, another CEO stated, \u201cInternally, people have to change their way of thinking, especially those who have been focused on filling beds for many years. The waste in the system is someone\u2019s revenue.\u201d\n\nOrganizations are still waiting to take bold action. Most organizations haven\u2019t made significant progress in transitioning to alternative payment models. In our interviews, 60 percent of organizations reported that they\u2019re not participating in any at-risk arrangements with payers or employers [see Figure 2], and a majority of these are still \u201cthinking, talking or planning\u201d internally (vs. talking to payers or employers).\n\nAlthough some organizations in the thinking, talking or planning group have made notable progress \u2014 including creating internal education programs for clinicians and establishing clinically integrated networks \u2014 many haven\u2019t done much outside of a handful of meetings or some small internal experiments.\n\nEven among organizations currently in at-risk arrangements, progress is mixed. Most arrangements include only upside potential, and deployment often is limited to pilot programs such as CMS innovation pilots.\n\nManaging variation in cost and quality remains a significant hurdle. Although organizations typically don\u2019t mention that managing variation in cost and quality is a key challenge, further investigation indicates that it is a critical roadblock. When prompted to discuss how well they were performing on activities like establishing care paths, building these paths into order entry systems and developing processes to track cost and quality at the physician level, many organizations stated that progress has been slow. As one senior vice president of a well-known health system said, \u201c[Managing variation] is at a stage of infancy, and we\u2019re just starting to do some of this work within treatment areas. \u2026 Traditionally, we\u2019ve been inpatient-focused. Yet even here, we\u2019ve struggled to understand variation in cost and quality.\u201d\n\nCollaborations are key. Although some larger health care networks \u201cown\u201d the entire continuum of care, many of the organizations that have made the most progress rely heavily on partnerships. These organizations commonly are able to forge deep relationships along the care continuum and have developed an infrastructure for monitoring and measuring the performance of partnering facilities.\n\nRelationships with payers complicate the transition to new payment models. According to the chief operating officer of a major health care network, \u201cMost payers we\u2019ve engaged are not enthusiastic to partner with us on population health.\u201d In some ways, this is indicative of the often antagonistic relationship between providers and payers. However, providers that are able to build collaborative partnerships with payers typically are in the best position to create mutually beneficial arrangements.\n\nTaking Action\n\nTransitioning to population health management involves a completely new mindset. Unlike the current model, providers must focus on the entire care continuum \u2014 from preventive care programs to post-acute care facilities. For most organizations, this requires building strong partnerships with entities outside of their direct control and developing processes for ensuring that partnering facilities meet contractual obligations.\n\nProviders also must establish strong relationships with key stakeholders, including payers and employers. As the focus on cost and quality intensifies, providers will need to develop compelling value stories for their services that are appealing to these audiences. They also will need to identify, collect and analyze the data to support these value claims.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s critical for providers to take an active role in managing variation in cost and quality, both inside and outside the organization. Providers need to have the processes and infrastructure to ensure that care paths are established and followed, key benchmarks are tracked, and outliers are identified and appropriately addressed.\n\nFor most organizations, population health management requires a radical shift. However, there are steps that can be taken to improve today\u2019s bottom line, while also preparing for tomorrow \u2014 including managing cost and quality better and developing strong collaborations across the continuum. Given the rapidly evolving market, adopting a wait-and-see approach has become exceedingly risky. In our opinion, the time to act is now.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Numerof & Associates.
