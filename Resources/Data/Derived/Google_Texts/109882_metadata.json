They claim that their true origins lie in the Book of Acts, the biblical account of how the first Christians \u201chad everything in common\u201d and \u201cgave to anyone as he had need.\u201d The ministries \u201cshow the world something that works, and works well, and is a reflection of the commandments of Christ,\u201d Mr. Meggs said.\n\nThe resemblance to apostolic Christianity is debatable: After all, Jesus\u2019 healing ministry didn\u2019t take pre-existing conditions into account, and the early church offered aid to nonbelievers. The real precursors are the mutual aid societies of the 19th and early 20th centuries. In their heyday, organizations like the Odd Fellows and the Loyal Order of Moose pooled fees to provide insurance for huge numbers of working-class Americans. It is no accident that in our new Gilded Age, the model that prevailed during the first Gilded Age is enjoying a second life.\n\nThese aid societies did more than provide relief from doctors\u2019 bills, lost wages or funeral expenses. They also divided the \u201cdeserving\u201d poor from miscreants who suffered through their own fault. Their bylaws stressed \u201cthrift, leadership skills, self-government, self-control and good moral character,\u201d the historian David Beito has written. Lodges required members to hold an \u201chonorable\u201d job, banned women of \u201cimmoral or questionable behavior,\u201d and limited the use of alcohol and drugs.\n\nToday, Medi-Share requires members to \u201clive by biblical standards:\u201d no tobacco or illegal drugs and no sex \u201coutside of traditional Christian marriage.\u201d Samaritan Ministries, with headquarters in Peoria, Ill., requires a pastor\u2019s approval of medical expenses (and refuses to cover treatment for S.T.D.s unless \u201ccontracted innocently\u201d). Liberty HealthShare, based in Independence, Ohio, is the only Affordable Care Act-exempt ministry open to people of many faiths. It asks them to affirm that \u201cit is my spiritual duty to God and my ethical duty to others to maintain a healthy lifestyle.\u201d\n\nMembers say these rules are marks of the kind of community that government programs undermine. \u201cThis is a solution for those of us who see the A.C.A. as a problem,\u201d said Daniel Alders, 28, a Samaritan member who lives in Nacogdoches, Tex., and has turned to the ministry to pay for the births of his two children. Samaritan members send their monthly share directly to another member with medical expenses. \u201cWhen we receive money, nine times out of 10 there\u2019s a note attached saying they\u2019re praying for us and the health of the baby,\u201d he told me.\n\n\u201cA community is an organically grown organism, so it can\u2019t succeed if it\u2019s pushed and enforced from the top level down,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have a moral foundation, a reason to trust those whose needs you\u2019re sharing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a recent interview with NPR, President Obama acknowledged that many white working-class voters felt no such trust in the government. \u201cThey think: \u2018I\u2019m being left out. Nobody seems to be thinking about how tough it is for me right now,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s not the first liberal to hope that publicly funded health insurance could win that trust. More than a century ago, the Progressive reformer Jane Addams admired the parades of mutual aid societies in Chicago\u2019s Italian quarter, where members marched \u201cwith a brave showing of banners, celebrating their achievement in having surrounded themselves by at least a thin wall of protection against disaster.\u201d She longed \u201cto pour into the government of their adopted country all this affection and zeal, this real patriotism. A system of State insurance would be a very simple device and secure a large return.\u201d\n\nIn fact, mutual aid societies fought compulsory insurance legislation that Progressive activists proposed in the World War I era, fearing that such laws would endanger Americans\u2019 \u201cspirit of self-reliance.\u201d The legislation failed, but the societies\u2019 days were numbered, too. The financial burdens of their aging membership sometimes became crushing. And they were no match for the growing political power of commercial insurance companies and organized medicine, or the I.R.S.\u2019s ruling in 1943 to grant tax breaks to employers who paid for workers\u2019 insurance.\n\nIn a way, Addams still got her wish. Persuaded by a new vision of solidarity, many of those Italian immigrants joined the New Deal coalition. In 1941, Franklin Delano Roosevelt advocated for the right to \u201csecurity for those who need it,\u201d including \u201cadequate medical care.\u201d Roosevelt wanted to surpass the model of the voluntary aid society by turning the social contract into a covenant that bound people who otherwise had little in common, that granted a basic level of economic security to people excluded by the market or mutual aid.\n\nFor a small, self-selected group of Americans, cost-sharing ministries make our broken health care system bearable. There is much to admire in their nonprofit structure and their tireless advocacy for members. The problem is that too often their proponents take them as proof that it\u2019s \u201cin the DNA of Americans to assist and help one another\u201d and success comes \u201cwhen the marketplace is given the opportunity to produce solutions on its own,\u201d as Dale Bellis, Liberty HealthShare\u2019s executive director, put it.\n\nThe truth is that Americans never enjoyed a golden age when local communities came together to solve social problems. In colonial times, villages \u201cwarned out\u201d the aged, disabled and unmarried pregnant women, deporting their neediest residents to other towns.\n\nThe great insight of the New Deal reformers was that fetishizing a romantic idea of community is as perilous as making a false idol of the free market. Cost-sharing ministries nurture one kind of community, but only by opting out of the broader obligations of society. To make the Affordable Care Act stick, and to make it work, means convincing more Americans that they are not just their brother\u2019s keeper.", "article_metadata": {"ad-sponsor": "Mutual Aid Societies,health care sharing ministry", "tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150131162938, "twitter": {"description": "In our new Gilded Age, mutual aid societies revive.", "title": "Onward, Christian Health Care?", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/opinion/sunday/onward-christian-health-care.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003483714"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Worthen-Molly-circular/Worthen-Molly-circular-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/opinion/sunday/onward-christian-health-care.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003483714", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/opinion/sunday/onward-christian-health-care.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "hdl_p": "Onward, Christian Health Care?", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 31, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Liberty HealthShare", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Christian Healthcare Ministries,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Nonprofit Organizations,Christians and Christianity,Liberty HealthShare,Mutual Aid Societies,health care sharing ministry", "CN": "molly-worthen", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Molly Worthen", "SCG": "sunday", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/sunday", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By MOLLY WORTHEN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "In our new Gilded Age, mutual aid societies revive.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Worthen-Molly-circular/Worthen-Molly-circular-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Worthen-Molly-circular/Worthen-Molly-circular-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "In our new Gilded Age, mutual aid societies revive.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 31, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/molly-worthen", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-03-16", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Liberty HealthShare", "published": "2015-01-31", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "01worthen", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150316195805, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/opinion/sunday/onward-christian-health-care.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Worthen-Molly-circular/Worthen-Molly-circular-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In our new Gilded Age, mutual aid societies revive.", "title": "Onward, Christian Health Care?"}, "pdate": 20150131, "des": "Christians and Christianity", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/molly-worthen", "tagline": "Religion, ideology and American politics.", "uri": "/column/molly-worthen", "display-name": "Molly Worthen", "identifier": "molly-worthen", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003483714, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Onward, Christian Health Care?", "col": "Contributing Op-Ed Writer", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "The real precursors are the mutual aid societies of the 19th and early 20th centuries.\nThese aid societies did more than provide relief from doctors\u2019 bills, lost wages or funeral expenses.\nFor a small, self-selected group of Americans, cost-sharing ministries make our broken health care system bearable.\nLiberty HealthShare, based in Independence, Ohio, is the only Affordable Care Act-exempt ministry open to people of many faiths.\nTo make the Affordable Care Act stick, and to make it work, means convincing more Americans that they are not just their brother\u2019s keeper."}
