WACO, Texas (AP) â€” About 100 people gathered on the Baylor University campus for a candlelight vigil, march and prayer service to protest what they regard as the university's weak policing of sexual violence.

The demonstrators gathered Monday night outside the home of University President Kenneth Starr before marching to Baylor's Truett Seminary for a brief prayer service for the survivors of campus sexual violence.

The event follows an ESPN report earlier this month about three students who said the Southern Baptist-affiliated university in Waco failed to act on allegations that they were sexually assaulted by a former football player later convicted in one of those cases.
