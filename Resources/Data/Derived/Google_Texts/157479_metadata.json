Trust in the executive (45%) and legislative (32%) branches are also quite low, but both were slightly up from last year.\n\nIn 2009, Americans' trust in the judiciary was 76 percent. In just the six years since then, mistrust has risen in nearly a third of Americans.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has caused the people to lose confidence in the entire judiciary, because over a period of years, the justices have issued arbitrary and conflicting decisions that have nothing to do with the Constitution,\u201d Liberty Counsel founder Mathew Staver explained.\n\nThe Gallup website explained that \"the decline in trust in the judicial branch likely stems from the Supreme Court's controversial decisions this year to legalize same-sex marriage, and uphold a key provision of the Affordable Care Act\" (Obamacare). \"As a result, the Supreme Court's job approval rating among Republicans plummeted to 18% in July,\" the polling website reported.\n\nStaver agrees. \u201cMost recently on the marriage issue,\u201d he elaborated, \u201cthe Supreme Court deviated not only from the Constitution but also from millennia of human history, when five lawyers sought to redefine marriage, something that the Constitution gives the Supreme Court absolutely no authority over.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe loss of trust should be no surprise, because, as Sandra Day O\u2019Connor said in the Planned Parenthood versus Casey decision, the only authority the Supreme Court has is the confidence of the people,\" he said. Unlike the executive branch, which has the power to enforce laws, or the legislative branch, which has power to make laws, the judicial branch has neither. The only authority it has is that the people accept its opinion as reasoned, based on the Constitution.\"\n\n\u201cIf the people lose confidence in the court, then the court loses its authority. That is exactly what has happened with the people losing confidence in the Supreme Court and in judges,\u201d Staver concluded.\n\nAdditionally, a growing number of Americans (37%) describe the court's ideology as \"too liberal,\" up seven percent from last year. That's the highest percent of Americans considering the court overly liberal in 22 years.\n\nStaver says trust in the courts has been diminishing for years, and cites the Supreme Court\u2019s recent gay marriage decision as the final straw for many. \u201cIn 2013, five justices said that states have the right to define marriage,\u201d Staver explained. \u201cThey said that three times. The same five lawyers, two years later in 2015, said no, states do not have the right to define marriage. Which is it?\u201d Staver rhetorically asked.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t make a determination because they are flying by an ideological compass, with no basis in the Constitution or the court\u2019s precedent,\u201d Staver reasoned. \u201cThey make it up as it happens, and that\u2019s not a system of laws. That\u2019s the reason why people are and should lose confidence in not only the Supreme Court, but in other judges who disregard the Constitution they are sworn to interpret.\"\n\nGallup speculated that the low trust and \"too liberal\" opinions are \"the effect of the Supreme Court's prominent left-leaning decisions.\"\n\nNotably, 63 percent of Republicans and 35 percent of independents now say the Supreme Court is too liberal, with both figures up from last year. A large number of Democrats moved from saying the Supreme Court was \"too conservative\" to saying the nation's highest court is \"about right\" (54%).\n\nGallup concluded that \"the decline this year is almost certainly a reaction \u2013 primarily among Republicans \u2013 to the Supreme Court's landmark ruling on same-sex marriage and its turning away the latest legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act\" (ObamaCare).\n\nStaver opined that America needs to talk about this. \u201cIt\u2019s about time we have this debate, because the Supreme Court has gone so far away from its Constitutional duty that we need to come to a reckoning as to the limits that the people will tolerate, and I think the people have literally reached that limit.\u201d\n\nThe results are based on Gallup's annual \"Governance\" poll, taken September 9-13. Just over one thousand people age 18 or older were randomly called via landline telephone (40%) and cell phone (60%).
