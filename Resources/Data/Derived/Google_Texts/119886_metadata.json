(WWLP) \u2013 There are 4 vaccines parents should consider for their children before they go back to school: Tdap, meningitis HPV, and the flu.\n\nMassachusetts requires all students to have the Tdap, a combined tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine. College students and those at boarding schools are required to have at least one dose of a meningitis vaccine. The HPV and flu vaccines are not required, but highly recommended.\n\nDr. Michael Klatte, pediatric infectious disease specialist at Baystate Medical Center, told 22News the HPV vaccination rate among teens is lower than the rate for other vaccinations.\n\nDoctors also recommend teens get the flu shot every year. Emmanuel College student Jason St. Jacques told 22News, \u201cI think it\u2019s very important. I make a point to get it every year just to be safe. I\u2019ve seen the kind of destruction it can do, especially to people who don\u2019t take it seriously. I mean, it\u2019s a contagious disease.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act makes these 4 vaccinations free to everyone. Among the HPV and flu vaccines, Dr. Klatte also recommends children be vaccinated for measles, mumps, and rubella.\n\n\u201cCertainly the MMR vaccine, of which 2 are required,\u201d said Dr. Klatte. \u201cI know there has been a lot of controversy in the past surrounding the MMR vaccine and research has shown there are no links between autism and the MMR vaccine.\u201d\n\nAll of these vaccinations can be administered in one doctor\u2019s visit.\n\nClick here to find the list of required vaccinations for all students before going back to school.", "article_metadata": {"bing-site-verification": "23CDEE3A27AFAAFA06AA97D2752E7BC3", "news_keywords": "doctor, 4, four, vaccine, vaccines, vaccination, vaccinations, your, kids, kid, child, children, should, have, before, start, starting, starts, school, baystate, medical, center, hpv, tdap, meningitis, flu, shot, need, require, state", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wwlp", "og": {"site_name": "WWLP.com", "description": "There are vaccinations your children should have before going back to school. 22News is working for you with information you need to know.", "title": "4 vaccines your children need before school starts", "url": "http://wwlp.com/2015/08/11/4-vaccines-your-children-should-have-before-school-starts/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwwlp.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/vaccine.jpg", "height": 366}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There are vaccinations your children should have before going back to school. 22News is working for you with information you need to know.", "title": "4 vaccines your children need before school starts", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwwlp.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/vaccine.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WWLP22News", "site": "WWLP22News", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Western Massachusetts Breaking News, Weather", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488537620", "fb": {"pages": 16780999098}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wwlp.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/82beb0f66fcee4174912ea30f52087cc?s=16", "application-name": "WWLP.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WWLP22News", "published_time": "2015-08-12T03:14:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-12T03:23:15+00:00"}, "keywords": "breaking news, weather, investigative reports, springfield news, chicopee news, northampton news, amherst news, greenfield news, hampshire county, hampden county, berkshires, Connecticut river valley, pioneer valley, westfield news, western massachusetts, national news, headlines, online, nbc news", "google-site-verification": "6YJPKhiEei9MITNyJe-rDmtJtJ8OhKZ_QWocROYaWIU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "There are vaccinations your children should have before going back to school. 22News is working for you with information you need to know."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2318\"", "article_summary": "Among the HPV and flu vaccines, Dr. Klatte also recommends children be vaccinated for measles, mumps, and rubella.\n(WWLP) \u2013 There are 4 vaccines parents should consider for their children before they go back to school: Tdap, meningitis HPV, and the flu.\nClick here to find the list of required vaccinations for all students before going back to school.\nThe HPV and flu vaccines are not required, but highly recommended.\n\u201cCertainly the MMR vaccine, of which 2 are required,\u201d said Dr. Klatte."}
