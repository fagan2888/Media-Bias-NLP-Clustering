Olivier Knox, Chief Washington Correspondent for Yahoo! News, joined the Federalist Radio Hour to discuss the latest news coming out of the White House and Obama’s foreign policy advisors, the White House Correspondents’ Dinner and the future of relationships between the President and the press.

In the area of foreign policy, more so than domestic, people who have experience working in foreign policy have up until this point been unwilling to work for Donald Trump. “Despite what a lot of conservative writers and thinkers are arguing in public, I think there is going to be a Republicans-coming-home-to-Trump-effect,” Knox said.

As a board member of the White House Correspondents’ Association, Knox said he is concerned about the future of the first amendment and the executive administration’s push for state-run media messaging. “I don’t want the first draft of history to be a photograph by the official White House photographer whose job it is to make the president look good,” he said. “I want news photographers to be at that event.”
