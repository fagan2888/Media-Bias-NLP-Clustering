The Healthy Indiana Plan can keep operating until December 31, 2014, but only for a portion of its current customers.\n\nPart of Gov. Mike Pence\u2019s agreement with the Obama administration lowered the maximum income level for eligibility from 200 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) to 100 percent.\n\nHealthy Indiana Plan participants have already begun to receive their cancellation notices. \u201cEffective January 1, 2014, due to the availability of new federal programs to help pay for health insurance the income standard for the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) has been lowered to 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL),\u201d a notice sent to one Indiana resident read.\n\nResidents kicked out of the program \u201cmay want to consider applying for health coverage through the federal health insurance marketplace or through the private market,\u201d the notice reads. \u201cYou may want to visit the federal website listed above [HealthCare.gov] and fill out a federal application to determine what your costs will be.\u201d\n\nThe federal Obamacare exchange will offer subsidies to those earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nSince launching almost one month ago, HealthCare.gov has had constant technical problems. Severe malfunctions and complete outages have kept consumers from registering, looking at options and purchasing plans.\n\nJeffrey Zients, an economic official heading the administration efforts to fix the site, told reporters Friday that federal officials estimate that HealthCare.gov will be running \u201csmoothly\u201d for a majority of users by the end of the November.\n\nIf the administration pulls through and is able to fix the problems with the help of its \u201ctech surge,\u201d that will leave former Healthy Indiana patients just 15 days to find health coverage before their plans are cut off, effective December 31.\n\nIndiana is the only state that received a waiver to continue its existing Medicaid-like program to provide coverage for low-income residents. The federal government denied Indiana\u2019s first request for a waiver to keep running the Healthy Indiana Plan, but Pence persisted and won the second round.\n\nIndiana did not accept the Medicaid expansion, which would have covered up to 400,000 enrollees. Healthy Indiana currently covers around 37,000 residents, including the 11,000 who will be dropped at the end of the year.\n\nPence contends that Indiana\u2019s pilot plan works better than Medicaid at keeping costs low and helping consumers make better health care choices. He argued in September that even the uninsured in Indiana can receive care through charity programs, public and private clinics and emergency rooms.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter and Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
