Wallace led southern whites out of the Democratic Party.\n\nLater, Republicans charged Democrats with coddling black \u201cwelfare queens,\u201c being soft on black crime (\u201cWillie Horton\u201d), and trying to give jobs to less-qualified blacks over more-qualified whites (the battle over affirmative action).\n\nThe bigotry now spewing forth from Donald Trump and several of his Republican rivals is an extension of this old race card, now applied to Mexicans and Muslims \u2013 with much the same effect on the white working class voters, who don\u2019t trust Democrats to be as \u201ctough.\u201d\n\nAll true, but this isn't the whole story. Democrats also abandoned the white working class.\n\nDemocrats have occupied the White House for sixteen of the last twenty-four years, and in that time scored some important victories for working families \u2013 the Affordable Care Act, an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Family and Medical Leave Act, for example.\n\nBut they\u2019ve done nothing to change the vicious cycle of wealth and power that has rigged the economy for the benefit of those at the top, and undermined the working class. In some respects, Democrats have been complicit in it.\n\n\n\nBoth Bill Clinton and Barack Obama ardently pushed for free trade agreements, for example, without providing the millions of blue-collar workers who thereby lost their jobs any means of getting new ones that paid at least as well.\n\nThey also stood by as corporations hammered trade unions, the backbone of the white working class. Clinton and Obama failed to reform labor laws to impose meaningful penalties on companies that violated them, or enable workers to form unions with a simple up-or-down votes.\n\n\n\nI was there. In 1992, Bill Clinton promised such reform but once elected didn\u2019t want to spend political capital on it. In 2008, Barack Obama made the same promise (remember the Employee Free Choice Act?) but never acted on it.\n\nPartly as a result, union membership sunk from 22 percent of all workers when Bill Clinton was elected president to fewer than 12 percent today, and the working class lost bargaining leverage to get a share of the economy\u2019s gains.\n\nIn addition, the Obama administration protected Wall Street from the consequences of the Street\u2019s gambling addiction through a giant taxpayer-funded bailout, but let millions of underwater homeowners drown.\n\nBoth Clinton and Obama also allowed antitrust enforcement to ossify \u2013 with the result that large corporations have grown farlarger, and major industries more concentrated.\n\nFinally, they turned their backs on campaign finance reform. In 2008, Obama was the first presidential nominee since Richard Nixon to reject public financing in his primary and general-election campaigns. And he never followed up on his reelection campaign promise to pursue a constitutional amendment overturning \u201cCitizens United v. FEC,\u201d the 2010 Supreme Court opinion opening the floodgates to big money in politics.\n\n\n\nWhat happens when you combine freer trade, shrinking unions, Wall Street bailouts, growing corporate market power, and the abandonment of campaign finance reform?\n\nYou shift political and economic power to the wealthy, and you shaft the working class.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t Democrats sought to reverse this power shift? True, they faced increasingly hostile Republican congresses. But they controlled both houses of Congress in the first two years of both Clinton\u2019s and Obama\u2019s administrations.\n\nIn part, it\u2019s because Democrats bought the snake oil of the \u201csuburban swing voter\u201d \u2013 so-called \u201csoccer moms\u201d in the 1990s and affluent politically-independent professionals in the 2000s \u2013 who supposedly determine electoral outcomes.\n\nMeanwhile, as early as the 1980s they began drinking from the same campaign funding trough as the Republicans \u2013 big corporations, Wall Street, and the very wealthy.\n\n\u201cBusiness has to deal with us whether they like it or not, because we\u2019re the majority,\u201d crowed Democratic representative Tony Coelho, head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the 1980s when Democrats assumed they\u2019d continue to run the House for years.\n\n\n\nCoelho\u2019s Democrats soon achieved a rough parity with Republicans in contributions from corporate and Wall Street campaign coffers, but the deal proved a Faustian bargain as Democrats become financially dependent on big corporations and the Street.\n\nNothing in politics is ever final. Democrats could still win back the white working class \u2013 putting together a huge coalition of the working class and poor, of whites, blacks, and Latinos, of everyone who has been shafted by the shift in wealth and power to the top.\n\nThis would give Democrats the political clout to restructure the economy \u2013 rather than merely enact palliatives that papered over the increasing concentration of wealth and power in America.\n\nBut to do this Democrats would have to stop obsessing over upper-income suburban swing voters, and end their financial dependence on big corporations, Wall Street, and the wealthy.\n\nWill they? That\u2019s one of the biggest political unknowns in 2016 and beyond.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why did the white working class abandon the Democrats?\nThe conventional answer is Republicans skillfully played the race card.\nIn the wake of the Civil Rights Act, segregationists like Alabama...", "title": "Who Lost the White Working Class? | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/01/21/who_lost_the_white_working_class_129392.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/341820_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Why did the white working class abandon the Democrats?\nThe conventional answer is Republicans skillfully played the race card.\nIn the wake of the Civil Rights Act, segregationists like Alabama...", "title": "Who Lost the White Working Class? | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "Who Lost the White Working Class? | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "Election 2016,middle class,white working class,white voters,"}, "article_summary": "Democrats also abandoned the white working class.\nThey also stood by as corporations hammered trade unions, the backbone of the white working class.\nWhy did the white working class abandon the Democrats?\nDemocrats could still win back the white working class \u2013 putting together a huge coalition of the working class and poor, of whites, blacks, and Latinos, of everyone who has been shafted by the shift in wealth and power to the top.\nYou shift political and economic power to the wealthy, and you shaft the working class."}
