The film industry is a booming market in certain parts of our state. Movies filmed in North Carolina were receiving a 25% tax incentive, but this year's state budget takes that incentive away.

It has many in the industry worried about what could happen next. Chris Maney is the Director of Black Gate Pictures, which is currently filming The Hollow Oak in Onslow County. He feels like it's a giant step back.

"I feel like I'm so close to getting my foot in the door finally into the industry. Right when I'm right there, it was snagged away from me," says Maney. "They are taking our incentive away and this is causing the productions just to move."

In 2010, then-Governor Beverly Purdue signed a 25% refundable tax credit into law, hoping to attract the film industry to North Carolina. Governor Pat McCrory has made a switch for the upcoming year, allocating just $20 million to an industry that used $60 million in 2013.

Actress Samantha Katelyn says those in the industry who wanted to stay local may have to move.

"The film crews are local to North Carolina. These are people who, most of them got their degrees at UNCW and are able to work in North Carolina with film," says Katelyn. "I mean, if they don't give us our incentive it means that people who are already here, who created a life will here for film, will be moving because there is no money to be made."

According to the Motion Picture Association of America, the North Carolina film industry has employed more than 12,000 people including crews, casts and production. Recent movies filmed in the state include The Hunger Games and Iron Man 3.
