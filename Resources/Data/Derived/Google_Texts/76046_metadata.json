The bags were strewn all over the banks of the lagoon.\n\n\u201cYou get a couple of people with bags and someone raking it up and it goes pretty quickly,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cService is always good. If we can help clean up the lagoon, we will. It's a nice park.\u201d\n\nSimilar cleanups took place Saturday at Glenn Cunningham Lake and Standing Bear Lake, led by Keep Omaha Beautiful, Theiler said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "The volunteers raked plastic bags and bottles from the banks of the lagoon and spread mulch under trees as part of the cleanup that ties into Omaha's massive sewer improvement project.", "title": "Fontenelle Park cleanup draws dozens 'trying to help'", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/fontenelle-park-cleanup-draws-dozens-trying-to-help/article_0f100700-803f-556e-9014-6b8fd4bc1cc4.html", "image": {"width": 760, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/cc/fcc374a5-a34e-50f1-a005-ffe5687b5229/533309a733a16.image.jpg?resize=760%2C459", "height": 459}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news", "description": "The volunteers raked plastic bags and bottles from the banks of the lagoon and spread mulch under trees as part of the cleanup that ties into Omaha's massive sewer improvement project."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4a4c\"", "article_summary": "Plans for the park and sewer work in the surrounding north Omaha neighborhoods are still in the design phase, Theiler said.\nSponsored by Black & Veatch, one of the engineering firms working on the $2 billion sewer overhaul, the cleanup attracted more than 50 volunteers.\n\u201cWe're cleaning up the park, picking up trash from around the pond,\u201d said Matt Schultze, a project manager for Black & Veatch.\nVolunteers fanned out Saturday across Fontenelle Park, raking plastic bags and bottles from the lagoon and spreading mulch under trees as part of a cleanup that ties into Omaha's massive sewer improvement project.\nThey included company employees and teenagers from Jacobs' Place Transitional Living and North High Magnet School's engineering program."}
