Laughter and the sounds of kids playing could be heard in the air Saturday afternoon, during a special rededication of an area park. James Chaney Memorial Park use to be nothing more than a patch of land with overgrown grass, but today it's a thriving ballpark.

"The park has been here since October of 1995 and when we discovered it was just a patch of grass, we felt like that Mr. Chaney deserved better than that," Councilwoman Ward 4 Kim Houston said.

That's when the hard work went into the renovated park and for one area resident who grew up near the park, his reaction upon seeing the new park was one of praise.

"Wow, thank you, and look at God, those are my thoughts," Anthony Rhone who grew up near the park stated.

The rededication, featured prize giveaways, fried catfish, hamburgers, a kickball tournament, and just a time for kids to be kids.

"I have a job where I work with kids with behavioral problems and this is the kinds of things that we need to keep the kids away from negativity," Rhone said.

For one local group, community service is the heart of what they believe in, which prompted them to provide more in sponsoring this park rededication.

"We gave a sponsorship of $300," Stephen Wilson of Omega Psi Phi said. "The sponsorship was $250, we as Men of Omega like to go over and beyond."

What use to be a field of grass is now a field where memories can be made, and the community can enjoy the hard work put into something that was once just a patch of grass and features the name of a prominent Meridian man.

"I hope that it will spark some interest in who Mr. James Chaney was and people will do research to see he was one of the civil rights people who was part of a great movement about 50 years or so ago," Houston said.

Houston says she would like to make Saturday's event an annual one at James Chaney Memorial Park.
