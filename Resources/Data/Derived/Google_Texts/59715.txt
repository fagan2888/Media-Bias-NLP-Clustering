NEW YORK (MainStreet) — A part-time barista job at Starbucks includes health insurance. Everybody knows that, right? But did you know that lots of other part-time gigs also include company-sponsored health benefits?

In 2014 the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported nearly 1 in 4 (23%) of part-time private-sector workers got medical care benefits, notes Joe Weinlick, senior vice president of marketing for career network Beyond. Full-timers did better -- 86% of them had employer-sponsored medical benefits -- but it’s clear that part-time with benefits is no pipe dream.



“Many companies offer benefits, even to those with a part-time schedule,” Weinlick says.

If you’re looking for part-time work with benefits, the bigger the employer, the better.



“Larger companies are more likely to offer benefits, and have more employees,” Weinlick says. And be prepared to compromise. Employers who do insure part-timers generally offer them lower-quality plans than full-timers get. You may have to pay more of the monthly premium, get fewer benefits, or both, compared to full-timers.

Employers usually require part-timers to work at least 20 hours a week to earn benefits, although it may be up to 30 hours. You also may have to work there for a while -- a three- to six-month probationary period is common -- before benefits kick in.

If you can’t find a part-time job with benefits, wait a while and try again.



“There are a number of trends that are causing more companies to offer part-time benefits,” Weinlick says. In a job market increasingly tilting toward employees, employers are looking to improved benefits as a tool to attract and keep talented workers. “In addition, more companies are making social responsibility a brand tenet,” Weinlick adds. “That responsibility starts at home, by treating employees well.”
