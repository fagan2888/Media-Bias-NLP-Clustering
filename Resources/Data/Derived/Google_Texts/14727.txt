U.S. Forest Service workers were doing a timber survey in the foothills north of Boulder.

In a ravine in Geer Canyon, they found the partially buried remains of a skeleton.

It’s likely that when the body of a woman or girl was originally buried it was completely underground.

But unless animal remains are buried deep enough, scavengers will dig them up, feed on the remains and spread the bones.

In this case, Boulder County Sheriff’s investigators had a good idea whose remains were in the shallow grave.

Fourteen-year-old Longmont Junior High School student Margaret “Margo” Henriette Hillman had disappeared from an old-fashioned, cowboy-style party in a large barn at the 5,000-acre Heil Valley ranch north of Lefthand Canyon nearly a year earlier.

The last anyone had seen Margo was shortly before midnight on Sept. 24, 1983. She told her parents that a cousin had offered to give her a ride home.

Three of Margo’s cousins were supposed to take her home at 1:30 a.m. on Sept. 25. But when it came time to go home they couldn’t find Margo and believed she had found another way to get home.

They drove home without her. The next morning, their mother asked where Margo was. But the cousins didn’t know.

A search began immediately.

Family members returned to the barn, and searched the large wooded territory around it.
