Let’s say you were to fall off the ladder while putting up your trademark, Clark Griswold-style Christmas lights. You’re rushed to the emergency room, evaluated, and stabilized. Then the hospital has several options: They can send you home or admit you as an inpatient for further treatment. But increasingly, hospitals are shuffling older patients to a third alternative, a category called "observation status" under which patients are monitored (and often treated) by doctors, but never formally “admitted” in the eyes of either the hospital or the insurer.

As it turns out, this classification is great for hospitals, but it can be far more expensive for patients.

Between 2001 and 2009, Medicare claims for observation status rose 100 percent, according to a recent report from the public policy arm of the AARP, and the rise was greatest for longer observation stays of 48 hours or more.

So why the uptick?

Patients under observation often have the same ailments that admitted inpatients do, but hospitals see observation as more efficient than inpatient care, since it frees up doctors and nurses to tend to sicker patients. The AARP also observed a 16 percent decline in the number of inpatient stays, especially one-day stays, during the same nine-year time period, suggesting that hospitals have been substituting inpatient stays for observation.

But on top of that, insurance regulators have been cracking down on short inpatient stays. Starting in 2005, auditors have been reviewing such claims to ensure their “medical necessity,” the AARP researchers write, which may have spooked hospitals into using the less-scrutinized observation status.
