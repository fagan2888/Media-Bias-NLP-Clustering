The Marine Corps really, really wants the ship, which would be designated LPD-28. And of course shipbuilder Huntington-Ingalls really, really wants the contract, which would help fill a multi-year gap in amphib construction.\n\nBut the Navy\u2019s top acquisition official, Sean Stackley, made clear today the service dares not sign that contract until it\u2019s confident that it will eventually get full funding to buy the ship, over $2 billion. Congress already voted $243 million \u201cadvanced funding\u201d for fiscal year 2013, and House authorizers and Senate appropriators have proposed $800 million in \u201cincremental funding\u201d for fiscal year 2015. Senate authorizers proposed $650 million, while House appropriators did not vote any money for LPD-28, so the final figure is much in doubt. \u201cWe appreciate your support,\u201d Assistant Secretary Stackley told the House Seapower subcommittee this morning, but even if the full $800 million is approved for 2015, and even adding in the quarter-billion from 2013, \u201cwe are still a billion-plus short.\u201d\n\nEspecially with the prospect of sequestration cuts looming over budgets for 2016 and beyond, Stackley is far from sure that the missing billion-plus will ever materialize. If the Navy could find that much additional money, he said bluntly, \u201cwe have other bills that are frankly higher-priority, [e.g.] the refueling of the carrier\u201d USS George Washington.\n\nIn fact, Stackley made clear to reporters after the hearing that the Navy would rather repurpose some of the LPD-28 funding to invest in cost-reduction efforts for future amphibious warships across the board. That would include not only LPDs but the \u201cbig-deck\u201d LHA-8, a much larger and more expensive ship, and most importantly the as-yet-undesigned LX(R) series, meant to be less capable but more affordable.\n\nThe Navy and Marines recently finished the second iteration of an in-depth Analysis Of Alternatives (AOA) for LX(R), meant to replace the aging . Options officially on the table are\n\nan economy version of the expensive San Antonio , which Huntington-Ingalls is naturally pushing; a modified foreign design built under license in the US, a long shot given both \u201cbuy America\u201d politics and Navy survivability standards; a completely new \u201cclean sheet of paper\u201d design, with all the cost and schedule uncertainties involved; and what Stackley called a \u201chybrid\u201d solution in which the LSD would be replaced, not by a new amphib, but by a mix of vessels, including less combat-capable but cheaper support craft such as the Joint High Speed Vessel , the Mobile Landing Platform , and the Afloat Forward Staging Base .\n\nBoth the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine are personally involved in reviewing the AOA, Stackley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get this thing inside the box in terms of those cost figures, [and] we\u2019re not there yet\u2026.There\u2019ll be a third pass and there might need to be a fourth pass.\u201d\n\nThat struggle for affordability is what makes repurposing the LPD-28 funds so attractive.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of money locked up for, potentially, an LPD-28,\u201d Stackley told reporters. But they can\u2019t spend it because it\u2019s not enough for the whole ship and \u201cyou have to show the money in your budget on how you\u2019re going to complete a ship before you place it under contract,\u201d he said. Signing a contract you\u2019re not sure you can fully pay for not only violates Defense Department policy, he said, it potentially breaks the law.\n\n(The statute in question, the Anti-Deficiency Act, is a complex tissue of exceptions, however. [UPDATED: House Armed Services Committee staff have told me they believe the Act is a non-issue here]).\n\nAcross the board, with LPD-28, LHA-8, and LX(R), \u201cwe need to invest in affordable designs, and we have this money sitting here,\u201d Stackley said. \u201cIf we could tap into that,\u201d the Navy could fund work with industry to reduce costs across all three classes, for example by using common components. Though Stackley didn\u2019t say so specifically, the money could also be invested in reducing overhead and increasing efficiency at the shipyards.\n\nThe problem with this plan is that it\u2019s currently illegal. \u201cThey appropriated the dollars for an LPD-28,\u201d Stackley acknowledged, \u201cand to use those dollars to go after design on say on say an LHA-8\u2026.we\u2019d need Congress to authorize and appropriate that.\u201d\n\nAs important as amphibs are, it\u2019s important to emphasize that carriers take precedence. For all the uncertainty and anxiety over a potential LPD-28, the Navy is even more anxious \u2014 although a little less uncertain \u2014 about the aircraft carrier George Washington, whose nuclear reactor needs a mid-life refueling if the ship is to stay in service. Multiple committees have voted to partially fund the overhaul, and the Navy\u2019s now confident enough it is spending money to plan the refueling phase, Stackley said. But even this top-priority program may not get full funding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting to see what tone Congress takes with regard to sequestration,\u201d Stackley told reporters, \u201cbut it\u2019s highly unlikely we\u2019ll have a clear understanding before we need to submit the \u201916 budget [early next year].\u201d That means Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel (and ultimately the President) will have to make a call \u201cwithout having had a clear determination by Congress.\u201d That\u2019s a polite way of saying that Hagel will have to roll the dice.\n\nThat\u2019s the huge question mark that looms over every federal program in the coming months.
