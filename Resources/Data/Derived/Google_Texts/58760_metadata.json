He was taken by ambulance to University of Colorado Hospital where he died, according to a medical examiner\u2019s news release.\n\nThe incident started around 8:46 p.m. Monday when Aurora police officers spotted a stolen Jeep Cherokee on East Colfax Avenue, according to police reports. Police had been searching for the stolen vehicle for a week after a driver had eluded police after appearing to bait police into a chase. However, police department policy bars car chases under most circumstances and officers would back off.\n\nOfficers located the stolen Jeep on Monday at 11:36 p.m. in the convenience store parking lot, and a patrol officer used his car to block it into a parking space.\n\nLieth then began ramming the police car and the building with the Jeep as he tried to escape, police said.\n\nSix people were inside the store and a propane tank cage was against the storefront, police said. One Aurora police officer was positioned between the building, the propane cage and a Red Box movie dispenser.\n\nPolice and store patron lives were in danger, the Aurora police said in a news release and during a news conference.\n\nTwo police officers fired at Lieth.\n\nLieth graduated from Cherry Creek High School in 2010, one of his friends told The Denver Post. He also had attended South High School.\n\nFithum Gebre, 26, said he met Lieth at South and had maintained a friendship over the years.\n\n\u201cHe used to be a smart guy in high school,\u201d Gebre said.\n\nGebre said he never had met any of Lieth\u2019s family and did not know anything about them. He often loaned money to his old friend, who would call and say he was hungry.\n\nGebre loaned Lieth $20 on Monday so he could eat. Hours later, another friend called to say Lieth had been shot by police.\n\nThe incident was not completely surprising, Gebre said, because his old friend had started running with the wrong crowd.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really, really sad,\u201d Gebre said.\n\nLieth was on parole from the Colorado Department of Corrections.\n\nHis criminal convictions include motor vehicle theft in 2013 in Ada,s County. He also had been charged with motor vehicle theft in Denver.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Denver police reported a caller had phoned in a tip about people associated with Lieth who were threatening to kill police officers in retaliation. The threat was not substantiated but officers were put on alert.\n\nThe officers who were involved with the altercation with Lieth are on paid administrative leave, pending an investigation by the Denver Police Department. Their names have not been released. The Denver District Attorney\u2019s Office will review the case to determine whether criminal charges should be sought against the officers.\n\nOne of the officers involved is a 12-year department veteran and has been involved in one prior shooting. The second officer has been at the department for two years and has prior law enforcement experience. He has not been involved in any other police shootings, the Aurora police said.\n\nMonday\u2019s shooting was the 15th involving Front Range police firing at suspects since Halloween. It was third officer-involved shooting for the Aurora Police Department in less than two weeks.\n\nNoelle Phillips: 303-954-1661, nphillips@denverpost.com or @Noelle_Phillips", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Man killed in Aurora police shooting identified as Chan Lieth", "title": "Man killed in Aurora police shooting identified as Chan Lieth", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/24/man-killed-in-aurora-police-shooting-identified-as-chan-lieth/", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224_055022_chan-lieth.jpg", "height": 275}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224_055022_chan-lieth.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-24T14:50:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:40:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Denver medical examiner has identified the man killed by Aurora police earlier this week as 25-year-old Chan Lieth, a man with a history of auto theft.\nPolice had been searching for the stolen vehicle for a week after a driver had eluded police after appearing to bait police into a chase.\nOne of the officers involved is a 12-year department veteran and has been involved in one prior shooting.\nIt was third officer-involved shooting for the Aurora Police Department in less than two weeks.\nLieth graduated from Cherry Creek High School in 2010, one of his friends told The Denver Post."}
