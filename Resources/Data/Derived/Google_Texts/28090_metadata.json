Town director of projects Scott Liggett says that\u2019s about $1.7 million worth.\n\nThe storms carved 13-foot-high cliffs out of the dunes on one beach, and entire stretches of dry sand disappeared in some areas. But Liggett says none of the erosion is considered an emergency.\n\nAbout 2.2 million cubic yards of sand will be pumped onto the island\u2019s major beaches over four months, beginning by February.\n\nMayor David Bennett says the project\u2019s timing is very fortunate.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Island Packet, http://www.islandpacket.com\n\n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
