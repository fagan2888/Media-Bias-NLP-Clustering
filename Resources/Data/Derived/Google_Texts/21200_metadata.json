Or, simply put, \u201chow do I get the biggest bang for my buck\u201d?\n\nThere are myriad ways that you, and a host of other people in your organization, can spend money on marketing your services, products and organization generally: Community events, trade shows, advertising, social media, direct sales or networking, public relations. The list goes on forever.\n\nDetermining the right mix of strategies and tactics to deliver the best ROI can be overwhelming. Tracking and measuring the effectiveness and success of your marketing efforts can be confusing as well. How do you measure awareness levels? Did the event result in leads or sales? Should I even expect to see results in the first year? Is social media necessary? How does all of this work together? Is my brand effective?\n\nWhile planning isn\u2019t always the \u201csexiest\u201d part of marketing communications and most of us creative beings want to move quickly to the concept and development phase, effective marketing communications are always a result of a sound strategy. No way around it. The planning and strategy has to come first. If you don\u2019t proceed this way, then you run the risk of building your program on a bad foundation. This can be costly and very time consuming.\n\nIt\u2019s always more efficient and effective to do it right the first time, developing the strategy prior to the creative development or outreach. Putting dollars towards building a solid brand is much more efficient, for example, than having to spend resources on undoing inappropriate messaging or bad public relations.\n\nEssentials of a good marketing plan include analysis (including target audience identification), measurable objectives and strategies, messaging, tactical plan with rollout strategy and metrics. There are a number of ways to develop your strategy or plan. I\u2019ve found the most effective approach to be one that starts with leadership and then involves key staff members to build consensus and ownership along the way.\n\nSome of our most successful campaigns and brands are ones that incorporated facilitated meetings to not only arrive at important messaging such as the brand positioning statement, but also to build consensus and ownership around the strategy and emerging brand.\n\nAnd yes, the tactical options can be overwhelming especially if you haven\u2019t clearly defined your target audiences or what you\u2019re trying to achieve. The best plans, by the way, integrate all marketing and communications activities and utilize a number of strategies and tactics to get results.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for the ROI question to get lost in the fray of all the excitement and \u201ctrying on\u201d of different ideas within an organization. The hype around the latest greatest tactics, such as social media for example, or great creative concepts or ideas from well meaning staffers can capture even the most grounded leader\u2019s attention and focus.\n\nSuccessful integration of tactics to connect you with your audience have to be carefully evaluated and integrated into the overall bigger picture, which starts with a clear understanding of \u201cwhere you are, where you\u2019re going, and how you\u2019re going to get there\u201d.\n\nCindy Thomas Wright owns a strategic marketing and communications firm, Thomas Wright Partners, that works with leaders in healthcare, industry and government to develop brands and programs that build consensus, grow business and effect change.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/getting-big-roi-your-healthcare-marketing-dollars", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "While it might not be the first question anyone with a stake in marketing their health system, practice or company, asks, the one thing that's really on their minds is how to get the most for their marketing and communications efforts and budget.", "title": "Getting big ROI for your healthcare marketing dollars"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "description": "While it might not be the first question anyone with a stake in marketing their health system, practice or company, asks, the one thing that's really on their minds is how to get the most for their marketing and communications efforts and budget.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Getting big ROI for your healthcare marketing dollars"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "While it might not be the first question a CEO, CFO or anyone with a stake in marketing their health system, practice or company, asks me, the one thing that\u2019s really on their minds is how to get the most for their marketing and communications efforts and budget.
