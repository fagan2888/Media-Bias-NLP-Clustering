But many lack access to medical care to address the health needs that come with aging.\n\nLike a lot of people who live in Savannah, Craig Rupert was drawn to the city by its beauty and historic charm. He says he saw a special about the city on public television and was dazzled by the images of the downtown area and River Street.\n\n\u201cIt was awesome. I said, you gotta be kidding me. I knew kinda where Savannah was at, but\u2026.I was like, man, if I ever get a chance I\u2019m gonna go to Savannah check it out,\u201d he says.\n\nRupert, 53, says he saw his chance after the farm where he was working in Alabama was sold. He sold his tractor and some furniture and moved to Savannah about 18 months ago, he says. But Rupert says the money ran out and he found himself homeless, living under a bridge on the edge of downtown.\n\nResidents of the camps depend on fires to keep warm at night, leading to what Rupert calls a recent \u201cfreak accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just tripped one night, coming out of my tent \u2026 and my hand just went right into the firepit,\u201d he says.\n\nRupert wound up with third-degree burns on his hand and forearm \u2013 bad enough, he says, to send him to a doctor for the first time in more than a year.\n\nOn a recent morning, he got a visit from Diane Daman, a retired nurse who\u2019s working with the Chatham-Savannah Authority for the Homeless to reach out to medically fragile people living in tents. Rupert says he struggles to keep his hand clean because it\u2019s still painful to touch.\n\nThe Homeless Authority\u2019s executive director, Cindy Murphy-Kelley, says her teams routinely visit Savannah\u2019s tent camps. But this year, they\u2019re adding the medical component; they go out twice per month to check blood pressure and offer first aid supplies, blankets, and clean socks.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that folks keep their feet dry who are living in the camps, so that we don\u2019t have issues with sores on their feet,\u201d she says.\n\nThe teams can take those who need immediate care to a low-cost clinic, or call 911.\n\nAbout 300 people live outdoors in Savannah, and Murphy-Kelly estimates 60 percent are 50 or older. She says that\u2019s creating a growing need for medical attention for people living in the camps. Some older residents should be in assisted living, she says, but lack insurance, family support, and other resources to help them navigate the health system\n\n\u201cThey are at high risk for death in the camps, and we want to be able to serve those folks,\u201d she says.\n\nShelters and clinics around the country are seeing more seniors among the homeless, says John Lozier, executive director of the National Health Care for the Homeless Council.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the aging of the Baby Boomers,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the group that is the most vulnerable to the economic conditions that we have now. It is so easy for somebody with limited resources to lose what they have.\u201d\n\nLozier says his organization\u2019s member clinics are seeing what he calls \u201cdramatic\u201d growth in patients age 50 or older; the number jumped from 18 to 32 percent between 2002 and 2013.\n\nIn states like Georgia, which have declined to expand the federal Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act, Lozier says social service groups have to rely on existing resources.\n\nFew of the homeless patients at Savannah\u2019s J.C. Lewis Primary Healthcare Center qualify for programs like Medicaid, says the CEO, Aretha Jones. More than half of the clinic\u2019s patients are homeless. Patients are charged on a sliding fee scale based on income.\n\n\u201cWe may be able to qualify some of them for Medicaid if some of their medical issues become extreme,\u201d Jones says. \u201cAnd then we see some mental health or substance abuse issues, especially mental health, we may be able to get some things qualified in that area.\u201d\n\nUp against those challenges, groups that work with the homeless are trying to meet the growing need largely with donations and volunteers. Murphy-Kelley says her organization will be making medical visits to the camps twice per month.", "article_metadata": {"meta_title": "For Savannah's Elderly And Homeless, Medical Care Can Be Out Of Reach", "medium": "News", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Georgia Public Broadcasting", "description": "As the Baby Boomers get older, advocates for the homeless say they\u2019re seeing more elderly people living in shelters or outdoors.
