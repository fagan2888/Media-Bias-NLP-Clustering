This version has been corrected.\n\nHeritage Foundation President Jim DeMint participates in a question-and-answer session Aug. 22 after speaking to attendees during Heritage Action for America\u2019s \u201cdefund Obamacare\u201d meeting at the Marriott in Franklin, Tenn. (Luke Sharrett/For The Washington Post)\n\nIt was a sleepy night in this historic town south of Nashville, but inside the ballroom of the local Marriott hotel, Michael Needham had more than 800 conservative activists on their feet.\n\n\u201cCan we defund Obamacare?\u201d he called out.\n\n\u201cYes, we can!\u201d the crowd shouted back.\n\nThe rally was not the work of a tea party group or the local Republican congressman. Instead, it was produced by Heritage Action for America, the new advocacy arm of the venerable Heritage Foundation that is emerging as one of the most pugilistic forces on the right.\n\nSuch red-meat, campaign-style events have boosted Heritage\u2019s standing with tea party activists, but they have also alienated many of the group\u2019s longtime Republican allies on Capitol Hill. On Wednesday, Heritage Action came out against President Obama\u2019s proposal to launch military action against Syria, putting the group at odds with House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) and other GOP leaders who back the strikes.\n\nView Graphic As of Sept. 4, lawmakers appear to be tentatively dividing into four camps over military action in Syria.\n\nThe Republican Study Committee, a group of the most conservative House members, recently barred Heritage analysts from its weekly strategy meetings, where they had played a central role for years, according to multiple people familiar with the episode. The move came after noisy disputes over a farm bill and other legislation, which left many lawmakers feeling blindsided by Heritage\u2019s positions.\n\n\u201cI pay no attention to Heritage Action,\u201d said Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), who has accused the group of \u201cdestroying the Republican Party\u201d with its push to strip funding for Obamacare. \u201cThey\u2019ve become a purely partisan group that never asks anybody\u2019s opinion.\u201d\n\nSince its founding in the 1970s, Heritage made its mark primarily as a purveyor of conservative ideas, exercising influence through dense policy papers and expert testimony. But through its new Heritage Action arm, the group is transforming itself into an overtly political force \u2014 scoring legislators on key votes, training \u201csentinels\u201d to track lawmakers\u2019 activities and marshaling loud rallies aimed at forcing Republicans to act.\n\nLast month, the group roused the base with a series of packed \u201cDefund Obamacare\u201d meetings around the country featuring Needham, chief executive of Heritage Action, and former U.S. senator Jim DeMint, the new president of the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cFolks, we can\u2019t allow this plague to come onto the American people,\u201d DeMint told the audience in Franklin, which murmured its assent.\n\nHeritage veterans\u2019 exit\n\nThe shift toward political activism has dismayed some longtime Heritage scholars; more than half a dozen have left in recent months. But Heritage officials say the mission of the think tank has not changed and note that it has a long track record of disagreement with Republican leaders.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing more research and policy work than we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d DeMint told reporters before the Franklin rally. \u201cThe only difference is now that we have a sister organization that is taking those ideas to the people and Congress in a more aggressive way.\u201d\n\nStill, the campaign to threaten a government shutdown Oct. 1, unless Obama agrees to strip funding from his signature health law, marks a dramatic departure from what former employees call \u201cthe old Heritage.\u201d Until recently, those staffers said, the think tank was reluctant to even place scolding editorials in local newspapers.\n\nNow, representatives of the advocacy arm are traveling the country in an attempt to pressure lawmakers to vote against funding the government in the new fiscal year unless the bill also halts spending for Obamacare. Top GOP aides believe the proposal has little chance of success and is likely to backfire.\n\nBoehner has promoted a different strategy aimed at challenging House Democrats to take a stand on controversial parts of the health-care law in a series of votes. Meanwhile, liberal groups have played up the possibility that GOP hostility to Obamacare could shut down the government: Americans United for Change followed Heritage Action on its tour last month, staging counter-events highlighting the law\u2019s benefits.\n\nGOP strategist Brian J. Walsh, a former communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said the Heritage approach is encouraging \u201cfratricide\u201d within the party. \u201cThere are a number of people who are frustrated, because what may be good for Heritage Action\u2019s fundraising or growing its mailing list is not necessarily good for the Republican Party heading into 2014,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong the conservative lawmakers in the group\u2019s crosshairs is Rep. Renee L. Ellmers of North Carolina, who voted 40 times to defund or dismantle the health-care law. But Ellmers believes the Heritage plan is unworkable, and was among 100 House Republicans targeted by Heritage Action last month with online ads.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve used bully tactics, and they\u2019re going way beyond the scope of promoting conservative ideology,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are now trying to influence members of Congress through what I consider very threatening actions.\u201d\n\nEllmers said she relied on Heritage Foundation research when she was first elected in 2010 but no longer: \u201cTo me, it is tainted.\u201d\n\nHeritage Action officials say the politicians who are complaining simply do not want to be held accountable for their conservative pledges.\n\n\u201cWe understand that people are upset,\u201d said Tim Chapman, the advocacy group\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cThis does hit them where it hurts.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Heritage has faced blowback from Republicans. The foundation was founded by Paul Weyrich and Edwin Feulner in 1973 to have a more aggressive presence on Capitol Hill than the conservative think tanks of the time. Since then, Heritage has weathered numerous clashes with GOP leaders unhappy with its policy pronouncements, including officials in the Reagan White House and both Bush administrations.\n\n\u201cThis is not new: We get into battles with our friends,\u201d said Phillip Truluck, the foundation\u2019s longtime executive vice president.\n\nThe creation of Heritage Action in 2010 meant \u201csome changes for us, no doubt about that,\u201d he added. \u201cBut primarily, we are still and always going to be a research institution. The tail is not wagging the dog here.\u201d\n\nHeritage officials said the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 crystallized the need to engage explicitly in political advocacy, which the foundation, as a 501(c)(3) charity, cannot do. (Some key components of the law, including an individual mandate to buy insurance, were once embraced by Heritage research; the group has since disavowed the idea.)\n\nHeritage Action, a 501(c)(4) \u201csocial welfare\u201d group, was seen as a way to harness the rising tea party movement and provide a vehicle for Heritage to press its arguments without having to register its analysts as lobbyists, according to current and former staffers.\n\nThe advocacy group quickly began issuing \u201ckey vote\u201d pronouncements, scoring lawmakers and contacting voters in Republican districts. Hometown activists, dubbed sentinels, are tasked with raising the alarm when incumbents stray from what Heritage considers conservative orthodoxy.\n\nHeritage Action jumped into the foreign policy arena Wednesday when it declared there was \u201cnot a vital U.S. interest at stake\u201d in attacking Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons. That stands in sharp contrast with recent statements from Heritage analysts, including several who called for urgent action on Syria last November and said the United States should \u201cwork closely with allies to accelerate the fall of the Assad regime.\u201d\n\nDeMint makes his mark\n\nIn its latest anti-Obamacare campaign, Heritage Action has coordinated closely with the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political action committee started by DeMint and run by one of his former advisers. The group is airing radio ads attacking Senate Republicans who do not support the defunding plan.\n\nThe arrival this year of DeMint as the foundation\u2019s president \u2014 succeeding Feulner, who held the post for 36 years \u2014 accelerated a cultural shift within the institution, according to several former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the group\u2019s inner workings.\n\nThe former South Carolina senator was a tea party leader who frequently clashed with his GOP colleagues. At Heritage, DeMint brought in a team of young acolytes who \u201cwere absolutely convinced that you were a sellout, and they wanted to do serious work to make sure we were ideologically centered,\u201d said one former policy analyst.\n\nAnother former staffer who left for Capitol Hill said: \u201cHeritage Action was sold to us as a small group that would give fire to the organization. Now, it\u2019s taken over the entire foundation.\u201d\n\nThe group has experienced a wave of departures to Capitol Hill and rival think tanks in recent months, losing its top statistician, its chief lobbyist, a senior tax analyst, a key retirement expert and a Latin America expert. Heritage Vice President Matthew Spalding announced last month that he was decamping for conservative Hillsdale College, where he will become vice president and dean of educational programs in Washington.\n\nTruluck said that the think tank\u2019s rate of turnover is consistent with past years and that DeMint fully supports independent analysis. \u201cThere has been no change in our policy direction,\u201d he said. \u201cZero.\u201d\n\nStill, DeMint has clearly brought a new feistiness to the group. In Tennessee, he drew the largest cheers of the night when he declared that \u201cthe president just has a different set of beliefs about our country than we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure in his heart he believes he\u2019s helping,\u201d DeMint added, prompting boos and shouts of \u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be nice, okay?\u201d he responded.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want nice!\u201d a man shouted from the audience.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d DeMint said, chuckling. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want nice.\u201d\n\nMontgomery reported from Washington.
