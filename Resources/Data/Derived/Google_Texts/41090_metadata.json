I know. Only a RINO or a (Trumphradites may insert preferred epithet for thinking Republicans here) would claim that the House omnibus spending bill contains anything conservatives can applaud. It does, nonetheless, include such a provision. As Ronald Reagan \u2014 who signed several omnibus bills himself \u2014 famously said, facts are stubborn things. And one of the most intransigent facts about this bill is that it imposes a deadly dose of fiscal restraint on Obamacare. It requires the law\u2019s \u201crisk corridor\u201d program to remain budget neutral. This is far more dangerous to the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d than most observers realize.\n\nSpecifically, it thwarts the Obama administration\u2019s plan to indiscriminately use taxpayer funds to revive Obamacare\u2019s moribund insurance exchanges. These \u201cmarketplaces\u201d are facing extinction because they have failed to hit their enrollment goals and the individuals who have signed up are far sicker, on average, than expected. Thus, insurers selling coverage through the exchanges are incurring unsustainable losses. Obamacare\u2019s risk corridor program is a corporate redistribution scheme whereby the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would, in theory, use excess profits made by some insurers to cover losses incurred by others.\n\nNo one really believed that this would work. It was all too predictable that most insurers selling coverage through the exchanges would incur serious losses. Consequently, during negotiations leading up to last year\u2019s spending bill, Senator Marco Rubio . led a successful effort to insert language that forbade HHS to use general appropriations or Medicare funding to finance the risk corridor program. This saved the taxpayers $2.5 billion. As the New York Times reports, \u201cLosses were so steep that insurance-company requests for risk corridor payments were $2.9 billion, compared with only $362 million paid into the program by profitable plans.\u201d\n\nThe budget neutral language is also included in this year\u2019s much-maligned omnibus bill, and it has led to apocalyptic predictions by a variety of commentators. Marc Thiessen at the Washington Post, for example, describes the Rubio provision thus: \u201ca poison pill that is killing Obamacare from within.\u201d This is not an exaggeration. The restriction on using general funds, as the Times piece goes on to point out, means that HHS can pay \u201conly 13 percent of what insurance companies were expecting to receive this year.\u201d Faced with this kind of \u201cassistance\u201d from the risk corridor program, most major insurers will abandon the exchanges.\n\nIndeed, some major insurers are already heading for the lifeboats. UnitedHealth Group announced last month that it \u201chas pulled back on its marketing efforts for individual exchange products in 2016\u201d and is mulling whether \u201cit can continue to serve the public exchange markets in 2017.\u201d And UnitedHealth is by no means the only major insurer to lose money in Obamacare\u2019s \u201cmarketplaces.\u201d Bloomberg reports, \u201cAnthem and Aetna are two of the biggest players [in the exchanges]. Like UnitedHealth, neither has had financial success there \u2014 Aetna has said it\u2019s losing money, while Anthem is making less than it would like.\u201d\n\nThe shareholders of these two corporations will soon lose patience with Obamacare participation as they watch the value of their investments go south. Phrases like \u201closing money\u201d and \u201cmaking less than we would like\u201d don\u2019t make for enjoyable reading in a quarterly earnings report. And, according to a November report from the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, only 35 percent of the insurers participating in Obamacare made money in 2014. When the final 2015 figures come in they will further erode \u201cconfidence in the durability of President Obama\u2019s signature health law,\u201d as the Times phrases it in the piece quoted above.\n\nSo, even if its risk corridor restrictions were the only useful feature of the omnibus, one could argue that the damage done to Obamacare outweighs the bill\u2019s admittedly numerous flaws. But it also delays implementation of the infamous HIT, medical device, and Cadillac taxes. Some conservatives claim that these delays will somehow make Obamacare\u2019s future more secure, an odd argument coming from a group of people who have bitterly complained about these taxes for six years. In reality, it is \u201creform\u2019s\u201d supporters who should be worried about the implications of these delays in a post-Obama political environment. And they are.\n\nThe Hill reports, \u201cObamacare advocates are growing fearful that several key taxes frozen in Wednesday\u2019s budget deal will never go into effect\u2026 they\u2019re worried that the delay of these taxes, until after Obama leaves office, will ultimately lead to their demise.\u201d This is a valid concern. Unless the GOP is dumb enough to bestow its presidential nomination on Donald Trump, whom Hillary would beat like dirty rug, these taxes are goners. This would certainly be true if Rubio gets the Republican nomination. Unlike the braying billionaire, the author of the risk corridor restrictions can win and would sign a full repeal bill.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "article_summary": "It requires the law\u2019s \u201crisk corridor\u201d program to remain budget neutral.\nled a successful effort to insert language that forbade HHS to use general appropriations or Medicare funding to finance the risk corridor program.\nUnlike the braying billionaire, the author of the risk corridor restrictions can win and would sign a full repeal bill.\nSo, even if its risk corridor restrictions were the only useful feature of the omnibus, one could argue that the damage done to Obamacare outweighs the bill\u2019s admittedly numerous flaws.\nAnd one of the most intransigent facts about this bill is that it imposes a deadly dose of fiscal restraint on Obamacare."}
