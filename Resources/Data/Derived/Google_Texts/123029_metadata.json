Arguably the most important sci-fi writer of his generation, Gibson\u2019s cyber-noir imagination has shaped everything from the Matrix aesthetic to geek culture to the way we conceptualize virtual reality. In a 1982 short story, Gibson coined the term \u201ccyberspace.\u201d Two years later, his first and most famous novel, \u201cNeuromancer,\u201d helped launch the cyberpunk genre. By the 1990s, Gibson was writing about big data, imagining Silk Road-esque Internet enclaves, and putting his characters on reality TV shows \u2014 a full four years before the first episode of \u201cBig Brother.\u201d\n\nPrescience is flashy, but Gibson is less an oracle than a kind of speculative sociologist. A very contemporary flavor of dislocation seems to be his specialty. Gibson\u2019s heroes shuttle between wildly discordant worlds: virtual paradises and physical squalor; digital landscapes and crumbling cities; extravagant wealth and poverty.\n\nIn his latest novel, \u201cThe Peripheral,\u201d which came out on Tuesday, Gibson takes this dislocation to new extremes. Set in mid-21st century Appalachia and far-in-the-future London, \u201cThe Peripheral\u201d is partly a murder mystery, and partly a time-travel mind-bender. Gibson\u2019s characters aren\u2019t just dislocated in space, now. They\u2019ve become unhinged from history.\n\nBorn in South Carolina, Gibson has lived in Vancouver since the 1960s. Over the phone, we spoke about surveillance, celebrity and the concept of the eternal now.\n\nYou\u2019re famous for writing about hackers, outlaws and marginal communities. But one of the heroes of \u201cThe Peripheral\u201d is a near-omniscient intelligence agent. She has surveillance powers that the NSA could only dream of. Should I be surprised to see you portray that kind of character so positively?\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s complicated, because she is this kind of terrifying secret police person in the service of a ruthless global kleptocracy. At the same time, she seems to be slightly insane and rather nice. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have my serious purposes with her, but at the same time she\u2019s something of a comic turn.\n\nHer official role is supposed to be completely terrifying, but at the same time her role is not a surprise. It\u2019s not like, \u201cWow, I never even knew that that existed.\u201d\n\nMost of the characters in \u201cThe Peripheral\u201d assume that they\u2019re being monitored at all times. That assumption is usually correct. As a reader, I was disconcerted by how natural this state of constant surveillance felt to me.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it would have been possible 30 years ago to convey that sense to the reader effectively, without the reader already having some sort of cultural module in place that can respond to that. If we had somehow been able to read this text 30 years ago, I don\u2019t know how we would even register that. It would be a big thing for a reader to get their head around without a lot of explaining. It\u2019s a scary thing, the extent to which I don\u2019t have to explain why [the characters] take that surveillance for granted. Everybody just gets it.\n\nYou\u2019re considered a founder of the cyberpunk genre, which tends to feature digital cowboys \u2014 independent operators working on the frontiers of technology. Is the counterculture ethos of cyberpunk still relevant in an era when the best hackers seem to be working for the Chinese and U.S. governments, and our most famous digital outlaw, Edward Snowden, is under the protection of Vladimir Putin?\n\nIt\u2019s seemed to me for quite a while now that the most viable use for the term \u201ccyberpunk\u201d is in describing artifacts of popular culture. You can say, \u201cDid you see this movie? No? Well, it\u2019s really cyberpunk.\u201d Or, \u201cDid you see the cyberpunk pants she was wearing last night?\u201d\n\nPeople know what you\u2019re talking about, but it doesn\u2019t work so well describing human roles in the world today. We\u2019re more complicated. I think one of the things I did in my early fiction, more or less for effect, was to depict worlds where there didn\u2019t really seem to be much government. In \u201cNeuromancer,\u201d for example, there\u2019s no government really on the case of these rogue AI experiments that are being done by billionaires in orbit. If I had been depicting a world in which there were governments and law enforcement, I would have depicted hackers on both sides of the fence.\n\nIn \u201cNeuromancer,\u201d I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence of anybody who has any parents. It\u2019s kind of a very adolescent book that way.\n\nIn \u201cThe Peripheral,\u201d governments are involved on both sides of the book\u2019s central conflict. Is that a sign that you\u2019ve matured as a writer? Or are you reflecting changes in how governments operate?\n\nI hope it\u2019s both. This book probably has, for whatever reason, more of my own, I guess I could now call it adult, understanding of how things work. Which, I suspect, is as it should be. People in this book live under governments, for better or worse, and have parents, for better or worse.\n\nIn 1993, you wrote an influential article about Singapore for Wired magazine, in which you wondered whether the arrival of new information technology would make the country more free, or whether Singapore would prove that \u201cit is possible to flourish through the active repression of free expression.\u201d With two decades of perspective, do you feel like this question has been answered?\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know, actually. The question was, when I asked it, naive. I may have posed innocently a false dichotomy, because some days when you\u2019re looking out at the Internet both things are possible simultaneously, in the same place.\n\nSo what do you think is a better way to phrase that question today? Or what would have been a better way to phrase it in 1993?\n\nI think you would end with something like \u201cor is this just the new normal?\u201d\n\nIs there anything about \u201cthe new normal\u201d in particular that surprises you? What about the Internet today would you have been least likely to foresee?\n\nIt\u2019s incredible, the ubiquity. I definitely didn\u2019t foresee the extent to which we would all be connected almost all of the time without needing to be plugged in.\n\nThat makes me think of \u201cNeuromancer,\u201d in which the characters are always having to track down a physical jack, which they then use to plug themselves into this hyper-futuristic Internet.\n\nYes. It\u2019s funny, when the book was first published, when it was just out \u2014 and it was not a big deal the first little while it was out, it was just another paperback original \u2014 I went to a science fiction convention. There were guys there who were, by the standards of 1984, far more computer-literate than I was. And they very cheerfully told me that I got it completely wrong, and I knew nothing. They kept saying over and over, \u201cThere\u2019s never going to be enough bandwidth, you don\u2019t understand. This could never happen.\u201d\n\nSo, you know, here I am, this many years later with this little tiny flat thing in my hand that\u2019s got more bandwidth than those guys thought was possible for a personal device to ever have, and the book is still resonant for at least some new readers, even though it\u2019s increasingly hung with the inevitable obsolescence of having been first published in 1984. Now it\u2019s not really in the pale, but in the broader outline.\n\nYou wrote \u201cNeuromancer\u201d on a 1927 Hermes typewriter. In an essay of yours from the mid-1990s, you specifically mention choosing not to use email. Does being a bit removed from digital culture help you critique it better? Or do you feel that you\u2019re immersed in that culture, now?\n\nI no longer have the luxury of being as removed from it as I was then. I was waiting for it to come to me. When I wrote [about staying off email], there was a learning curve involved in using email, a few years prior to the Web.\n\nAs soon as the Web arrived, I was there, because there was no learning curve. The interface had been civilized, and I\u2019ve basically been there ever since. But I think I actually have a funny kind of advantage, in that I\u2019m not generationally of [the Web]. Just being able to remember the world before it, some of the perspectives are quite interesting.\n\nDrones and 3-D printing play major roles in \u201cThe Peripheral,\u201d but social networks, for the most part, are obsolete in the book\u2019s fictional future. How do you choose which technological trends to amplify in your writing, and which to ignore?\n\nIt\u2019s mostly a matter of which ones I find most interesting at the time of writing. And the absence of social media in both those futures probably has more to do with my own lack of interest in that. It would mean a relatively enormous amount of work to incorporate social media into both those worlds, because it would all have to be invented and extrapolated.\n\nYour three most recent novels, before \u201cThe Peripheral,\u201d take place in some version of the present. You\u2019re now returning to the future, which is where you started out as a writer in the 1980s. Futuristic sci-fi often feels more like cultural criticism of the present than an exercise in prediction. What is it about the future that helps us reflect on the contemporary world?\n\nWhen I began to write science fiction, I already assumed that science fiction about the future is only ostensibly written about the future, that it\u2019s really made of the present. Science fiction has wound up with a really good cultural toolkit \u2014 an unexpectedly good cultural toolkit \u2014 for taking apart the present and theorizing on how it works, in the guise of presenting an imagined future.\n\nThe three previous books were basically written to find out whether or not I could use the toolkit that I\u2019d acquired writing fictions about imaginary futures on the present, but use it for more overtly naturalistic purposes. I have no idea at this point whether my next book will be set in an imaginary future or the contemporary present or the past.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The brilliant science-fiction novelist who imagined the Web tells Salon how writers missed social media's rise", "title": "William Gibson: I never imagined Facebook", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The brilliant science-fiction novelist who imagined the Web tells Salon how writers missed social media's rise", "title": "William Gibson: I never imagined Facebook", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/09/william_gibson_i_never_imagined_facebook/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/william_gibson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The brilliant science-fiction novelist who imagined the Web tells Salon how writers missed social media's rise", "title": "William Gibson: I never imagined Facebook", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/william_gibson.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael Schulson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Apple, Books, Cyberpunk, Editor's Picks, Edward Snowden, Facebook, Google, Neuromancer, science-fiction, The Peripheral, William Gibson", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ed4\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Apple, Books, Cyberpunk, Editor's Picks, Edward Snowden, Facebook, Google, Neuromancer, science-fiction, The Peripheral, William Gibson, Innovation News, Technology News, Entertainment NewsEven if you\u2019ve never heard of William Gibson, you\u2019re probably familiar with his work.\nIf we had somehow been able to read this text 30 years ago, I don\u2019t know how we would even register that.\nWell, I don\u2019t know.\nIn \u201cNeuromancer,\u201d I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence of anybody who has any parents.\nIn his latest novel, \u201cThe Peripheral,\u201d which came out on Tuesday, Gibson takes this dislocation to new extremes."}
