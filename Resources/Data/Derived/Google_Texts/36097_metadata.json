That\u2019s a very good point \u2014 and I think we\u2019re circling in on an important part of the logic behind the \u201cnew view\u201d on inequality policy, which says that policies to enhance worker bargaining power can have major effects on the distribution of market income.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on here? Maybe two schematic pictures can help.\n\nThe conventional view about the choices facing an employer looks something like this:\n\nPhoto\n\nThe employer\u2019s choice of wage to pay is pinned firmly in place by the invisible hand. It can\u2019t pay less than the going market wage, or it won\u2019t be able to attract any workers; it really, really doesn\u2019t want to pay more than the going wage, because any wage increase translates dollar for dollar into lost profits. Minimum wages or a strong union can force the wage up all the same, but it takes a lot of political or institutional power.\n\nWhat Dube, I, and many others are suggesting is, however, that for quite a few employers \u2014 including large service-sector companies \u2014 the situation looks much more like this:\n\nPhoto\n\nThere isn\u2019t a sharply defined \u201cgoing wage\u201d, either because the firm has monopsony power \u2014 it can, in effect, choose the going wage in its local labor market \u2014 or because efficiency wage considerations lead it to pay more than the minimum, so that there are normally more applicants than places. And as I\u2019ve drawn it, the top of the hill relating the wage rate to profits is fairly flat. In particular, the firm shouldn\u2019t mind very much paying a somewhat higher wage, because this will produce offsetting benefits \u2014 a larger supply of labor if it has monoposony power, lower turnover or higher productivity if efficiency wages are an issue, maybe all of the above.\n\nThe point is that under these circumstances it needn\u2019t be all that hard to push up wages: the threat of union organizing or a consumer boycott, even moral suasion from the government might be enough. So the standard view that it\u2019s very hard to change the distribution of market income, that policy must involve after-market taxes and transfers, may be quite wrong.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150611131959, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 11, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/The Mutability of Wages ( 20150611 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "More on the loose grip of the invisible hand.", "title": "The Mutability of Wages", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/11/the-mutability-of-wages/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "More on the loose grip of the invisible hand.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "June 11, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1434043199, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-06-11T17:19:59-04:00"}, "utime": 20150611171959, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150611, "pdate": 20150611, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "More on the loose grip of the invisible hand.", "title": "The Mutability of Wages", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/11/the-mutability-of-wages/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/11/the-mutability-of-wages/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Mutability of Wages", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda9de\"", "article_summary": "Arindrajit Dube enlarges on my post about efficiency wages, pointing out that the same logic applies to firms that have monopsony power.\nMinimum wages or a strong union can force the wage up all the same, but it takes a lot of political or institutional power.\nIt can\u2019t pay less than the going market wage, or it won\u2019t be able to attract any workers; it really, really doesn\u2019t want to pay more than the going wage, because any wage increase translates dollar for dollar into lost profits.\nThe point is that under these circumstances it needn\u2019t be all that hard to push up wages: the threat of union organizing or a consumer boycott, even moral suasion from the government might be enough.\nAnd as I\u2019ve drawn it, the top of the hill relating the wage rate to profits is fairly flat."}
