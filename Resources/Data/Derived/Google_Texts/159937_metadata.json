Though average generic drug prices have fallen by more than half since 2008, costs for the name-brand prescription drugs that treat chronic and life-threatening diseases have more than doubled over that period, up 127 percent, far more than the 11.24 percent inflation rate.\n\nFor 28-year-old Sacramento resident Charis Hill, who suffers from a type of arthritis that causes lower back pain and stiffness, California\u2019s new rules mean she won\u2019t have to fear a $2,000 monthly price tag for Enbrel, a specialty drug she needs to live as normal a life as possible.\n\n\u201cI feel very relieved, not just for me, but for so many people who have chronic health conditions,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThis program will allow people to access drugs they could not afford.\u201d\n\nCritics counter that such price controls could backfire, leading to higher insurance premiums for everyone and discouraging drug development.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a popular thing to say, \u2018I want lower drug prices,\u2019\u201d said Geoffrey Joyce, chairman of the pharmaceutical and health economics department at the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying, \u2018I\u2019m against crime,\u2019 and who\u2019s not in favor of that? But the reality is there are implications and consequences.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s game-changing moves began early this year after Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange marketplace established under the Affordable Care Act, became the first in the nation to apply a cap for most plans on outpatient prescription drug costs to treat life-threatening conditions such as multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, cancer and AIDS. The cap limits copayments to $250 per drug per month.\n\nThen last month, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Assembly Bill 339, which mimics the exchange\u2019s prescription drug copayment cap and covers those who get their insurance outside the exchange.\n\nBoth plans, however, are aimed only at outpatient prescriptions \u2014 people who get their medication at a pharmacy or through the mail. People who receive \u201cinpatient\u201d lifesaving medications that must be administered intravenously at clinics or hospitals will not benefit from California\u2019s new caps.\n\n\u201cThe percentage of Californians this law will effect is not huge, but it\u2019s huge for each one of these individuals \u2014 we\u2019re talking about people whose lives depend on these drugs,\u201d said Assemblyman Richard Gordon, D-Los Altos, who carried AB 339.\n\nRelief for up to 26,000 of Covered California\u2019s 1.3 million enrollees who confront at least one monthly drug prescription that costs them more than $250 arrives on Jan. 1. And for about 134,000 Californians in the same boat who buy private health insurance plans on their own or get them through their employer, AB 339 kicks in Jan. 1, 2017.\n\nThe two top Democratic presidential candidates \u2014 Clinton and self-proclaimed socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 already are pounding away on the subject of controlling drug prices. Even Republican candidate Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has criticized those drug manufacturers whose practices he said amount to \u201cpure profiteering.\u201d However, most political experts say Republican presidential hopefuls will be wary of advocating for federal regulation of prices.\n\nSome critics say placing price caps on copays will increase the cost of premiums for everyone else, though a state analysis concluded that any increase would be less than 1 percent under AB 339 and the Covered California policy.\n\nStill others note that the price caps don\u2019t solve an underlying problem: Unlike most other major industrialized countries, most of which have national health plans that regulate drug prices, the U.S. imposes no such regulations.\n\nAt the Washington, D.C.-based Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group that represents at least 50 pharmaceutical companies in the U.S., member firms are worried about the thrust of the debate, said spokeswoman Priscilla VanderVeer.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about any effort designed to artificially cap the price of drugs because it will impact innovation and have the potential to affect access to needed medication,\u201d she said.\n\nVanderVeer added that the trade group issued a statement about Turing, the company that boosted the price of Daraprim, which treats parasitic infections, by 5,000 percent \u201cas not representing PhRMA or the values of its membership.\u201d\n\nThe furor over the price increase led the company to say it would back down on its price. But Turing\u2019s CEO also defended the price hike, saying it was a result of increased costs, and that the firm would use the money to develop new and better drugs to replace Daraprim.\n\nParticularly worrisome to the industry, VanderVeer said, are legislative efforts in California and around the country demanding drug manufacturers explain their pricing to patients.\n\nThe legislative proposals \u201cdon\u2019t have any accounting for the failure inherent in the work our companies do,\u201d VanderVeer said, noting that only 12 percent of all potential new drugs make it to the market.\n\nOn average, it takes at least eight years for a new medicine to get to the marketplace, with the average cost to research and develop each successful drug estimated to be $2.6 billion.\n\nRegulating drug prices, VanderVeer said, \u201cwould significantly impact our ability to innovate and develop new drugs because you are curbing the amount that can be reinvested back into research and development.\u201d\n\nVanderVeer and Joyce at USC noted that both Medicaid \u2014 called Medi-Cal in California \u2014 and drug companies offer deep discounts on drug prices for the poor. Many doctors argue, though, that if patients can\u2019t afford the drugs, they will get sicker and end up in the hospital \u2014 which adds even more costs to the health care system.\n\nDr. Steven Coutre, a professor at Stanford University School of Medicine who specializes in blood-related cancers such as leukemia, said it\u2019s hard to justify the stratospheric costs of many cancer medications \u2014 some of which cost $100,000 per year or more. Although most of the cost is covered by health insurance, he said many patients are still responsible for a substantial share of the charges.\n\nWithout some type of reform, such as government regulation, Coutre said, \u201cThe situation is only going to get worse.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Health, Tracy Seipel", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "The Golden State\u2019s effort to tackle the issue of skyrocketing drug prices is among the most aggressive in the nation.", "title": "Amid debate on drug prices, California leads way on cost controls", "url": "http://onlineathens.com/health/2015-11-15/amid-debate-drug-prices-california-leads-way-cost-controls", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/Prescription.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4f4\"", "article_summary": "There seems little doubt that the controversy over rising drug prices will rage on and become a key issue in the presidential race.\nThe two top Democratic presidential candidates \u2014 Clinton and self-proclaimed socialist Sen.
