Medical bills are bloated with waste, redundancy, profiteering, fraud and outrageous over-billing. Much is wrong with the process of pricing and providing health care.\n\nThe latest in this medical cost saga comes from new data released last week by National Nurses United (NNU), the nation\u2019s largest nurse\u2019s organization. In a news release, NNU revealed that fourteen hospitals in the United States are charging more than ten times their costs for treatment. Specifically, for every $100 one of these hospitals spends, the charge on the corresponding bill is nearly $1,200.\n\nNNU\u2019s key findings note that the top 100 most expensive U.S. hospitals have \u201ca charge to cost ratio of 765 percent and higher \u2014 more than double the national average of 331 percent.\u201d They found that despite the enactment of \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 the Affordable Care Act \u2014 overall hospital charges experienced their largest increase in 16 years. For-profit hospitals continue to be the worst offenders with average charges of 503 percent of their costs compared to publically-run hospitals (\u201c\u2026including federal, state, county, city, or district operated hospitals, with public budgets and boards that meet in public\u2026\u201d) which show more restraint in pricing. The average charge ratios for these hospitals are 235 percent of their costs.\n\nAccording to NNU\u2019s data, the top 10 Most Expensive Hospitals in the U.S. listed according to the huge percentage of their charges relative to their costs are:\n\n1. Meadowlands Hospital Medical Center, Secaucus, NJ \u2013 1192%\n\n2. Paul B. Hall Regional Medical Center, Painsville, KY \u2013 1186%\n\n3. Orange Park Medical Center, Orange Park, FL \u2013 1139%\n\n4. North Okaloosa Medical Center, Crestview, FL \u2013 1137%\n\n5. Gadsden Regional Medical Center, Gadsden, AL \u2013 1128%\n\n6. Bayonne Medical Center, Bayonne, NJ \u2013 1084%\n\n7. Brooksville Regional Hospital, Brooksville, FL \u2013 1083%\n\n8. Heart of Florida Regional Medical Center, Davenport, FL \u2013 1058%\n\n9. Chestnut Hill Hospital, Philadelphia, PA \u2013 1058%\n\n10. Oak Hill Hospital, Spring Hill, FL \u2013 1052%\n\nThe needless complications of the vast medical marketplace have provided far too many opportunities for profiteering. Numerous examples of hospital visit bills feature enormous overcharges on simple supplies such as over-the-counter painkillers, gauze, bandages and even the markers used to prep patients for surgery. That\u2019s not to mention the cost of more advanced procedures and the use of advanced medical equipment which are billed at several times their actual cost. These charges have resulted in many hundreds of millions of dollars in overcharges.\n\nWhen pressed for answers, many hospital representatives are quick to defer to factors out of their control. It\u2019s the cost of providing care they might say, or perhaps infer that other vague aspects of running the business of medical treatment add up and are factored into these massive charges. Cost allocations mix treatment costs with research budgets, cash reserves, and just plain accounting gimmicks. These excuses shouldn\u2019t fly in the United States.\n\nFew in the medical industry will acknowledge the troubling trend. One thing is undeniably certain however \u2014 the medical marketplace is not suffering for profits. Health-care in the United States is a nearly 3 trillion dollar a year industry replete with excessive profits for many hospitals, medical supply companies, pharmaceutical companies, labs and health insurance vendors.\n\nAmericans spend more on health care than anywhere else in the world. One would hope and wish, at the least, that this enormous expenditure would provide a quality of healthcare above and beyond that found in the rest of the western world. The reality is that the results on average are no better than in France, Germany, Canada and elsewhere, which manage to provide their quality treatment without all the overcharges.\n\nMuch like our similarly wasteful, bloated military budget, the U.S. spends more on health care than the next ten countries combined \u2014 most of which cover almost all of their citizens.The United States spends $8,233 per person, per year according to a 2012 figure from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The average expenditure of the thirty three other developed nations OECD tracked is just $3,268 per person.\n\nIt gets worse. Harvard\u2019s Malcolm Sparrow, the leading expert on health care billing fraud and abuse, conservatively estimates that 10 percent of all health care expenditure in the United States is lost to computerized billing fraud. That\u2019s $270 billion dollars a year!\n\nAnd unlike other commercial markets, where the advance of technology routinely makes costs lower, the reverse trend is in effect when providing medical care \u2014 the prices just keep soaring higher and higher. The flawed, messy Obamacare system will do little to help this worsening profit-grab crisis, which is often downright criminal in the way it exploits tragedy-stricken people and saddles them with mountains of debt.\n\nSteven Brill\u2019s TIME magazine cover story from February 2013 titled \u201cBitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us\u201d gives an in-depth and highly-researched rundown of the severity of the medical cost problem and provides some of the worst, most astonishing examples of profiteering off of the plight of the sick or injured.\n\nHere\u2019s a fact that puts the full scope of this troubling trend into perspective \u2014 Brill writes: \u201cThe health-care industrial complex spends more than three times what the military industrial complex spends in Washington\u201d. Specifically, the medical industry has spent $5.36 billion on lobbying in Washington D.C. since 1998. Compare that expenditure to the $1.53 billion spent lobbying by the also-bloated defense and aerospace sector.\n\nOne line summarizes the breadth of Brill\u2019s enormous piece: \u201cIf you are confused by the notion that those least able to pay are the ones singled out to pay the highest rates, welcome to the American medical marketplace.\u201d\n\nAmericans who can\u2019t pay and therefore delay diagnosis and treatment are casualties. About 45,000 Americans die every year because they cannot afford health insurance according to a peer-reviewed report by Harvard Medical School researchers. No one dies in Canada, Germany, France or Britain because they do not have health insurance. They are all insured from the time they are born.\n\nObamacare, which has already confused and infuriated many Americans \u2014 and even some experts \u2014 with its complexity made up of thousands of pages of legislation and regulations is clearly not the answer to the problem. Long before the internet, President Lyndon Johnson enrolled 20 million elderly Americans into Medicare in six months using index cards. Canada\u2019s single-payer system was enacted with only a thirteen page bill \u2014 and it covers everyone for less than half of the cost per capita compared to the U.S.\u2019s system. (Check out 21 Ways the Canadian Health Care System is Better Than Obamacare)\n\nEnacting a single payer, full Medicare-for-all system is the only chance the United States has of unwinding itself from the spider web of waste, harm, and bloat that currently comprise its highly flawed health insurance and health care systems. It\u2019s time to cut out the corporate profiteers and purveyors of waste and fraud and introduce a system that works for everybody.\n\nRalph Nader is a consumer advocate, lawyer and author of Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us!
