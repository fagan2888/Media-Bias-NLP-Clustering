But it has yet to address another glitch that surfaced almost two years ago: Language in the law that prevents married taxpayers who file separate tax returns from qualifying for special tax subsidies.\n\nNow, as the March 31 deadline for individuals to obtain health insurance coverage rapidly approaches, the Obama administration has proposed a temporary fix.\n\nHere\u2019s the skinny: Beginning in 2014, an individual who uses the health insurance marketplace may be eligible for a premium tax credit. This tax credit can help make health insurance coverage more affordable for people with moderate incomes. Generally, a taxpayer is eligible for the premium credit if all the following requirements are met:\n\nYou acquire health insurance through the marketplace;\n\nYou are ineligible for coverage through an employer or government plan;\n\nYou fall within certain income limits (see sidebar);\n\nYou can\u2019t be claimed as a dependent on another person\u2019s tax return; and\n\nYou don\u2019t file a separate return as a married individual.\n\nIt\u2019s the last requirement that is causing most of the ruckus. The Treasury Department has acknowledged that this rule could lead to inequities, especially when it involves people who are victims of dispute, on the brink of divorce or are living apart for other valid reasons, such as when one spouse is in prison. In the preamble to regulations on the premium tax credit that were issued back on May 23, 2012, the Treasury promised to correct this flaw, but it hasn\u2019t done so yet.\n\nA few other groups \u2014 including immigrants and families with twins \u2014 have also experienced problems with enrollment at this late stage. In these cases, the software designed for www.healthcare.gov hasn\u2019t been able to properly accommodate their life situations. This is another sticky issue the Treasury has vowed to address.\n\nAs the finish line nears \u2013 the initial open enrollment period for individuals ends on March 31 \u2013 the Treasury is unofficially taking steps to allow married survivors of domestic abuse to claim subsidies for obtaining health insurance coverage, even if they file separate returns.\n\nAccording to a report in the Washington Post, an anonymous Treasury spokeswoman said, \u201cWe take seriously the compelling rationale to allow married survivors of domestic abuse and others facing similar circumstances to claim the premium tax credit even if they are unable to file a joint income tax return.\u201d For those other than battered spouses who will not be covered by the action this week, the spokesperson claimed the Treasury would continue to \u201cexplore ways to address the situation.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s no such olive branch being extended to other married people filing separate returns. At least for the time being, these individuals will not be eligible for the tax subsidies. We\u2019ll continue to monitor the proceedings.\n\n------------------------------\n\nWhat Are the Income Limits?\n\nTaxpayers who have annual household income between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line for their family size may be eligible for the premium tax credit. An individual who meets the income requirements must also meet the other eligibility criteria.\n\nFor 2014, residents of one of the 48 contiguous states or Washington, D.C., the following generally illustrates when household income would be between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line.\n\n$11,490 (100%) up to $45,960 (400%) for one individual.\n\n$15,510 (100%) up to $62,040 (400%) for a family of two.\n\n$23,550 (100%) up to $94,200 (400%) for a family of four.\n\nGo to https://www.healthcare.gov/how-can-i-save-money-on-marketplace-coverage for more details.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The government seems to have worked out most of the kinks in www.healthcare.gov, the online site used to sign up for Obamacare.
