By then the rout was on, way on, with the Dow industrials losing, what -- 350 points in the first 10 minutes? He wanted to warn us about 1 p.m.\n\nThat\u2019s when he suspected the margin calls -- or maintenance calls as they\u2019re sometimes called now -- were going to start coming in. At his firm, he explained, they don\u2019t make those calls as long as the client\u2019s equity remains above 30 percent, but once it drops below that, you have to sell three-and-a-half times as much stock to cover the account, and selling three-and-a-half times as much stock puts huge downward pressure on everything.\n\nOnce you get into the margin calls, it just feeds on itself for a while, he tells us. Usually a customer has three days to work it out, but in times of horrible stress -- like yesterday was for a little while there -- there won\u2019t be any grace period. You cover now or you\u2019re getting liquidated.\n\nEverything had seemed to hit all at once and right at the open: oil crashing, CNN\u2019s Sanjay Gupta climbing in and out of Ebola suits as we learned the virus had spread to a second health-care worker in Texas -- who had inexplicably been allowed to fly to Cleveland in the interim, gold soaring, the dollar tanking, Greek bonds tumbling. Our guy said he\u2019d never seen as much information washing over him at the same time, and he started making a joke about Depend adult diapers.\n\nExcept he didn\u2019t really laugh. (We did, though.)\n\nSure enough, right around 1 p.m. New York time, maybe a few minutes after, the floor gave way again. The Dow was trading at 15,960 as the clock struck one, down about 350 points, and by about 1:30 p.m., we\u2019d lost another 104 points. Another run at that level happened about 15 minutes later, taking us to 15,855 and change, down 460 points. At the same time, the 10-year Treasury yield, which had plummeted to 1.8622 percent by 9:38 a.m., had recovered to about 2 percent and a fraction, but the worst was past there.\n\nThe mutual funds and the hedge funds were working overtime. Then came \u201cThe Last Hour.\u201d It would be worth watching, he said, and especially the market-on-close orders. When he said that, we were assuming the worst. If we were off 460 with most of the afternoon to go, well. When was the last time we bothered to check the 401(k) plan, again?\n\nThen about an hour later, with the industrials having recouped about 116 points, Rich Miller and the U.S. economy team, in one of the more propitiously timed scoops we\u2019ve seen in a while, flashed the headline that Yellen had expressed confidence during a private meeting last weekend in the U.S. economy\u2019s ability to withstand the current headwinds.\n\nMaybe that was a turning point, maybe not.\n\nSo we got back on the phone with our guy for the last hour, or some of it, and it was a thing to behold. Like the Eagles having their way with the Giants defense last week, that crazy little line started its climb. The offense started moving the ball right around the time of the headline, with the Dow at 15,947.\n\nAbout 45 minutes later -- 15 minutes into the last hour -- it was at 16,088. Then another leg down, and then a real power surge, and with 15 minutes to go, we were at 16,185, a gain of 332 points from the day\u2019s low point. Finally tally, 1.06 percent loss on the day. Not even the worst day this month.\n\nWe don\u2019t know much about market psychology, but resilience is pretty easy to spot.\n\n***\n\nToday\u2019s U.S. economic indicators begin with initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. EDT, followed by industrial production at 9:15 a.m., Bloomberg consumer comfort and Bloomberg economic expectations at 9:45 a.m., the Philadelphia Fed and NAHB housing market index at 10 a.m., and TIC flows at 4 p.m.\n\nIt\u2019s a big earnings day in the U.S., with 27 companies scheduled to report as of this writing. Those reporting before the market opens include Goldman Sachs, UnitedHealth, PPG, Blackstone, BB&T, Mattel and Fifth Third. After the bell: Athenahealth, Capital One, AMD, Schlumberger, Delta and Google, among others.\n\n***\n\n- Apple unveils (again) new versions of its bigger iPad and the iPad mini, and may provide an update on its OS X Yosemite operating system when Tim Cook takes the stage around 10 a.m. in Cupertino, California, 1 p.m. EDT. - Obama will travel to Long Island, New York, so stay off the LIE.

The law passed in 2010, here it is 2014, and now people without a steady job can see a doctor. The sky didn\u2019t fall.\n\nMeanwhile, insurance premiums for companies that offer health benefits increased less than 3 percent this year, the lowest rate in 16 years, and none of the more than 600,000 employers who use Automatic Data Processing\u2019s payroll management intend to cut health benefits for full-time workers in response to the law, Alex Wayne and Thomas Black report.\n\nYet still you have some businesses, notably restaurants, that began adding surcharges to bills to cover the expense before they had even started providing health care to their employees. Like the Gator\u2019s Dockside restaurant chain in Florida, which claimed that without the 1 percent surcharge, \u201cthe costs associated with ACA compliance could ultimately close our doors.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what you do, guys: Sell more deep-fried gator poppers or whatever it is you people eat in Florida.\n\n***\n\nThere will be a moment not too long from now when you\u2019re watching television, perhaps even channel surfing, while sitting inside a train. You might even be at home. The one thing that will be missing is the TV.\n\nTime Warner Inc.\u2019s move to finally offer HBO online, free of any subscription to cable TV, will be the day you remember when you\u2019re watching \u201cMary Tyler Moore\u201d reruns on your tablet or phone, or whatever the device will be by then, while waiting for your flight.\n\nCBS said it\u2019s considering following suit with its Showtime cable channel, which is causing some Netflix investors to check the rearview mirror.\n\nWe\u2019re old and still watch things like our local TV news and could care less about Game of Thrones, so our obscenely expensive cable/phone/Internet bill is probably going to remain a fact of life and remain one reason the dog only eats every other day. But we know many \u201ccord-cutters,\u201d as they\u2019re described in the overview of the watershed moment by Crayton Harrison, Scott Moritz and Doni Bloomfield.\n\nNot only TV, but the telephone as well; they live off of a mobile phone entirely. These tectonic shifts are here to stay, so might as well capitalize on them, we figure Time Warner is thinking, even though the policy appears to have an element of cannibalizing the company.\n\nIt also should hasten nascent legislative efforts in Washington to force cable-TV providers to offer channels a la carte instead of the bundling of certain tiers that include channels you\u2019ll never, ever watch.\n\nNext, the end of movie theaters for first-run films.\n\n***\n\nWe\u2019ve never used Gare du Nord, one of the major train depots in Paris, but we\u2019ve been through Gare de Lyon a couple times and that was interesting enough. New York\u2019s Penn Station has a seamy side. It\u2019s just that the ones in Paris are in a different language.\n\nPart of this, we\u2019ll venture, has to do with what we perceive as the French tendency just to endure things that others, namely Americans, would set about to fix right away. \u201cC\u2019est normal,\u201d they\u2019ll say with a shrug -- it\u2019s normal that standing outside a train station waiting for a ride or smoking a cigarette leaves you vulnerable to an unrelenting onslaught of panhandlers and skells.\n\nAt the same time, for a casual tourist, it\u2019s got a certain gritty charm. But that would surely evaporate if you had to use the station with any frequency, let alone daily. And since it\u2019s the first thing that welcomes those travelers to Paris, it\u2019s understandable that it\u2019s being held up as a symbol of decline. And it is.\n\n\u201cNothing works and worse, nobody cares,\u201d John Lewis Partnership Managing Director Andy Street sniffed, comparing Gare du Nord (roughly, \u201cNorth Station\") with the \u2018\u2018modern, forward-looking\u2019\u2019 St Pancras, the Eurostar station in London.\n\nMr. Street, you know the French love nothing more than to annoy the Brits, right?\n\nThings are changing, though. They\u2019re already setting about to fix it up, and maybe afterward the roving vomiteers described by Angeline Benoit today will find it too difficult to hang around. Or too luxe to think about going anywhere else.\n\n***\n\nHow \u2019bout those Royals? Pretty easy team to like, the way they play National League-style small-ball over in the American League. The AL wild card team finished off the AL East champion Baltimore Orioles in four straight games, winning yesterday 2-1 for Kansas City\u2019s first pennant since 1985, when they won it all.\n\nThe chances for an all-Missouri World Series are growing fainter, however. The San Francisco Giants defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 6-4 to take a 3-1 series lead. Game 5 is today at 5 p.m. in San Francisco, 8 p.m. EDT.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "C.
