McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Illinois, has encouraged employees to work from home, spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in an email. The company will host the annual shareholder meeting at its headquarters campus on Thursday, with security personnel in attendance as usual, McComb said.\n\nThe pace of IPOs this year has been the slowest since 2009, but with five companies coming public today that drought may be ending.\n\nWarren Buffett is an Obama supporter, but he is still bullish on America even if Trump becomes president. He cited the fact that in his lifetime, GDP per capita has gone up six times. He thinks it will continue to rise for at least the next 50 years and that no presidential candidate is going to put an end to that.\n\nAt the annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting, Warren Buffett answered a tough question from a shareholder about Berkshire's substantial holdings of Coca-Cola shares. He said, \"I elect to get my 2600 or 2700 calories per day from things that make me feel good.\"\n\nAddressing the issue of climate change at his annual shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett said he doesn't agree that climate change is the most pressing issue facing the Earth. However, he does want to reduce our dependence on oil out of a fear that we're going to use \"every last drop.\"\n\nMore Americans have health insurance. Fewer people have to worry about catastrophic medical costs. Those are notable accomplishments of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut 31 million Americans remain \u201cunderinsured,\u201d which means they have healthcare coverage but still face out-of-pocket medical costs that could cause serious financial stress. Like workers who are underemployed\u2014holding a job but for less pay or fewer hours than they\u2019d like\u2014the plight of the underinsured is often overlooked by policymakers, employers and public health advocates; they have insurance, after all, which means they\u2019re better off than people who don\u2019t.\n\nYet the problems faced by the underinsured reveal the ongoing failings of the U.S. healthcare system and explain why Americans remain frustrated with Obamacare, as the ACA is known. A new study by the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund finds that 23% of people with health coverage are underinsured. That means out-of-pocket medical costs for a middle-income family\u2014not including insurance premiums\u2014would be more than 10% of household income in a given year if they hit the ceiling for all out-of-pocket costs.\n\nMost people who get health insurance under the ACA qualify for subsidies that help cover the cost of premiums, and some get additional tax breaks for medical costs they actually incur. There are no government subsidies for people who get health insurance through an employer, which is still the way most non-senior adults get coverage.\n\nTo control the cost of premiums, many companies that offer insurance have been raising deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. At the same time, many workers have been choosing such high-deductible plans, as they're called, since the premiums are usually lower. Since 2003, the percentage of people covered by private-sector plans with a deductible of $1,000 or more has risen from 8% to 38%, as this chart from the Commonwealth study shows:\n\nView photo .

Most policies have out-of-pocket maximums, but even those are sometimes much higher than most families can afford. The limit for a plan under Obamacare in 2015, for example, is $6,600 for an individual and $13,200 for a family. Such limits are high enough to cause plenty of trouble. The Commonwealth study found that 38% of people deemed underinsured had trouble paying medical bills in 2014, while 23% were contacted by a collection agency.\n\n[Get the Latest Market Data and News with the Yahoo Finance App]\n\nPrivate-sector businesses have generally shrugged off Obamacare, with few canceling or seriously altering the plans they offer workers, according to a recent study by the Rand Corp. Many Obamacare critics predicted the opposite would happen, with employers canceling coverage and pushing workers en masse onto the new ACA marketplaces, to avoid the cost and hassle of dealing with insurance. But one big reason employers may be sticking with insurance coverage is their ability to pass most or all of the increased cost of care onto their employees.\n\nWorkers are clearly paying more for health insurance and actual care, even though overall costs have moderated a bit in recent years. The Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s latest report on health benefits found that the average amount workers pay for premiums has risen nearly four times as much as average incomes since 1999. Some companies are doling out lower pay to compensate for higher healthcare costs. And some employees who are getting decent raises are spending most or all of the extra money to cover higher health insurance or medical costs.\n\nSeparate research by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans found that 41% of companies say they increased out-of-pocket limits on the policies they offer in 2015, with 37% saying they\u2019ve increased deductibles and 28% saying they\u2019ve boosted co-payments. Overall coverage may have remained stable, but cost hikes continue to cut into paychecks.\n\nThat unhappy trend seems likely to continue and perhaps worsen. Consulting firm Milliman says the average total cost of healthcare, including premiums and all out-of-pocket expenses, hit $24,671 this year for a family of 4 with company-provided insurance. That's up 27% since 2011, which is nearly 5 times the overall inflation rate during the same time. The family covers about $10,500 of that expense, through premium payments, deductibles, co-pays and other direct costs. The employer pays the rest, mainly through its contribution to premiums. Milliman says the total price of care for the typical family \"will almost certainly surpass $25,000 in 2016.\"\n\nThe ACA includes several pilot programs meant to test new ways to lower costs. But cost pressures will probably intensify before they ease. In the IFEBP survey, benefit managers said costs were likely to rise more next year than this year (for both workers and employers). Another big cost bump could come in 2018, when an excise tax on the most generous healthcare plans goes into effect, which will force companies to either scale back coverage or raise costs yet again. Before long, we may need another Affordable Care Act\u2014one that actually makes healthcare affordable.\n\nRick Newman\u2019s latest book is Liberty for All: A Manifesto for Reclaiming Financial and Political Freedom.
