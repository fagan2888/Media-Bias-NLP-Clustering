Two years after surviving the sinking of the Titanic, Molly Brown spent time in France during World War I, part of a small team of American women volunteers who devoted themselves to relief work in France during and after the war.

Photographs from that time are highlighted in a new exhibition at the Molly Brown House Museum in Denver: “A Call to Arms: Colorado at War, 1914 – 2014,” which runs through Sept. 28.

The volunteer effort was organized by Anne Morgan, a daughter of the financier Pierpont Morgan, who used photography to create a humanitarian response to the difficulties of French refugees.

Morgan created the American Committee for Devastated France with her friend Anne Murray Dike.

The committee commissioned photographs of the devastation in France, and the committee’s activities to help relieve the suffering. American newspapers ran full-page images, and sets of prints sold for $3 a dozen.

Those photographs are now on view in “American Women Rebuilding France” at the Molly Brown House. They are on loan from the Franco-American Museum, a national museum housed in the 17th-century chateau that served as the base of operations for the American Committee for Devastated France.
