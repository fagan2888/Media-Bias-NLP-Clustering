Ted Cruz said Friday that the rulings mark \u201csome of the darkest 24 hours in our nations history.\u201d\n\nCruz made the comments in an interview on Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show Friday afternoon.\n\n\u201cToday is some of the darkest 24 hours in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t say it more eloquently,\u201d Hannity responded.\n\n\u201cYesterday and today were both naked and shameless judicial activism,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cNeither decision \u2014 the decision yesterday rewriting Obamacare for the second time. Six justices joined the Obama administration. You now have President Obama, Kathleen Sebelius and six justices responsible for forcing this failed disaster of a law on millions of Americans, and simply rewriting the law in a way that is fundamentally contrary to their judicial oaths.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then today, this radical decision purporting to strike down the marriage laws of every state. It has no connection to the United States Constitution. They are simply making it up,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt is lawless, and in doing so, they have undermined the fundamentally legitimacy of the United States Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nCruz went on to blast many Congressional Republicans for not standing up to Obamacare, saying that some are \u201cpopping champagne\u201d in celebration.\n\n\u201cThe sad part is leadership supports each of those decisions. A lot of Republicans put out statements today saying they were unhappy and crying crocodile tears because privately they are celebrating and popping champagne,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThey\u2019re thrilled, number one, that the court didn\u2019t throw Obamacare back in the laps of Congress. That they don\u2019t want to actually stand up and do anything to stop it, and they were overjoyed at the marriage decision because they don\u2019t want to defend marriage and they are running away from it. And it is fundamentally dishonest and corrupt.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Al Weaver", "description": "Sen.
