Circumstances stem from the Republican presidential race, in which some candidates appear to be vying to out-Trump Trump.\n\nIn sum, Obama doesn\u2019t think much of Trump \u2013 or of Trump\u2019s Republican critics. Neither does he think much of Republican leaders and wannabe presidents, whose apocalyptic rhetoric has reduced political debate to a crypto-Armageddon-ish clash of cliches.\n\nBeware Brother Trump, for thrice the cock hath crowed.\n\nAddressing those Republicans who complain about Trump now \u2013 or who criticized him for questioning Sen. John McCain\u2019s war heroism \u2013 Obama said they are either insincere or stupid. My guess is that Obama would go with the second choice.\n\n\u201cNow\u201d is the operative word, since so few in the Republican Party were willing to criticize Trump when he was challenging Obama\u2019s natural-born citizenship. Of course, in those days, potential presidential candidates were hoping for a handout from Trump. Little did they suspect he\u2019d soon be routing and outing them, telling their little secrets (Sen. Lindsey Graham asked him for help getting on Fox News) and ridiculing their appearance (former Texas Gov. Rick Perry wears glasses so he\u2019ll look smart).\n\n\u201cRidiculous\u201d and \u201csad\u201d were the words Obama chose to describe recent comments by Republican presidential contenders and others. Pointedly, he singled out former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton.\n\nAll three men dug deep into their sacks of Pavlovian metaphors and similes that would get their constituents banging their reward levers. Even ol\u2019 Pontius Pilate, to whom Cotton compared Secretary of State John Kerry, got a trot-out. Huckabee said that the Iran deal was leading Israelis \u201cto the door of the oven.\u201d And Cruz brought it home with his charge that Obama is a leading state sponsor of terrorism.\n\nPut these three in a cocktail shaker, and you get a rather mixed metaphor that nonetheless pours like a narrative: Pontius Kerry is leading the Jews to the Auschwitz ovens in a terrorist act orchestrated by the president of the United States.\n\nWith all due respect, you three are making Rick Perry look like Confucius, though you might edge out Graham for a spot on Fox. Outrageous remarks get attention, and attention gets ratings, and ratings are the coins of the realm.\n\nContrary to Cruz\u2019s remark, Obama is the terrorist-killer in chief. The drone-master has killed the second-highest-ranking terrorist leader, oh, at least 373 times in the past six years. In the world of terrorism, you don\u2019t want to be third in command.\n\nMoreover, Obama\u2019s trip to Ethiopia was partly to praise the nation for its role in weakening the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab group in Somalia. He also urged greater press freedom and human rights, hardly the priorities of a terrorist leader. Or does Cruz think this was a clever ruse?\n\nCotton\u2019s reference to Pontius Pilate was simply spectacular. Cotton, you\u2019ll recall, pushed the Open Letter to the Leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran notifying them that congressional Republicans could kill any deal. Additionally, the 47 signees indicated that the next president could revoke an executive agreement.\n\nIf you squint your eyes and spin in circles counting backward from 100 by threes, you can begin to understand how Cotton would see Kerry, who is trying to negotiate a way to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities, as exactly like Pilate, who condemned Jesus Christ to die on the cross. Huh? Exactly.\n\nFinally, Huckabee. What did you do with the other Huckabee \u2013 the jovial, not-mad-at-anybody, quick-with-a-quip Huckabee? \u201cOven\u201d? It\u2019s vivid and descriptive, but cruel and offensive. One does not summon the horrors of the Holocaust except to discuss the Holocaust \u2013 a singularly horrific event deserving of its own place in history and in no one\u2019s stump speech.\n\nAt most these three conjurers have demonstrated temperaments unbecoming of leadership while insulting thoughtful Republicans who deserve better. Unwittingly (and how), they\u2019ve made President Obama, whom they find so despicable, appear the wisest of all.\n\nKathleen Parker is a columnist for The Washington Post Writers Group.
