Gary Herbert\u2019s office, to talk about trying again.\n\nUtah Rep. Kim Coleman, a West Jordan Republican who sponsored the bill earlier this year, said the governor has said he\u2019d consider adding it to lawmakers\u2019 agenda if they meet for a special session this year.\n\nHerbert\u2019s spokesman Marty Carpenter said in a statement Tuesday afternoon that while Coleman\u2019s bill didn\u2019t make it to the governor\u2019s desk, Herbert \u201cwill continue to work with legislators and all stakeholders to ensure Utah has the right policy to embrace innovative ideas while protecting consumers.\u201d\n\nChen said Tesla won\u2019t use third-party dealerships because they\u2019re not only trying to persuade customers to buy an electric car, but in the process, convince them it\u2019s better than an internal combustion engine car. Chen said that would be a conflict of interest for dealerships relying heavily on sales of traditional vehicles.\n\n\u201cUntil we can get electric vehicles into the mainstream, we still feel like we must do this on our own,\u201d Chen said.\n\nTesla has faced similar roadblocks to selling its cars in a number of states with dealership laws like Utah\u2019s. In some of those states, legislators have been looking at ways to tweak laws and let the company operate.\n\nIn late March, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed legislation allowing Tesla to sell directly to customers, a proposal similar to a bill Utah lawmakers voted down earlier this year.\n\nColeman\u2019s bill would have created a special dealership license that would allow companies like Tesla to avoid using franchises and sell directly to customers online.\n\nUtah\u2019s dealership laws stem from decades-old concerns that manufacturers could create monopolies over car sales, she said.\n\n\u201cWe just really didn\u2019t see the Internet coming when we made these laws and now you have companies like Tesla that just do it differently,\u201d Coleman said.\n\nUnder her proposal, customers at Tesla\u2019s showroom could view a car and then order it online at a nearby computer.\n\nState lawmakers cited concerns that the legislation was tailor-made for Tesla and the bill needed more study. It was voted down in March during the Legislature\u2019s final week.\n\nColeman said the bill ran up against steep opposition from existing Utah car dealers.\n\nCraig Bickmore with the New Car Dealers of Utah told The Associated Press in an email Tuesday that he was not available for an interview but said the group looks forward to continue discussing the issue with Coleman and other lawmakers.\n\nMessages left with Wayne Jones of the Used Car Dealers Association were not immediately returned\n\nSarah Starkey, with the New Car Dealers Association and Utah\u2019s Larry H. Miller Dealerships, spoke against the bill during the session but through a spokeswoman, declined to comment to The Associated Press. Starkey told lawmakers in March that they\u2019d love to see Tesla in Utah but they want them to follow the same laws other dealers and manufacturers are following.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tesla Motors has built a new showroom in Salt Lake City to sell its sleek electric cars, but no one can buy, drive or discuss prices there after Utah officials ruled it violates state laws about car makers owning dealerships.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Tesla Motors has built a new showroom in Salt Lake City to sell its sleek electric cars, but no one can buy, drive or discuss prices there after Utah officials ruled it violates state laws about car makers owning dealerships.", "title": "With shuttered dealership, Tesla looking for options in Utah", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/7/with-shuttered-dealership-tesla-looking-for-option/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/07/89732b2ca0a3040f730f6a7067003294.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/07/89732b2ca0a3040f730f6a7067003294.jpg", "description": "Tesla Motors has built a new showroom in Salt Lake City to sell its sleek electric cars, but no one can buy, drive or discuss prices there after Utah officials ruled it violates state laws about car m", "card": "summary", "title": "With shuttered dealership, Tesla looking for options in Utah"}, "Author": "MICHELLE L.
