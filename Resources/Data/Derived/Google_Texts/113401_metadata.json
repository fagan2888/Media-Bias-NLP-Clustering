Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has as broad a public reach as any politician today. Her opening statement for the Middle Class Prosperity Project Forum, something she and Rep. Elijah Cummings conceived out of thin air, got 1 million Facebook views in less than 24 hours.\n\nSo it\u2019s significant when she uses this platform to steer supporters toward investigating government\u2019s seedy underbelly, where the real decisions get made. For example, this week, Warren authored an op-ed about something called investor-state dispute resolution, the obscure provision in trade deals that allows corporations to sue governments in outside tribunals to overturn sovereign laws. She also wrote a letter to the Education Department, highlighting a hidden taxpayer bailout of for-profit Corinthian Colleges, which forced defrauded students to pay off worthless loans.\n\nRelated: How Wall Street Is Fighting to Rip Off Your Retirement Money\u200b\n\nPerhaps her biggest teaching lesson this week introduced the nation to Scott Alvarez, general counsel of the Federal Reserve. Alvarez is the most important public official nobody knows about, yet he wields tremendous power over Fed policy, especially on financial regulation. This derives from his ability to lurk in the shadows and affect the process unobstructed. Warren\u2019s public call-out could change that dynamic.\n\nWhat you need to know first about Scott Alvarez is that he was appointed to his position by Alan Greenspan, and he fully shares Greenspan\u2019s laissez-faire views on regulation. A Fed staffer since the 1980s, Alvarez has participated in virtually every deregulatory maneuver of the past 35 years. He helped draft the law that formally eliminated the Glass-Steagall separation of commercial and investment banking and resisted using the Fed\u2019s consumer protection authority to tame the runaway mortgage market during the housing bubble. Now, with a team of over 50 lawyers who analyze all rulemaking, supervisory actions and legal guidance, Alvarez can influence Fed work product at the staff level. In short, he controls what the Fed leadership sees.\n\nFed governors may think they\u2019re in charge, but Alvarez has repeatedly contradicted their stated goals in public. For example, last fall, New York Fed Chair William Dudley and Daniel Tarullo, a Fed governor and point person on financial regulation, each gave speeches on the need to influence the culture of greed and risk-taking on Wall Street. Weeks later, Alvarez said, \u201cculture is not something that we feel we can regulate.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Wall Street Breeds So Many Bad Apples\n\nIn the same speech, given to bank lawyers at the American Bar Association conference, Alvarez pointed out which parts of Dodd-Frank he wanted to see repealed, an odd posture for a public official at an agency implementing the law. Even tame rules like the SEC\u2019s Dodd-Frank provisions on credit rating agencies are \u201cmore constraining than I think is helpful,\u201d Alvarez said.\n\nAlvarez\u2019 biggest targets in that speech were rules to push out swaps trading to separately capitalized entities (\u201cYou can tell it was written at 2:30 in the morning,\u201d he said), and the Volcker rule, which limits banks from risky trading on their own accounts. And in a show of Alvarez\u2019 clout, these suggestions became the law in a matter of months.\n\nLast December, Congress killed the swaps push-out, over Warren\u2019s objections, with a rider placed into a must-pass bill. That same month, the Fed had opted to delay implementation of key elements of the Volcker rule, letting banks keep investments like collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) on their books. The Fed had to break Dodd-Frank rules allowing it to delay provisions only one year at a time by announcing its \u201cintention to act next year\u201d 13 months early. At least one Democratic aide openly blamed Alvarez for the Volcker rule delay; it wasn\u2019t the first time he was implicated in watering it down.\n\nRelated: Two Big Breaks for the Big Banks to Kick Off 2015\n\nHaving a mole inside the Federal Reserve, able to defy the will of the leadership, implement deregulatory policies and signal Congress to act finally became too much for Warren. Questioning Fed Chair Janet Yellen at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Wednesday, Warren started by noting that Alvarez failed to brief her, as requested, on a leak of information from a private 2012 Fed meeting, used to move markets.\n\nThen, she highlighted Alvarez\u2019 American Bar Association comments, and how they line up with recent actions to weaken Dodd-Frank. Warren asked Yellen, \u201cDo his criticisms reflect your criticisms?\u201d Yellen said that she was not interested in altering Dodd-Frank in any way, an evasive answer, considering that the Fed did delay the Volcker rule as per Alvarez\u2019 suggestions.\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s appropriate that Mr. Alvarez took public positions that do not evidently reflect the public position of the Fed\u2019s board, especially before an audience that has a direct financial interest in how the Fed enforces its rules?\u201d Warren probed. Yellen again dodged, saying they\u2019re not seeking to change the rules, a remarkable statement for a federal agency head to have to make.\n\nRelated: Why Elizabeth Warren Trumps Obama\u2019s Economic Message\n\nWarren is protesting how Alvarez can subtly operate on the side of big banks, against the public interest. When he tells bank lawyers what parts of Dodd-Frank he\u2019d kill, he gives them a roadmap for where they\u2019ll get official support for undermining the law. When the Fed delays the effective date of certain regulations, he gives space for bank lobbyists to gut the rules. Warren brought up just this point about the swaps push-out (which the Fed delayed until 2016 before the provision was eliminated), and Yellen said she didn\u2019t know Alvarez\u2019 role. But as general counsel, it\u2019s impossible that he wasn\u2019t involved.\n\nYellen left no doubt who she sided with after the hearing, releasing a written statement backing Alvarez. \u201cMy colleagues and I depend, with confidence, on Scott Alvarez\u2019 expert advice and counsel,\u201d Yellen wrote. \u201cHe is a dedicated public servant who is committed to thoughtful public policy.\u201d\n\nThis is what makes change at the Fed so difficult. In her confirmation hearing, Yellen committed to prioritizing financial regulation at the level of principals, rather than delegating to staff. But her statement effectively sanctioning Alvarez\u2019 conduct suggests that he still heavily influences decisions behind the scenes. There\u2019s too little transparency about his role, but calling him the power behind the throne, as Jesse Eisinger did in 2013, does not seem far-fetched.\n\nRelated: Yellen Defends Fed Against Special Interest Assaults\n\nThere are two ways to deal with this. One is to simply fire Alvarez for acting at cross-purposes with the leadership\u2019s stated goals. A similar tactic, when Office of the Comptroller of the Currency head Thomas Curry fired pro-bank General Counsel Julie Williams, significantly improved that agency. \u201cThe Fed\u2019s general counsel\u2026 should not be picking or choosing which rules to enforce based on their personal views,\u201d Warren told Yellen at this week\u2019s hearing.\n\nBut Yellen, by her statement, has already ruled out dumping Alvarez, and it\u2019s not certain that there\u2019s any real daylight between the two on regulatory priorities. So the other option is to increase transparency at the Fed, to help the public understand who decides on these monumentally important issues and why.\n\nWarren has come out against the \u201cAudit the Fed\u201d bill being pushed by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) because of concerns about \u201cmeddling in monetary policy decisions.\u201d But the situation with Alvarez clearly shows that the Fed is too opaque and cloistered, such that an obscure staffer can overpower the process.\n\nThe larger point about auditing the Fed is piercing this veil of secrecy. Just having a popular senator exposing Scott Alvarez to the light of day helps in that effort. But we can go further to ensure that one man doesn\u2019t hold the nation\u2019s regulatory posture almost entirely in his hands.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Sen.
