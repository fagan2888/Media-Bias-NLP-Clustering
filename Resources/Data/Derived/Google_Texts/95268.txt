LAS VEGAS â€” A 48-year-old former Cherry Hill man has been arrested on suspicion of impersonating a police officer and sexually assaulting an escort service employee at a Las Vegas Strip resort.

Police say Mark Picozzi of Las Vegas was arrested Thursday after the employee told investigators she was called to meet a male client in a room at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and forced to have intercourse.

The woman said she and the man were about to leave the room when he identified himself as a Las Vegas Metro vice officer and offered to help her out if she helped him.

Police say the suspect has no known affiliation with any law enforcement agency, and has been convicted of robbery, kidnapping and impersonating an officer in New Jersey.

He had been sought on an arrest warrant out of New York on a robbery charge.

Picozzi was booked into the Clark County jail on various charges, including sexual assault and impersonating an officer.

Picozzi spent nearly 11 years in prison in New Jersey charges of kidnapping, burglary, aggravated assault, robbery and parole violation, according to a 2009 Press of Atlantic City report. He is a former Cherry Hill resident, according to the Press report.
