You may have missed it at the end of last week, but Senator Professor Warren took to the floor of the Senate and lit a whole bunch of stuff on fire, including the hiring practices of the last two Democratic presidents, and Citigroup. This was something which Senator Huckleberry J. Butchmeup would not put up with. So he put aside his fourth-generation bootleg DVD's of CIA interrogations in Thailand, stopped giggling, wiped away most of the drool, and rose up, such as he can rise up, to respond.

Waiting after Warren's blistering speech was Sen. Lindsey Graham, a deal-making Senate Republican prone to offering unsolicited wisdom to many of his colleagues. He cited comments Warren made during last year's shutdown, and said that his liberal colleague sounded a lot like conservative hardliners who tried - and failed - to defund Obamacare as part of last year's spending bill. "You have every right to vote no and argue to bring the bill down," the South Carolina senator chided her. "If there's something you don't like, welcome to democracy."..."If you follow the lead of the senator of Massachusetts ... people are not going to believe you are mature enough to run the place," Graham said. "Don't follow her lead. She's the problem." Share

All I want for Christmas is for Huckleberry to engage her publicly on the issues she discussed. There would be nothing left of him but the vapors.
