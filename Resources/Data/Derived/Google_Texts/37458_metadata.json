This time? That meant a Serbian-style burger.\n\nStory continues below photo\n\nThis year's fair boasted a range of new attractions, from a \"Brew Mile\" race to cultural shows throughout the fair's 10-day run.\n\nBut in its 109th year, old standbys \u2014 classic carnival fare such as funnel cake, turkey legs and corn on the cob, or rides like the Ferris wheel \u2014 seemed to be the main draws.\n\nShontae Wilson quietly chowed down on a Polish sausage.\n\nHer favorite thing about a day at the fair?\n\n\"You can let your kids go while you eat in peace,\" she said.\n\nThe mother of five \u2014 including three teens who were out playing games and going on rides \u2014 said that even though they're teenagers, her kids don't mind coming to the fair with their mom.\n\n\"If they come with Mama, Mama's going to pay,\" the Nashville resident said as she cracked a smile.\n\nQuianna and Frankie Ashford said their three daughters were excited to check out the rides and try new foods.\n\nFirst, though, they stopped in one of the exhibit halls to try their hand at decorating cupcakes.\n\nAnaya, 5, showed off a cupcake with Jackson Pollock-like splashes of color.\n\n\"It's called a crazy cupcake,\" she said.\n\nHer sister, 3-year-old Mariyah, however, couldn't wait to explain her design.\n\nShe had already started eating it.\n\nReach Jill Cowan at 615-664-2150 and on Twitter @jillcowan.\n\nBuy Photo Mason Collins presents his calf in the Hereford calf exhibit at the Tennessee State Fair on Sunday.
