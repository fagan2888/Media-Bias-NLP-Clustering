The Trans-Pacific Partnership would, in his words, \u201clevel the playing field\u201d and \u201cgive our workers a fair shot.\u201d But critics argue that within the hundreds of pages of esoteric provisions, the deal \u2014 like similar ones before it \u2014 includes a glaring double standard: It provides legal rights to corporations and investors that it does not extend to unions, public interest groups and individuals.\n\nRecently leaked drafts of the agreement show the pact includes the kind of \u201cInvestor-State Dispute Settlement\u201d (ISDS) provisions written into most major trade deals passed since the North American Free Trade Agreement. Those provisions allow companies to use secretive international tribunals to sue sovereign governments for damages when those governments pass public-interest policies that threaten to cut into a corporation\u2019s profits or seize a company\u2019s property.\n\nBut also like past trade deals, the TPP is not expected to allow unions and public-interest groups to bring their own suits in the same tribunals to compel governments to enforce labor, environmental and human rights laws.\n\nThe discrepancy is a deliberate effort to make sure trade policy includes a \u201ctilt toward giant corporations,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said.\n\n\u201cIf a Vietnamese company with U.S. operations wanted to challenge an increase in the U.S. minimum wage, it could use ISDS,\u201d Warren wrote in a Washington Post op-ed in February. \u201cBut if an American labor union believed Vietnam was allowing Vietnamese companies to pay slave wages in violation of trade commitments, the union would have to make its case in the Vietnamese courts.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration argues that concerns from TPP opponents are exaggerated because to date the federal government has \u201cnever once lost an ISDS case.\u201d\n\nBut those opponents counter by noting that those cases are on the rise across the globe. As the United Nations reported recently, ISDS cases \u201chave proliferated in the past 10-15 years, with the overall number of known treaty-based arbitrations reaching 514.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama's new pact provides legal rights to corporations that it does not extend to unions and public interest groups", "title": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2019s glaring double standard", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Obama's new pact provides legal rights to corporations that it does not extend to unions and public interest groups", "title": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2019s glaring double standard", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/28/the_trans_pacific_partnershipis_a_plutocrats_dream_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/barack_obama20.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama's new pact provides legal rights to corporations that it does not extend to unions and public interest groups", "title": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2019s glaring double standard", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/barack_obama20.jpg", "creator": "@@davidsirota", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Sirota", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Canada, Corporate America, Trans-Pacific Partnership", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The discrepancy is a deliberate effort to make sure trade policy includes a \u201ctilt toward giant corporations,\u201d Sen.
