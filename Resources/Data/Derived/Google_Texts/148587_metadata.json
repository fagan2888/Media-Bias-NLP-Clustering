The post, which has been shared over 120,000 times as of Feb. 1, is illustrated with a photo of the two men bowing their heads.\n\nThe new page on the GoFundMe site identifies the homeless man as Justin Burkeen and says he \u201chas lived a rough life that eventually led to him being homeless just over 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nThe campaign\u2019s sole purpose is to \u201chelp fund a food truck that would present an opportunity to travel around the country feeding those who are much like Justin and to spread a little more hope where hope itself seems hopeless.\u201d The crowdfunding page adds:\n\nMr. Burkeen has prayed about the direction his life should go and he never thought that seeking out a meal to fill his physical hunger would also provide the spiritual fulfillment he has longed for all along.\n\nAmanda Mills told The Daily Signal she started the GoFundMe account after seeing Mustain\u2019s viral post online. Having previously been homeless herself, Mills said, she reached out to Burkeen via Facebook because \u201cI felt his pain\u2014not knowing where you\u2019re heading or where you are going to be sleeping.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Christian myself and I felt compelled to help him,\u201d Mills, a resident of Louisville, Ky., who works at a homeless health clinic, said.\n\nMills said the homeless have a great need for mobile meal trucks, especially in the winter months, since some of them camp outside when shelters are full. She said limited hours at soup kitchens can leave many hungry.\n\nThe money raised will help pay for repairing the transmission of a bus Burkeen already owns, the crowdfunding page says. Any leftover money will go toward food and supplies.\n\nThe page requests that those who cannot give financially keep Burkeen in their prayers.\n\nThe hope is to maintain Burkeen\u2019s bus as a food truck with donations and grants, Mills said. She plans to work out details with Mustain and Burkeen over the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cThe key right now is to get him up and started,\u201d she told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to meeting [Burkeen] and Joey. It\u2019s definitely been a humbling experience,\u201d she added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An online fundraising page requests that those who cannot give financially to Justin Burkeen's \"food truck\" keep him in their prayers.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An online fundraising page requests that those who cannot give financially to Justin Burkeen's \"food truck\" keep him in their prayers.", "title": "Homeless Man Gets Strangers' Help With His Dream", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160201_ChickfilaUpdate_Barillas.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T22:48:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JTSVeB"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An online fundraising page requests that those who cannot give financially to Justin Burkeen's \"food truck\" keep him in their prayers.", "title": "Homeless Man Gets Strangers' Help With His Dream", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160201_ChickfilaUpdate_Barillas.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "media", "published_time": "2016-02-01T16:22:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T22:48:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "homeless, chick-fil-a, store manager, christianity, prayer, american dream, GoFundMe, food truck, Justin Burkeen, charity"}, "article_summary": "A crowdfunding campaign is raising money to help a homeless man pay for a food truck for the hungry, after tens of thousands learned of his plight in a viral photo taken at a Chick-fil-A restaurant.\nThe fundraising effort \u201cexists to help him fulfill his dream,\u201d Joey Mustain said on Facebook.\nThe hope is to maintain Burkeen\u2019s bus as a food truck with donations and grants, Mills said.\nThe money raised will help pay for repairing the transmission of a bus Burkeen already owns, the crowdfunding page says.\nMustain said the man requested scraps, but the manager offered him a full meal with the only condition being they pray together."}
