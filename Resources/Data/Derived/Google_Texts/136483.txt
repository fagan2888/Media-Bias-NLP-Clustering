Nine of the state's 10 largest insurers are asking for large increases.

Nine of Oregon's ten largest insurance companies are asking for double-digit rate hikes next year.

It's the second year in a row since the Affordable Care Act mandated that customers cannot be rejected because of pre-existing conditions that insurers have asked for sizable increases.

Several of the companies have lost tens of millions each of the last two years.

Mona leads the way - asking for a 32.3% hike - followed by Oregon's Health Co-Op, which asked for a 32% increase.

Providence was close behind, asking for rates to be raised 29.6 percent.

The next step is for the state's Department of Consumer and Business Services, Division of Financial Regulation to review the proposed rate hikes.

"For the next two months, we will analyze the requested rates to ensure they adequately cover costs without being too high or too low," said Insurance Commissioner Laura Cali. "Our open process allows Oregonians to see everything we do and provide comments on the filings that affect them."

Starting Thursday, Oregonians will be able to go to this website to look at the filings by the insurance companies and post comments.

After the comments are submitted, the state will schedule hearings and announce a preliminary decision on June 16.

A final decision will be announced on July 1.
