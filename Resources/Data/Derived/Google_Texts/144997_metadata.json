Bush was, it\u2019s where LBJ (Lyndon B. Johnson) was. (Bill) Clinton was higher because he was a very popular second-termer.\n\n\"But this notion that this is really bad or worse for Obama, it\u2019s actually right in the average, and if anything impressive because we\u2019re in such a super polarized time period.\"\n\nHe spoke over a bar chart showing approval ratings of the presidents he mentioned \"about 1,750 days\" into their second term. Here\u2019s a screenshot:\n\nIntrigued by his point, we looked into it.\n\nIn an interview with PunditFact, Melber told us he used data from Gallup\u2019s Presidential Job Approval Center, an interactive tool that allows users to compare Gallup approval ratings of each president since President Harry Truman (1945-53) at various points in office.\n\nMelber isolated Johnson, Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama. For all but Johnson, the 1,750th or so day falls around the first full week of November. (Johnson\u2019s 1,750th day does not fall around the same time because he finished out Kennedy\u2019s term before being re-elected, so his comparable rating is from September 1968, just months before he left office.)\n\nObama\u2019s 1,750th day fell during the week of Nov. 4-10, when his job approval rating was at 41 percent. For the comparable week, Johnson\u2019s was 42 percent, Bush\u2019s was 40 percent, and Clinton\u2019s was 59 percent.\n\nMelber said he chose to compare those presidents because Bush is recent and the others are Democratic two-termers.\n\n\"We created the graphic of four presidents' ratings in order to reference those four presidents -- not all presidents,\" Melber said in an email.\n\nEven by this narrow comparison, it\u2019s not accurate to say Obama\u2019s poll numbers are \"right in the average.\" But we\u2019re not sure viewers would think Melber was comparing Obama with just three other presidents -- particularly when he said \"over the entire history of second-term presidents.\"\n\nIf you expand the pool, how does Melber\u2019s claim stand up? (Gallup\u2019s polling goes back to Harry S. Truman.)\n\nApproval rating for presidents in their 1,750th day in office\n\nPresident Percent Obama 41 percent George W. Bush 40 percent Bill Clinton 59 percent Ronald Reagan 65 percent Richard Nixon 27 percent Lyndon Johnson 42 percent Dwight Eisenhower 58 percent Harry Truman 37 percent Average of all presidents 46.8 percent\n\nSo the overall average approval rating for those presidents, under Melber\u2019s metric, is about 47 percent -- 6 percentage points higher than Obama.\n\nAnother way to look at the data\n\nGallup editor in chief Frank Newport said there\u2019s no right way to compare the approval ratings, but he would use a different method. He looked at the monthly average of polls for presidents in the first November of their second term. He argued this way smooths out weekly blips, and offers a more accurate portrayal of Truman and Johnson, who shared first terms with predecessors who died in office.\n\nComparing by the number of days served puts Johnson well into his second term in September 1968, when his approval rating began to sour over the Vietnam War, Newport said.\n\nThat exaggerates the disparity. Using Newport\u2019s methodology, second-term presidents had an average approval rating of about 51 percent.\n\nKarlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Melber is correct about one thing: This is one of the most polarized eras in American history.\n\n\"Sometimes it seems to me that the American people are living in different countries, or different universes,\" she said. \"Republicans and Democrats have completely different impressions.\"\n\nBowman also would have gone about the comparison in a different way, starting by including Reagan over Johnson, and by looking at different polls, too. (A CBS News poll released Wednesday, after Melber\u2019s segment, put his approval rating at 37 percent. Gallup\u2019s three-day rolling average for Nov. 17-19 was down to 40 percent .) She said the political climate was so different in Truman and Eisenhower\u2019s time that she, like Melber, would have left them out. She empathized with Melber trying to make a point in a tight crunch on television.\n\n\"People pick and choose polling data they want to highlight,\" Bowman said. \"I think he should have been more precise in his wording, but I\u2019m not gonna give him darts and arrows for this kind of thing.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nMelber said: \"As to the approval numbers, it\u2019s very important to understand, we look at Gallup over the entire history of second-term presidents, and you\u2019ve got in the 40s this president. At the same point, 1,700 days or so in, that\u2019s exactly about where (George) W. Bush was, it\u2019s where LBJ (Lyndon B. Johnson) was. (Bill) Clinton was higher because he was a very popular second-termer.\" Depending on what presidents you pick, and how you gauge the time frame, Melber comes close. Obama\u2019s approval ratings are roughly in the range of some presidents.\n\nBut looking at the numbers other ways produce vastly different results.\n\nMelber\u2019s claim is partially accurate but take things out of context.
