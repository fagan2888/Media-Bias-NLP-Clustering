Lords cavorting with witches. Brothers bedding sisters. Whore-loving dwarves. “Game of Thrones” has explored every permutation of romance. Why not a chaste one? It strikes a sort of poetic balance that on the same night that “Game of Thrones” fans lost their beloved bi-furious champion Oberyn Martell — as renowned for his boundless libido as his warrior skills — we would see a genuine spark of mutual, but as-yet-unfulfilled, longing between the unassuming translator Missandei (Nathalie Emmanuel) and the eunuch Grey Worm (Jacob Anderson). But does the show have the balls to follow through and allow pure love to bloom between these two? Twitter fans hope so.

While it seems a forgone conclusion that the Khaleesi’s two most dedicated disciples will inevitably hook up, as far as I am concerned, the uniqueness of their connection ultimately relies on its logistics. At one point in the episode, Daenarys asks Missandei whether or not the “pillars” and “the stones” were removed when Grey Worm was indoctrinated into the Unsullied warrior class. Neither woman knew for certain — which leaves open the possibility that Grey Worm still bears enough equipment to seal the deal in the traditional sense.
