(Danielle Paquette/The Washington Post)\n\nOMAHA, Neb. \u2014 \u201cIf you are a committed Christian,\u201d the contract begins, \u201cyou do not have to violate your faith by purchasing government-approved health insurance.\u201d\n\nEvery year, Gary Duff signs an updated version of these 40-page terms, which detail one way Americans can avoid buying private insurance or paying into the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe deal, made possible by a little-known provision in the health-care law, has one particularly important requirement: The Duff household of nine must abstain from general debauchery.\n\nSamaritan Ministries, a health-care sharing group, will charge its national network to cover the family\u2019s medical bills, but only if they agree to forsake binge-drinking, extramarital sex, illegal drugs and tobacco (with the exception of celebratory, post-birth cigars). The organization describes itself as a \u201cBiblical approach\u201d to health-care, guided by Galatians 6:2: Bear one another\u2019s burdens.\n\nThis appeals to Duff, a 60-year-old former missionary and international business instructor. He and his wife, Sheryl, have home-schooled all seven of their children and taught them to avoid MTV-approved anything.\n\nSamaritan\u2019s rules, however, extend beyond the religious realm to the practical one of saving money. Sinful behavior threatens more than a soul\u2019s entrance to Heaven, Duff and his cohorts believe: It damages the earthly body \u2014 and amplifies the price of health-care.\n\n\u201cChristians are just healthier people,\u201d he says. \u201cThink of all the physical problems we can attribute to a sinful lifestyle.\u201d\n\nObamacare, the Samaritan contract states, is undesirable because it covers costs that \u201cresult from immoral practices,\u201d such as STD treatments or out-of-wedlock births. The law creates a moral dilemma for Duff, who now works as an assistant pastor in downtown Omaha.\n\n\u201cSimply put,\u201d he says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to pay for that or encourage it in any way.\u201d\n\nNeither do the estimated 100,000 other Samaritan users. The health-care sharing ministry, recognized in ACA as a viable insurance alternative, covers up to $250,000 per \u201cneed.\u201d About 37,000 households are in the network.\n\nSamaritan bills itself as non-insurance \u2014 and has therefore avoided regulation.\n\nTo Duff, it\u2019s a way to preserve some personal liberties while giving up the ones he won\u2019t miss.\n\nIt works like this: When illness strikes, Samaritan members can file a request for aid. The ministry fields each request and alerts other members, who are then morally \u2014 if not legally \u2014 bound to mail checks directly to the sick. Each member commits to a monthly \u201cshare\u201d amount, rather than a premium.\n\nThe Duff family pays $400. There\u2019s no guarantee their medical bills will actually get covered. They have to front medical costs.\n\nEleven years ago, Duff maxed out more than one credit card to cover his son\u2019s leg surgery after he broke his femur. The $20,000 need was the most they\u2019ve filed to Samaritan. (But, Duff said, he negotiated a discount for paying that day.)\n\nThe repayment system is built on faith.\n\n\u201cI trust that God will provide,\u201d Duff said. \u201cSo far, He has delivered every time, and before the bills are due.\u201d\n\nSamaritan, based in Illinois, is among a handful of health-care sharing ministries in the United States. There\u2019s Medi-Share in Florida, Christian Healthcare Ministries in Ohio. An estimated 300,000 Americans use this insurance alternative, according to advocacy groups.\n\nAbout $9 million is available to pay medical bills each month, executive vice president James Lansberry said. Obamacare, he believes, has made it more popular.\n\n\u201cWhen the law passed, and when open enrollment started, the number of people applying to be part of Samaritan doubled,\u201d he said. \u201cThey thought, \u2018I don\u2019t want to support something that goes against my religious beliefs.\u2019 They actively sought other forms of coverage.\u201d\n\nThe ministry relies on grass-roots lobbying. As Washington polished the ACA, Samaritan urged members to push for an exemption from the law\u2019s individual mandate, or a penalty-tax uninsured Americans must pay.\n\nThe Duffs wrote letters to local politicians. They protested outside a Nebraska senator\u2019s office. They won; a health-share ministry form will be available for 2014 tax returns.\n\nThe next battle: winning immunity from Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate, which requires businesses with at least 50 employees to offer affordable, comprehensive health insurance to full-time workers. (It kicks in next year.)\n\nFirms that don\u2019t comply face fines of up to $2,000 per employee. Samaritan, which employs about 130 people, has already budgeted for the blow.\n\n\u201cWe will fight it,\u201d Lansberry says. \u201cIt goes against our very DNA. The first step is raising awareness: We\u2019re out here; we take care of each other.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhotos of family and friends cover the Duffs\u2019 fridge in their Omaha, Neb. home.\n\nDuff, who retired three years ago from teaching business skills to international students at the University of Nebraska Omaha, didn\u2019t join Samaritan just to circumvent the government. He believes in holistic medicine, the kind that conventional insurance typically doesn\u2019t cover.\n\nFour decades ago, he and his wife taught English in Japan as Christian missionaries. They felt the universal health-care there was impersonal. The American system, no better.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t work for us,\u201d he said. \u201cOne size didn\u2019t fit all.\u201d\n\nThe Duffs returned to Nebraska uninsured despite their growing brood. Sheryl preferred home births. She disliked the rigid structure of public schools and, to avoid both pathogens and social germs, educated their kids at home on Tea Party Lane in Omaha\u2019s farmland outskirts. (The youngest three are now learning middle and high school curriculums.)\n\nThe couple paid for every medical bill in cash before joining Samaritan, which they call a tight community, in 2000. Members send each other get-well cards, teddy bears and balloons.\n\nWhen possible, the Duffs avoid doctor\u2019s visits. Colds, flus and earaches are treated with herbal remedies.\n\nTogether, the family studies the relationship between religion and health \u2014 a favorite dinner conversation topic. They own several books about it. One claim that Duff swears by: Worship reduces stress, boosts social support and discourages risky activities.\n\n\u201cOur bodies are temples,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how we treat them.\u201d\n\nIn health-care and in life, Duff and his wife tell their children to have faith. Make the right choices for their souls, and for their immune systems. The family painted a permanent reminder on their living room wall: \u201cTrust in the Lord with all your heart.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health-care sharing gives some Americans a faith-based support system -- as long they pledge to refrain from sin.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danielle.paquette.58", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Health-care sharing gives some Americans a faith-based support system -- as long they pledge to refrain from sin.", "title": "\u2018Christians are just healthier': One family\u2019s cost-sharing alternative to Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/08/29/christians-are-just-healthier-one-familys-cost-sharing-alternative-to-obamacare/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2014/08/1Gary.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@dpaqreport"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/08/29/christians-are-just-healthier-one-familys-cost-sharing-alternative-to-obamacare/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obamacare, health care, health care-sharing", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danielle.paquette.58"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, health care, health care-sharing"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdafa4\"", "article_summary": "It works like this: When illness strikes, Samaritan members can file a request for aid.\nAbout $9 million is available to pay medical bills each month, executive vice president James Lansberry said.\nGary and Sheryl Duff found a religious alternative to health insurance.\nSamaritan bills itself as non-insurance \u2014 and has therefore avoided regulation.\nThe next battle: winning immunity from Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate, which requires businesses with at least 50 employees to offer affordable, comprehensive health insurance to full-time workers."}
