(By Jenna Esarey, special to The Courier-Journal) August 14, 2015\n\nThe Downtown Jeffersonville Trolley Hop lured a crowd on Friday to peruse the 22 participating shops, galleries, restaurants, and the artists exhibiting there.\n\nStained glass artist Lori Jones created whimsical Christmas trees in front of Gadabout Gallery. Across the street at Silica Ceramics, Jennie DiBeneditto showed off her skills on a pottery wheel.\n\nThe Vintage Fire Museum hosted fused glass artist Marilee Burnside, a docent at the museum. Burnside worked on a glass dish to be raffled off as a fundraiser for the museum. For a $1 donation, guests were able to help design the dish by placing a piece of glass. Burnside will fuse and shape the finished piece in a kiln at her home studio.\n\nThe free hop was the second as a stand-alone event. Two earlier hops were tied to the city\u2019s wine tasting event and a chocolate stroll.\n\n\u201cThis is the second one that was tied to art rather than food,\u201d said Jay Ellis, director of Jeffersonville Main Street, the organization that hosts the hop.\n\nThe hops are modeled on two trolley hops in Louisville, each highlighting art galleries, shops and restaurants, which have proven quite popular.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to see if that could work here,\u201d said Natalie Carden, manager of The Springs Salon & Spa. \u201cWith all the interest in public art it seemed like it could work. And I think it\u2019s always important to do things that will support local businesses.\u201d\n\nWith six stops, the route covered 19 participating businesses along a long stretch of Spring Street, with three other participants on Riverside Drive and Pearl Street.\n\nEach location featured an artist either exhibiting or demonstrating their work. \u201cI think this is really exciting,\u201d said Dawn Spyker, Jeffersonville\u2019s public art director and co-owner of Silica Ceramics and Gadabout Gallery, both stops on the trolley hop. \u201cHaving live demonstrations sets us apart.\u201d\n\nLive music featured heavily as well, with a number of locations hosting sidewalk performances. The trolley itself was home for the evening to Mike O\u2019Bryan\n\nWith the summer concert series on the RiverStage at one end of Spring Street, and the Concerts in the Park series at Warder Park near the other, the Trolley Hop was just one of the attractions on a beautiful Friday night in the city.\n\n\u201cWhat a gem we have in our downtown,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cPeople are coming in and saying, I didn\u2019t know we had this wonderful downtown here!\u201d\n\nThe next Trolley Hop is scheduled for September 11 from 6:00 to 9:00 p.m. For more information visit jeffmainstreet.org.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1TGXVHE", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Downtown Jeffersonville Trolley Hop lured a crowd to peruse the shops, galleries, restaurants and the artists.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "The Downtown Jeffersonville Trolley Hop lured a crowd to peruse the shops, galleries, restaurants and the artists.", "title": "Jeff trolley hop attracts shoppers, artists", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2015/08/15/jeff-trolley-hop-attracts-shoppers-artists/31786455/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Downtown Jeffersonville Trolley Hop lured a crowd to peruse the shops, galleries, restaurants and the artists.", "title": "Jeff trolley hop attracts shoppers, artists", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6472b9ebe1a2b58bf9521247eab6459cf84ea52f/c=134-0-667-533&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/15/Louisville/B9318431218Z.1_20150815160528_000_GF4BKQ82F.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8fd588f0f44b12068efa2339672115e3a8a4c410/c=200-0-600-533/local/-/media/2015/08/15/Louisville/B9318431218Z.1_20150815160528_000_GF4BKQ82F.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/638654ae1d20bc87a2eaa76ee81d38cdcabce667/c=134-0-667-533/local/-/media/2015/08/15/Louisville/B9318431218Z.1_20150815160528_000_GF4BKQ82F.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68ca7fed1fb4a9555a427c22d66fa056de2620b5/c=44-0-755-533/local/-/media/2015/08/15/Louisville/B9318431218Z.1_20150815160528_000_GF4BKQ82F.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c938dc92fc3a3ca9191e7d52655363c522c8fd01/c=0-42-800-492&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/15/Louisville/B9318431218Z.1_20150815160528_000_GF4BKQ82F.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-15T23:19:49.570000-04:00", "shorthed": "Jeff trolley hop impresses", "articleid": 31786455, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/91663fb702b52330025b57acd219649a8481db29/c=0-42-800-492/local/-/media/2015/08/15/Louisville/B9318431218Z.1_20150815160528_000_GF4BKQ82F.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/759890191a377e8eda26af666bd1e40795443d57/c=250-0-550-533/local/-/media/2015/08/15/Louisville/B9318431218Z.1_20150815160528_000_GF4BKQ82F.1-0.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "data", "author": "Jenna Esarey", "pageclass": "article", "title": "Jeff trolley hop attracts shoppers, artists"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc34c\"", "article_summary": "(By Jenna Esarey, special to The Courier-Journal) August 14, 2015The Downtown Jeffersonville Trolley Hop lured a crowd on Friday to peruse the 22 participating shops, galleries, restaurants, and the artists exhibiting there.\nStained glass artist Lori Jones demonstrates her art on the street in front of Gadabout Gallery & Artisan Shoppe during the downtown Jeffersonville Trolley Hop on Friday.\nStained glass artist Lori Jones created whimsical Christmas trees in front of Gadabout Gallery.\n\u201cI think this is really exciting,\u201d said Dawn Spyker, Jeffersonville\u2019s public art director and co-owner of Silica Ceramics and Gadabout Gallery, both stops on the trolley hop.\nThe Vintage Fire Museum hosted fused glass artist Marilee Burnside, a docent at the museum."}
