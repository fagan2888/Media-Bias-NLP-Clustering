As Democrats dabble with democratic socialism, might the idea of a single-payer healthcare see new life? After all, it is a key item in Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign agenda. And the crowds love him!\n\nSo maybe time to see how things are going with the Britain\u2019s National Health Service. From the Economist:\n\nThough the health budget has been spared the cuts of the past years, it has remained flat at a time of rising pressures. The population is becoming older and fatter. Waiting lists have hit seven-year highs. Austerity in other areas, most notably social care, has left folk in expensive hospital beds who should be at home. \u2026 The question is: is Britain willing to pony up? It is a clich\u00e9 to talk of the NHS as the country\u2019s secular religion, a service still adored in the context of the post-war era in which it was born. But as the collectivist afterglow of that age fades, each generation is less misty-eyed than the last. Like a tired marriage held together only by the tax benefits, Britons\u2019 purported love affair with the NHS has become transactional. They are horrified by America\u2019s private insurance system and like the services that they and their nearest use, but less out of \u201clove\u201d than out of a baser enthusiasm: for good stuff at low cost. Thus Britain spends relatively little on health as a share of its GDP, and ever-less in comparison with other rich countries. The essential fact circumscribing Mr Hunt is that, according to the Kings Fund, a health think-tank, 72% of Britons think the NHS should provide all drugs and treatment at any cost, but only 38% are willing to pay more tax for it. \u2026 So let Mr Hunt, along with the prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer, confront voters with the truth: if Britons love their tax-funded health system so much and want it to work, they will have to pay more for it. And if not, they should start considering the alternatives: probably a social insurance system akin to that used elsewhere in Europe. The objection to such a shift\u2014that the taxpayer-funded model is more efficient\u2014is correct, but counts for little if the status quo is politically unworkable. It may be that a more individualistic, consumerist country simply needs a more individualistic, consumerist health service; one of personal accounts, more choice and clearer rights and responsibilities. Perhaps it is time for that divorce.\n\nThe UK spends about 9% of GDP on healthcare vs. 17% of the US. And from 2009 through 2013, according to the OECD, annual real spending per person in the UK fell by 0.9% while it rose by 1.5% in the US. Yet it seems that recent UK spending patterns are unsustainable.\n\nAt the same time the US is more or less in line with the OECD average since 2008. And from 2003-2013, US spending was below the OECD average and about the same as the UK. More or less the same with Canada, too, another single-payer system.\n\nSo suddenly switching to a single-payer system would accomplish what exactly as far reducing what the US spends on healthcare? As Bloomberg\u2019s Megan McArdle has written:\n\nLet\u2019s get a government system in there, get our cost growth down to the level of other OECD countries instead of the insane rates that our inefficient private system produces. Eventually, as the economy grows, health care will shrink relatively, if not absolutely, and the proportion of national income that Americans spend on health care will come to resemble that of the rest of the world. Here\u2019s the problem with that idea: America doesn\u2019t have a cost-growth problem. The rate of cost growth in our \u201cinsane,\u201d \u201cinefficient,\u201d \u201cfree market\u201d system isn\u2019t particularly high by OECD standards. It\u2019s the level that\u2019s so high. We\u2019re growing at a normal rate, but off a much higher starting expenditure \u2014 an expenditure that we\u2019ve so far proven unable to cut by even a bit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Consider it a different kind of Obamacare \"repeal and replace\" plan.
