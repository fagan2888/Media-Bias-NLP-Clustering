In these pages and elsewhere, Boulder's civic conversation is dynamic. That tempts casual observers to conclude that Boulder participates more fully than many communities in the decisions that shape its future.

Voter turnout, on the other hand, suggests Boulder's civic engagement may be a mile wide and an inch deep. Two years ago, the last time seats on the City Council were up for grabs, only 32,704 ballots were cast in a city with a population north of 100,000. It took just over 12,000 votes to be elected to City Council, or the support of roughly 12 percent of the population.

Opponents of one of this year's citizen initiatives complain that 10 percent of a neighborhood should not be able to force a referendum on land-use policy. How about 12-15 percent of the city determining who makes every kind of policy?

More than 90,000 people were registered to vote within the city going into this election season, according to the county clerk's office, and for those that aren't, instant registration, right up to and including Election Day on Nov. 3, eliminates any excuse for not participating.

Advocates on both sides of this year's hotly-contested citizen initiatives say this election will shape Boulder's future more than most, not only because of those ballot issues, but also because of the wide range of sensibilities among the 17 candidates actively seeking five open council seats.

Is a doubling of the 2013 turnout too much to hope for? In an election that has produced so much debate, dare we dream that a majority of Boulder residents take the trouble to cast ballots? No matter the outcome, Boulder would benefit from a strong turnout that says the results represent a broad consensus of the city. Mail ballots make voting as easy and convenient as it has ever been.

We have made our recommendations. For Boulder City Council, we endorse:

• Michael Kruteck

• Jan Burton

• Julianne McCabe

• Don Cote

• Aaron Brockett

For the two contested seats on the Boulder Valley School District Board of Education, we recommend:

• Shelly Benford

• Kathy Gebhardt

On the citizen initiatives labeled Propositions 300 and 301, we recommend no votes.

On ballot issues put forward by the state, city and school district, we recommend yes votes on Propositions BB, 2N, 2O, 2Q, 2R and 3A. We take no position on Proposition 2P.

Mostly, we recommend that you cast your ballot between now and Nov. 3. If you've had trouble keeping up with all the candidates and issues, you'll find our coverage collected online in our election section. For details on how to vote, refer to our voter guide, distributed in print with last Sunday's paper and also available online.

We urge Boulder residents to raise the bar on civic engagement and participation this year. Vote!
