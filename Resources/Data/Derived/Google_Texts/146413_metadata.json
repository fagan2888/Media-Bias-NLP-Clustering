He\u2019s allowed just two goals in his past 10 regulation periods.\n\nBut the shootout belonged to Nathan MacKinnon.\n\nThe Avs\u2019 center moved to 4-for-4 in shootout attempts this season. But Sunday\u2019s might be his best this year.\n\nHe slow-played Red Wings goalie Petr Mrazek. It was like a staring-contest to see who would fidget first. MacKinnon waited until the last second. It was impressive. Here\u2019s the full video of his goal with the Altitude call from Mike Haynes and Peter McNab. Or check it out below.\n\nMackinnon told Mike Chambers that \u201cback in the day\u201d he would use that move most of the season because many amateur teams didn\u2019t suspect it. It\u2019s not quite a wrist shot because he snaps it. It\u2019s more a flip of the wrist. A snapper. Or a flipper.\n\nMacKinnon knows that teams are scouting and expecting his snap shot to the high-glove side after dekeing left and faking backhand \u2014 a move he\u2019s used earlier this season.\n\nMacKinnon said he\u2019ll continue to go with what works until it\u2019s stopped \u201ca couple times.\u201d \u2026", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Calvin Pickard,Nathan MacKinnon,Petr Mrazek,Red Wings,shootout", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Colorado Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon moved to 4-for-4 in shootout attempts this season, all of them unique.
