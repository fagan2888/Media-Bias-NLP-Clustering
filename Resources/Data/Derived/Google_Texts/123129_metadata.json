The company already operates more than 100 retail clinics nationwide, but these new clinics could provide much more direct competition, according to Forbes.\n\nWhile the retail clinics generally operate via leases with area hospitals, Walmart owns and operates the new clinics. Unlike other primary care providers, they will be open 12 hours a day on weekdays and at least eight hours a day on weekends, Forbes reports. Moreover, Walmart is able to provide care at much lower rates, with the new clinics charging patients only $40, and employees covered under the company health plan only $4. Moreover, they accept Medicare and, in some locations, Medicaid, according to Fortune.\n\nThe company's move signals yet another shift in healthcare delivery that create more competition for traditional providers like doctors and hospitals. Public and private health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act mean patients have more control over their own healthcare than ever before, Rob Lazerow, a practice manager with the Health Care Advisory Board, told Forbes.\n\n\"This is a very different competitive landscape than what most executives have faced previously--and hospitals risk losing volumes at each decision point,\" Lazerow said.\n\nA study last year found many patients visit retail clinics for the very advantages the Walmart clinics offer, with 74 percent saying they visited a clinic rather than a pediatrician either because of the more convenient hours, lack of appointment availability with the pediatrician, not wanting to bother the pediatrician, or the problem's perceived lack of seriousness, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the Forbes article\n\n- read the MedicalDaily article\n\n- check out the Fortune article\n\n- read the Healthcare Finance News article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n4 reasons parents use retail health clinics instead of pediatricians\n\nConsumers turn to retail clinics for convenience, affordability\n\nCompetition for patients spurs tech, design advancement\n\nEmbrace retail clinic strategies to succeed with consumer-driven healthcare", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare providers may have a new, unexpected source for competition: Walmart.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Healthcare providers may have a new, unexpected source for competition: Walmart.", "title": "Walmart primary care creates stiff competition for providers", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/wal-mart-primary-care-are-stiff-competition-providers/2014-08-11", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,competition,Operations & Business Management,primary care clinics,Retail Clinics,Wal-Mart,Walmart", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28a3\"", "article_summary": "Unlike other primary care providers, they will be open 12 hours a day on weekdays and at least eight hours a day on weekends, Forbes reports.\nWhile the retail clinics generally operate via leases with area hospitals, Walmart owns and operates the new clinics.\nHealthcare providers may have a new, unexpected competitor: Walmart.\nThe retail giant already opened several primary care clinics in South Carolina and Texas, with an additional six staffed by nurse practitioners to open by next January, Forbes reports.\nThe company already operates more than 100 retail clinics nationwide, but these new clinics could provide much more direct competition, according to Forbes."}
