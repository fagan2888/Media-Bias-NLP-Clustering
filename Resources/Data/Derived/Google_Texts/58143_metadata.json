A national Quinnipiac University poll released last week found Trump essentially tied with Democrat Hillary Clinton in a hypothetical head-to-head match up among unaffiliated voters.\n\nTrump Voter Talks Trump's Appeal Ken Raczewski, a registered Democrat, talks about why Donald Trump appeals to him.

Although registered Democrats cannot vote in the Republican primary and vice versa, unaffiliated and new voters have until noon on April 25 to enroll with a party if they want to participate in the primary.\n\nQuinnipiac poll Director Doug Schwartz expects older, white, working class men to support Trump here, just as they have in other states.\n\n\"That's the core base of his support,'' Schwartz said. \"He does well among independents because you can't fix a political ideology on him. On trade, on immigration, on military intervention, on entitlement reform, he's not a traditional conservative. He departs from the Republican leadership and that appeals to independents and Reagan Democrats.''\n\nCount Ralph Mucherino among them. Like many Trump supporters, the 52-year-old small business owner from Ansonia can't shake the feeling that the U.S. has lost stature in the world, that we've become a nation of whiners and losers while other countries surge past.\n\n\"We seem to lose on everything we do, with China and everywhere else,'' said Mucherino, who owns a T-shirt screening company. \"The jobs are going in a different direction and we're losing a lot of good opportunities.\"\n\nWhile critics say Trump's rise is fueled by xenophobia and racism, Mucherino doesn't see it that way. \"I like his views on the border,'' he said. \"If we don't do anything about immigration, things are only going to get worse here.\"\n\nMucherino, a Democrat, voted for Obama in 2008 \u2014 \"I gave him a shot.\" But he says he quickly grew disenchanted with the president and his agenda.\n\n\"We've had Obama for seven years and he didn't do a helluva lot,'' Mucherino said. \"As far as I'm concerned, Obamacare's a mess.\"\n\nIf Democrats are worried that Trump's appeal to blue-collar independent voters in Connecticut is a harbinger of trouble, they aren't acknowledging it. \"Obviously there are frustrations out there and Donald Trump has tapped into that,'' said Leigh Appleby, spokesman for Connecticut Democrats. \"He's playing into people's worst fears and, while that might be something that's effective in a Republican primary, it isn't when it comes to leading the country.\"\n\nMatthew Daly, a Republican from Glastonbury who made an unsuccessful run for Congress in 2010, said Trump appeals to voters from both parties who love their country but are driven by a powerful sense of political alienation. \"People feel like they're losing their country,'' said Daly, a Trump supporter. \"Trump's a guy who wakes up every morning and finds a way to kick the beehive. The establishment of both parties have a hard time understanding his appeal.\"\n\nA new Quinnipiac national poll documents that disconnect. The survey, released Tuesday, found a whopping 91 percent of Trump backers say their \"beliefs and values are under attack.\" About 85 percent of Trump supporters believe that America has lost its identity.\n\nTrump's supporters are profoundly pessimistic about the nation's economy as well as their own personal finances. More than two-thirds of Trump backers said they agree with the statement that they are falling further behind economically. And 84 percent said they believe the America needs a leader who is willing to do or say anything to solve the nation's problems.\n\nTrump's image as a blunt-talking disrupter who will shake up the system and restore the nation to greatness holds great appeal among these restless voters, many of whom are struggling in a turbulent economy.\n\n\"He's uncovering things and speaking the truth and saying what everyone's swept under the rug for years,'' said Brendan Howley, a 54-year-old commercial roofer from Glastonbury. \"Trump is standing up for the middle class.\"\n\nHowley is a Democrat but he says he has grown increasingly disenchanted with the party. \"This country's done nothing but crash and burn under Democratic rule,'' he said. He's not completely sure whom he will vote for but he knows it won't be Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. \"I'm not voting Democrat this time,\" he declared.\n\nGreg Steele, a 63-year-old retired golf pro from South Windsor, views Trump as a fighter who is unafraid to shake up the system. \"I haven't made a decision yet but I'm thinking about Trump,'' said Steele, an unaffiliated voter who supported President Obama in 2012.\n\nStanding at the counter at Augie & Ray's on a busy weekday afternoon, Steele conceded that Trump \"hasn't been very presidential.\" But, he quickly added, \"I like his style. I think it's exactly what we need.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Trump Attracts Disaffected Independents, Democrats", "Description": "EAST HARTFORD -- Ken Raczewski has been a registered Democrat for years but the 60-year-old tool engineer from Columbia says he is ready to abandon the party.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Hartford Courant", "author": "Hartford Courant", "og": {"site_name": "courant.com", "description": "EAST HARTFORD \u2014 Ken Raczewski has been a registered Democrat for years but the 60-year-old tool engineer from Columbia says he is ready to abandon the party.", "title": "Trump Attracts Disaffected Independents, Democrats", "url": "http://www.courant.com/politics/hc-trump-democrats-unaffiliated-20160403-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-570a352d/turbine/hc-trump-democrats-unaffiliated-20160403", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp07.14", "twitter": {"site": "@hartfordcourant", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=391113483, app-argument=http://www.courant.com/deeplinkid/86503994", "fb": {"admins": 14500562, "page_id": 49693986601, "app_id": 152391743139}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-04-10", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "But the renegade billionaire is also capturing the support of disaffected unaffiliated voters and even some blue-collar Democrats in Connecticut.\nTrump Voter Talks Trump's Appeal Ken Raczewski, a registered Democrat, talks about why Donald Trump appeals to him.\nA national Quinnipiac University poll released last week found Trump essentially tied with Democrat Hillary Clinton in a hypothetical head-to-head match up among unaffiliated voters.\n\"Obviously there are frustrations out there and Donald Trump has tapped into that,'' said Leigh Appleby, spokesman for Connecticut Democrats.\nRaczewski hasn't decided whom he will vote for but he likes what he's hearing from Republican front-runner Donald Trump."}
