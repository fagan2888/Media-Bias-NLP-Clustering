But it\u2019s far from alone.\n\nLast month, the University of Kansas said it would limit student workers to 20 hours per week for the school year and 40 hours in the summer. With these limitations, students will fall under the 1,560-hour per year threshold that would otherwise make them full-time workers who qualify for health coverage, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported.\n\nBeyond those struggling to pay for college, the threshold has interfered with the ability of student journalists to report on campus, as The College Fix has noted.\n\nWhen it limited student working hours, Wright State University in Ohio faced the issue of tracking student journalists\u2019 hours, as they were not paid an hourly rate. The school created a software system that requires students to clock in and out, giving them a warning when the 28-hour limit is approaching, the Chronicle said.\n\n\u201cWe had no budget for that,\u201d said Dan Abrahamowicz, vice president for student affairs at Wright State, regarding the possibility of paying for students\u2019 health insurance. \u201cWe had to make some adjustments.\u201d\n\nThe Iowa State Daily is making its staff who work more than 29 hours a week sign a waiver saying they get insurance through their parents or otherwise don\u2019t need it, as suggested by \u201ca lawyer,\u201d General Manager Laura Widmer told the Student Press Law Center. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say, \u2018OK, you can only work 29 hours a week and oh my gosh if there\u2019s a breaking story and you\u2019re on hour 29, walk away,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nMiami University and Kent State University in Ohio and La Sierra University in California are also among schools that have reduced student worker hours, according to the Chronicle.\n\nFull-Time in Practice, Part-Time in Name Only", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The College Fix", "description": "Colleges are cutting student workers' hours so they don't qualify for free healthcare.
