(Source: Vannesa Pena/CNN)\n\n(RNN) - The all clear has been given after the White House was placed on lockdown after someone jumped the fence, according to CNN.\n\nThe jumper, wearing an American flag, was caught by Secret Service and arrested. He was carrying a binder in his mouth.\n\nSecurity is especially important because the president and his family are actually at the White House today for Thanksgiving.\n\nThis is the second lockdown for the White House in a week. On Nov. 21, the White House was locked down because someone threw an apple core over the fence.\n\nSo many people have tried to jump over the fence in the past two years that in July the Secret Service added metal spikes onto the fence surrounding the White House, which frequently locks down when suspicious items or people make their way onto the lawn.\n\nThis guy standing right next to me jumped the White House fence ?? @washingtonpost get on this pic.twitter.com/LfewNarJ18 \u2014 Vanessa Pe\u00f1a (@VanessaVans_) November 26, 2015\n\nIn September, the White House was in lockdown for an hour after a suspicious package was found across the street, and in March, the White House went into lockdown when a nearby food truck exploded.\n\nThe most concerning fence jumper, U.S. Army Veteran Omar Gonzales, managed to scale the fence and sprint inside an unlocked door while armed with a knife in September 2014.\n\nGonzales pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful entry and one count of assaulting an officer and was sentenced to 17 months in jail along with 36 months of supervised release.\n\nOn March 1, Curtis Smith scaled a stone wall on the southeast corner of the White House. Authorities captured him without resistance, and he reportedly said he did it to pass a message to the president.\n\nSmith was killed at a Pennsylvania courthouse in August by a sheriff's deputy. According to police, he was appearing on a domestic charge unrelated to the White House incident that day when he slashed at a deputy with a knife.\n\nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
