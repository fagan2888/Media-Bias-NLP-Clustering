A steady stream of people came out to their designated polling places to exercise their right to vote.\n\nYoung voters flocked to the polls including Chance Davis, 20, of Bethel, who registered for the first time to vote in order to support Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cThe other candidates don\u2019t seem as experienced,\u201d he said, continuing, \u201cshe will better for the people.\"\n\nKenny Reddinger, 23, pictured in photo No. 1, was voting for the second time and said he was excited to vote for Ted Cruz because \u201che\u2019s just like Bush, my favorite president,\u201d noting, \u201cBush got rid of the terrorists and Ted Cruz will get rid of ISIS.\u201d\n\nAlso supporting Cruz was Jennifer Nicoletti of Bethel who said, \"Ted Cruz the only constitutional conservative who has a proven record of doing exactly what his constituents elected him to do, including standing up against Obamacare, amnesty for illegals and out of control spending.\"\n\nGreg Middleton said he was voting for Clinton because of what she stands for including social issues and human rights.\n\nAnother Hillary supporter was Kiri Ryan, pictured in photo No. 2, who said gun control and women\u2019s issues were the main reasons for her voting for Clinton.\n\n\u201cI wanted to vote for Sanders but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for that yet,\u201d she laughed.\n\nBut New Milford resident Mike Walsh is ready to \"Feel the Bern.\"\n\n\"I voted for Bernie,\" Walsh said, because of \"human rights, women's rights, economic equity. One of these candidates has to choose Elizabeth Warren as a running mate.\"\n\nIn Brookfield Matt Grimes said he voted for Kasich because he believes in \"his fiscal conservatism, ability to lead, and record of using his elected offices not to \u201cbe somebody,\u201d but to actually get something done.\"\n\nHe said Kasich has the most experience, qualifications and makes decisions on an ethical basis without fear of standing up for what\u2019s right, and following the rule of law \u2014 whether or not he happens to agree with it personally.\n\nHow about you? Did you vote? Tell us who you voted for and why in the comments.\n\nPhoto No. 3: Bethel voting offials at Stony Hill Fire Department: Carol Olson, Eileen Freebairn and Linda Ryan\n\n\n\nPhotos by Wendy Mitchell", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Bethel, CT Patch", "description": "Voters said human rights, women's rights and ISIS were some of the most important issues for why they came out on a dreary Tuesday to vote.", "title": "2016 Presidential Primaries: Who Did You Vote for and Why?", "url": "http://patch.com/connecticut/bethel/2016-presidential-primaries-who-did-you-vote-why-0", "image": "http://cdn.patch.com/users/22817504/2016/04/T800x600/201604571ff609b5313.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": 116541048368485, "section": "Politics & Government", "published_time": "2016-04-26T19:19:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:03:01-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521361477908471}, "description": "Bethel, CT - Voters said human rights, women's rights and ISIS were some of the most important issues for why they came out on a dreary Tuesday to vote.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Voters said human rights, women's rights and ISIS were some of the most important issues for why they came out on a dreary Tuesday to vote.\nA steady stream of people came out to their designated polling places to exercise their right to vote.\nYoung voters flocked to the polls including Chance Davis, 20, of Bethel, who registered for the first time to vote in order to support Hillary Clinton.\n\u201cI wanted to vote for Sanders but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for that yet,\u201d she laughed.\n\"I voted for Bernie,\" Walsh said, because of \"human rights, women's rights, economic equity."}
