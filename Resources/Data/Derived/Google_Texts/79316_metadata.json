A 2014 survey showed that the problem is prevalent in the region, says Miriam Schwarz, WCMS director.\n\nAsheville psychiatrist Dr. Adrienne Coopey, for example, had been working repeated stretches of 12 days in a row.\n\n\u201cI was really trying to do my best at work in meeting everyone\u2019s expectations,\u201d Coopey says. \u201cBut I was tired. I didn\u2019t really want to go to work. There\u2019s a lack of motivation to continue your work because you don\u2019t feel effective at it. It can be very much like depression.\n\n\u201cI deal with traumatized children, which can be a pretty stressful work environment. I was experiencing conversations with insurance companies telling me a child didn\u2019t need to be in the hospital and I should discharge them, but I knew that was wrong.\u201d\n\nCoopey says she was able to make changes in her personal and professional life that helped her to better manage the stress. But with the recognition that doctors across the region are facing similar problems, WCMS members and leaders are trying to do something to address it.\n\nThe issue of physician burnout came to the medical society\u2019s attention last year during its strategic planning process, which involved interviewing more than 100 doctors, practice managers, CEOs and others across the region, says Schwarz.\n\n\u201cWe take all the data we collect and look for trends,\u201d she says.\n\nInterviews with both private physicians and those employed by hospitals revealed that burnout is widespread and growing.\n\n\u201cThis was startling to us, because physicians tend to keep these kind of issues internalized,\u201d Schwarz says. \u201cPhysicians have very rigorous educational requirements that they need to fulfill, and expectations are very, very high for them to excel. I think there\u2019s an expectation that physicians need to appear externally to be strong, unflappable, compassionate and frankly to be more composed human beings than most of the rest of us.\u201d\n\nIn a recent Medscape.com nationwide survey, 46 percent of doctors said they were experiencing burnout.\n\n\u201cThe study validated what we were seeing locally,\u201d Schwarz says. \u201cWhen we identified burnout as a key issue, we decided to develop a strategic plan to address it. Because the medical society is a physicians organization supporting physicians across Western North Carolina, it made a lot of sense for us to take action.\u201d\n\nThe society plans to bring in a physician-burnout expert who will conduct a forum for doctors, spouses and partners, she explains. The goal is to work together to define burnout and come up with personal and organizational plans to address it.\n\nThe society also is researching physician wellness programs in preparation for establishing one here, Schwarz says. WCMS will consider a mentoring program, too \u2014 one that would match experienced doctors with those who need help to \u201cnavigate the choppy waters of health care,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a sharp increase in burnout because in addition to their high-stress jobs, they are in the midst of great upheaval and experimentation and uncertainty about their future in health care,\u201d she says. \u201cWe think that if we don\u2019t address this problem, we\u2019ll see physicians leaving the practice of medicine, and those who stay will continue to spiral downward if we don\u2019t give them the help they need.\u201d\n\nAsheville obstetrician/gynecologist Dr. Robert Henderson says he experienced burnout while in private practice in Texas and serving as director of resident education at a medical school. Now president of WCMS, he says that pushing himself too hard took its toll.\n\n\u201cYou reach a point where you don\u2019t enjoy the practice of medicine like you used to,\u201d says Henderson. \u201cAnd you want to withdraw from people when you\u2019re not working. You reach a point where you don\u2019t have satisfaction and pleasure in engaging with your family. That\u2019s what I experienced.\u201d\n\nBurnout can become severe enough that it affects patient care, he adds. When he served on the Texas Medical Board, violations by doctors cited by the board nearly always involved physician burnout, Henderson recalls.\n\nFurther, with fundamental changes in the structure of the country\u2019s health care system, doctors increasingly have more to worry about, Schwarz says. There is a growing emphasis on data collection and other time-consuming administrative requirements, including the introduction of electronic health records.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is changing the way doctors and hospitals are reimbursed from the traditional fee-for-service model to a system that rewards keeping people healthy and out of the hospital, she continues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really turning the health care system on its head,\u201d Schwarz says. \u201cWe\u2019re in a transition from volume-based care to getting paid to manage population health. That brings a whole host of additional skill sets that physicians need to learn and apply. They\u2019ve never done it before, hence the uncertainty and the feeling that they\u2019re in a great experiment.\u201d\n\nCoopey says the new method of reimbursement means more doctors are forced to become employees of hospital systems, adding to a lack of control. Then there\u2019s the frustration and paperwork involved in dealing with insurance companies for doctors trying to do what\u2019s best for their patients, she says.\n\n\u201cSo even when physicians know they are making the right decision for patients, they may have to argue with an insurance company or a hospital system to get that need met \u2026 or the system doesn\u2019t give us the tools we need to help,\u201d she says.\n\nRespect for doctors has declined, too, leading to decreased job satisfaction, Coopey believes. She regularly talks with doctors considering leaving the profession, she says.\n\n\u201cWhat they hoped and dreamt as a child for being a doctor has not come to fruition,\u201d Coopey says. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost physicians in this community because of burnout. They no longer practice clinical medicine at all.\u201d\n\nHenderson says young doctors feel the stress of large debts accumulated to obtain their education and training, while revenues have declined. He cites \u201cgovernment intrusion into the physician-patient relationship,\u201d including a Florida law preventing doctors from discussing the dangers of firearms in the home and a proposal in the N.C. General Assembly to restrict what physicians can discuss with their patients regarding abortion services.\n\nCoopey says being a doctor is stressful enough even without the added burdens.\n\n\u201cPeople are dealing with death and illness and things that are out of their control, but as physicians we feel responsible for our patients and we want to help them get better,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a lack of recognition for all the years of hard work we\u2019ve put in when we have to argue with an insurance company to give patients what they need, or the system we\u2019re working in doesn\u2019t give us the tools we need to help the patient.\u201d\n\nMORE INFO\n\nWestern Carolina Medical Society: mywcms.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Doctors, nurses, psychiatrists and other medical professionals are getting burned out, and the Asheville-based physicians organization Western Carolina Medical Society has taken notice.", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "og": {"site_name": "Mountain Xpress", "description": "Doctors, nurses, psychiatrists and other medical professionals are getting burned out, and the Asheville-based physicians organization Western Carolina Medical Society has taken notice.", "title": "Western Carolina Medical Society tackles physician burnout", "url": "http://mountainx.com/living/medical-society-tackles-physician-burnout/", "image": "https://mountainx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bob-1-1100x732.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@mxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"section": "living"}, "theme-color": "#642D91"}, "article_summary": "Doctors, nurses, psychiatrists and other medical professionals are getting burned out, and the Asheville-based physicians organization Western Carolina Medical Society has taken notice.\nFurther, with fundamental changes in the structure of the country\u2019s health care system, doctors increasingly have more to worry about, Schwarz says.\nThat brings a whole host of additional skill sets that physicians need to learn and apply.\nWhen he served on the Texas Medical Board, violations by doctors cited by the board nearly always involved physician burnout, Henderson recalls.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really turning the health care system on its head,\u201d Schwarz says."}
