A set of twin boys have died following a house fire in Pratt.

The fire broke out shortly before 3 p.m. on Monday in the 600 block of High Street.

The boys' aunt told KAKE's Lily Wu at the scene that the child's mother escaped the fire, but she could not save her two twin boys who were 23-months-old.

"Words can't describe what our family's going through," said Sara Lopez, aunt. "We've been overwhelmed with support from our family and friends, and we're grateful for this community that we live in."

In a news release from the Pratt Police Department, authorities said the home was consumed in fire when emergency personnel arrived on scene.

Police said "crews worked diligently to rescue the children, who were pronounced dead at the scene."

The children have been identified as Jayce and Jasper Ibarra, who were born on January 10th.

The children's mother has been identified as 24-year-old Destry Ibarra. She was transported to the burn unit at Via Christi-St. Francis in Wichita and was released this afternoon.

Police said the children's father was not home at the time of the fire.

Family members were told the fire may have been an accident.

"The fire marshal, they said it was an accident, whether it was electrical, furnace, heater, we still don't know that," said Lopez.

The Pratt Police Department is working with the Kansas Fire Marshal to determine the cause of the fire. They expect to release more information next week.

Funeral arrangements are being made through Larrison Family Mortuaries. The Red Cross is assisting the family in this time of need.
