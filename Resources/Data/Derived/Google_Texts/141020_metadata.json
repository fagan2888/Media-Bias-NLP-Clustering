Lois Wolk of Davis says she\u2019s still trying to secure votes for SB128 to pass the Assembly Health Committee.\n\nThe issue gained traction nationally after 29-year-old Brittany Maynard moved from California to Oregon to end her life in November. Wolk\u2019s bill allowing doctors to prescribe fatal drugs has already advanced out of the state Senate.\n\nThe California Medical Association dropped its opposition to SB128, but the Catholic Church and other religious groups are still fighting it.\n\nThe first of four remaining votes on the bill is now scheduled for July 7. Gov. Jerry Brown, a former Jesuit seminarian, has not taken a position.\n\nThe bill requires two doctors to confirm a prognosis that the patient who asks for the lethal drugs has six months or less to live, and has the mental capacity to make medical decisions. Patients would have to be able to take the drugs themselves without assistance.\n\nOpponents say legalizing assisted suicide presents opportunities for disabled or elderly people to be coerced into taking lethal medication by heirs, or indirectly by insurance companies who deny expensive, life-sustaining treatments.\n\n\u201cThis bill is simply about protecting doctors and HMOs from liability and tells people with disabilities who face a terminal diagnosis, that may well prove inaccurate, that there is no dignity in our lives,\u201d said Marilyn Golden, senior policy analyst at the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund, after the Senate approved the bill on June 4. \u201cAssisted suicide is dangerous.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
