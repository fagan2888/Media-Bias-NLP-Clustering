Hundreds of friends, fans and family members of Rodney Hood gathered at the Boys and Girls Club of Lauderdale County to spend time with the former Meridian High School basketball star before he flies back to Utah for training camp.

Rodney's father, Ricky Hood, is the executive director of the local chapter. He told stories to the crowd, both humorous and sincere, about Rodney's rise to Meridian High School, Duke University and the NBA, making sure everyone knew his ascent was a result of hours of practice and not just natural ability.

Mr. Hood said it's good for the youth to learn from his story.

"He did it through hard work, and he continues to do it through hard work," said Hood.

Rodney will fly to Utah to meet up with his Jazz teammates before they begin summer league basketball in Las Vegas, Nevada.
