James Lankford, R-Okla., spearheaded the Senate\u2019s move to defund the organization, but the senator is taking a more cautious approach following his bill\u2019s defeat last week.\n\n\u201cA government shutdown is not what Sen. Lankford is advocating for, but he plans on exploring all possible options to redirect Planned Parenthood taxpayer funding,\u201d a spokesman for Lankford told The Daily Signal.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, meanwhile, has not backed away from a shutdown, promising to use \u201cevery procedural means\u201d available to block the more than $500 million in federal grants allocated to the group annually.\n\n\u201cOf course federal taxpayer funds should not go to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise that is committing a pattern of felonies selling the body parts of unborn children,\u201d Cruz told reporters Friday.\n\n\u201cAlready President Obama and Harry Reid are threatening a shutdown because their partisan commitment to Planned Parenthood is so extreme they would be willing to try to force a government shutdown in order to continue sending millions in taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, also plans to reject the spending bill, but he told The New York Times that while he is against Planned Parenthood, he would have rejected the measure regardless.\n\n\u201cContinuing resolutions are problematic for a number of reasons,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublican leaders, including McConnell, have pushed to defund Planned Parenthood following the release of five covert videos alleging to show top officials from the organization discussing the sale of fetal tissue for medical research.\n\nThe Senate voted last week on legislation introduced by Lankford along with Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., that would have defunded the group, but the bill fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance, splitting along party lines in the final 53-46 roll call.\n\nThe approach to block funds to Planned Parenthood is reminiscent of the battle leading up to the 2013 government shutdown after Republicans rejected a spending bill including funding for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been down this path before,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThis is a tactic that\u2019s been tried going back to the \u201990s, frequently by Republican majorities that always have the same ending: that the focus is on the fact that the government is shut down, not on what the underlying issue that is being protested is.\u201d\n\nMcConnell said lawmakers would negotiate a budget deal before the government\u2019s funds expire.\n\n\u201cEach side will have to give some things they don\u2019t want to give and we\u2019ll get to an agreement,\u201d he said.\n\nHe vowed that the Senate would continue to investigate Planned Parenthood and find other routes to \u201cmake our voices heard.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Opinions are divided over letting a government shutdown occur.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Opinions are divided over letting a government shutdown occur.", "title": "Republicans Splinter Over Planned Parenthood Defund Strategy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150810_PPFunding_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-10T22:42:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1guhnW1"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Opinions are divided over letting a government shutdown occur.", "title": "Republicans Splinter Over Planned Parenthood Defund Strategy", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150810_PPFunding_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-08-10T19:41:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-10T22:42:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Mitch McConnell, James Lankford, Ted Cruz, government shutdown"}, "article_summary": "He vowed that the Senate would continue to investigate Planned Parenthood and find other routes to \u201cmake our voices heard.\u201d\nThe fate of a spending bill required to keep the government running remains uncertain as Republicans enter the August recess divided over tactics to strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood.\nThe approach to block funds to Planned Parenthood is reminiscent of the battle leading up to the 2013 government shutdown after Republicans rejected a spending bill including funding for Obamacare.\n\u201cA government shutdown is not what Sen.
