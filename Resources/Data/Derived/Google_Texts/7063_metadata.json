And Sanders will re-introduce similar legislation in the next couple of weeks.\n\nPNHP has endorsed a rival single payer bill \u2014 HR 676 \u2014 which currently has 52 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives \u2013 although not one of the co-sponsors has publicly called for HR 676 to replace Obamacare. HR 676 would create a national single payer system.\n\nIt became clear from Himmelstein\u2019s mini skirmish with Shulmin \u2014 and in a breakout session later in the day titled \u201cVermont\u2019s \u2018Pathway to Single Payer\u2019 \u2014 that Himmelstein has real misgivings about the state by state approach.\n\n\u201cIn fact, you are not going to be able to enact a single payer program,\u201d Himmelstein told Shumlin during the question and answer period.\n\n\u201cYeah we are,\u201d Shumlin shot back.\n\n\u201cWell, by definition, if you\u2019ve got Medicare, Tricare \u2013\u201d Himmelstein said.\n\n\u201cYou have written us off before we have tried,\u201d Shumlin responded.\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Himmelstein said. \u201cI\u2019m actually just saying what\u2019s true. And that is, you can have a publicly financed program, and as Deb [Richter] said, it won\u2019t be single payer. It will be enormous progress. But let\u2019s not confuse it with single payer because you will give up much of the advantage of the single payer program.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me just say, I agree with you,\u201d Shumlin told Himmelstein. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to try to get the waivers to get everybody [in Vermont] in the pool \u2014 everybody. I want everybody in the pool.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat of course will take an act of Congress,\u201d Himmelstein answered.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cBut if you help me get rid of those Tea Party nuts in 2014, I\u2019ll get it done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other source of concern is the movement to ACOs (Accountable Care Organizations) in your state,\u201d Himmelstein said. \u201cAnd it is an ACO that is a for profit corporation [OneCare Vermont] that is the dominant provider in your state. It\u2019s essentially a private planner of health care in your state. That\u2019s of great concern. It\u2019s a move to an organization for which there is no evidence that it will save money or improve care. We have grave concerns about that as a first step to single payer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou make a good point,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cBut let me be clear. Listen. I was not Governor when the Affordable Care Act passed. As a Governor, I had two choices \u2014 implement the bill myself with federal dollars, or have the federal government do it for me. I chose to go it my own way. That doesn\u2019t mean that I believe that the Affordable Care Act is my best friend. So, don\u2019t confuse what I have to do under federal law as a Governor and where I\u2019m going in 2017.\u201d\n\nAt the breakout session afterward, Himmelstein laid out in detail his concern with state based campaigns for single payer.\n\nWhile acknowledging the political positives of organizing and raising the single payer banner at the state level, Himmelstein said there were serious obstacles to implementing single payer at the state level \u2014 starting with Medicare waivers.\n\n\u201cThe President can give Medicaid waivers,\u201d Himmelstein said. \u201cBut a Medicare waiver \u2014 to stop Medicare from requiring a patient by patient documentation of what is done, or to dump everybody into a state run Medicare managed care firm \u2014 that takes an act of Congress. We can\u2019t actually get Medicare into this system without Congressional approval. Similarly, we can\u2019t get federal retirees and federal workers without Congressional action.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means that the best a state plan can be is a very partial single payer plan where there has to be someone making the effort to maintain per patient billing for part of the system. That attenuates a very substantial part of the administrative savings. We think it is something like 30 percent to 50 percent of the administrative savings have to be lost by doing that.\u201d\n\nHimmelstein pointed to other areas that make state single payer problematic.\n\n\u201cIf you can get a waiver for Vermont to do better, you can get a waiver for Alabama to do worse,\u201d Himmelstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s a Pandora\u2019s box that we need to be very careful about opening for Medicare. We\u2019ve already opened it for Medicaid. And a couple of states have done good things with Medicaid. But let\u2019s remember that Arkansas has used that opportunity to completely privatize the Medicaid program. So, Arkansas is essentially abolishing government\u2019s role in Medicaid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that as we press for waivers, we not open the box for states to do worse things,\u201d Himmelstein said.\n\nHimmelstein also warned that \u201cthe political power of corporations is highly portable.\u201d\n\n\u201cVermont offers the best case scenario,\u201d Himmelstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve been so happy to see the work in Vermont. As Governor Shumlin said, they seem the best positioned to resist an avalanche of outside money. And it\u2019s partly because there has been such exemplary activism and grassroots efforts there. But it\u2019s partly because the scale of political activity in the state allows for person to person influence that would be very difficult in a state like New York or a state like California where media plays such a major role.\u201d\n\nHimmelstein said that most large employers are self insured and the federal ERISA law precludes states from regulating employee benefits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s legally a little bit tricky on whether we can get them to participate in this [Vermont] plan,\u201d Himmelstein said. \u201cIf you have a universal tax, you can get employers to pay it. Almost certainly, an individual income tax would stand up to federal court scrutiny. But [in a state single payer plan] you can\u2019t prohibit employers from offering parallel private coverage. That\u2019s almost certain. And parallel private coverage is a real problem.\u201d\n\nHimmelstein said while that one can make \u201csubstantial and important progress\u201d at the state level, and politically the state efforts can be extremely important to the movement, \u201cactually implementing single payer and achieving the full benefits of what can be achieved requires Washington\u2019s work.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we think about the relationship between state and national work, these have to be part of the same effort. They are inseparable. The state work can certainly feed our national efforts. It certainly can\u2019t go forward over the long term without the national efforts to support them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 3.8.14"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9928\"", "article_summary": "And the back and forth exposed a developing fault line within the single payer movement over the question of priorities \u2014 state versus national single payer?\nBut let\u2019s not confuse it with single payer because you will give up much of the advantage of the single payer program.\u201d\u201cLet me just say, I agree with you,\u201d Shumlin told Himmelstein.\n\u201cIn fact, you are not going to be able to enact a single payer program,\u201d Himmelstein told Shumlin during the question and answer period.\nAnd he did give his speech to the more than 400 doctors, medical students and activists who filled the Seaport Boston Hotel ballroom, touting his \u201csingle payer\u201d plan in Vermont and being praised in return for raising the single payer banner.\nBut [in a state single payer plan] you can\u2019t prohibit employers from offering parallel private coverage."}
