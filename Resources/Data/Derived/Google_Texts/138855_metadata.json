We must find creative ways of making health promotion a central part of community and economic development.\n\n\u201cIn these and many other ways, the inextricable, often stress-laden link between financial well-being and physical and mental health must become the centerpiece of public understanding and public policy. Both our economic health as a nation and the very lives of the American people depend on it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#a51417", "application-name": "Washington University in St. Louis", "og": {"site_name": "The Source", "description": "More and better health care will be necessary, but not sufficient, to advance better overall population health and to address lingering health disparities, says Jason Purnell, an expert on public health at Washington University in St. Louis.
