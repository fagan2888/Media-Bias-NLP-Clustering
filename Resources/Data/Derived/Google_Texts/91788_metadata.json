During a press conference for this year\u2019s Berlin Film Festival, where she serves on a panel of judges, Streep was asked about the fact that all of the panelists are white. Would she be able to understand a movie from, say, the Middle East or North Africa?\n\n\u201cThere is a core of humanity that travels right through every culture, and after all, we\u2019re all from Africa originally,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all Africans, we\u2019re all Berliners.\u201d Clearly she was having what Matt Damon was having.\n\nFollowing Streep\u2019s unfortunate comments, Eddie Redmayne decided join the foot-in-mouth party. On the BAFTAs red carpet, Redmayne was asked about playing Lili Elbe, the transgender painter whose story inspired \u201cThe Danish Girl.\u201d The 34-year-old responded, \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary how trans issues have come into the mainstream media since we made \u2018Danish Girl,\u2019\u201d appearing to take credit for the work being done by Janet Mock and Laverne Cox, as well as trans activists all over the world. (He later walked back the remarks.)\n\nThese myriad controversies were yet another reminder that it\u2019s dangerous to put too much stock in what celebrities have to say because, well, Katharine Hepburn didn\u2019t calling acting \u201cthe perfect idiot\u2019s profession\u201d for nothing. If you need further proof, here\u2019s a roundup of the most tone-deaf, ridiculous and just plain dumb comments from famous actors.\n\n1. Lindsay Lohan wants to turn your Hurricane Sandy frown upside down\n\nIn 2012, New Yorkers braced for the onslaught of Hurricane Sandy, but \u201cI Know Who Killed Me\u201d actress Lindsay Lohan refused to let a little thing like the bitterly destructive force of Mother Nature\u2019s wrath get her down. \u201cWHY is everyone in SUCH a panic about hurricane (i\u2019m calling it Sally)..? Stop projecting negativity! Think positive and pray for peace,\u201d the 29-year-old actress tweeted to her followers.\n\nSandy was the second-most destructive hurricane in history, causing an estimated $32 million billion in damage to the East Coast; 53 people were killed.\n\n2. Russell Crowe thinks that women over 40 might get work if they weren\u2019t so sad and desperate\n\nDear women over 40: Russell Crowe has heard your complaints about ageism in Hollywood, and he thinks they\u2019re bullshit. In an interview with the Australian magazine Women\u2019s Weekly, the Oscar-winner advised actresses to act their age. \u201cThe best thing about the industry I\u2019m in\u2014movies\u2014is that there are roles for people in all different stages of life,\u201d Crowe said. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find that the woman who is saying that [the roles have dried up] is the woman who at 40, 45, 48, still wants to play the ing\u00e9nue, and can\u2019t understand why she\u2019s not being cast as the 21-year-old.\u201d\n\nThe numbers, of course, prove Crowe wrong. The reason women\u2019s roles dry up as they age is because there are fewer parts written for them. While men over 40 represent 53 percent of male speaking parts in films, women over 40 account for just 30 percent.\n\n3. Arnold comes out against same-sex marriage\u2014we think?\n\nSCOTUS finally ruled in favor of marriage equality last year after a decade of heated debate on granting same-sex couples the right to marry. Back in 2003, former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced his support for same-sex unions on Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show\u2014so long as the couple enjoying them is heterosexual. \u201cI think that gay marriage is something that should be between a man and a woman,\u201d Schwarzenegger said.\n\nMany have claimed the Terminator misspoke, but he could have also been a big fan of Liza Minnelli and David Gest.\n\n4. Elizabeth Hurley probably thinks you\u2019re fat\n\nElizabeth Hurley is notorious for throwing shade at any woman who isn\u2019t rail-thin. In 2005, the actress/model, currently appearing in \u201cThe Royals,\u201d told the London Mirror that she was tired of women wearing clothing that was \u201ctoo small or too tight, unless you\u2019re slim and toned.\u201d Hurley said, \u201cI\u2019m sick of seeing flab bulging out all over.\u201d Her most notorious remark, however, was directed at famed beauty Marilyn Monroe. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought Marilyn Monroe looked fabulous, but I\u2019d kill myself if I was that fat,\u201d she once told Allure, remarking on the fact that the famed beauty was a size 16.\n\nIn truth, vintage sizes are very different than modern clothing, and today, Monroe would be a 4 or a 6. The average American woman, however, is a 14\u2014meaning that Elizabeth Hurley would kill herself if she looked like the majority of women in the U.S.\n\n5. Morgan Freeman and Stacey Dash are so post-racial\n\nProof that white people don\u2019t have a total monopoly on saying really stupid things: Morgan Freeman called for an end to Black History Month back in 2005. His reasoning starts off sound: \u201cYou\u2019re going to relegate my history to a month?\u201d he asked \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want a black history month. Black history is American history.\u201d But it quickly goes downhill from there.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lately, it seems like actors can't stop saying dumb things to the press\u2014it's all part of a long Hollywood tradition", "title": "The 10 dumbest celebrity quotes ever: \u201cGay marriage is something that should be between a man and a woman\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Lately, it seems like actors can't stop saying dumb things to the press\u2014it's all part of a long Hollywood tradition", "title": "The 10 dumbest celebrity quotes ever: \u201cGay marriage is something that should be between a man and a woman\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/20/the_10_dumbest_celebrity_quotes_ever_gay_marriage_is_something_that_should_be_between_a_man_and_a_woman/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/hasselhoff_kardashian_crowe.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lately, it seems like actors can't stop saying dumb things to the press\u2014it's all part of a long Hollywood tradition", "title": "The 10 dumbest celebrity quotes ever: \u201cGay marriage is something that should be between a man and a woman\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/hasselhoff_kardashian_crowe.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nico Lang", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Arnold Schwarzenegger, celebrities, david hasselhoff, Editor's Picks, elizabeth hurley, Hollywood, Kim Kardashian, Lindsay Lohan, morgran freeman, raven-symone, Russell Crowe, sienna miller", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Elizabeth Hurley probably thinks you\u2019re fatElizabeth Hurley is notorious for throwing shade at any woman who isn\u2019t rail-thin.\n\u201cI think that gay marriage is something that should be between a man and a woman,\u201d Schwarzenegger said.\nWhile men over 40 represent 53 percent of male speaking parts in films, women over 40 account for just 30 percent.\nThe average American woman, however, is a 14\u2014meaning that Elizabeth Hurley would kill herself if she looked like the majority of women in the U.S.5.\nRussell Crowe thinks that women over 40 might get work if they weren\u2019t so sad and desperateDear women over 40: Russell Crowe has heard your complaints about ageism in Hollywood, and he thinks they\u2019re bullshit."}
