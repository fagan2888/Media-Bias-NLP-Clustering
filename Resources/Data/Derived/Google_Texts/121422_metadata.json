What do you think of the ESL increase? Leave a comment below.\n\nTHE CASE FOR\n\nTOM KOUTSANTONIS\n\nTHE State Government will immediately return the discounts to the Emergency Services Levy if Tony Abbott overturns the $898 million cuts over four years to South Australia.\n\nTony Abbott is failing South Australia. He is letting Holden close its doors in 2017, he is planning to have our submarines built in Japan instead of South Australia and he is ripping up agreements to fund our hospitals and schools.\n\nTony Abbott thinks he can sit in his ivory tower in Canberra and expect there to be no consequences. But there are.\n\nThe direct cause and only reason for an increase to your Emergency Services Levy is because Tony Abbott cut $898 million over the next four years from health and education in South Australia.\n\nTony Abbott\u2019s cruel cuts to health alone are the equivalent of closing an entire hospital, removing 600 beds from the system or doubling elective surgery waiting times. These cuts are unsustainable.\n\nThese cuts were delivered just a few weeks before the South Australian State Budget was due to be finalised.\n\nIt meant the State Government was forced to make difficult choices in a very short space of time.\n\nTo cover just half of Tony Abbott\u2019s cuts to health we removed the general remission (discount) that we provided on the Emergency Services Levy and directed that funding (approximately $90 million per year) to our health system.\n\nIt is not something we wanted to do but that we had to do if we are to continue to keep our hospitals open.\n\nBy removing the discounts, taxpayers are now paying the full amount of the Emergency Services Levy. Every dollar people pay on their Emergency Services Levy goes to emergency services organisations that keep our communities safe.\n\nThe Emergency Services Levy, introduced by the Liberal Party, was the fairest, most equitable option we had to address the cuts imposed on South Australia.\n\nWe wish we could protect all South Australians from Tony Abbott\u2019s cuts. We have ensured our most vulnerable are protected - with pensioners and concession card holders receiving no increase on their Emergency Services Levy.\n\nBut the discounts on the Emergency Services Levy can be returned immediately.\n\nJoin our campaign Federal Cuts Hurt at federalcutshurt.com.au and help us fight Tony Abbott\u2019s cuts.\n\nIf Tony Abbott overturns his $898 million cuts to South Australia, we will return the discounts to the Emergency Services Levy.\n\nTom Koutsantonis is Treasurer of South Australia\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE CASE AGAINST\n\nSTEVEN MARSHALL\n\nHOUSEHOLDS and businesses across the state have slowly been receiving their Emergency Services Levy bill over recent weeks. It\u2019s fair to say almost everyone has been shocked by the massive increases.\n\nSome bills have increased by over one thousand per cent. Charities, schools, multicultural groups, farmers and homeowners have all been slugged.\n\nAnd Labor said nothing about this before the last election. The people of South Australia have been deceived on a massive scale by this Labor Government.\n\nYou could be forgiven for thinking that these increases will provide more money for emergency services in South Australia.\n\nBut they won\u2019t be getting a single cent from these hikes. The extra money Labor are gouging from us won\u2019t buy a single new fire engine or employ any additional emergency personnel.\n\nPerhaps the deepest cut of all is that while Labor have ratcheted up the ESL, they continue to deny CFS volunteers the same cancer compensation that is provided the paid fire fighters.\n\nLabor\u2019s increase in the ESL will reap them about $90 million extra per year, while last year\u2019s budget deficit was the largest in the state\u2019s history.\n\nThey can\u2019t manage the State budget, so they\u2019re slugging the household budget.\n\nJay Weatherill and Tom Koutsantonis have tried to con South Australians that these increases are somehow connected to the Federal Budget.\n\nThe simple fact is that every other state in Australia has the same federal budget, and none of them have jacked up taxes because of it.\n\nWeatherill and Koutsantonis have to stop the whinging and take responsibility for their economic vandalism of the South Australian economy.\n\nAt the last election, we promised no new taxes and had a plan to reduce the tax burden on South Australians.\n\nWe would never have done what Labor have and increased the ESL. If Geoff Brock and Martin Hamilton-Smith switched their support tomorrow, we would immediately reverse these increases.\n\nWe need to focus on creating jobs in South Australia and helping families with rising cost of living pressures. We need to make sure our next generation stays in South Australia and that this state has the opportunities to attract the best and the brightest to make their future here.\n\nLabor\u2019s increase to the ESL simply does the opposite of that.\n\nSteven Marshall is leader of the State Opposition\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nROGER FLAVELL\n\nThe Emergency Services Levy has gone up by 1000 per cent or more in places and made people very unhappy. They want the Government to understand it is unacceptable.\n\nIn metro area it has gone up by 100 per cent. The further you are from the city the more it has gone up.\n\nVolunteers right across the state are very angry regarding the levy and (emergency services) sector reform (proposal announced last month). It is causing considerable angst\n\nIt appears to volunteers and farmers that Government is just not listening to what they are being told. It\u2019s time the Government stopped and thought about where its food comes from.\n\nIt is a concern for the CFS. We rely heavily on farmers in those country areas.\n\nFarmers and their fire units are extremely important to get on top of fires early, often before fire trucks get there.\n\nA lot of farmers are saying where they used to go 10km, if this is the way the Government is going to treat us perhaps we will just do our place and the neighbours and the rest will have to look after themselves.\n\nThe big worry is if they can\u2019t assist as much in the future it will put a high load back on to volunteers and the incidents will get larger before they get to them.\n\nThe rural sector has been really struggling for a long time and one day people will just say how do we keep going.\n\nThere will come a time when it gets too hard for volunteers and it (emergency services response) will need to be handed over to paid people.\n\nRoger Flavell is the president of the CFS Volunteers Association\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nIAN YATES\n\nThe problem is how quick the rise is coming in and the proportion of it.\n\nIt\u2019s a very large increase at very short notice which makes it hard for people like self-funded retirees who have a fixed income to adjust their budgets to absorb the shortfall.\n\nThe changes in Federal Government funds could have been spread across other measures rather than being lumped into the ESL.\n\nAnd people are confused because the Commonwealth cuts were in health and education but the ESL is meant to fund the emergency services.\n\nThe ESL was always an odd way of taking taxes because it had all of the different subsides and the effect of taking them away has is being felt most strongly by average families and farmers.\n\nIan Yates is chief executive of the SA Council for the Ageing.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nMARGARET KOHLHAGEN\n\nThe government needs to realise that they are putting private landlords out of business because some of them will end up selling because they won\u2019t be able to make ends meet, between their mortgages, council rates, emergency services levies, management fees, etc, it will send a lot of private landlords to the wall financially.\n\nWhen you look at a lot of landlords, they are picking up tenants that the Housing Trust are no longer housing, they are no longer able to provide affordable rent to them if the government continues to increase our fees.\n\nAny landlord that is going to incur a massive increase, at the end of the day it will be the consumer that is going to have to pay, the consumer here is the landlord who will pass it on to the tenant.\n\nIt\u2019s going to have an impact on rentals - it may not be imminent - but you will see it when leases are being renewed. I\u2019d say rents would go up by a minimum $10 or $20 a week.\n\nMargarat Kohlhagen is Landlords Association of SA president", "article_metadata": {"description": "THE CASE FOR", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/opinion/emergency-services-levy-increase-provokes-heated-discussion-within-south-australian-community/news-story/7f0d0bd067df60adf0242cef9414ca21", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3a66a130b39b1ec64aa15afbf7820ae6", "type": "article", "description": "THE CASE FOR", "title": "Levy hike prompts heated discussion"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3a66a130b39b1ec64aa15afbf7820ae6", "title": "Levy hike prompts heated discussion", "description": "THE CASE FOR", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@theTiser"}, "robots": "noarchive", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/7f0d0bd067df60adf0242cef9414ca21?domain=adelaidenow.com.au"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "articleid": "7f0d0bd067df60adf0242cef9414ca21", "keywords": "emergency services, State budget, heated discussion, Landlords Association, private landlords, Levy hike, emergency services organisations, emergency services response, emergency services levies, emergency services levy, widespread community anger, concession card holders, Australian State, cancer compensation, Australian economy, council rates, health system, fire engine, paid fire fighters, communities safe, federal budget, fire units, management fees, metro area, dollar people pay, sector reform, tax burden, helping families, budget deficit, day people, Japan, Australia, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, South Australia, Liberal Party, State Government, Federal Government, Housing Trust, SA Council for the Ageing, CFS Volunteers Association, Tony Abbott, Martin Hamilton-Smith, Steven Marshall, Roger Flavell, Geoff Brock, Jay Weatherill, Tom Koutsantonis", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-19T11:59:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-10-19T12:17:51.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03a7\"", "article_summary": "Every dollar people pay on their Emergency Services Levy goes to emergency services organisations that keep our communities safe.\nBy removing the discounts, taxpayers are now paying the full amount of the Emergency Services Levy.\nWe have ensured our most vulnerable are protected - with pensioners and concession card holders receiving no increase on their Emergency Services Levy.\nBut the discounts on the Emergency Services Levy can be returned immediately.\nIf Tony Abbott overturns his $898 million cuts to South Australia, we will return the discounts to the Emergency Services Levy."}
