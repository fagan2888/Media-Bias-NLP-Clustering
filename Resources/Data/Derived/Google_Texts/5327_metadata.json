Factors such as body mass index were considerably lower for generally wealthier neighborhoods, like those in West Los Angeles, especially when compared to the generally low-income neighborhoods in South Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to the study, only 10 people residing in West Los Angeles are obese, while 33 percent of those living in South Los Angeles are.\n\nBody Mass Index by Service Planning Area\n\nThe data highlighted other alarming trends as well. Only 78 percent of South Los Angeles residents reported having easy access to fresh produce, compared with 96 percent of those in West Los Angeles. South Los Angeles residents also ranked first in those not able to afford medication (19 percent), to visit the doctor (19 percent), or to visit the dentist (35 percent).\n\nIn an effort to bridge this healthcare gap, the City of Los Angeles and some private organizations are trying to help South Los Angeles residents, and those residing in similar low-income communities, live better-balanced lifestyles. By giving low-income families better access to healthy foods, places to exercise, and free or discounted preventive healthcare services, the ultimate goal of the city and other non-profits is to prevent diseases, not just treat them.\n\nOne of the best ways to prevent long-term illnesses, such as diabetes, is through healthy eating, which can be challenging for those who live in South Los Angeles. According to the California Department of Public Health, many neighborhoods in South Los Angeles are filled with low-income residents who do not have easy access to fresh food.\n\nLow Income & Access to Food, West LA Low Income & Access to Food, South LA\n\nRalph Aramirez, a resident of South Los Angeles, says that statistic is absolutely true: \u201cAll that\u2019s around here are liquor stores that sell chips and pork grinds,\u201d he said, which makes life difficult when he is trying to raise two young children to eat healthy.\n\nIn an effort to get his children to eat a nutritious after-school snack, Aramirez occasionally stops by a famers market at the parking lot of his daughter\u2019s school, St. Agnes.\n\nOrganic Vegetables at the St. Agnes Farmers Market\n\nThe farmers market, which takes place from two to six every Wednesday afternoon at St. Agnes Catholic Church and School, is one of the oldest in the city, but it is also one of the only ones in South Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to manager Ida Edwards, the farmers market was originally created in the 1970s to give low-income community members a chance to eat affordable fresh produce, and it still fulfills that goal today.\n\nTo encourage healthier eating habits for low-income South Los Angeles residents, the managers of the farmers market have partnered with Hunger Action Los Angeles (HALA). Every Wednesday, HALA offers those who use Cal Fresh benefits (formerly known as food stamps) at the farmers market a way to get more food for the same amount of money through a program called market match.\n\nHALA's Market Match coupons\n\nWhen a low-income resident uses their Cal Fresh benefits to buy fresh fruit and vegetables from the market, HALA will match the amount they spend through vouchers that can only be used towards fruits and vegetables. For example, if someone purchased $5 worth of vegetables with Cal Fresh benefits, HALA would give them another $5 voucher to spend at the market for free.\n\n\u201cThe idea behind the program is that fresh fruits and vegetables are more expensive, even though they\u2019re needed for a healthy diet, so this [market match] is giving people who are low-income the extra boost they need by matching some of their purchases,\u201d explained Frank Tamborello, the Executive Director of HALA. \u201cThere is a major supermarket across the street, and it\u2019s an expensive one, and other than that, if people are getting any fruits or vegetables, they\u2019re getting them from liquor stores, where they\u2019re going to be over priced and not have much of a selection.\u201d\n\nWhile the farmers market has given South Los Angeles residents access to healthy food for over 30 years, the demand for market match vouchers at St. Agnes typically exceeds the supply, even with a $10 voucher cap per week.\n\n\u201cWe have to budget it, and of course we budget carefully, but for most of the last year we\u2019ve run out of vouchers before the market ends,\u201d Tamborello said.\n\nTamborello knows that more can always be done to better serve the nutrition needs of South Los Angeles and other low-income communities, and he hopes that one day the City of Los Angeles will back the market match program.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that the community at large and the city and the county see this as a preventive health program,\u201d he said. \u201cPromoting people to have a healthy diet \u2013 making it easier for them to do that \u2013 will save money and dollars on the other end of the equation when people have catastrophic health conditions and then the county has to pick up the tab for that.\u201d\n\nWhile the City of Los Angeles has not backed the market match program yet, it has recently stepped up its effort to make South Los Angeles, as well as other neighborhoods around the city, a healthier place to live in other ways. Through the ongoing 50 Parks Initiative, the City of Los Angeles is adding more green space, especially to densely populated areas that lack recreation services, such as South Los Angeles.\n\nThe Hoover Recreation Center is located at the corner of Adams and Hoover in South Los Angeles\n\nParks with exercise machines, like the Hoover Recreation Center in at the corner of Hoover and Adams, allow residents to get their daily exercise in without having to pay expensive gym membership fees. For some, this park is the only place to workout within miles.\n\n\u201cGyms around here? Not so much. Probably the closest one I know is in downtown,\u201d explained Ana Vielman, an employee of the park.\n\nThe Hoover Recreation Center features a running trail, basketball court, sports field, playground and exercise machines outdoors, as well as an open indoor facility for group exercise classes and kids activities.\n\nAnthony Hill, a local resident who proudly flaunts his six-pack abs, is just one of the many people who come to the Hoover Recreation Center to get their exercise in. He chooses to workout at this park \u201cbecause they have good machines, and they actually work.\u201d\n\nLashean Dean, another South Los Angeles resident who uses the machines to workout five days per week, has been coming to the park since before the machines were donated and installed.\n\nShe says that she has noticed a positive change: \u201cI see a lot more people here because they\u2019re [the machines] more accessible in the area.\u201d\n\nThe exercise machines at the park use your body weight for resistance\n\nIn addition to having an outdoor workout space, the Hoover Recreation Center also has staff, like Vielman, that organize affordable group exercise classes and other events indoors to encourage South Los Angeles residents to get their recommended amount of daily activity in.\n\n\u201cThe Zumba classes are $1 per class, and they\u2019re for the whole hour,\u201d Vielman said. She also explained that while they have to keep prices low so that anyone can afford to get in a workout, but they need to set a price because they don\u2019t get funding from any other source.\n\nWhile the Hoover Recreation Center offers easily accessible classes and equipment to the residents of South Los Angeles, it is not always the ideal place to exercise. Although Hill frequents the weight training machines, he also points out that the parks can draw in the \u201cwrong crowd.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is basically a park for the homeless,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just a boring park where people come, they sit down, and they smoke drugs.\u201d\n\nThere also seems to be a disconnect between the condition of the outside facilities and the staff who run the indoor activities. When I first visited the park back in October, the indoor facility was locked, even though a sign posted on the front door read that it should have been open for over an hour.\n\nFurthermore, one of the slides on the playground was blocked off with \u201cCaution\u201d tape back in October, and the staff at the facility said they were unaware of the problem. As of December, the caution tape had been removed, but the slide had still not been fixed.\n\nOctober December\n\nRegardless, in a community where there are no better workout facilities, the exercise equipment and basketball courts are still used every day.\n\n\u201cThey [South Los Angeles residents] are here from like six in the morning to use the facility\u2026 Then you see ladies in the afternoon time, and young people in the evening.\u201d Vielman explained. \u201cEver since they put it [the exercise equipment] in, it\u2019s a gym for the people.\u201d\n\nWhile working out and eating right are crucial to staying healthy, it is also important to get preventive health care. The Affordable Care Act is making it easier for low-income individuals to get an annual physical, but the new health insurance plans and Medicaid do not cover non-emergency dental care for adults.\n\nWhat most people do not realize, however, is that dental care is one of the most important components of preventive medicine. According to the American Dental Association, several studies have shown that, if left untreated, gum disease can cause other health conditions, including diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.\n\nUnfortunately, many neighborhoods in South Los Angeles, including the one around the Hoover Recreation Center and St. Agnes Catholic Church, are in dental health provider shortage areas.\n\n\u201cWhat that means is that the population is so large that there aren\u2019t enough dental providers, even if everyone had insurance,\u201d explained Meyerer Miller, a Project Specialist for community health programs at the University of Southern California\u2019s Ostrow School of Dentistry.\n\nIn order to help the surrounding community maintain their oral health and prevent more serious health conditions, the Ostrow School of Dentistry participates in 10 \u2013 15 events throughout the year. When members of the school attend events like the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books or the American Diabetes Association Expo, they provide oral health screenings exams for free.\n\nLow-income community members can also always stop by the school on USC\u2019s University Park campus for treatment that is priced lower than most private dental offices.\n\n\u201cThe clinics aren\u2019t free, but they are at a low cost,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe try to price care where the people are.\u201d\n\nThanks to grant funding, Ostrow can provide free care to HIV positive patients. The school also partners with Union Rescue Mission downtown to provide dental care for the homeless on Skid Row.\n\nWhile the Ostrow School of Dentistry, Hoover Recreation Center, and St. Agnes farmers market are all helping to improve the health of South Los Angeles residents, there are still more hurdles to overcome.\n\n\u201cA lot of it is not lack of education because we know that the families here know about good nutrition, but what it is, is that people may have schedules that prevent them from taking the time be healthy,\u201d Tamborello explained. \u201cThere are a lot of burdens on someone who is low-income to make ends meet - to survive much less thrive.\u201d\n\nIn addition, these organizations and events only target those who are actively searching for ways to improve their health, and there is no incentive for others in the neighborhood to spend their limited time or money on their health.\n\n\u201cWhat would it take for someone to workout? The willpower, the want, the need, the desire,\u201d Hill said. \u201cYou can\u2019t force a person to pick up a weight.\u201d\n\nAlthough Hill uses the exercise machines at the Hoover Recreation Center to work on his abs, he admits to smoking cigarettes every day. He also does not think that adding more healthy options around South Los Angeles will encourage people, such as himself, to live better-balanced lifestyles.\n\n\u201cPeople are still going to live their life the way they\u2019ve been living their life,\u201d he explained. Hill suggests that one way to increase community participation in wellness initiatives is to give residents an incentive or to make it fun.\n\n\u201cIf there was a weight lifting contest where they [community members] would get paid for it, of course they would do it because there is money involved,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when people play basketball here, people don\u2019t consider this exercising, people consider this fun time.\u201d\n\nAnother problem that these organizations struggle with is raising awareness for their events and services. Even residents like Lashean Dean, who actively looks for ways to live and eat healthy, do not know about all the wellness options available to them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff around here that people just don\u2019t know about,\u201d she said. Dean even thinks something as simple as more advertising, such as with signs, would help South Los Angeles residents be more aware of the wellness opportunities.\n\nOrganizers of wellness services, like Tamborello from HALA or Miller from the Ostrow School of Dentistry, know that the answer is not that simple.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of outreach done\u2026 but we are in need of creating more publicity for the program,\u201d Tamborello said. \u201cSo we\u2019re always trying to get extra funding for this [market match].\u201d\n\nMiller stated, \u201cWe are always looking to expand, but usually funding is the issue.\u201d\n\nWhile non-profits and the City of Los Angeles have taken steps in the right direction, a lot of work still has to be done to tackle the problem and make South Los Angeles a healthier place to live. If Los Angeles wants to have a healthy, promising future for everyone, including those members of low-income communities, more steps have to be taken now to promote wellness in some of the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods.\n\nMiller did offer some hope though that the effort put in by these organizations today will have an even greater impact in the future: \u201cBy providing our students with a spirit of service, we hope they will take that to their practice, and we have had a number of students who do go on to practice in low-income areas.\n\nReach Contributor Theresa Pablos here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The people who need health and wellness initiatives the most, residents of low-income communities, often have the least access to them.", "author": "Theresa Pablos", "og": {"url": "http://www.neontommy.com/news/2014/02/preventive-medicine-low-income-communities", "image": "http://www.neontommy.com/sites/default/files/organicveggies_0.png?1392667230", "type": "article", "description": "The people who need health and wellness initiatives the most, residents of low-income communities, often have the least access to them.", "title": "Preventive Medicine For Low-Income Communities"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 19560893}, "revisit-after": "1 day", "p": {"domain_verify": "4f67b85b5e96bc75e43aefc386ed9fb0"}, "google-site-verification": "Gd7gRPMvk-fLgqZF-yo5Ax5NmoCw6MBzipcz9xhUGgk"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc97a5\"", "article_summary": "According to the study, only 10 people residing in West Los Angeles are obese, while 33 percent of those living in South Los Angeles are.\nOnly 78 percent of South Los Angeles residents reported having easy access to fresh produce, compared with 96 percent of those in West Los Angeles.\nTo encourage healthier eating habits for low-income South Los Angeles residents, the managers of the farmers market have partnered with Hunger Action Los Angeles (HALA).\nIn an effort to bridge this healthcare gap, the City of Los Angeles and some private organizations are trying to help South Los Angeles residents, and those residing in similar low-income communities, live better-balanced lifestyles.\nFactors such as body mass index were considerably lower for generally wealthier neighborhoods, like those in West Los Angeles, especially when compared to the generally low-income neighborhoods in South Los Angeles."}
