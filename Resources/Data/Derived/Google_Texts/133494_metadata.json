In one, an actor playing a patient with advanced cancer was told by a doctor that treatment options had been exhausted. The other video showed the same scenario with a similar-looking doctor saying there may be some treatment options.\n\nOn a scale of 0 to 50, with 50 being the least compassionate, patients gave the doctor with good news a score of 19, compared to 26 for the doctor with bad news.\n\nFifty-seven patients said they preferred the doctor delivering the more optimistic message, while 22 preferred the doctor delivering the less optimistic news.\n\n\u201cThe patients consistently perceived the doctor who gave the more optimistic message as more compassionate,\u201d Bruera said.\n\nHe said the findings may help explain why doctors intuitively have a difficult time delivering bad news to their patients.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but it\u2019s the reality of life that when the doctor needs to give the patient bad news, the perception of that patient may be that of a less compassionate doctor,\u201d Bruera said.\n\nThere needs to be additional research into the findings, Dr. Teresa Gilewski of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City said in an editorial accompanying the new study in JAMA Oncology, online February 26.\n\n\u201cFor example, would the patient perception be different with an in-person interaction, a longer discussion, a personal relationship with the physician, or at a different time in the patient\u2019s illness?\u201d wrote Gilewski.\n\nThe researchers say future research should account for the trust patients have with their doctors, too.\n\nStill, they also suggest researchers should craft techniques to help doctors deliver bad news without the content affecting the patients\u2019 perceptions of their compassion.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1MZitVK and http://bit.ly/1MZizgi\n\nJAMA Oncology 2015.\n\n(By Andrew M.
