Play video According to reports, the federal government will expand the work-for-the-dole scheme this year.\n\nJOBLESS Australians will be forced to work for free collecting rubbish, maintaining parks and volunteering in aged care homes, as the federal government expands its work-for-the-dole scheme this year.\n\nThe Liberal Government's tough new plan will again make work-for-the-dole compulsory and anyone who turns down a job close to home will lose the payment.\n\nLocal councils will be encouraged to recruit volunteers from Australia's army of 805,000 unemployed to pitch in with community chores, including rubbish collection and park maintenance.\n\nNon-profit aged care homes and charities are also expected to offer unpaid work to the unemployed.\n\nThe \"dole jobs'' are likely to be limited to three-month stints, to prevent employers replacing their permanent workforce with unemployed volunteers.\n\nAssistant Minister for Employment Luke Hartsuyker said Prime Minister Tony Abbott was \"very focused'' on expanding work-for-the dole.\n\nMandatory work-for-the-dole was introduced under the Howard government in the 1990s, but the program was altered under Labor and unemployed people were no longer forced to participate.\n\nMr Hartsuyker confirmed the Coalition's expanded scheme would be compulsory.\n\n\"I'm looking at new and innovative ways to involve people in work-for-the-dole,'' he said on Sunday.\n\n\"We are talking to not-for-profit entities about creating work-like placements for jobseekers so they can gain skills.\n\n\"We think everyone who is capable of working should be working.''\n\nMr Hartsuyker also flagged a crackdown on dole recipients who turn down jobs.\n\nHe said anyone who refused to work would lose their Newstart payment.\n\n\"We will be looking very sternly upon anybody who refuses a job,'' he said.\n\n\"We expect people, when a job opportunity is presented, to take that opportunity.\n\n\"We take a very dim view of people who refuse a job and stay on benefits.''\n\nBut Mr Hartsuyker said most unemployed people on Newstart were genuinely searching for work, and some had been on the dole so long they had trouble finding employment.\n\n\"Very few people refuse jobs,'' he said.\n\n\"Some people are challenged in finding work.''\n\nFrom July 1, the government will pay long-term unemployed aged 18-30 a $2500 \"job commitment bonus'' if they find a job and stay working for 12 months.\n\nIf they remain working for at least two years, they will be paid an extra $4000 bonus.\n\nThe government expects the scheme will lure 36,000 young Australians into paid work each year, at a cost to taxpayers of $157 million over three years.\n\nThe government will also pay employers up to $3250 for each mature-age worker, aged 50 or older, they hire.\n\nIt estimates 22,000 older workers each year will find a job as a result, at a cost of $197 million to taxpayers over three years.\n\nThe long-term jobless - those out of work longer than a year - will be paid up to $6000 to cover their relocation costs if they move to a regional area to take up a job.\n\nThey will be paid up to $3000 to take up a job in another city.\n\nMr Hartsuyker said the money would reimburse people's removal and travel costs, as well as the cost of paying a rental bond for a new home.\n\nThe government has set aside $39 million for the relocation scheme over the next three years, but expects just 680 people a year to use it.\n\nMr Hartsuyker said the government would not force unemployed people to move towns or cities to find work.\n\nAustralian Local Government Association president Felicity-ann Lewis said councils would insist the federal government cover the cost of workers' compensation and training for work-for-the-dole volunteers.\n\nShe said councils would have to induct the volunteers, provide occupational health and safety training, and conduct police checks.\n\n\"The days of waking up and saying, 'Can I help?' and someone handing you a shovel are well past,'' Ms Lewis said.\n\n\"We want to do our bit to help people get their first step on to the jobs ladder, but we would want to see some contribution (towards the cost).''\n\nNational Welfare Rights Network president Maree O'Halloran said the government should focus spending on wage subsidies for employers to hire the long-term jobless.\n\n\"Our experience is that work-for-the-dole costs a lot of money and at the end of the program a person usually doesn't get a job,'' Ms O'Halloran said.\n\nThe number of Australians on the dole jumped 20 per cent last year, with 805,398 people receiving unemployment benefits last November.\n\nOf those, 224,812 people had been out of work for at least a year.\n\n###", "article_metadata":
