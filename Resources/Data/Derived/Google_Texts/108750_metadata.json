The first three, he said, are the most immediate and pressing concerns, while the fourth and fifth priorities look to the future:\n\nHoldren emphasized that acquiring talented and motivated individuals to step up to the challenge of working within this field is a crucial first step.\n\n\u201cWe are only going to find and motivate enough such individuals if we tap the nation\u2019s entire talent pool, including women and girls and individuals from other groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields,\u201d Holdren said.In fact, Holdren mentioned that the demand for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners is growing 12 times faster than the job market as a whole.Symposium panelist Larry Kramer, president of The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, agreed that cybersecurity education is key. The Hewlett Foundation has funded research at Stanford University, MIT and Berkeley.\u201cWe recognize it\u2019s as important to begin to generate a talent pipeline, to create educational opportunities,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cAnd the universities are the places you have to go to do it.\u201dBut, even if the cybersecurity workforce is larger and smarter, privacy remains a concern for the average Internet user.Parisa Tabriz, symposium panelist and lead of Google Chrome\u2019s security team of hired hackers, said the issue of privacy is a personal one. This specificity may make it difficult to ensure satisfaction of one type of privacy for every individual.\u201cI want to emphasize the human component to this problem,\u201d Tabriz said. \u201cPrivacy is so personal and so specific to culture and your specific situation.\u201dPanelist Cynthia Dwork, a distinguished scientist at Microsoft specializing in private data analysis, suggested that perhaps privacy is being thought of in the wrong way. Dwork said people should \u201cquestion every assumption\u201d and that although there is concern about being treated unfairly, privacy is not necessarily the solution concept to ensure fairness.Panelist John Mitchell \u2014 professor of computer science and vice provost for teaching and learning at Stanford University \u2014 frequently deals with the cross-section of cyberspace education and concerns of cyberspace privacy.Mitchell said Stanford has been involved in expanding educational opportunities by combining online learning activities for individuals via free public courses, from which data can be collected regarding the learning patterns of individuals.But, it\u2019s \u201ca balancing act.\u201d There is tension between making data available and protecting the privacy of individuals.\u201cAs technology evolves and new ways of collected data evolves, we need a social process around that so that as users of systems can become comfortable with the data collection,\u201d Mitchell said, \u201cand also we can begin to articulate the kind of boundaries that we don\u2019t want to cross and ways that the data could be used.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "A research symposium suggested that while the human relationship with cyberspace will continue to strengthen, educating the cybersecurity workforce and addressing consumer privacy should be the focus.", "title": "White House summit kicks off with symposium about cybersecurity future - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cybersecurity-slide.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-02T16:20:02+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/02/13/white-house-cybersecurity-summit-thursday-symposium/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Business + Tech", "tag": "WhiteHouse", "published_time": "2015-02-13T00:00:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-02T16:20:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "A research symposium suggested that while the human relationship with cyberspace will continue to strengthen, educating the cybersecurity workforce and addressing consumer privacy should be the focus.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cybersecurity-slide.jpg", "title": "White House summit kicks off with symposium about cybersecurity future - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0fd0\"", "article_summary": "Reshaping the security landscape in cyberspace by developing a cybersecurity workforce that possesses the essential knowledge and skills.\nLaunching the White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection on Thursday, a research symposium hosted by Stanford University\u2019s School of Engineering suggested that while the human relationship with cyberspace will continue to strengthen, educating the cybersecurity workforce and addressing consumer privacy should be the focus of our attention.\nSecuring federal networks by setting clear security targets and holding agencies accountable for meeting those targets.\n\u201cPrivacy is so personal and so specific to culture and your specific situation.\u201dPanelist Cynthia Dwork, a distinguished scientist at Microsoft specializing in private data analysis, suggested that perhaps privacy is being thought of in the wrong way.\nProtecting the country\u2019s information systems and other cyber-dependent critical infrastructure from intrusions and attacks."}
