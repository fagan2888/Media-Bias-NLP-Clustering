And more than 1,000 people a day decide to come to Texas, many because of corporate relocations. Companies based outside Texas certainly understand the economic benefits of moving to the state, given its low taxes, abundant natural resources and cheap labor. And that\u2019s why they come.\n\nBut deciding to relocate a company to Texas is just the first step in what can be a daunting transition for company executives, their employees and families. Ed Curtis, a former banking executive who experienced a bit of cultural shock when he moved from New York to Dallas in 1993, believes he has found a way to smooth this transition.\n\nIn January 2013, he stepped away from his banking career and started a company called YTexas with the purpose of helping incoming CEOs of new companies, their employees and families feel welcome in Texas, become a part of their communities and most of all succeed here.\n\n\u201cI can tell you most people outside of the state do not think Dallas or Texas is modern, and that is surprising to me,\u201d said Curtis, 46. \u201cWe are trying to let people know that Dallas is innovative and as modern a city as anywhere else.\u201d\n\nCurrently YTexas has a network of about 50 CEOs based in Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio and Houston. Unlike the Chambers of Commerce, this network is not trying to recruit companies to Texas. Instead, it provides a conduit to connect newly relocated companies to community leaders and other executives.\n\nAlso, YTexas is a statewide organization, whereas most chambers focus only on their communities, Curtis said. CEOs must be invited to join the network, and then they pay an annual fee of $5,000. They don\u2019t charge the companies they help.\n\n\u201cTransitioning a large group of people to a new city is difficult,\u201d Curtis said. \u201cThey are uprooting their lives, so our CEOs are trying to lend a helping hand.\u201d\n\nThey help with issues about housing, schools, what sports are available or whether a spouse can get a job.\n\nNetworking events\n\nWhen leaders of incoming companies better understand the cities they are moving to, they have a much better chance of bringing their key people along with them. Typically, when a company relocates, employees are given an option as to whether they move or not, so it\u2019s important that most of the key people agree to make the change, he said, or otherwise the company will lose a lot of talent.\n\nRalph Hawkins, who is chairman of HKS Architects Inc. in Dallas and a part of YTexas, said connecting with this network allows incoming company executives to have access to corporate executives from every key industry in Texas.\n\n\u201cJust think about moving into Texas and have this connection and network of major CEOs throughout the state. That is a pretty powerful thing to create,\u201d Hawkins said.\n\nCEOs from such industries as energy, health care, aerospace, hospitality and aviation will make themselves available to incoming company leaders to answer questions or help in any way they can. Also, YTexas hosts quarterly networking events for incoming executives and sponsors forums on various topics.\n\nFor example, Joel Allison, chief executive of Baylor Scott & White Health, has given presentations on how companies new to Texas can navigate the Affordable Care Act. This is critical to companies because health insurance is one of their biggest expenses, and incoming CEOs can then go back to their employees armed with solid information on this topic.\n\n2-way street\n\nAnd this is a two-way street. New companies can invite YTexas executives to their headquarters to learn about them. For example, TopGolf, which moved its headquarters from Chicago to Dallas in 2012, invited YTexas CEOs to one of its facilities for a presentation and to hit golf balls. TopGolf uses golf balls that have microchips to track accuracy and distance.\n\n\u201cAll the CEOs got to play at TopGolf, and it was a lot of fun,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cSo they all found out about TopGolf, whereas before YTexas it might have taken them a year or so to find out about it.\u201d\n\nSince its inception, YTexas has reached out to more than a dozen new companies, but Curtis expects that pace to pick up dramatically in the coming months. He wants to increase the number of participating CEOs to about 200 by the end of next year.\n\n\u201cIf you are moving your company to Texas, we want you to be part of the entire community,\u201d Curtis said. \u201cAnd that means having an understanding of the specific issues we face.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ex-banker saw the need after experiencing culture shock moving from New York to Dallas in 1993.", "og": {"description": "Ex-banker saw the need after experiencing culture shock moving from New York to Dallas in 1993.", "title": "Network of CEOs helps newcomers adjust to Texas", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/will-deener/20140824-network-of-ceos-helps-newcomers-adjust-to-texas.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-08-25T01:45:18Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-08-25T01:42:18Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Network of CEOs helps newcomers adjust to Texas\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/will-deener/20140824-network-of-ceos-helps-newcomers-adjust-to-texas.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1877708\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-25T01:42:18Z\", \"section\": \"Will Deener\", \"author\": \"Will Deener\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-08-25T01:42:18Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d02\"", "article_summary": "\u201cJust think about moving into Texas and have this connection and network of major CEOs throughout the state.\n\u201cIf you are moving your company to Texas, we want you to be part of the entire community,\u201d Curtis said.\nUnlike the Chambers of Commerce, this network is not trying to recruit companies to Texas.\nCEOs must be invited to join the network, and then they pay an annual fee of $5,000.\nFor example, TopGolf, which moved its headquarters from Chicago to Dallas in 2012, invited YTexas CEOs to one of its facilities for a presentation and to hit golf balls."}
