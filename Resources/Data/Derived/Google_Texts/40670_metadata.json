Currently, when organs are in between transplants, they are typically boxed and placed on ice in a cooler of sorts.\n\n\u201cThe cold storage method does not allow for reconditioning of the lungs before transplantation, but this promising \u2018breathing lung\u2019 technology enables us to potentially improve the function of the donor lungs before they are placed in the recipient,\u201d Dr. Abbas Ardehali, director of the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center\u2019s heart and lung transplant program, said in a 2012 press release.\n\nWhen the lungs are inside the Organ Care System, \u201cthey are immediately revived to a warm, breathing state and perfused with oxygen and a special solution supplemented with packed red blood cells,\u201d according to the UCLA press release. UCLA is also known for developing the \u201cheart in a box,\u201d a similar technique that keeps a transplant heart beating and warm before transplantation.\n\nIn November 2012, a team at UCLA successfully completed the first \u201cbreathing lung\u201d transplant on a 57-year-old patient who had pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a disease causing the air sacs of the lungs to be replaced by scar tissue. The patient received two new lungs and recuperated properly afterward.\n\nLung transplants are typically used for people with end-stage lung disease, for example. Transplants can help relieve symptoms like shortness of breath, and the breathing lung method could improve the entire process overall. \u201cOrgans were never meant to be frozen on ice,\u201d Ardehali said. \u201cLungs are very sensitive and can easily be damaged during the donation process. The cold storage method does not allow for reconditioning of the lungs before transplantation, but this promising \u2018breathing lung\u2019 technology enables us to potentially improve the function of the donor lungs before they are placed in the recipient.\u201d\n\nWhen placed on ice, organs stop functioning and ultimately begin to deteriorate. So doctors only have up to 10 hours to rush the organ from the donor to the recipient. Sometimes, organs can go to waste if it takes too long. Ardehali mentions that every year, up to 30 or 40 hearts in Hawaii are unused because there isn\u2019t enough time to transport them to the mainland.\n\nThe Organ Care System is still being investigated and tested to ensure safety and efficacy. Previously, a study was published in the journal The Lancet which concluded that the OCS lung technique safely preserved the organs, \u201cresulting in complete organ use and successful transplantation in our series of high-risk recipients.\u201d\n\nAccording to the TransMedics website, the OCS machine is currently commercially available in Europe as well as Australia and is being used in clinical settings. Clinical trials in the U.S., meanwhile, are expected to begin soon.\n\nWatch the video below for more information on the Organ Care System:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lungs breathing outside body, heart in a box, organ transplants, organ care system", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Organ Care System is a new form of technology that allows lungs to continue breathing while outside the body, which will improve the transplantation process.", "title": "\u2018Organ Care System\u2019 Allows Lungs To \u2018Breathe\u2019 Outside Body Before Transplant [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/organ-care-system-medical-device-allows-lungs-breathe-outside-body-transplant-269099", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/11/lungs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Organ Care System is a new form of technology that allows lungs to continue breathing while outside the body, which will improve the transplantation process.", "title": "\u2018Organ Care System\u2019 Allows Lungs To \u2018Breathe\u2019 Outside Body Before Transplant [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/organ-care-system-medical-device-allows-lungs-breathe-outside-body-transplant-269099", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/11/lungs.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/11/lungs.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-02-11T16:02:26-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-11T16:02:25-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Organ Care System is a new form of technology that allows lungs to continue breathing while outside the body, which will improve the transplantation process."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb090\"", "article_summary": "Watch the video below for more information on the Organ Care System:\nThe Organ Care System is still being investigated and tested to ensure safety and efficacy.\nThe medical device company known as TransMedics has developed an experimental machine called the Organ Care System, which allows doctors to keep lungs \u201cbreathing\u201d while they are on their way from the donor\u2019s body to the recipient\u2019s.\nThe process of lung donations may now be improved significantly with the help of the Organ Care System, which allows doctors to keep lungs \"warm and breathing\" before transplants.\nTransplants can help relieve symptoms like shortness of breath, and the breathing lung method could improve the entire process overall."}
