Police had been responding to a report of shoplifting at a Winslow convenience store.\n\nThe officer responded by shooting Tsingine on a sidewalk a couple of blocks from the store, said Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Raul Garcia.\n\n[RELATED: PD: Woman shot by police in Winslow was reportedly armed with scissors]\n\nOrganizers of Saturday's event said the shooting was unjust.\n\nThey also wanted to draw attention to the struggles of American Indians in towns that border the Navajo Nation. A community-based organization known as \"Red Nation\" organized Saturday's event.\n\n\"We want to know how many times she was shot and why he shot her so many times?\" said Floranda Dempsey, an aunt of Tsingine. \"We want justice.\"\n\n[RELATED: Winslow police shoot, kill woman during altercation]\n\nThe Arizona Department of Public Safety is investigating Tsingine's death. Authorities have not released the officer's name but have said he's worked for Winslow police for three years.\n\nWinslow borders the Navajo Nation about an hour east of Flagstaff and has a large American Indian population. The city was immortalized in pop culture by the 1972 by the Eagles' song, \"Take it Easy,\" with the lyrics: \"Standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona.\"\n\n\u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.
