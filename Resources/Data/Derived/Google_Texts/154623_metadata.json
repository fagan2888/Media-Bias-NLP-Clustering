The retailer started using the \u201cNavajo\u201d descriptor in 2001, according to court documents.\n\nThere was no evidence anyone legally associated with the Navajo Nation knew the retailer used the tribe\u2019s trademarks until June 2011, Black said. The tribe sent a cease and desist letter to Urban Outfitters and followed up with the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy with the ruling and hope to resolve the matter expeditiously for the benefit of the Navajo people,\u201d Paul Spruhan, an attorney for the tribe, said Friday.\n\nCourt documents do not quantify the amount the Navajo Nation could recover if it\u2019s successful in its lawsuit, but it could amount to millions of dollars dating to 2008.\n\nOn some claims, the tribe wants all the profits generated from the Navajo-themed sales. On others, it wants $1,000 per day per item, or three times the profit generated by marketing and retail of products using the name.\n\nLindsay DeMoss, one of a handful of attorneys listed for Urban Outfitters, declined to comment. The company had said in court documents that granting the tribe a monetary windfall for a situation it created with unexplained silence \u201cwould be inequitable and unjust.\u201d\n\nBlack\u2019s ruling applies to Urban Outfitters and one of its subsidiaries, Anthropologie. The judge held off on determining whether it also applies to subsidiary Free People LLC until a company representative could be interviewed.\n\nThe tribe\u2019s lawsuit alleges violations of federal and state trademark laws, including the Indian Arts and Crafts Act, which makes it illegal to sell arts or crafts in a way to falsely suggest they are made by American Indians.\n\nUrban Outfitters says \u201cNavajo\u201d is a generic term for a style or design.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal judge cleared the way for the Navajo Nation to seek potentially millions of dollars in its 2012 lawsuit over Urban Outfitters' use of the \"Navajo\" name in clothing, jewelry and other merchandise", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "WREG.com", "description": "A federal judge cleared the way for the Navajo Nation to seek potentially millions of dollars in its 2012 lawsuit over Urban Outfitters\u2019 use of the \u201cNavajo\u201d name in clothing, jewe\u2026", "title": "Navajo Nation can seek potentially millions from Urban Outfitters over use of their name", "url": "http://wreg.com/2016/04/03/navajo-nation-can-seek-potentially-millions-urban-outfitters-over-the-use-of-their-name/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwreg.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/urban-outfitters.jpg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwreg.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/urban-outfitters.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@3onyourside", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@3onyourside"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324690258", "fb": {"pages": 114737265221655}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wreg.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/9bc3246fbdba300537a296bf9ad07b3c?s=16", "application-name": "WREG.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wreg3", "published_time": "2016-04-03T19:50:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-03T19:50:18+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/wreg3"}, "keywords": "news, lawsuit, navajo, urban outfitters", "google-site-verification": "uJnF6Q7vJP3k7pEVLotNZ8dGfBwvCzC3at_F3MZ_CA4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7277\"", "article_summary": "\u00d7 Navajo Nation can seek potentially millions from Urban Outfitters over use of their nameFLAGSTAFF, Ariz. \u2014 A federal judge cleared the way for the Navajo Nation to seek potentially millions of dollars in its 2012 lawsuit over Urban Outfitters\u2019 use of the \u201cNavajo\u201d name in clothing, jewelry and other merchandise.\nUrban Outfitters says \u201cNavajo\u201d is a generic term for a style or design.\nLindsay DeMoss, one of a handful of attorneys listed for Urban Outfitters, declined to comment.\nThere was no evidence anyone legally associated with the Navajo Nation knew the retailer used the tribe\u2019s trademarks until June 2011, Black said.\nThe tribe sent a cease and desist letter to Urban Outfitters and followed up with the lawsuit."}
