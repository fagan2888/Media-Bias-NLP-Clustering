Claire McCaskill doesn\u2019t know whether she\u2019ll vote for President Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019m voting for\u201d the agreement, the Missouri Democrat said Tuesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMcCaskill, who has endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid, said she is trying to find out what will happen if America pulls out of the deal. Right now, she believes that\u2019s not clear.\n\n\u201cThe analysis I\u2019m doing is pretty simple,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect deal, there\u2019s a lot of things about this deal that are bad, but what is the new status quo if we walk away?\u201d\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry said Monday in a briefing with regional newspapers that he respected McCaskill\u2019s deliberative approach to her decision.\n\n\u201cI admire those that are genuinely looking at the agreement, rather than those who oppose it without even knowing what the agreement does,\u201d he said, according to the St. Louis Post Dispatch.\n\nKerry\u2019s comments suggest a softer approach for the administration after last week\u2019s sharp breach with Democratic New York Sen. Chuck Schumer.\n\nLast week, after Schumer, the likely incoming minority leader, came out against the Iran deal, the White House suggested he might pay a price with the Democratic Caucus in the Senate \u2014 while former Obama administration officials attacked Schumer in more aggressive terms.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if senators factored Schumer\u2019s Iran position into their vote on the next minority leader, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Friday.\n\n\u201cChuck Schumer, who said it was a mistake to pass Obamacare, now comes out against the Iran Deal. This is our next Senate leader?\u201d tweeted former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau.\n\n\u201cFacts are facts, and politics is politics. Schumer made a decision based on politics, not fact,\u201d tweeted former White House senior adviser David Axelrod.\n\n\u201cSenator Schumer siding with the GOP against Obama, [Hillary] Clinton and most Democrats will make it hard for him to lead the Dems in \u201916,\u201d tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, a former top White House communications aide, adding in a subsequent tweet: \u201cThe base won\u2019t support a leader who thought Obamacare was a mistake and wants War with Iran.\u201d\n\nBut McCaskill said that no matter what she decides, Schumer\u2019s decision won\u2019t affect her support of him as Sen. Harry Reid\u2019s successor.\n\n\u201cEvery senator is going to make their decision based on their analysis of this, and I think that Chuck Schumer has done that; I will do that,\u201d she said.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 insistence on having 60 days to review the deal \u2014 a period of time that may allow more opposition to develop \u2014 has been the only thing that has disappointed her about the debate, she said. \u201cIt appeared to me that most of them made up their mind in about five minutes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019m voting for\u201d the agreement, the Missouri Democrat said on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Tuesday.", "title": "McCaskill still undecided on Iran deal", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/iran-deal-claire-mccaskill-undecided-121255.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/08/11/150811_claire_mccaskill_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Claire McCaskill,Senate,Democrats,Iran,Iran Deal,Iran Nuclear Program", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019m voting for\u201d the agreement, the Missouri Democrat said on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Tuesday.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "McCaskill still undecided on Iran dealSen.
