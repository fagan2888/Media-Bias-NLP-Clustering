It\u2019s still not workable.\u201d\n\nOne problem, Liddle said, is that the final rule broadly expanded the definition of what qualifies as a \u201cmenu.\u201d Under the rule \u201cmenu\u201d can refer to any writing that \u201cused by a customer to make an order selection at the time the customer is viewing the writing,\u201d which could apply to advertisements.\n\n\u201cWe no longer know what a menu is,\u201d Liddle said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to interpret. Essentially they\u2019re saying anything that a consumer can look at and make a potential ordering decision from is a menu.\u201d She said this could apply to flyers, ads in the newspapers, or signs in the window.\n\n\u201cIf you take it to the broadest thing it could be an ad on the television,\u201d she said. \u201cThat makes it literally impossible to comply.\u201d\n\nLiddle said that the company agrees with the regulation\u2019s goals and has been providing calorie information for more than a decade. The company already offers an online \u201ccal-o-meter\u201d that allows consumers to see the total calories of any pizza they order.\n\nA problem specific to pizza chains is the challenge of displaying a vast number of possible calorie totals across all of the materials that the rule potentially counts as a \u201cmenu.\u201d Considering that Domino\u2019s customers can customize their own pizzas, there is an endless number of possible combinations of toppings, each of which has a different calorie count. Liddle said a low-ball estimate of combinations Domino\u2019s offers is 34 million. Pizza Hut has 2 billion possible combinations.\n\n\u201cInherently, we\u2019re not against this. We\u2019re for it,\u201d Liddle said. \u201cWe\u2019re for giving our customers information that they want and need. So if our customers want calorie information, then we will give it to them\u2013and we do give it to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just want to do it in a way that makes sense,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite the fact that the rule runs 391 pages and addresses details such as whether a limited-time \u201cpumpkin spice muffin\u201d should be covered, it still does not give clear guidance about how restaurants are supposed to comply, according to critics. The rule, finalized in November, will affect chains with 20 or more stores.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately once the sausage was made and all the stuff was finalized, it got homogenized into something that the FDA felt was feasible for everybody,\u201d Liddle said. \u201cSo they tried to force it into a one-size-fits-all, and I think that\u2019s where the problem began. It really should have been let every brand do it in a way that suits their customers.\u201d\n\nThe FDA has said it will issue guidance on compliance for companies before the rule goes into effect in December 2015.\n\nThough the regulation remains vague on who is responsible for ensuring that calorie information is displayed, it carries criminal and civil penalties.\n\n\u201cThey say there could be civil and criminal penalties for having incorrect calorie information,\u201d Liddle said. \u201cAnd not only is that frightening, that is also very unclear and invites a whole host of potential problems not just for pizza, but for anybody that I can think of who is preparing food and selling it to the public.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can go to jail, according to the way this is written, if somehow you did it wrong,\u201d she said.\n\nThe final rule explains that failure to comply with the regulation will render food \u201cmisbranded\u201d under the Food Drug & Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), which carries criminal penalties.\n\nViolations of the law carry a maximum $1,000 fine, one year in prison, or both. If a person is convicted of a violation, a second violation can carry a $10,000 fine and up to three years in prison.\n\nAccording to the law, the U.S. government can also seize misbranded food.\n\nWhile technically the act carries civil and criminal penalties, it is not likely that restaurant owners will find themselves in jail, given the FDA\u2019s approach to enforcement.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the FDA is to work with industry on menu-vending machine labeling,\u201d said Jennifer Dooren, a press officer for the FDA.\n\n\u201cThe first step for the agency in helping ensure compliance will be to provide guidance and technical support materials to the industry,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore the rules become effective, we intend to issue such materials and further reach out to industry. We also intend to further coordinate with states and local governments.\u201d\n\nDooren added that the government could bring a civil action in federal court over violations of the FD&C Act.\n\n\u201cThe FDA will determine the level of monitoring needed depending on our initial assessment of the degree of compliance and available resources,\u201d Dooren said. \u201cEnforcement will be considered on a case-by-case basis depending on the specific facts and circumstances.\u201d\n\nEven if fines are not issued, the regulation is costly. Liddle said Domino\u2019s does not have an estimate of what compliance will cost her company, though implementing a similar law in New York cost as much as $5,000 per store. The regulation is expected to cost industry $1.7 billion overall.\n\nDomino\u2019s is not going to stop pushing back against the regulation, and is hopeful that Congress or the FDA will revise the rule to make it easier to comply.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to fight,\u201d Liddle said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try hard not to get issue fatigue, because we\u2019ve been working on this for a long time.\n\n\u201cHope springs eternal. I still believe that somebody will listen to common sense.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare calorie regulation carries criminal penalties", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The final Obamacare regulation forcing restaurant chains to display calorie information is causing headaches for companies that\u00a0say it is \u201cimpossible to comply\u201d with the new rule.
