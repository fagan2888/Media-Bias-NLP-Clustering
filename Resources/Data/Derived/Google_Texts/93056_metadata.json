Nobody\u2019s talked about health care, and although health care costs have begun to slow as a percentage of total economic growth and as a percentage of GDP, one of the things that\u2019s happened in 2014 and 2015 is that the actual consumer is paying a higher part of it.\n\nEither because companies continue to cut benefits or because of the ACA [Affordable Care Act], Obamacare, co-pays are higher. And people actually pay more out of pocket. That is having an impact, and it\u2019s going to have a political impact, of course, on 2016 as well. I think the days of real easy unit and pricing growth in health care may be behind us, and those are very elevated prices right now.\n\nI think that, increasingly now, people are going to look at the downside of the ACA.\"\n\nChanos went short healthcare in 2010 right before the ACA was passed. He had believed that federal spending on healthcare would fall. But when it became clear that spending would actually rise, he admitted the short was a wrong call.\n\nA major Supreme Court ruling in June held up subsidies for over 6 million Americans, increasing the number of clients with insurance. It was seen as a big plus for healthcare providers, whose shares surged after news of the ruling crossed.\n\nHowever, Chanos says people would begin to focus on the negatives of Obamacare going forward.\n\nWe've seen a frenzy of mergers in the sector this year, as healthcare providers look for ways to cut costs and stay competitive. One of the goals of Obamacare was to heat up competition and keep costs low for consumers.\n\nHealthcare stocks, and the biotech sector, have had a strong run this year. But in recent months, the sector has come under rapid fire on all sides.\n\nThere was the tweet that wrecked several shares, sent by democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, indicating her administration would take on price-gouging in the sector. And when Chanos talks about \"pricing growth in health care,\" that's the kind of thing Clinton would tackle head-on if she was president.\n\nAnd the US Senate launched a bipartisan investigation into drug pricing, focusing on Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"Anybody that\u2019s been dependent on raising prices aggressively as their business strategy is going to be under a microscope, we know that,\" Chanos said.\n\nRead more of Fortune's roundtable discussion with other money managers here \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Akin Oyedele", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Chanos says people are increasingly going to focus on the downsides of Obamacare.", "creator": "AkinOyedele", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/jim-chanos-says-investors-should-avoid-healthcare-2015-12", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/53cd43a76da811027158e6df-506-253/chanos-short-obamacare.jpg", "title": "CHANOS: Short Obamacare", "site": "themoneygame", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "moneygame,clusterstock,politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Jim Chanos, Stocks, Healthcare, Short Selling, Akin Oyedele", "description": "Chanos says people are increasingly going to focus on the downsides of Obamacare.", "author": "Akin Oyedele", "sailthru.date": "2015-12-09", "sailthru.title": "CHANOS: Short Obamacare", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/53cd43b8eab8ea1c0a712753-50-50/chanos-short-obamacare.jpg", "news_keywords": "Jim Chanos, Stocks, Healthcare, Short Selling, Akin Oyedele", "tbi-image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/53cd43b8eab8ea1c0a712753/chanos-short-obamacare.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-12-09", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/akin-oyedele"}, "sailthru.description": "Chanos says people are increasingly going to focus on the downsides of Obamacare.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Chanos says people are increasingly going to focus on the downsides of Obamacare.", "title": "CHANOS: Short Obamacare", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/jim-chanos-says-investors-should-avoid-healthcare-2015-12", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/53cd43a76da811027158e6df-1190-625/chanos-short-obamacare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "CHANOS: Short Obamacare", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/53cd43b8eab8ea1c0a712753/chanos-short-obamacare.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "moneygame"}, "article_summary": "Billionaire hedge fund manager Jim Chanos is skeptical about healthcare stocks once again.\nWithout explicitly saying that he's short the sector, and so betting that healthcare stocks will fall in 2016, he's called it out as one sector investors should avoid next year.\nChanos went short healthcare in 2010 right before the ACA was passed.\nAnd when Chanos talks about \"pricing growth in health care,\" that's the kind of thing Clinton would tackle head-on if she was president.\nHealthcare stocks, and the biotech sector, have had a strong run this year."}
