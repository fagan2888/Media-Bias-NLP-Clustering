(The survey was conducted Aug. 20-24.)\n\nWhite evangelical Protestants express strong support for Republican candidates, just as they have in recent elections. Two-thirds of registered voters who are white evangelical Protestants in the new survey say they would vote Republican (67%), compared to 22% who would vote for a Democrat.\n\nOn the other side of the partisan divide, black Protestants and religiously unaffiliated voters lean heavily Democratic. Nearly nine-in-ten black Protestants say they would vote for the Democratic congressional candidate in their district. And among people who don\u2019t identify with any religion, 62% say they would vote for the Democratic candidate while just 22% say they would vote for the Republican congressional candidate in their district.\n\nCompared with white evangelicals on the one hand and black Protestants and religious \u201cnones\u201d on the other, white mainline Protestants and Catholics are more evenly divided. Among mainline Protestants, 52% say they would vote for the Republican candidate in their district if the election were held today, while 39% say they would vote for the Democratic candidate. About half of Catholics (49%) say they would vote for a Republican if the election were today, while four-in-ten (41%) prefer a Democrat.\n\nThese patterns mirror broad trends seen in several surveys leading up to the last midterm elections, in 2010. White evangelical Protestants also leaned heavily Republican, while religiously unaffiliated voters and black Protestants expressed strong support for Democrats. White mainline Protestants and Catholics, as they are now, were more evenly divided \u2013 although both groups ultimately supported Republican candidates over Democrats, helping the GOP make major gains in the 2010 midterms.\n\nTopics: Political Party Affiliation, Religion and U.S. Politics", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Despite some contentious issues at the intersection of religion and politics, voting preferences among major religious groups is little changed.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5", "og": {"url": "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/03/religious-divides-persist-heading-into-fall-campaign/", "type": "article", "site_name": "Pew Research Center", "description": "Despite some contentious issues at the intersection of religion and politics, voting preferences among major religious groups is little changed.", "title": "Religious divides persist heading into fall campaign"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/03/religious-divides-persist-heading-into-fall-campaign/", "title": "Religious divides persist heading into fall campaign", "description": "Despite some contentious issues at the intersection of religion and politics, voting preferences among major religious groups is little changed.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@pewresearch"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"project\": \"Religion\"}", "projects": "Religion", "date": 20140903, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pewresearch", "published_time": "2014-09-03T10:00:32+00:00"}, "topics": "Religion and U.S. Politics", "theme-color": "#231f20"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2c1\"", "article_summary": "Compared with white evangelicals on the one hand and black Protestants and religious \u201cnones\u201d on the other, white mainline Protestants and Catholics are more evenly divided.\nWhite evangelical Protestants also leaned heavily Republican, while religiously unaffiliated voters and black Protestants expressed strong support for Democrats.\nNearly nine-in-ten black Protestants say they would vote for the Democratic congressional candidate in their district.\nOn the other side of the partisan divide, black Protestants and religiously unaffiliated voters lean heavily Democratic.\nAmong mainline Protestants, 52% say they would vote for the Republican candidate in their district if the election were held today, while 39% say they would vote for the Democratic candidate."}
