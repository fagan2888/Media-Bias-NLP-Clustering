Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersThe Trail 2016: Interleague play Clinton laughs off idea of Trump-Sanders debate Colorado gov sports Trump socks MORE (I-Vt.) and former Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.).\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who on Monday signed a \u201cright to work\u201d bill in the state and has angered public sector unions, did not attend the event. Neither did New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who also has a difficult relationship with organized labor.\n\nWalker was briefly criticized from the podium for his comment last month that he could take on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) because he had taken on union protesters in Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cAny politician who compares demonstrators to ISIS \u2026 just is flat out wrong,\u201d Pataki said.\n\nSpeakers from both sides of the aisle touted their support for the working class.\n\n\u201cFor the rich and powerful, big government has been a good deal,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cBut working men and women across this country are hurting.\u201d\n\nHe urged reforms that would cut taxes for small businesses and said that a full repeal of ObamaCare. His line about ObamaCare fell flat in the room, according to reports.\n\nRubio praised the work of first responders like those who had helped his daughter when she was in an accident.\n\n\"You're an important part of the ability of our governments to respond,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we'll continue to be allies and advocates for the causes that are important to your profession.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans also calibrated their messages to appeal to the pro-union crowd.\n\n\"I\u2019m a proud Republican, but I\u2019ll tell you this folks \u2014 we are all one car wreck\u201d away from needing support from government, Graham said.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican said that Congress had endangered government programs that helped the middle class like social security.\n\n\u201cAnd Congress allowed that to happen because we don\u2019t know what the hell we\u2019re doing up here,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats were also quick to draw a contrast with Republicans, who are generally seen as less supportive of pro-union laws.\n\nO\u2019Malley said as he began his speech that there were two things that the audience would not have heard from the Republican speakers.\n\n\u201cOne is a commitment to collective bargaining,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the second is a commitment to increasing funding for public safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I believe: I believe that you don\u2019t play games with public safety. I believe that you don\u2019t play games with peoples\u2019 lives. Not now, not ever,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former Maryland governor deployed a populist message that some have said is designed to appeal to progressives who are dissatisfied with Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonJudge seals all video interviews in Clinton email case State aide thought Clinton email was for \u2018family and friends\u2019 Clinton: I'm ready for Trump's 'fantasy' campaign MORE, the race\u2019s prospective Democratic frontrunner.\n\n\u201c[I]f a bank is too big to fail without harming our nation, then it\u2019s too big and we must break it up before it breaks us,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders and Webb played to the union crowd as well.\n\n\u201cMaybe, just maybe, it\u2019s time for corporate America and the wealthy to start paying their fair share of taxes,\u201d Sanders said, to loud applause.\n\nWebb said that he was the only person elected to statewide office in Virginia \u201cwith a union card, a purple heart and three tattoos.\u201d\n\nVice President Biden also attended the event one day earlier.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who would be considered a frontrunner for the nomination if he decides to run, did not attend but greeted attendees in a short pre-taped address.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Both Republicans and Democrats addressed the International Association of Fire Fighters.", "description": "Both Republicans and Democrats addressed the International Association of Fire Fighters.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Both Republicans and Democrats addressed the International Association of Fire Fighters.", "title": "2016 hopefuls make pitches to firefighters union", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/235257-2016-hopefuls-make-pitches-to-firefighters-union", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/235257-2016-hopefuls-make-pitches-to-firefighters-union", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-10T17:23-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Jessica Taylor", "author": "David McCabe", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Hillary Clinton, Lindsey Graham, Bernie Sanders, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-10T17:23:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/235257-2016-hopefuls-make-pitches-to-firefighters-union", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Both Republicans and Democrats addressed the International Association of Fire Fighters.", "card": "summary", "title": "2016 hopefuls make pitches to firefighters union"}, "dcterms.title": "2016 hopefuls make pitches to firefighters union"}, "article_summary": "Martin O\u2019Malley (D), Sen.
