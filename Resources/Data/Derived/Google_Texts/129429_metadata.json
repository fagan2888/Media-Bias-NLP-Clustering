Officials were already committed to rejecting every possible aspect of the Affordable Care Act, and undermining its implementation wherever possible, but Institute members were nevertheless tasked with looking for ways Texas could improve the state\u2019s struggling health care infrastructure.\n\nWhen Gov. Rick Perry (R) endorsed the creation of the panel in 2011, and chose its members, this probably isn\u2019t what he had in mind.\n\nA board of medical professionals appointed by Gov. Rick Perry said Wednesday that the state should provide health coverage to low-income Texans under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 a move the Republican-led Legislature has opposed. The 15-member Texas Institute of Health Care Quality and Efficiency recommended that the state\u2019s health commissioner be authorized to negotiate a Texas-specific agreement with the federal government to expand health coverage to the poor, \u201cusing available federal funds.\u201d\n\nSteve Berkowitz, the board\u2019s chairman, told the Texas Tribune , \u201cWe\u2019re trying to take the politics out of it.\u201d\n\nAnd while that\u2019s certainly a noble goal, if state policymakers were willing to take politics out of the decision-making process, they wouldn\u2019t have rejected Medicaid expansion in the first place.\n\nJoel Allison, a board member who is chief executive of the Baylor Scott & White Health System, added, \u201cWe should be maximizing available federal funds through the Medicaid program to improve health care for all Texans.\u201d\n\nGiven that Texas has one of the worst uninsured rates in the country \u2013 the Perry-appointed board called the current totals \u201cunacceptable\u201d \u2013 maximizing available federal funds would make a lot of sense.\n\nBut Texas Republicans also don\u2019t like President Obama. The result isn\u2019t pretty.\n\nOf course, pressure for change isn\u2019t just coming from the state\u2019s Institute of Health Care Quality and Efficiency. The Dallas Morning News reports that state hospitals are increasingly desperate to see Republican policymakers take a more responsible approach.\n\nExpanding Medicaid may be anathema to Texas political leaders. For hospitals, though, it would be a godsend. [\u2026] The Texas Hospital Association \u2026 wants to coax Governor-elect Greg Abbott and the Legislature to use federal funds available through the Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid with a private insurance model. This \u201cTexas Way\u201d approach, as the hospital association describes it (texasway.org), would seek out the uninsured not currently eligible for Medicaid but who can\u2019t afford the insurance policies offered under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s healthcare.gov site. That\u2019s about 1.05 million Texans, the association estimates.\n\nIn theory, the fact that so many state Republicans \u2013 in Arizona, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere \u2013 have agreed to take federal funds to help low-income families would presumably give Texas some cover to do the same thing. The fact that hospitals and a Perry-appointed panel want the same thing might help push against the prevailing political winds, too.\n\nIndeed, both the Texas Hospital Association and the Perry-appointed Institute of Health Care Quality and Efficiency don\u2019t even tell policymakers what to do, exactly, so much as they urge officials to do something. There are alternative avenues and opportunities for compromise with federal officials.
