A video found on the boy\u2019s cell phone shows the 15-year-old wearing only underwear while kids pour, not ice water on his head, but allegedly a bucket containing spit, feces, urine, and cigarette butts, Fox News reported.\n\nIn the video, the teen is standing half naked in a driveway outside a house not far from his high school as bodily fluids are poured over his head. The boy\u2019s mother said her son didn\u2019t realize what the kids dumped on him until after the fact. Utterly humiliated, the boy did not want to tell his parents what happened, said his mother Diane, who asked the family's last name be witheld.\n\nWhen his family discovered the disturbing video on his phone, they were outraged. They couldn\u2019t imagine how kids could be so cruel. \u201cOnce we found out about it, we were just horrified,\u201d the mother of the Bay High School student said. Not only did the kids film the horrific incident, but they posted it on Instagram. \u201cThis is just too far. It\u2019s really bad,\u201d his brother Jacob said.\n\nBay High School is now working with police to further investigate the incident. Police say they are pretty sure who was involved and are working on the case for a few weeks before pressing charges. The family said they refuse to let the kids get away with bullying their son and have posted the video for everyone to see. \u201cI want these kids held accountable for what they did to him and they targeted somebody who just didn\u2019t really understand what was going on,\u201d Diane said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that autism spectrum disorders are five times more common in boys and affect one in 68 children.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ice bucket challenge, sick joke, kids, teen, austistic", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A group of kids used the Ice Bucket Challenge to trick an autistic teen into having bodily fluids poured over him.", "title": "Kids Pour Urine And Feces On Autistic Teen In Sick Ice Bucket Challenge 'Joke' [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ice-bucket-challenge-used-bully-teen-autism-kids-pour-urine-feces-and-cigarette-butts-teen-301278", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/04/kids-use-ice-bucket-challenge-bully-autistic-teen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A group of kids used the Ice Bucket Challenge to trick an autistic teen into having bodily fluids poured over him.", "title": "Kids Pour Urine And Feces On Autistic Teen In Sick Ice Bucket Challenge 'Joke' [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ice-bucket-challenge-used-bully-teen-autism-kids-pour-urine-feces-and-cigarette-butts-teen-301278", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/04/kids-use-ice-bucket-challenge-bully-autistic-teen.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/04/kids-use-ice-bucket-challenge-bully-autistic-teen.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-04T15:39:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-04T15:43:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A group of kids used the Ice Bucket Challenge to trick an autistic teen into having bodily fluids poured over him."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe599a\"", "article_summary": "The boy\u2019s mother said her son didn\u2019t realize what the kids dumped on him until after the fact.\n\u201cOnce we found out about it, we were just horrified,\u201d the mother of the Bay High School student said.\nA video found on the boy\u2019s cell phone shows the 15-year-old wearing only underwear while kids pour, not ice water on his head, but allegedly a bucket containing spit, feces, urine, and cigarette butts, Fox News reported.\nIn the video, the teen is standing half naked in a driveway outside a house not far from his high school as bodily fluids are poured over his head.\nBay High School is now working with police to further investigate the incident."}
