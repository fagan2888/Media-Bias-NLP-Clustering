I was just a worker.\u201d\n\nCarter said as she began to continue her employment at CTC, her boss, Bill Beebe, sat her down in the mid-\u201990s and asked her where she saw herself in five years. The questions spurred on Carter\u2019s career and educational goals, and with it, a lot of hard work.\n\n\u201cI would get off work at 5 o\u2019clock, I would go to class at 6 and I wouldn\u2019t get home until around 10,\u201d she said, recalling her work-school-life balance days.\n\n\u201cI would take a nap until 11 or 12, and then I\u2019d wake up and study until maybe 2 in the morning.\u201d\n\nDuring those times, it was her husband, Antonio, her parents, Sharen and Wesley Morganfield, and her church family at the Cathedral of Central Texas Christian House of Prayer who were her \u201crecharge zones,\u201d in the midst of an already cramped schedule.\n\nShe said commitment is a key issue to success.\n\n\u201cWhatever that goal is \u2014 in terms of the education or career \u2014 commit. Because if you are not, you won\u2019t achieve the goal,\u201d she said. \u201cYou must be diligent in your work, you must keep moving, don\u2019t stop, and surround yourself with a really good network of support people who will encourage you.\u201d\n\nIn her new role as the chancellor of finance and administration, Carter will act as the college\u2019s chief financial officer and also guide some of its support services. She starts in January.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Killeen Daily Herald", "description": "The old saying goes, \u201cit takes a village to raise a child,\u201d and these days, the phrase holds true for many area students as well.", "title": "CTC names new deputy chancellor  of finance", "url": "http://kdhnews.com/news/education/ctc-names-new-deputy-chancellor-of-finance/article_49a0a70c-7782-11e4-ba5e-372c254c8dbd.html", "image": {"width": 945, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kdhnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/19/61987a6a-7782-11e4-a64d-378ebc2c7f8b/54794f7e3f0b0.image.jpg?resize=945%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kdhnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "The old saying goes, \u201cit takes a village to raise a child,\u201d and these days, the phrase holds true for many area students as well.", "msvalidate.01": "9F304B519542CC4AA866533D2B53AECA", "fb": {"app_id": 496799633680125}, "google-site-verification": "tvpDrly4oWZOJdt-kIl4RYZzursFYwXuQ-Ejs4m1V5k", "keywords": "michele carter,ctc,central texas college,killeen,education,higher education,learning,education", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/facebook.com/kdhnews"}, "news_keywords": "michele carter,ctc,central texas college,killeen,education,higher education,learning,education"}, "article_summary": "Carter was named the new deputy chancellor of finance and administration at CTC in mid-November, one of the highest executive positions at the school.\n\u201cI had always worked, I\u2019d worked since I was 16 years old, but I didn\u2019t have any career goals or clear paths when I started at CTC ...\nStarting off as a receptionist at the college in 1991, she completed her associate, bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees while holding down a full-time job at CTC.\nThe questions spurred on Carter\u2019s career and educational goals, and with it, a lot of hard work.\nIf it wasn\u2019t for her colleagues, family and church community, Michele Carter, 43, said her degrees and simultaneous career at Central Texas College probably would never have happened."}
