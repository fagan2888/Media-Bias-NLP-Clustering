ACA talks: What would they discuss?\n\nEven if President Barack Obama and Republican and Democratic leaders suddenly started talking about Obamacare, there would be a problem: They just don\u2019t have that much to talk about.\n\nObama says he\u2019s willing to talk about his health care law, after the crisis is over. \u201cIf you disagree with certain aspects of it, tell us what you disagree with, and let\u2019s work on it,\u201d Obama said at a press conference Tuesday afternoon.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut the kinds of piecemeal changes that wouldn\u2019t cripple Obamacare \u2014 like repealing the medical device tax \u2014 wouldn\u2019t satisfy tea party Republicans. And the bigger changes Republicans have suggested, like delaying the individual mandate or the whole law, would be nonstarters for the White House.\n\n( POLITICO's full coverage of the government shutdown)\n\nAnd if the attention turned from Obamacare to entitlements and health spending, the barriers are still considerable. Yes, Obama has proposed savings to Medicare and Social Security in his own budget. But he also made it clear that those would have to be part of a package with new revenues \u2014 which Republicans aren\u2019t about to give.\n\nHere are some of the ideas that may come up if Obamacare is on the table.\n\nDelay the individual mandate. This idea is at the heart of the Republicans\u2019 \u201cfairness\u201d argument: If the Obama administration could delay the requirement for large employers to cover their workers or pay fines, why shouldn\u2019t regular people get a one-year break from the requirement to get health coverage or pay their own fines?\n\nIt\u2019s an argument that could have broad appeal \u2014 22 House Democrats voted for an individual mandate delay in July. Even Jon Stewart pressed Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius Monday night on why individuals couldn\u2019t get the same delay as business.\n\n( POLITICO's full coverage of the debt ceiling)\n\nThe problem for the White House is the individual mandate is linked directly to the coverage of everyone with pre-existing conditions, which starts Jan. 1. The mandate brings healthy people into the new insurance system, along with the sicker ones. That balance helps prevent the so-called insurance \u201cdeath spiral\u201d \u2014 rising insurance prices and fewer people covered if only sicker people enroll.\n\nRepublicans could also renew their push to delay the entire law for one year, including pre-existing condition coverage. But even if the White House was open to that delay \u2014 which it has rejected on principle \u2014 there\u2019s a practical problem. People are already signing up for Obamacare health plans that start Jan. 1. The last thing the administration needs is another P.R. nightmare \u2014 telling those people they have to wait another year.\n\nRepeal the medical device tax. This was one of the House Republicans\u2019 last proposals before the shutdown, and the idea has won some Democratic support in the past. The idea is to get rid of the health care law\u2019s 2.3 percent tax on the sales price of medical devices by manufacturers and importers. Striking that tax wouldn\u2019t gut the basic workings of the health law, and it would relieve the pressure lawmakers from both parties are feeling from medical device makers.\n\n( Understanding Obamacare: POLITICO's guide to the Affordable Care Act)\n\nThe problem, though, is that a repeal of the device tax would get rid of $30 billion in revenue that\u2019s needed to fund Obamacare. Unless it\u2019s replaced with another funding source, that\u2019s just another $30 billion added to the deficit.\n\nAnd tea party groups aren\u2019t likely to be satisfied with that anyway. Their point: We went through a government shutdown to get rid of Obamacare, and all we have to show for it is a medical device tax repeal? Plus, Democrats worry that other health care sectors would start demanding rollbacks of other financing pieces of the law.\n\nThrow Tom Harkin under the bus again. One easy concession to Republicans would be to get rid of the Prevention and Public Health Fund. The fund, authored by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), is part of the health law, but it\u2019s not central to its operation and Democrats have dipped into it in the past. Republicans could welcome the repeal of what they call a \u201cslush fund\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s a \u201cso what\u201d victory to tea party members who want to wipe out the whole law.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 great shutdown quotes)\n\nGet rid of the Congress subsidies. Republicans like Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) have been flogging the issue of the subsidies members of Congress and their staffs will get to receive their health coverage through the Obamacare exchanges. They\u2019re calling it a \u201cspecial break,\u201d and House Republicans attached a repeal of the subsidies to one of their last continuing resolution proposals \u2014 even though the real purpose is to act like the employer contributions lawmakers and their staffs have always received to get federal employees\u2019 health coverage.\n\nEven if Democrats agreed to that, though, it\u2019s not clear how hard Republicans like Boehner would push \u2014 since they know it\u2019s a sure way to lose experienced staff members who don\u2019t want to pay the entire cost of their premiums out of pockets.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Any discussions are likely to be focused on specific policy issues, not grand changes.", "title": "ACA talks: What would they discuss?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/obamacare-aca-entitlements-government-shutdown-debt-ceiling-republicans-democrats-98037.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/08/130810_barack_obama_senate_house_republicans_democrats_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Congress,Republicans,Democrats,Medicare,Debt Ceiling,Government Shutdown,Chained CPI,Obamacare (617)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Any discussions are likely to be focused on specific policy issues, not grand changes.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b6a\"", "article_summary": "People are already signing up for Obamacare health plans that start Jan. 1.\nhave been flogging the issue of the subsidies members of Congress and their staffs will get to receive their health coverage through the Obamacare exchanges.\nStory Continued BelowBut the kinds of piecemeal changes that wouldn\u2019t cripple Obamacare \u2014 like repealing the medical device tax \u2014 wouldn\u2019t satisfy tea party Republicans.\nThis was one of the House Republicans\u2019 last proposals before the shutdown, and the idea has won some Democratic support in the past.\n( POLITICO's full coverage of the government shutdown)And if the attention turned from Obamacare to entitlements and health spending, the barriers are still considerable."}
