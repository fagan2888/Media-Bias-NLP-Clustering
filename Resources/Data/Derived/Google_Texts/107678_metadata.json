What Hillary wants to do is to take us back to real growth, to reduce poverty by building middle-class income.\"\n\nAn enthusiastic but small crowd - a Hillary Clinton spokesman estimated 250 people - showed up to hear the former president as he touched on themes his wife's campaign is stressing in Kentucky - boosting wages, making college more affordable, fighting heroin and prescription drug abuse, and \"finishing the work of health care reform.\"\n\nHe praised Kentucky for \"the best implementation of health care reform, thanks to your former governor.\" That was a reference to Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear's embrace of the Affordable Care Act by expanding the Medicaid program and establishing the health care exchange known as kynect.\n\nHe touted his wife's plan \"that we set aside $30 billion for 10 years to invest in coal country so they can come back with a different economy.\" But he made no mention of his wife's controversial comment in March to CNN that \"we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\"\n\nHillary Clinton made that remark in the context of her plan to create clean-energy jobs in coal regions and she said she has been unfairly attacked by critics who have taken it out of context.\n\nThe former president engaged in no attacks against his wife's opponent in the Democratic presidential primary - Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was in town for his own rally. Instead, he touted his wife - a former U.S.secretary of state and U.S. senator - as being \"the only one qualified\" to address the world's problems.\n\nAnd, though not by name, he chided the policies of Republican front-runner Donald Trump. He said U.S. policy must be more sophisticated than building walls because \"walls can't stop social media.\"\n\nAnd he said, \"It is wrong to demonize our fellow Americans who are Muslim.\"\n\nThe Clintons have a strong electoral track record in Kentucky. Hillary Clinton soundly defeated Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary here. Bill Clinton is the last Democratic presidential candidate to win Kentucky, and he did so in both 1992 and 1996. However, he won each time with a plurality - not a majority - of votes in elections that included third-party candidate Ross Perot.\n\nWhile much of Kentucky has trended Republican in the years since Bill Clinton was president, Ronald Hunter, a customer at Franco's Home Cooking, made it clear he's supporting Hillary Clinton. \"She's got my vote, 100 percent,\" Hunter said. \"It would be good to have a woman in the White House. It's about time. Plus she knows the issues.\"\n\nReporter Tom Loftus can be reached at (502) 875-5136 or tloftus@courier-journal.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/26OgRZ6", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Former President Bill Clinton stops at Shively restaurant, downtown coffee shop before speech", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Former President Bill Clinton stops at Shively restaurant, downtown coffee shop before speech", "title": "Bill Clinton stumps for Hillary in Louisville", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/elections/kentucky/2016/05/03/where-bill-clinton-speak-louisville/83862568/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former President Bill Clinton stops at Shively restaurant, downtown coffee shop before speech", "title": "Bill Clinton stumps for Hillary in Louisville", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/01ca6f3d4cc332482ff7b62d4210490bd997b8cd/c=838-0-4210-3372&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/01/Louisville/Louisville/635977163356737076-Clinton-Indiana-init.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Bill Clinton", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Bill Clinton", "title": "Bill Clinton stumps for Hillary in Louisville", "author": "Tom Loftus", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/elections/kentucky", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33a01f93162488c444fe6ed312a4bc6437ea1f08/c=1259-0-3788-3372/local/-/media/2016/05/01/Louisville/Louisville/635977163356737076-Clinton-Indiana-init.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c8394684ab6e0ff7ece1f2a8af8531c3f7c4fd6d/c=838-0-4210-3372/local/-/media/2016/05/01/Louisville/Louisville/635977163356737076-Clinton-Indiana-init.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/db17013839d267265e36fd0ab879496246bf026c/c=282-0-4767-3372/local/-/media/2016/05/01/Louisville/Louisville/635977163356737076-Clinton-Indiana-init.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3e57b5f91b654bffd5f36b04af1240f28d4cfd26/c=0-260-5048-3112&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/05/01/Louisville/Louisville/635977163356737076-Clinton-Indiana-init.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-05-03T23:26:40.217000-04:00", "shorthed": "Bill Clinton stumps retail-style for Hillary", "articleid": 83862568, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/43093542b947f3b3bc9313041b06fd35b720b33f/c=0-260-5048-3112/local/-/media/2016/05/01/Louisville/Louisville/635977163356737076-Clinton-Indiana-init.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/27b0e5a1d4226c40dbf1209544fe3886ad61e286/c=1580-0-3468-3372/local/-/media/2016/05/01/Louisville/Louisville/635977163356737076-Clinton-Indiana-init.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "hillary clinton, bill clinton, bill clinton in louisville, african american heritage center louisville"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2446\"", "article_summary": "While much of Kentucky has trended Republican in the years since Bill Clinton was president, Ronald Hunter, a customer at Franco's Home Cooking, made it clear he's supporting Hillary Clinton.\nBill Clinton is the last Democratic presidential candidate to win Kentucky, and he did so in both 1992 and 1996.\nHillary Clinton soundly defeated Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary here.\nFormer President Bill Clinton speaks at UAW Local 685 during the Howard County Democratic Pre-Primary Pancake Breakfast during his visit to Kokomo, Ind., Saturday, April 30, 2016.\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Bill Clinton speaks in Louisville on May 3, 2016, as he rallies support for his wife Hillary's presidential campaign."}
