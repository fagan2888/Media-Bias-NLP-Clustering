But there may be some drawbacks to procrastinating.\n\nMonday, Dec. 15, was the deadline to buy or switch plans in the insurance marketplace coverage that would begin on Jan. 1. You can still enroll in, or switch, a plan during the next two months. But new coverage won\u2019t take effect until Feb. 1 at the earliest.\n\nIf you were enrolled in an Affordable Care Act plan in 2014 and didn\u2019t make changes by Monday, you\u2019ll generally be re-enrolled in the same plan next year, said Karen Pollitz, a health insurance expert with the Kaiser Family Foundation. (There are some exceptions; you should have received a notice outlining your options, if you are ineligible for automatic re-enrollment.) You still can decide to change plans, however, as late as Feb. 15 \u2014 the final deadline for open enrollment \u2014 for coverage starting March 1.\n\nHowever, there is at least one potential caveat: If you are automatically covered by your old plan for a month or two in 2015 before switching to a new one, your plan deductible \u2014 the amount you must pay out of pocket before the plan pays for certain kinds of care \u2014 will probably reset when the new plan starts. That means if your new plan starts on Feb. 1, bills you paid in January may not count toward your \u201cnew\u201d deductible.\n\nMs. Pollitz said some insurers might allow you to apply the expenses toward your new deductible if you switch to another plan offered by the same insurer. So you should ask about that possibility. However, she noted, \u201cthis is not required under federal law.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, a spokeswoman for Anthem, a large insurer, said someone enrolled in one of its individual plans bought on the marketplace for 2015 can move to another Anthem individual plan and have their accumulated deductible amounts carry over to the new plan. (But the carry-over would not apply to someone moving from another insurer\u2019s individual policy, or moving to an individual policy from a group policy, the spokeswoman said.)\n\nIt\u2019s likely that some people who haven\u2019t paid close attention may want to make changes after they get the new bill for their existing plan, even if their deductible resets. That\u2019s because premiums for many plans have increased.\n\nAnd in some cases, consumers could see their own costs rise, even if their plan\u2019s premiums didn\u2019t increase, because of the way the Affordable Care Act calculates income-based tax credits. Your credit amount is based partly on the cost of the lowest-priced \u201cbenchmark\u201d plan in your market \u2014 and the plan that cost the least last year may not cost the same this year. So, your credit could shrink.\n\nFor that reason, health policy experts and federal officials have urged consumers to go online to compare plans and to actively re-enroll, to make sure they understand all the options available and to update their income information, so their tax credit will be accurately calculated.\n\nIf you missed Monday\u2019s deadline and subsequently decide that your plan\u2019s premium is too high, you could cancel the plan as of Jan. 1 and enroll in a lower-cost one starting on Feb. 1, said Sabrina Corlette, a senior research fellow at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. But that would mean forgoing any coverage for January.\n\nHere are some questions and answers about participating in open enrollment:\n\n\u25a0 I enrolled in an exchange plan in the spring of 2014. Why does my plan expire on Dec. 31 instead of after 12 months of enrollment?\n\nAll marketplace plans run on a calendar year, regardless of when you enrolled. For many, this is a change from the pre-Affordable Care Act individual insurance market; previously, individual plans could be bought at any time, and often renewed 12 months later. (The calendar year approach aligns marketplace coverage with the system used by many large employers, which offer group insurance on a calendar year, with an annual open-enrollment period).\n\n\u25a0 Do some state-run exchanges have different deadlines?\n\nHealthCare.gov, which serves 37 states, set the deadline for coverage beginning in January at Dec. 15, and the final deadline at Feb. 15, but states running their own exchanges may set more expansive deadlines. Last week, New York said it would extend to Dec. 20 the deadline for coverage as of Jan. 1 because of bad weather that hit the state. And California and some other states have recently extended their deadlines too. So it\u2019s best to check with your state\u2019s exchange for its deadlines.\n\n\u25a0 What if I miss the Feb. 15 marketplace deadline?\n\nYou can\u2019t sign up for marketplace coverage until the next open enrollment in the fall of 2015, unless you have a special circumstance, like the loss of a job or the birth of a child.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141216114809, "twitter": {"description": "For those who missed Monday\u2019s deadline for health insurance enrollment at the Affordable Care Act marketplace, there\u2019s still time, though possibly with some provisos.", "title": "Signing Up for Health Insurance, Even After Missing the Deadline", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/16/your-money/signing-up-for-health-insurance-even-after-missing-the-deadline.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003306144"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/16/your-money/signing-up-for-health-insurance-even-after-missing-the-deadline.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003306144", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/16/your-money/signing-up-for-health-insurance-even-after-missing-the-deadline.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "yourmoney", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/your-money/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 16, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "HealthCare.gov", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Tax Credits  Deductions and Exemptions,HealthCare.gov", "news_keywords": "HealthCare.gov", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Ann Carrns", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By ANN CARRNS", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "For those who missed Monday\u2019s deadline for health insurance enrollment at the Affordable Care Act marketplace, there\u2019s still time, though possibly with some provisos.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "description": "For those who missed Monday\u2019s deadline for health insurance enrollment at the Affordable Care Act marketplace, there\u2019s still time, though possibly with some provisos.", "CN": "your-money", "CG": "your-money", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Dec. 16, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/ann_carrns/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/your-money/index.html", "section": "Your Money", "modified": "2014-12-30", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/your-money/index.jsonp", "tag": "HealthCare.gov", "published": "2014-12-16", "section-taxonomy-id": "ED7B8594-44CE-4D37-A58B-1CDAA19774E4"}, "slug": "16adviser", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141230023106, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/16/your-money/signing-up-for-health-insurance-even-after-missing-the-deadline.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "For those who missed Monday\u2019s deadline for health insurance enrollment at the Affordable Care Act marketplace, there\u2019s still time, though possibly with some provisos.", "title": "Signing Up for Health Insurance, Even After Missing the Deadline"}, "pdate": 20141216, "des": "Tax Credits, Deductions and Exemptions", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "feature", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/your-money", "tagline": "A column on anything and everything that hits you in the wallet.", "uri": "/column/your-money", "display-name": "Your Money", "identifier": "your-money", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003306144, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Signing Up for Health Insurance, Even After Missing the Deadline", "col": "Your Money", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd238\"", "article_summary": "\u25a0 What if I miss the Feb. 15 marketplace deadline?\nMonday, Dec. 15, was the deadline to buy or switch plans in the insurance marketplace coverage that would begin on Jan. 1.\nConsumers who missed the Monday deadline for enrolling in, or changing, an insurance plan on HealthCare.gov still have two months to act.\nFor many, this is a change from the pre-Affordable Care Act individual insurance market;
