More participants live in Texas than in any other state, according to Samaritan and the two other largest ministries, Medi-Share, based in Florida, and Christian Healthcare Ministries, based in Ohio. Under the federal health law, only members of ministries that have operated continuously since December 1999 are exempt from the requirement to have health insurance.\n\nThe growth seems to have come largely through word of mouth, at churches, schools and workplaces. Mr. Doyle, a machinist, heard about Samaritan Ministries at Grace Point Church in San Antonio, whose pastors and employees are members and whose congregants post about it on Facebook.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe and Sarah, who stays home with their two toddlers, mail a flat $405 payment to a fellow member every month, the standard rate for families of three or more. Had they stuck with the insurance he was offered through work, the Doyles said, their share of the premium would have been about $600 a month, and they would have had to pay the first $5,000 in individual medical costs, $10,000 for the family, other than preventive care.\n\nUnder the ministry, they also have to pay the first $300 of any medical expense they incur. They have not yet had a doctor\u2019s bill exceed that amount, though they are waiting somewhat nervously for that day to come. Samaritan limits spending on each injury or illness to $250,000, with exceptions for people who agree to pay extra each year toward others\u2019 bills above that amount.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of fear going into it,\u201d said Mrs. Doyle, 33, adding that she suspected she had a hernia that would need to be repaired soon. \u201cWhat if people don\u2019t pay their share and what if the money doesn\u2019t come in? But that\u2019s where the faith-based part comes in \u2014 I\u2019m really going to rely on God.\u201d\n\nMr. Lansberry said Samaritan members\u2019 eligible medical bills averaged, cumulatively, over $16 million a month. Its membership has grown by about 50,000 over the last year, to nearly 200,000 people in 58,000 paying households.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAcknowledging that many families can qualify for subsidized insurance policies with free preventive care through the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Lansberry said that most new members were not \u201cjoining primarily on price; they are joining primarily on principle.\u201d\n\nBefore members can be reimbursed, they sometimes must pay upfront for their medical care \u2014 potentially a sizable outlay, because hospitals increasingly require at least partial prepayment. It then takes at least two months for Samaritan to process their requests for help and for checks from other members to arrive in the mail.\n\nThe most harrowing part of health care sharing so far for Kyle Burkholder, the teaching pastor at Grace Point, and his wife, Stefani, was paying $6,500 upfront for their daughter\u2019s ear tube surgery, they said. They waited for what seemed like forever for other members\u2019 checks to come.\n\n\u201cAbout 90 days after her surgery, sure enough, the money did start showing up,\u201d Mrs. Burkholder said. \u201cAnd it was with handwritten notes \u2014 every day it was one, two, three notes, and she was reading them aloud, and I found myself just crying.\u201d\n\nMembers with \u201cspecial prayer needs\u201d \u2014 conditions that are not eligible under the ministry\u2019s rules \u2014 can also ask for financial help. Last month, for example, Samaritan\u2019s newsletter highlighted the case of a woman with uterine cancer diagnosed before she became a member, and a teenager who tore a knee ligament in a dirt bike race.\n\nUpon joining, members waive their right to sue, and in the case of Samaritan, appeals panels of randomly selected members are supposed to settle disputes. Mr. Lansberry said that such panels had been convened only four times since Samaritan\u2019s founding in 1994, and that the group had never been the subject of complaints to state attorneys general or insurance commissioners.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe insurance commissioner in Washington State did try to stop Samaritan from operating in 2011, saying it was selling \u201cunauthorized insurance,\u201d but the state Legislature passed a law explicitly exempting health care sharing ministries from regulations.\n\nInsurance commissioners in Kentucky and Oklahoma had tried to block Medi-Share, the Florida-based ministry, but were thwarted when their legislatures also passed protection laws.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2001, Ohio\u2019s attorney general sued one ministry \u2014 known then as the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter, and now as Christian Healthcare Ministries \u2014 ultimately forcing its leaders to repay $15 million they had spent on homes, vehicles and excessive salaries out of the fund where members had sent payments.\n\nMembers have filed a handful of lawsuits against Medi-Share after bills they had expected to be covered were not. The cases were settled out of court. While the health law requires the ministries to submit to annual independent audits, critics question whether that safeguard is sufficient.\n\n\u201cOur message has consistently been that this is not a health insurance product that we regulate, so buyer beware,\u201d said Nick Gerhart, the insurance commissioner in Iowa. \u201cA premature baby could cost $1 million pretty easily, so it wouldn\u2019t take very many of those to put a significant strain on any group, let alone an unregulated group like this.\u201d\n\nLee and Amy Jebson of Chesapeake, Va., were not expecting any major medical costs when they signed up for Medi-Share in 2014 after being priced out of the plans available through HealthCare.gov, the federally run insurance marketplace. Then their 8-year-old son was found to have acute lymphoblastic leukemia, leading to several hundred thousand dollars\u2019 worth of medical bills in just the first few months of his treatment.\n\n\u201cOne single fever is a $10,000-a-night hospital cost,\u201d said Mrs. Jebson, adding that her family pays a $500 monthly share toward other members\u2019 medical costs, and $2,500 a year toward their own. But so far, she added, their bills are being covered, with the exception of a few thousand dollars.\n\nThey, like others interviewed, said joining the ministries allowed them to live by their religious beliefs rather than follow a government mandate to buy insurance that may cover things they do not want to pay for, like abortion (though half the states do not allow plans sold through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, at least, to pay for abortions) or birth control.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a model of wanting to take care of someone else \u2014 not being told, \u2018You have to,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m forcing you to do this,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Jebson said.\n\nThe Doyles said that their impression might change if they incurred big medical bills, but that for now they appreciated the personal nature of their monthly transactions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something different about writing my check to someone who needs it,\u201d Mrs. Doyle said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m loving on somebody instead of just paying my premiums.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160310050026, "twitter": {"description": "Interest in health care sharing
