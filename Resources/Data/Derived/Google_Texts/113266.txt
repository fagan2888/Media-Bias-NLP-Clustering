Hundreds came down this weekend to Panama City Beach for the 17th Annual Thunder Beach Spring Rally and Sunday, the traditional 'Blessing of the Bikes' took place as a spiritual send off.

The Panama City Christian Motorcyclist association held the 'Blessing of the Bikes' ceremony at the Shoppes at Edgewater.

The annual tradition wraps up the bike week here in Panama City Beach.

Bikers were invited to attend the ceremony, have their bikes blessed, and pray with group members.

"We pray over the bikes and bicycles for safe travels and it gives us a chance to talk to them about the Lord and how he can make a difference in changing their life," said George Pfeiffer, PCB Christian Motorcyclists Association Chapter. This is a great opportunity for us to work in our ministries and help spread that word and just bring people closer to that."

Pfeiffer says the goal of the group is to shatter the negative stereotypes that surround bikers, and show people that Christianity and riding go hand in hand.
