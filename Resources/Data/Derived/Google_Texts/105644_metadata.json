It goes back many decades. And I think it\u2019s an extraordinary historical achievement. And I\u2019m delighted to, you know, have \u2013 have seen it come to pass.\u201d\n\nAs this reporter revealed, Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber admitted that the Obamacare bill never had any cost controls in it.\n\n\u201cThe problem is it starts to go hand in hand with the mandate; you can\u2019t mandate insurance that\u2019s not affordable. This is going to be a major issue,\u201d Gruber, a White House adviser, said in a 2009 lecture.\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s different this time? Why are we closer than we\u2019ve ever been before? Because there are no cost controls in these proposals. Because this bill\u2019s about coverage. Which is good! Why should we hold 48 million uninsured people hostage to the fact that we don\u2019t yet know how to control costs in a politically acceptable way? Let\u2019s get the people covered and then let\u2019s do cost control,\u201d Gruber said.\n\nThus, Hillary Clinton\u2019s perceived handout is actually a fix to a problem that she promised would never be a problem in the first place. But all along, Democrats secretly knew the problem was coming.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton announced her plan to fight \"the rising costs of health care,\" but she previously said that Obamacare would control costs.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Hillary Clinton announced her plan to fight \"the rising costs of health care,\" but she previously said that Obamacare would control costs.", "title": "Obamacare Costs Rising, Not Falling, Admits Hillary", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/AP_918036454617.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/20/obamacare-costs-rising-not-falling-admits-hillary/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton announced her plan to fight \"the rising costs of health care,\" but she previously said that Obamacare would control costs.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/AP_918036454617.jpg", "title": "Obamacare Costs Rising, Not Falling, Admits Hillary", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Hillary Clinton, obamacare,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Breitbart TV,Obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-11-20T15:49:37-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd20c0\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDemocratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton announced her plan Friday to fight \u201cthe rising costs of health care,\u201d even though she previously assured Americans that Obamacare would \u201ccontrol costs.\u201dClinton, an Obamacare supporter, wants to give out billions of dollars in tax credits to deal with rising health care costs.\nLet\u2019s get the people covered and then let\u2019s do cost control,\u201d Gruber said.\nBut her proposed handout \u2013 $2,500 to people spending more than five percent of their income on health care and $5,000 to families paying the same \u2013 wouldn\u2019t be needed if Obamacare had actually brought down health care costs in the first place.\nWhy should we hold 48 million uninsured people hostage to the fact that we don\u2019t yet know how to control costs in a politically acceptable way?\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERClinton told then-ABC News correspondent Jake Tapper in 2010 that Obamacare would control costs, which would be an historic achievement for the United States and for the Democratic Party."}
