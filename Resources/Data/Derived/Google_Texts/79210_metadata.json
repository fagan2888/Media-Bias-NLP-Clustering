Then again, Republicans don\u2019t need a story to be sexy in order to get themselves worked up about it. And right now the brewing conflict over who will lead the CBO is just one of a growing number of potential rifts among the Republican rank and file.\n\nFirst, a word on one of Washington\u2019s wonkiest bodies. The CBO is a nonpartisan agency that calculates the impact pending legislation could have on the federal budget and the economy as a whole. That analysis of how a bill would impact the government\u2019s revenues and the economy as a whole is called a score. The speaker of the House and the president pro-tem of the Senate (Rep. John Boehner and Sen. Orrin Hatch, respectively) will soon jointly appoint a CBO director for a term that will begin in January. One important detail in the process for naming the head of the CBO is that the House and Senate budget committees take turns recommending who the new director ought to be. The Senate made the last recommendation, so now it\u2019s the House\u2019s turn.\n\nSince the GOP will control both chambers during the next Congress, some on the right are pushing for Republicans to pick a CBO director other than the current one, former Brookings Institution senior fellow Doug Elmendorf. Elmendorf has loyal backers in conservative circles (more on that in a minute), but he also has drawn substantial criticism for the method he used to score the Senate Gang of Eight\u2019s immigration bill and, per Red State, for being \u201ca dyed-in-the-wool leftist.\u201d CBO directors don\u2019t have term limits, so Elmendorf could keep the gig. But many influential activists on the right don\u2019t want that to happen.\n\nIf Elmendorf is out, some wonder what kind of loon House Republicans would pick?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere are two basic schools of thought on the right about whether Elmendorf is the man for the job (and I\u2019m painting with extremely broad brushstrokes here, for what that\u2019s worth). The first favors Elmendorf\u2019s re-appointment. In this school are the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s deputy director of economic policy studies, Michael Strain; the former chairman of George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, Gregory Mankiw; and Charles Murray, the author of The Bell Curve. Strain made the case for Elmendorf\u2019s continued reign at the CBO in a writeup for National Review Online. He credits him for the CBO\u2019s \u201creputation of impartiality during his tenure\u201d and implies that congressional Republicans may not have a better alternative.\n\n\u201cA CBO director less dedicated to solid, mainstream, academic, non-partisan analysis could put a large dent in the quality of the CBO\u2019s work and reputation,\u201d Strain writes. \u201cThat would be bad, a very bad outcome indeed.\u201d\n\nBut there seems to be a bit of a subtext here: If Elmendorf is out, what kind of loon would House Republicans pick?\n\nThe other school of thought holds that Elmendorf is totally untenable as CBO director. Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist is a vocal member of this school, as are American Commitment\u2019s Phil Kerpen and Heritage Action, the lobbying arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nDan Holler, a Heritage Action spokesman, was unequivocal in his opposition to Elmendorf\u2019s re-appointment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd if the Republican-controlled Congress would keep the guy who was at the CBO during Obamacare, especially in light of everything that [Obamacare adviser Jonathan] Gruber has said about the scoring and the sort of implicit misdirection that Congress employed and Elmendorf went along with,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAppointing him again is a sign that they\u2019re not ready to change Washington,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the message from the last election is that Washington needs to change.\u201d\n\nKerpen was comparably vehement in his opposition to Elmendorf\u2019s return.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cI would imagine that if this actually looked like it were going to happen, we could get a very large and vocal contingent of almost every conservative to weigh in against it,\u201d he said.\n\n(The specifics of this debate get really wonky really fast. If you\u2019re interested in more detail, you can read much more here at the Washington Post.)\n\nSo is it going to happen? A House aide close to the ongoing process said decision-makers are currently looking at an array of candidates. The aide didn\u2019t mention specific names. The big question now is: Will this disagreement flare up? Heritage Action has long been a thorn in the House leadership\u2019s side, and grass-roots conservatives\u2019 anger with Jonathan Gruber could well tarnish Elmendorf\u2019s reputation as a nonpartisan and an honest broker.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "You may not know who runs the Congressional Budget Office, but Republicans may go to blows over who gets to run it next.", "fb-share": "The Newest Obscure War Among Republicans", "sailthru.author": "Betsy Woodruff", "description": "The Congressional Budget Office director\u2019s odds of being reappointed might not be the single sexiest news story of the day.
