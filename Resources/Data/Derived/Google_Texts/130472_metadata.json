This is not the first challenge to the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate, either.\n\nThe Zubik v. Burwell case is an extension of the Hobby Lobby case from 2014, which ruled that certain corporations don't have to provide birth control coverage to employees if it's against their beliefs.\n\nSo, what are the religious nonprofits arguing?\n\nIt's an interesting argument. Basically, they think that the whole idea of claiming religious exemption from the requirement to cover employees' BC is violating their religious freedom. They say that even filling out the forms to get the exemption ultimately leads to sin (AKA those employees getting birth control elsewhere). Hmmmm.\n\nWhat's the Obamacare contraceptive mandate do anyways?\n\nWith this mandate, or requirement, access to contraceptives has increased drastically. This means less unplanned pregnancies and less abortions across the US.\n\nMany women do not want their employers infringing on their access to BC in the first place. Many people can't believe this conversation is still happening.\n\n99% of women use birth control. Here's why it is so crucial to their health and economic security. #HandsOffMyBC pic.twitter.com/0TBOlVXpZ0 \u2014 EMILY's List (@emilyslist) March 23, 2016\n\nHow you feel when it's 2016 & you're on the steps of #SCOTUS to tell bosses #HandsOffMyBC. https://t.co/hJkNqMpZyQ pic.twitter.com/srFrRB0Rvj \u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPact) March 23, 2016\n\nWe're at the Supreme Court today to say: #HandsOffMyBC! pic.twitter.com/o0j2nxXmDf \u2014 CenterforReproRights (@ReproRights) March 23, 2016\n\nEven politicians are weighing in.\n\nNo, we\u2019re not gonna deny coverage for contraception or any other procedure because an employer has a \u201cmoral\u201d objection to it. #HandsOffMyBC \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) March 23, 2016\n\nWomen deserve birth control coverage no matter where they work.
