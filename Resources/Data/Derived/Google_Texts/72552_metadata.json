These are the little people that U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., likes to say she can be counted on to support against big moneyed interests.\n\nExcept when she doesn\u2019t, like now.\n\nThe senator\u2019s office is rejoicing over her role in the backroom deal to suspend the med-tech tax.\n\nIn 2010, Congress included a range of small taxes and fees in the ACA to subsidize folks needing health coverage they couldn\u2019t afford.\n\nIn the early days of health reform, even the industry acknowledged that device makers would benefit from a new law because more people would use the health system supplied with devices. In fact, some publicly supported the ACA.\n\nBut that changed when the med-tech tax was added to the bill. Soon a multimillion-dollar campaign was underway to nix the tax.\n\nU.S. Rep. Erik Paulsen, R-Minn., whose campaign fund benefits from Minnesota\u2019s huge contingent of medical-device companies, was an eager crusader against a tax he calls \u201ca jobs crusher.\u201d\n\nThe industry peppered the media with claims that \u201c30,000 jobs\u201d would be lost or moved overseas due to the tax, exports would dry up, and research and development would suffer.\n\nBut every look at the industry\u2019s \u201cfacts\u201d proved them to be exaggerated or flat-out wrong. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said job-loss claims were \u201cseriously flawed.\u201d Bloomberg Government called them \u201cnot credible.\u201d And the Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker extensively reviewed the claims before issuing three Pinocchios \u2014 which is in the \u201cbaloney\u201d range.\n\nAfter the device tax went into effect in 2013, none of the job-loss claims could be verified by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Plus, a prominent industry group, EvaluateMedTech, forecast that despite the tax the industry was poised to continue its impressive growth for at least the next decade.\n\nAnd even Paulsen was surprised when told that instead of the tax being 2.3 percent on sales, its effective rate was 1.5 percent, because as an excise tax it\u2019s deductible on corporate income taxes.\n\nNone of the dire claims by industry would stick. That didn\u2019t matter to Paulsen, who\u2019s at least consistent with his anti-tax, pro-business bent.\n\nBut it was troubling that both of Minnesota\u2019s Democratic senators, Klobuchar and Sen. Al Franken, carried the banner of bogus industry claims as they joined Paulsen and even then-Rep. Michelle Bachman, R-Minn., in the drumbeat against the tax.\n\nApparently feeling the heat, Klobuchar once indicated she\u2019d support tax repeal only if lost revenue would be made up by budget cuts elsewhere. She said she\u2019d work on a so-called \u201cpay for\u201d with another powerful opponent, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, but nothing came of it.\n\nThe anti-tax forces were out of credible ammunition and seemed to go into hiatus. Until earlier this week, when House leaders agreed to slip the tax-suspension into the massive spending bill. Given the late-year timing and the bill\u2019s size, it\u2019s unlikely to face an Obama veto.\n\nAs she crowed about the tax suspension, Klobuchar, through an aide, engaged in fanciful political spin by suggesting that Obama has softened on his opposition to eliminating the tax.\n\nKlobuchar\u2019s office was asked about the senator\u2019s earlier vow to support repeal only if poor folks wouldn\u2019t be hurt by billions in lost revenue.\n\nAfter thinking about it for most of the day, Klobuchar\u2019s aide said she no longer felt a commitment for a \u201cpay for\u201d because a later estimate shows that the ACA is costing less, so a two-year suspension of the tax would have a lesser effect on low-income people.\n\nWe should all feel better.\n\nRon Way, of Edina, is an investor representative on the boards of five medical start-ups.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even Sens.
