Suzanne Kessler of Manchester died in a two-car head-on crash Thursday morning on Route 539.

Investigators said they were not sure why the Cadillac Deville driven by Kenneth Busardo, 27, of Barnegat, veered into the path of Kessler's 2000 Chevy Cavalier.

Kessler had been headed south just before 6 a.m. on Route 539 near milepost 16 when Busardo, who was driving north, drifted into the southbound lane, Ocean County Prosecutor's office spokesman Al Della Fave said.

Kessler was pronounced dead at the scene.

Della Fave said Busardo suffered minor injuries, but was taken to Southern Ocean Medical Center in Stafford to have blood drawn.

"We're going to wait for this blood sample to be analyzed and look at some other things," he said. "We'll make a determination later if charges will be filed."

Lacey Township Police's Accident Investigation Unit responded with the Ocean County Prosecutor's office and the Ocean County Criminal Investigation Unit.
