(KTVI)-The politics of rage is driving both the government shutdown and threats of a possible default on U.S. debt later this month. The conservative Republican rage in the House of Representatives against Obamacare resulted in them demanding that the Affordable Care Act be de-funded or the government would shut down. The government did close while Obamacare health insurance exchanges opened. Congress now has to increase the federal debt limit by October 17or the U.S. government will default on some of its debt payments.

So what's that mean for us if thousands of federal workers lose paychecks or if the U.S. defaults on part of its debt? Charles Jaco sits down with Dr. Steve Fazzari , an economist at Washington University and associate director of the Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy.
