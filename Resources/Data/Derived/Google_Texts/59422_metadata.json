I grew up in Fairfax County. My mother was a bureaucrat all her professional life with the Department of Agriculture and did some time on the Hill, for instance, working with Congressman Mike Epsy, who was President Bill Clinton\u2019s appointment to the Secretary of Agriculture,\u201d she said. \u201cI grew up with public policy and civil service is just inherent in your life.\u201d\n\nBedell, 43, will face 51-year-old freshman Rep. Dave Brat, R-Richmond, in the November election, and said that she also decided to enter the race as the party nominee to provide a viable replacement in spite of the district being historically Republican.\n\n\u201cI find it very disconcerting to have any unopposed elections for either side. I think it makes both parties better to hear the views of the other side and for the voters to have those alternatives,\u201d she said.\n\nBedell earned a communications degree from Virginia Tech before getting her law degree from the College of William & Mary. She feels that her legal know-how makes her well-suited for Congress.\n\nA Chesterfield County resident, Bedell has been a general practice attorney for nearly two decades and is solo practitioner at the McNeil Law Group in Richmond\u2019s Church Hill District \u2014 McNeil is her maiden name. Bedell\u2019s father is a retired lawyer.\n\n\u201cI do everything but criminal defense \u2014 custody cases, contract dispute, estate litigation, wills,\u201d she said. \u201cIt transfers well to having that broad spectrum of expertise you would need sitting on different committees of Congress. On some level, I have been representing people and small businesses in the 7th in another branch of government for almost 20 years.\u201d\n\nBedell, a wife and mother of two, said her campaign is focused on building a stronger economy. She advocated for increased telecommuting opportunities for Culpeper workers as well upping the minimum wage in Virginia to $10. On the latter, \u201cI have the mom approach first and foremost,\u201d she said.\n\nBedell said her 14-year-old daughter\u2019s friends won\u2019t babysit for anything less than $10/hour, which she called \u201cthe floor\u201d for Virginia\u2019s minimum wage.\n\n\u201cOne of the big things is if we increase people\u2019s spending power, it\u2019s going to come back around to improved profits for the business. Consumers help drive our economy and if they have some extra money then our economy will grow,\u201d she said.\n\nBedell believes access to affordable healthcare is a basic human right and said the Affordable Care Act was a start in that direction on which the country should continue to build.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons as well I am a proponent of Planned Parenthood because of their incredible contribution to providing accessible, affordable healthcare to a lot of Americans that has nothing to do with any of the roles they\u2019re often painted to be involved in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for that funding to continue to continue to provide that.\u201d\n\nAsked her position on abortion, Bedell said she finds the terms, pro-life and pro-choice, disingenuous.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that I really would hope that no one would have to make that choice. That being said, if it\u2019s a choice that has to be made I certainly believe every woman has the right to make that choice,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we had greater education and greater access to birth control then less people would have to be faced with that choice.\u201d\n\nBedell fully supports adopting the Equality Act that would amend the 1960s-era Civil Rights Act to include broad protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n\u201cI believe that the constitution says that all men are created equal and we know through common law that includes every individual in the country. It\u2019s very clear,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the topic of immigration reform, Bedell said it\u2019s a priority that\u2019s integral to addressing the budget and deficit concerns shared by so many Americans.\n\n\u201cWe have to consider the revenue increases that could come from reasonable immigration reform. We have to recognize that if we have a pathway to citizenship for people who are willing to embrace the responsibility of paying taxes that comes with the right of citizenship, we\u2019re working toward addressing the deficit and debt from a position that doesn\u2019t affect people\u2019s Social Security and Medicare,\u201d she said.\n\nBedell said that though Rep. Brat has clearly identified the problems of the national debt and deficit during his first term in office that he hasn\u2019t submitted any \u201cconcrete proposals\u201d to fixing the problem other than voting against his party\u2019s budget or proposing cuts to programs such as Social Security and Medicare.\n\n\u201cThere are other approaches to the budget issue that involve greater government accountability, duplicative services, inefficiencies and increasing revenue. I think before we could even consider breaching the social contract we\u2019ve made with seniors we need to look at those,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the 2nd Amendment, Bedell said the issue is not gun control, but gun violence.\n\n\u201cI am really going to focus on re-characterizing it because we have more in common than we differ,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no question in my mind the 2nd Amendment provides Americans the right to own a gun. There is no question in my mind that most Americans don\u2019t want guns used for gun violence, and because we all agree on that, I know there is room for responsible legislation that would reduce gun violence in America.\u201d\n\nIf elected, Bedell said she would work to compromise within her own party, across the aisle and with whomever is the next president. She added that she didn\u2019t think Brat had done a very good job at that.\n\n\u201cI do recognize that perfect is virtually impossible in politics. However, the ideas that Republicans bring to the table and the ideas that Democrats bring to the table are representative of all of us,\u201d she said. \u201dIt is na\u00efve for any party to ignore the ideas of the other, and I think my background has taught me how to listen well to the other side, how to listen well to my side and figure out where we can find solutions that are reasonable and acceptable to both.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Progress", "description": "Richmond attorney running against Brat in November", "title": "Democrat Bedell on the issues in 7th District congressional race", "url": "http://www.dailyprogress.com/starexponent/news/democrat-bedell-on-the-issues-in-th-district-congressional-race/article_fc6e20a0-0cbc-11e6-8d62-9fc10c7861e6.html", "image": {"width": 969, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dailyprogress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/6f/86f474aa-0cbc-11e6-8d17-cf2465bf8c48/57212adddbbb9.image.jpg?resize=969%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "Richmond attorney running against Brat in November", "fb": {"admins": "100001414653607,10152170988485008,10101111419558100", "app_id": 366214100134806}, "google-site-verification": "sz237c0jgdTfDm1AqlrYHFhfluLF3VvL35nkk6TaMaM", "keywords": "news,local_news,top_story", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailyprogress"}, "news_keywords": "news,local_news,top_story"}, "article_summary": "Richmond attorney Eileen Bedell says she's running for Congress to represent Virginia\u2019s 7th District because government involvement is in her blood and she supports voter choice.\nBedell earned a communications degree from Virginia Tech before getting her law degree from the College of William & Mary.\nOn the 2nd Amendment, Bedell said the issue is not gun control, but gun violence.\nBedell said her 14-year-old daughter\u2019s friends won\u2019t babysit for anything less than $10/hour, which she called \u201cthe floor\u201d for Virginia\u2019s minimum wage.\n\u201cThere is no question in my mind the 2nd Amendment provides Americans the right to own a gun."}
