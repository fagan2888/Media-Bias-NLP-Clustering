The average wait time at a doctor's office dropped a full minute from last year — and you can thank Obamacare for it, according to a new study.

But it’s not all good news: Americans still have to wait an average of 19 minutes and 16 seconds to see their doctor, according to the survey by Vitals.com, a physician review website.

The company attributed the one-minute improvement from last year to the growth in walk-in clinics that has accompanied the Affordable Care Act.

"Urgent care centers and retail clinics are a convenient, lower cost alternative to emergency rooms, and may be especially attractive to the newly insured under the Affordable Care Act, who often contend with high deductibles," said Heyward Donigan, CEO of Vitals.

There are now about 1,600 walk-in clinics across the country, up from 1,200 in 2011, according to the Convenient Care Association. And Accenture predicts there will be 3,000 by 2017 as patients say they prefer to see doctors without having to wait days to schedule an appointment.

Wait times differed dramatically by specialty. Psychologists have the shortest wait time on average (11 minutes, 33 seconds), whereas pain management specialists have the longest (24 minutes, 52 seconds).

Location also affects wait times. Patients in New Hampshire — the luckiest — wait 15 minutes, 4 seconds, while Alabama patients wait the longest, with an average of 23 minutes, 25 seconds.

This is the sixth annual wait time report from Vitals, which calculated data based on patient reports. The numbers have see-sawed over the last five years, but all remained at about 20 minutes.
