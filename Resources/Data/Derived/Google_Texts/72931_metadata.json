Turns out this \"perfect donor\" was college dropout Chris Aggeles, who has also been diagnosed with three serious mental disorders.\n\nThe identity of Aggeles, 39, was uncovered two years ago after Xytek accidentally included his name in an email. This information prompted some curious moms to take to the internet and do some Google sleuthing. To their horror, they found out that the man, who the sperm bank described as \u201cmature beyond his years\u201d with an undergraduate degree in neuroscience and a master\u2019s degree in artificial intelligences, was actually a felon who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and schizophrenia. \u201cIt was like a dream turned nightmare in an instant,\u201d Angie Collins told The Toronto Star. Collins and her partner Margaret Elizabeth filed a lawsuit against the sperm bank last year,\n\nShe said she felt sick upon hearing the news, realizing that her \u201cson\u2019s life could just turn on a dime in puberty.\u201d It's a valid cause for concern, given mental illnesses plague an estimated 26.2 percent of U.S. adults aged 18 and older in a given year. These are complex disorders that arise as a result of an interplay genetic and environmental factors, according to the National Society of Genetic Counselors, suggesting there is a chance her son has a chance of developing at least one of Aggeles\u2019s diagnosed mental disorders.\n\nCollins\u2019 lawsuit, which accused the sperm bank and donor of \u201cmisrepresenting the medical and social history of the donor,\u201d was initially tossed out by an Atlanta judge for procedural issues, CBS News reported. The case was also considered a \u201cwrongful birth\u201d claim, which is not recognized under Georgia law.\n\nBut that\u2019s not stopping Collins. On Wednesday, she and two other Ontario families filed a new lawsuit against the sperm bank and its Ontario distributor, claiming the companies continued to promote and sell the donor\u2019s sperm even after the sperm bank learned of the discrepancies between the sperm they were advertising and the sperm being delivered, The Star reported.\n\nApparently, Aggeles\u2019 lie went undetected for more than a decade. During that time, his sperm was used to create at least 36 children in the U.S., Canada and the UK between 2000 and 2014, according to The Star. Nancy Hersh, a San-Francisco-based lawyer who is representing some of the families, speculated Aggeles could have more children running around. She said some of his sperm was stored and made available for use even after his lies came to light.\n\nAggeles\u2019 real identity is the opposite of what many women look for in a sperm donor. A 2015 study published in the journal Applied Economics Letters found that women tend to look for smart, \u201cbut shy and calm\u201d sperm donors. So Collins is taking this opportunity to push for overall change in the sperm-bank industry.\n\n\u201cGiven the current state of affairs in the sperm-bank industry, it is strictly a matter of luck if a sperm donor is an upstanding and healthy individual, not a matter of testing, screening, regulating or legislating,\u201d she said. \u201cWho would have thought that an industry that makes people would be like this?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "3, families, sue, sperm, bank, billing, mentally, ill, felon, perfect, donor", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Three families are suing a Georgia-based sperm bank for misrepresenting a mentally ill felon as a \"perfect donor.\"", "title": "Sperm Bank's 'Perfect Donor' Turns Out To Be Mentally Ill Felon", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/3-families-sue-sperm-bank-perfect-donor-mental-illness-criminal-382201", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/16/sperm.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Three families are suing a Georgia-based sperm bank for misrepresenting a mentally ill felon as a \"perfect donor.\"", "title": "Sperm Bank's 'Perfect Donor' Turns Out To Be Mentally Ill Felon", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/3-families-sue-sperm-bank-perfect-donor-mental-illness-criminal-382201", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/16/sperm.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/16/sperm.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-04-16T13:49:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-16T14:16:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Three families are suing a Georgia-based sperm bank for misrepresenting a mentally ill felon as a \"perfect donor.\""}, "article_summary": "Xytek, a Georgia-based sperm bank, is in hot water for telling parent hopefuls that Sperm Donor 9623 was a healthy, post-doctoral student with an IQ of 160.\nAggeles\u2019 real identity is the opposite of what many women look for in a sperm donor.\nCollins\u2019 lawsuit, which accused the sperm bank and donor of \u201cmisrepresenting the medical and social history of the donor,\u201d was initially tossed out by an Atlanta judge for procedural issues, CBS News reported.\nTurns out this \"perfect donor\" was college dropout Chris Aggeles, who has also been diagnosed with three serious mental disorders.\nOn Wednesday, she and two other Ontario families filed a new lawsuit against the sperm bank and its Ontario distributor, claiming the companies continued to promote and sell the donor\u2019s sperm even after the sperm bank learned of the discrepancies between the sperm they were advertising and the sperm being delivered, The Star reported."}
