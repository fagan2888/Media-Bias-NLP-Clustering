What is wrong with you, it's a sin!!!!\"\n\nThe letter was typed and unsigned. The envelope had no return address on it.\n\nClick on the photo to read the full letter.\n\nThe sender said invitations were forwarded to an anti-gay group which would protest at their wedding.\n\n\"I guess we thought we knew the people that were coming and we didn't know that well,\" Keith said.\n\nKeith and Chad met nine years ago. They can't wait to get married this May.\n\n\"A happy occasion. It's something we waited a long time for, we honestly never thought we'd be able to do it,\" Chad said.\n\nThey poured their hearts into this wedding.\n\n\"Our colors are gold and blue,\" Keith said.\n\nThey've painted decorations and hand-made gifts. They even built a cake stand.\n\nThey won't let this letter ruin their wedding.\n\n\"Never even crossed my mind -- I never even thought about canceling and quite frankly, other than our initial shock of the letter this made us both want to do it more,\" Keith said.\n\nNow they're left narrowing down their guest list, trying to figure out who sent them this letter. But the support they got from all of the other guests and even strangers after they posted the letter online has been overwhelming.\n\n\"This letter we received yesterday is more of a reason to move forward with it. Love will win in the end, that's what it comes down to,\" Chad said.\n\nKeith and Chad have not changed their wedding date or venue and the wedding will go on as planned.\n\nIt's on private property, so they say if protesters show up, they're not getting in.\n\nUPDATE: New Vision UCC in Canton -- self-described as an open and affirming congregation of the United Church of Christ -- is hosting a card shower for Chad and Keith. Letters of support can be sent to the address below:\n\nNew Vision United Church of Christ\n\n3129 Market Ave North, Canton, Ohio 44714\n\nAttn: Chad and Keith\n\nFollow Cleveland 19 News:\n\nDownload the Cleveland 19 News app.\n\nCopyright 2016 WOIO.
