After its 2012 purchase of a 45 percent stake in European health and beauty retailer Alliance Boots GmbH, Walgreen last year announced a 10-year deal with drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp., based in Valley Forge, Pa. The partnership, which may transform the way prescription drugs are purchased and shipped around the world, took effect in September.\n\n\"All of this culminated in a year of solid progress and a five-year total shareholder return for our stock of 145 percent,\" Walgreen CEO Greg Wasson said during the meeting.\n\nHere are a few key points to look for in 2014:\n\n\u2022 Executives say the transition to the Affordable Care Act has gone fairly smoothly so far and will ultimately result in more business. Kermit Crawford, president of Walgreen's pharmacy, health and wellness division, said he hopes and expects to gain \"more than our fair share\" of prescription business from the estimated 30 million Americans who will be newly insured this year. Walgreen controls about 20 percent of the prescription drug market in the U.S., so that could mean gaining new pharmacy business from 6 million or more people.\n\n\u2022 Walgreen isn't done rolling out its fancy flagship stores. Two years after debuting the concept in the Loop, the company operates 13 such stores in nine markets from New York to Los Angeles. Mark Wagner, Walgreen's president of operations and community management, said the company wants to open additional stores in the next 16 to 24 months in cities including Miami, San Francisco, Houston and more in Los Angeles.\n\n\u2022 Walgreen will continue to focus on improving front-of-store health and beauty items and private-label offerings by leveraging its partnership with Alliance Boots. The European retailer owns the No. 7 beauty and cosmetics brand that has been a popular staple in Europe for years. In addition to offering No. 7 products, Walgreen will now begin to use Alliance Boots' research pipeline to create its own exclusive beauty products, according to Alex Gourlay, a former Alliance Boots senior executive who took over as Walgreen's president of customer experience and daily living in August.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Brigid Sweeney", "timeCrawled": "20160524_02:18:22", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more.", "title": "Walgreen plans more prescriptions, flagship stores, beauty products", "taxo_Industries": "Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20140109/NEWS07/140109844/AR/0/AR-140109844.jpg", "taxo_People": "Gregory Wasson", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "summary": "Walgreen executives shared expectations for 2014, and beyond, at the Deerfield-based drug company's annual meeting.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "Walgreen executives shared expectations for 2014, and beyond, at the Deerfield-based drug company's annual meeting.", "title": "Walgreen looks ahead to more prescriptions, more fancy stores \u2014 and more beauty products", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140109/NEWS07/140109844/walgreen-looks-ahead-to-more-prescriptions-more-fancy-stores-and-more-beauty-products", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20140109/NEWS07/140109844/AR/0/AR-140109844.jpg", "type": "article"}, "published_at": "2014-1-9", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS07/140109844", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "Walgreens Boots Alliance", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20140109/NEWS07/140109844/AR/0/AR-140109844.jpg&maxw=400", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Walgreen plans more prescriptions, flagship stores, beauty products"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "categoryName": "CCB - Consumer"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad27\"", "article_summary": "Walgreen Co. executives yesterday outlined expectations for higher prescription sales, more flagship stores and an expanded line of exclusive beauty products.\n\u2022 Walgreen will continue to focus on improving front-of-store health and beauty items and private-label offerings by leveraging its partnership with Alliance Boots.\n7 products, Walgreen will now begin to use Alliance Boots' research pipeline to create its own exclusive beauty products, according to Alex Gourlay, a former Alliance Boots senior executive who took over as Walgreen's president of customer experience and daily living in August.\nAfter its 2012 purchase of a 45 percent stake in European health and beauty retailer Alliance Boots GmbH, Walgreen last year announced a 10-year deal with drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp., based in Valley Forge, Pa.\n\u2022 Walgreen isn't done rolling out its fancy flagship stores."}
