It increases the penalties for soliciting another for prostitution.\n\nListen to the story!\n\nProstitution is seen as one of the greatest drivers of human trafficking in Florida.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ve said, all along that one of the things that many people would acknowledge, but would never do anything about, is the demand for the purchase of sex,\u201d said Rep. Ross Spano R-Dover). \u201cSo, until you address that part of that education, you can never fully address the problem of human trafficking.\u201d\n\nSpano is the House sponsor of a newly signed measure enhancing the criminal penalties for solicitation. A first offense is now bumped up to a first degree misdemeanor from a second degree misdemeanor. The offender must also spend a minimum of 10 days in jail, perform 100 hours of community service, and attend an educational program on the negative effects of human trafficking and prostitution. It also allows a victim to petition the court to expunge their criminal history relating to human trafficking.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to make a positive impact,\u201d added Spano. \u201cAnd, if it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll make another run at it, and we\u2019ll do whatever we have to do to make sure that people\u2014men primarily\u2014understand what it means and the impact that it has when they take actions that effect other people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nIt goes into effect October 1st. So, do a couple public records exemptions that protect the identity and location of human trafficking victims in law enforcement investigative records.\n\n\u201cBecause traffickers consider and perceive their victims to be chattel or property, when they\u2019re taken away from them, they hunt them down, and try to get them back,\u201d continued Spano. \u201cSo, this will actually protect the addresses and identifying information of these safe houses and public records, so the traffickers can\u2019t find those locations and find their victims.\u201d\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A bill aimed at toughening Florida\u2019s human trafficking laws will become law in a few months, following Governor Rick Scott\u2019s signing.
