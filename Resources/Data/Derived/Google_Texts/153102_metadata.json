But because of ObamaCare\u2019s menu-labeling requirements, a little publicized provision of the law, they\u2019ve had to switch to a pre-packaged sauce or discontinue sauces.\n\n\u201cDue to the nutritional labeling requirements of ObamaCare, we have to serve pre-packaged, pre-made fry sauce,\u201d said the franchisee in a letter, made available by The Quinton Report. \u201cWe can no longer make our own as we have done for many years. The additional cost to us is substantial, about $5,800 per year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI regret to say, we are forced to pass the cost of pre-packaged fry sauce, for take-out, along to you the customer. We will serve pre-made bulk fry sauce in the lobby at no additional charge,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cIt is for the same reason we have had to discontinue our Buffalo Sauce and Habanero Ketchup, which were made in-store.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease be assured we are doing our very best to keep the cost to you, our customer, down while still maintaining the quality you have come to expect from us,\u201d the letter added.\n\nThis provision of ObamaCare (Section 4205) requires restaurant chains with 20 or more locations to disclose the caloric content of menu items to their customers. It also applies to grocery and convenience store chains.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is overseeing the implementation of this provision, estimates that it will cost restaurants, grocery and convenience store chains as much as $537 million to comply the regulations. The high-end cost to restaurants alone is $457 million. The estimates that annual recurring compliance costs will run as high as $64 million.\n\nThe FDA says that the requirement will allow customers to see how many calories they\u2019re consuming, in hopes that it will reduce obesity.\n\n\u201cThe potential benefit from the proposed rule stems from the effect that decreasing the consumption of calories from restaurant and restaurant-type food has on mitigating obesity rates and growth in the U.S. population,\u201d said the FDA of the provision. \u201cWhile survey data has shown that calorie labeling increases the number of people who see, and claim to use, this information, the literature has found mixed results on the effect of calorie posting on actual food consumption.\u201d\n\nDaren Bakst of the Heritage Foundation recently noted that menu-labeling hasn\u2019t had much success when it has been tried.\n\n\u201cThe Obamacare menu-labeling law is modeled after a provision that has been in place in New York City since 2008. New York University and Yale researchers collected receipts before and after the New York City law went into effect and found that individuals ordered more calories after the labeling law went into effect,\u201d wrote Bakst.\n\n\u201cThey also ordered more calories than a similar population in Newark, where there was no labeling law,\u201d he added.\n\nSo basically, the provision is pointless, but it\u2019s going to cost restaurants and others that will have to comply with it a lot of money just to make members of Congress who voted for the law and bureaucrats who wrote the rules feel good about themselves.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "calories,Dairy Queen,Daren Bakst,fast food,FDA,grocery stores,Heritage Foundation,Jeff Quinton,menu-labeling,Nanny State,ObamaCare,obesity,restaurants,The Quinton Report,washington", "description": "Dairy Queen A Dairy Queen in Washington\u00a0state had been making their own homemade sauces for customers.
