We were just discussing that, of course, we would\u2019ve signed it, but we had never heard of it, and these were a lot of high-level industry people.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Clooney appears to be changing his story a bit. Yesterday, Clooney told THR, \u201cBryan Lourd and I were sent a letter from the head of the MPAA Chris Dodd, which was to be circulated to the studios. It didn\u2019t ask for support for the release of the film in the face of threats, so we wrote a new letter and sent it to the MPAA. Over the next 24 hours, Bryan asked several people to sign on to the petition. One said he would if others did, [and] the rest said, flat-out, \u2018No.\u2019 Chris Dodd told Bryan that he had no takers either.\u201d\n\nThis is what Clooney told Deadline last week: \u201c[The petition] was sent to basically the heads of every place. They told Bryan Lourd, \u2018I can\u2019t sign this.\u2019 What? How can you not sign this? I\u2019m not going to name anyone, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m here to do, but nobody signed the letter[.]\u201d\n\nNo one who said they did not receive the petition would go on the record with THR.\n\nClooney will not name anyone who refused to sign the petition.\n\nRegardless, we\u2019re still left wondering why Clooney didn\u2019t ask Sorkin, Lowe, and Apatow to sign on.\n\nJohn Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Studio Execs to George Clooney: Uhm, We Never Received Your Sony Petition", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Studio Execs to George Clooney: Uhm, We Never Received Your Sony Petition", "title": "Studio Execs to George Clooney: Uhm, We Never Received Your Sony Petition - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/clooney.jpg", "height": 600}, "updated_time": "2014-12-24T06:29:37-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2014/12/24/studio-execs-to-george-clooney-uhm-we-never-received-your-sony-petition/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Studio Execs to George Clooney: Uhm, We Never Received Your Sony Petition", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/clooney.jpg", "title": "Studio Execs to George Clooney: Uhm, We Never Received Your Sony Petition - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "George Clooney, Hollywood, Hollywood Reporter, Judd Apatow, Sony, Sony Hack, Sony Pictures, The Interview,Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2014-12-24T06:20:00-07:00", "section": "Big Hollywood", "modified_time": "2014-12-24T06:29:37-07:00", "tag": "The Interview", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "According to the Hollywood Reporter, though, George Clooney didn\u2019t ask a whole lot of people to sign his George Clooney petition before George Clooney ran to the media to claim that only George Clooney had the George Clooney-ish courage to stand up for Sony.\nWhy George Clooney didn\u2019t ask Rob Lowe, Aaron Sorkin, and Judd Apatow to sign the George Clooney petition is only something George Clooney can answer.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAccording to George Clooney, George Clooney\u2019s petition proved that only George Clooney had the moral courage to stand up to the terrorists.\nRegardless, we\u2019re still left wondering why Clooney didn\u2019t ask Sorkin, Lowe, and Apatow to sign on.\nYesterday, Clooney told THR, \u201cBryan Lourd and I were sent a letter from the head of the MPAA Chris Dodd, which was to be circulated to the studios."}
