They said the finding, if confirmed, could be a \"game changer\" in the probe.\n\nCNN reported that one U.S. official said Malik had made the pledge to al-Baghdadi in a posting on Facebook on Wednesday, the day of the attack, under an account that used a different name.\n\nThough large information gaps remain, it appeared to be the strongest evidence so far that the attack may have been inspired by Islamic State. But U.S. government sources said there was no sign that it had been directed by the militant group, which has seized swathes of Syria and Iraq and claimed the deadly Nov. 13 attacks in Paris.\n\nFATHER BECAME \"CONSERVATIVE AND HARDLINE\"\n\nTwo Pakistani officials said Malik was from Karor Lal Esan, a city on the west coast of the Indus River in southern Punjab province. She moved to Saudi Arabia with her father, an engineer, 25 years ago, they said.\n\nShe returned home five or six years ago to study at Bahauddin Zakariya University in Multan to become a pharmacist, they said.\n\nThe area in Punjab where she spent her early years and later went to university is a \u201crecruitment ground\u201d and stronghold of Islamist groups with ties to al Qaeda, said Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States. Among the militant groups with a presence there is Lashkar-e-Taiba, which has been blamed for the November 2008 killing spree in the Indian financial capital of Mumbai.\n\n\"Our brother changed a lot since he went to Saudi,\" Malik's uncle, Javed Rabbani, said of Malik's father. \"When relatives visited him, they would come back and tell us how conservative and hardline he had become,\" he said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nA source close to the Saudi government said that during Malik\u2019s time in Saudi Arabia nothing came to authorities\u2019 attention there that suggested she was involved with radical Islamic groups. Malik was not on any Saudi law enforcement or intelligence watchlist, the source said.\n\nMalik's father, Gulzar, had built a house in Multan, where he stays when he visits Pakistan, according to another uncle, Malik Anwaar.\n\nHe said Gulzar had a falling-out long ago with the rest of the family, citing a dispute over a house among other matters. \u201cWe are completely estranged,\u201d Anwaar said.\n\nRabbani said he had been contacted by Pakistani intelligence as part of the investigation into the San Bernardino shooting.\n\nMalik had two brothers and two sisters and was related to Ahmed Ali Aulak, a former provincial minister, the Pakistani officials said.\n\nThe exact circumstances of how Farook and Malik met remained unclear but they had apparently been married for two years. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said Malik was in the United States on a visa under a Pakistani passport.\n\nWhile Farook had an active presence online, Malik's digital footprint is harder to trace. A Facebook profile established under an alias by Malik was removed by the company for violating its community standards, which prohibit praise or promotion of \u201cacts of terror,\" a spokesman said on Friday.\n\nBut her name was attached to a gift registry for their baby hosted by the website TheBump.com. According to the registry, Malik's baby had been due on May 17.\n\nJust hours before the couple opened fire on Farook\u2019s co-workers in a government building in San Bernardino, they had dropped off their daughter at his mother\u2019s house, telling her they had a doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\n(Additional reporting by Idrees Ali, Warren Strobel and Jonathan Landay in Washington; Writing by Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Bill Trott, Will Dunham, Toni Reinhold)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Tashfeen Malik's path to accused mass killer in California began", "title": "Exclusive: Investigators piece together portrait of Pakistani woman in shooting massacre", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/04/Exclusive-Accused-California-shooter-lived-Saudi-Arabia-years-Pakistani", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/california-shooting-suspects_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/04/Exclusive-Accused-California-shooter-lived-Saudi-Arabia-years-Pakistani", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/california-shooting-suspects_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Tashfeen Malik's path to accused mass killer in California began", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5a2c\"", "article_summary": "\"Our brother changed a lot since he went to Saudi,\" Malik's uncle, Javed Rabbani, said of Malik's father.\nMalik's father, Gulzar, had built a house in Multan, where he stays when he visits Pakistan, according to another uncle, Malik Anwaar.\nShe moved to Saudi Arabia with her father, an engineer, 25 years ago, they said.\nThe intensive search for clues, extending to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, could help U.S. investigators piece together what drove Malik and her husband to leave their infant daughter with his mother, don assault-style clothing and carry out the shooting.\nRabbani said he had been contacted by Pakistani intelligence as part of the investigation into the San Bernardino shooting."}
