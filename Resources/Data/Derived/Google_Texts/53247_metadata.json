Before long he was suicidal.\n\n\"The heroin had stopped working,\" he said.\n\nHe finally secured a place at the only state-funded in-patient treatment center in his area \u2014 but only after calling every day for three weeks.\n\n\u201cI was one of those people who was definitely nearly a casualty of the heroin crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nDean LeMire, 29, with his family.

Among 18- to 25-year-olds, New Hampshire ranked among the highest of all states for binge drinking and use of illicit drugs in the previous 30 days, according to the most recent National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\n\nPoliticians Confront Opioids\n\nPressed by residents, the visiting candidates have added drug addition as a top talking point alongside the economy and terrorism. A video of New Jersey's Republican Gov. Chris Christie describing the care his mother, a longtime smoker addicted to nicotine, received for lung cancer got more than 3 million views. He also shared the story of a law school friend who became addicted to Percocet after injuring his back.\n\n\u201cAnd he couldn\u2019t get help and he\u2019s dead,\u201d Christie told a New Hampshire audience as he advocated for treatment.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich described increasing prison drug rehabilitation and law enforcement in his state. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush talked about his daughter\u2019s struggle with drug addiction, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina about the death of her step-daughter from a drug overdose.\n\nCan Congress Fix Opioid Epidemic? U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark, a Democrat serving Massachusetts' 5th District, joins Kelly Bates to discuss the ongoing crisis of opioid addiction. (Published Wednesday, Sept. 2, 2015)\n\nOn the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton put forward a $10 billion plan for treatment. Sen. Bernie Sanders in neighboring Vermont advocates for the overdose antidote, naloxone, to be made more widely available.\n\nAcross the country, overdoses from heroin have soared in the last decade, with the rate of heroin-related deaths nearly quadrupling between 2002 and 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 8,200 people died in 2013.\n\nNew England officials have been outspoken about the epidemic. Last year, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin devoted his entire State of the State address to the state\u2019s heroin problem and budgeted money for medication-assisted treatment. Connecticut improved prescription drug monitoring and Rhode Island school nurses pushed for supplies of naloxone. Maine\u2019s Gov. Paul LePage earlier this month focused on enforcement and authorized hiring 10 new drug agents.\n\nGov. Baker Unveils Opioid Abuse Bill Gov. Charlie Baker is calling for a 72-hour limit on first-time prescriptions for opioid painkillers and changes in the state's civil commitment laws as part of a strategy to curtail a surge in drug overdoses.

We will assign them an 'angel' who will be their guide through the process. Not in hours or days, but on the spot.\u201d\n\nAny addict who walks into the police station with the remainder of their drug equipment (needles, etc) or drugs and asks for help will NOT be charged. Gloucester Police Chief Leonard Campanello on Facebook\n\nIn an update posted on Dec. 11, the chief wrote that 310 people had been placed in treatment \u2014 with 85 centers participating. Forty-five police agencies in more than 10 states are now helping addicts to find treatment and another 85 others are expected to develop programs based on Gloucester's.\n\nPolicing Heroin and Opiates by Treating Addiction Policing heroin and opiates by treating addiction \"like a disease, not a crime.\" GUEST: John Rosenthal, co-founder of the Angel Project. (Published Tuesday, Nov. 3, 2015)\n\n\u201cWe treat all with this DISEASE as a valued member of our community and work to support their families with dignity and respect,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDO NOT BE ASHAMED OF YOUR ILLNESS. DO NOT HIDE IT.\u201d\n\nRemember, a dollar that we spend on an opioid program can\u2019t be spent on the developmentally disabled. So we have to choose.New Hampshire state Rep. Neal Kurk, R-Weare\n\nNew Hampshire, which hopes to put similar programs in place, spends less than any other state in New England on alcohol and drug services, $8.81 per person in state and federal funds compared to $14.32 in Rhode Island, the next lowest spender, or $48.35 in Connecticut at the high end, according to figures from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The average for New England is $25.70.\n\nGetting Help in the 'Live Free or Die' State\n\nAdding to its challenge are the people newly eligible for treatment under the New Hampshire Health Protection Program, the state\u2019s expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare, but for whom the states does not have enough programs or professionals. Between the beginning of September and the end of March, 1,800 people sought drug and alcohol treatment under the expansion, which must be reauthorized next year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building infrastructure in the middle of a crisis,\u201d said Melissa Silvey, the director for continuum of care for One Voice for Strafford County, a recovery coalition.\n\nFront Lines of Addiction Crisis Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, the president and CEO of the Dimock Center, gives a front-line perspective on the crisis of opioid addiction and deaths. (Published Friday, Oct. 16, 2015)\n\nNew Hampshire has 1,200 beds in residential treatment programs, Silvey said. The waiting period is six to eight weeks and for some of the programs, addicts must call in three times a day. If they fail to, they are bumped to the end of the waiting list, a policy that discourages Silvey.\n\nThe waiting lists at our local state-funded rehabs are three to four weeks. People just die.Dean LeMire, a substance misuse prevention coordinator\n\n\u201cJust picture it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re an addict. You\u2019re not quite thinking about, \u2018Call that treatment facility.\u2019 You\u2019re dope sick.\u201d\n\nLeMire said he tried to stop drinking after college and when he no longer had access to opiates he turned to heroin instead.\n\nFighting Opioid Epidemic With Rehab While the abuse of opioids has reached a crisis level in Massachusetts, with more than 1,000 deaths last year, most addiction care is still in the hands of the criminal justice system instead of doctors.

She helped him find a bed in a program run by Southeastern New Hampshire Alcohol & Drug Abuse Services.\n\n\u201cOn June 2, I got in my last drunken car accident,\" he said in an email. \"June 5 I took my last drink while withdrawing from opiates and June 6, I entered rehab.\"\n\nPolice, Lawmakers Fight Opioid Crisis in N.H. The heroin epidemic is getting worse in Manchester, New Hampshire, where in September alone, 100 people overdosed and nine people died. (Published Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015)\n\nRaiding New Hampshire's Treatment Fund\n\n\n\nNew Hampshire could have more money available to fund substance abuse treatment and prevention. Fifteen years ago, it created an Alcohol Abuse Prevention and Treatment Fund, which was supposed to get 5 percent of the New Hampshire Liquor Commission\u2019s yearly gross profit, but which has been fully financed only once.\n\nThe Alcohol Fund will receive $6.656 million for the next two years, far short of the $19 million it would have gotten if fully funded. Legislators decided to set the amount awarded at 1.7 percent instead of 5 percent.\n\n</p>\n\nHad New Hampshire spent more money on prevention and treatment it might have avoided the severity of the epidemic, said Linda Paquette of New Futures, a non-profit group in Concord that works to prevent drug and alcohol problems.\n\nIn 2012, her organization issued a report, \"We Need Treatment,\" that noted that 14 residential facilities had closed over the previous decade because they were not receiving adequate reimbursements for care they provided. They were not replaced, she said.\n\nCVS Offers Heroin Overdose Antidote Over the Counter CVS Pharmacies will now offer the overdose antidote Naloxone over the counter without a prescription. The drug reverses the symptoms of a heroin or a prescription painkiller overdose. (Published Friday, Oct. 9, 2015)\n\n\"So over the years, resources for our alcohol and drug services system have been strangled essentially,\" she said.\n\nThe epidemic is cutting a wide path of destruction. Three hundred and twenty-five people died in New Hampshire last year. That is more deaths from drugs than traffic accidents, a statistic true in 36 states and Washington D.C., according to \u201cThe Facts Hurt: A State-By-State Injury Prevention Policy Report,\u201d a survey by the Trust for America\u2019s Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nHeroin use has risen across the board \u2014 among men and women, most age groups and all income levels, the CDC reported. Some of the greatest increases have been among those with historically low rates of use, women and people with higher incomes.\n\nOne cause of the epidemic: abuse of prescription opioid painkillers. Forty-five percent of people who use heroin are also addicted to painkillers, according to the CDC. Heroin laced with the synthetic painkiller fentanyl is worsening the problem.\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan created a task force last month to study an array of issues around the epidemic, including insurance coverage for treatment, drug courts, prescription drug monitoring and improving law enforcement. The task force this week recommended speeding up the review of some changes including removing prior authorization for first visits for drug treatment and aligning penalties for distributing and manufacturing fentanyl with those for heroin.\n\nBalancing Budget Demands\n\n\n\nThe chairman of the state House of Representatives Finance Committee, Republican Rep. Neal Kurk, wants New Hampshire to better evaluate the programs that it is being asked to fund \u2014 both in terms of how well they work and how cost effective they are. Five percent of alcohol sales was an arbitrary figure, he said.\n\nNew Hampshire, like other states, does not have unlimited funds, he said.\n\nSo over the years, resources for our alcohol and drug services system have been strangled essentially.Linda Paquette of New Futures, a non-profit group in Concord\n\n\u201cRemember, a dollar that we spend on an opioid program can\u2019t be spent on the developmentally disabled,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we have to choose.\u201d\n\nTreatment advocates will continue to fight for a full 5 percent of alcohol sales, said Timothy Rourke, chairman of Gov. Maggie Hassan\u2019s Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment and Recovery, which dispenses the funds.\n\nFinding Alternatives to Putting Addicts in Jail Barnstable County Sheriff James Cummings joined necn to discuss the Massachusetts heroin epidemic and finding alternatives to putting drug offenders behind bars. (Published Tuesday, Aug. 4, 2015)\n\n\u201cThe general public thinks we have an opiate epidemic and while that is true, it is the tip of an iceberg,\u201d Rourke said. \u201cNew Hampshire has had some of the highest rates of substance abuse of any state in the United States since at least the late '90s if not longer.\u201d\n\nLeMire, now a substance misuse prevention coordinator for One Voice for Strafford County, recently traveled to Scarborough, Maine, with members of the Dover, New Hampshire, police department, to study a program that began there in September. Modeled on the one in Gloucester, it pairs the police department and a recovery center, with volunteers walking addicts through the steps of getting help.\n\n\"The waiting lists at our local state-funded rehabs are three to four weeks,\" he said. \"People just die. They don't get into treatment.\"\n\nNew Hampshire, like other states, is facing what were once big city problems in its small towns and needs the services that cities have implemented: needle exchanges, access to naloxone and teams to reach out to people who are battling homelessness, substance abuse problems, and mental illness, he said.\n\n\"All the energy, passion and expertise, it's right there,\" he said. \"It's really obvious to us, at least to me, that we can't wait for the state to act on this. So we don't.\"\n\nLeMire said that his recovery from heroin addiction was possible because of the love and guidance from others who had dealt with their own drug addiction.\n\n\"So I feel like the same principals apply to a community that needs to recover from an opiate epidemic or from addiction on whole, which is it takes a lot of us, setting aside of old ideas that don't work and welcoming of new ideas, and especially from people who have done this thing before,\" he said.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the presidential candidates criss-cross New Hampshire wooing voters for the country\u2019s first primary in February, the state\u2019s struggle to confront its opioid epidemic is in the national spotlight \u2014 its...", "title": "Presidential Candidates Talk Heroin, But New Hampshire Lags Neighbors in Battling Drug Scourge", "og": {"site_name": "NECN", "description": "As the presidential candidates criss-cross New Hampshire wooing voters for the country\u2019s first primary in February, the state\u2019s struggle to confront its opioid epidemic is in the national spotlight \u2014 its...", "title": "Candidates Talk Heroin Scourge, But NH Effort Lags Neighbors", "url": "http://www.necn.com/news/new-england/Heroin-Overdoses-Soar-New-Hampshire-Drugs-362406441.html", "image": "http://media.necn.com/images/1200*675/drug-abuse-treatment-kit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the presidential candidates criss-cross New Hampshire wooing voters for the country\u2019s first primary in February, the state\u2019s struggle to confront its opioid epidemic is in the national spotlight \u2014 its...", "title": "Candidates Talk Heroin Scourge, But NH Effort Lags Neighbors", "url": "http://www.necn.com/news/new-england/Heroin-Overdoses-Soar-New-Hampshire-Drugs-362406441.html", "image": "http://media.necn.com/images/1200*675/drug-abuse-treatment-kit.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@NECN", "site": "@NECN", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 424638114340719}, "keywords": "Opioid Epidemic", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/necntv"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Opioid Epidemic"}, "article_summary": "She helped him find a bed in a program run by Southeastern New Hampshire Alcohol & Drug Abuse Services.\nLeMire said that his recovery from heroin addiction was possible because of the love and guidance from others who had dealt with their own drug addiction.\nJeb Bush talked about his daughter\u2019s struggle with drug addiction, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina about the death of her step-daughter from a drug overdose.\nU.S. Rep.
