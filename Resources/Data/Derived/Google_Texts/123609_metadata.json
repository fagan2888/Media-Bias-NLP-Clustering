We need more white cops who are anti-Zog and willing to put Jewish controlled black thugs in their place. Most cops are cowards and do nothing while 90% of interracial crime is black (and non-white) on white.\u201d\n\nIn a Tuesday editorial about the case headlined \u201cThe Death of Michael Brown: Racial History Behind the Ferguson Protests,\u201d The New York Times expressed hope that the FBI will be able \u201cto answer the many questions surrounding the death\u201d of the teenager\u201d while focusing on St. Louis\u2019 history of racial problems.\n\n\u201c[I]t doesn\u2019t take a federal investigation to understand the history of racial segregation, economic inequality and overbearing law enforcement that produced so much of the tension now evident on the streets,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cSt. Louis has long been one of the nation\u2019s most segregated metropolitan areas, and there remains a high wall between black residents \u2013 who overwhelmingly have lower incomes \u2013 and the white power structure that dominates City Councils and police departments like the ones in Ferguson.\u201d\n\nBrown \u2013\u2013 dressed in shorts and flip flops \u2013\u2013 was reportedly shot multiple times in broad daylight after he and a friend were confronted by the officer for walking in the middle of the street in Ferguson, a predominately African American suburb of St. Louis. Police officials say Brown assaulted the officer and tried to wrestle away his gun before fleeing and being shot. At least one shot was fired in the police cruiser during the struggle, police say.\n\nBrown\u2019s friend, Dorian Johnson, 22, told a radically different version of events. He told reporters that he and Brown were close to their destination when confronted by the officer, who angrily told them to get out of the street. Suddenly, the friend said, the officer grabbed Brown by the neck and tried to pull him into the police car. Brown broke free and both young men began running away when Brown was struck by a bullet. He turned and raised his hands in surrender only to be shot several more times, dying where he fell.\n\nBrown\u2019s body lay in the street for several hours as police gathered evidence and the neighborhood\u2019s shock turned to rage. Three days of protests, some of it violent, followed. A gas station/convenience store was burned. There was some looting. Police in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a crowd of mostly angry African Americans. But there were whites marching in some of the protests as well, holding up their hands in surrender as Brown had reportedly done, chanting, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Desperate for publicity and any opportunity to spread hate, the KKK said more white cops should follow suit", "title": "\u201cHe is a hero\u201d: Why the KKK is raising money for Ferguson police officer who shot Michael Brown", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Desperate for publicity and any opportunity to spread hate, the KKK said more white cops should follow suit", "title": "\u201cHe is a hero\u201d: Why the KKK is raising money for Ferguson police officer who shot Michael Brown", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/16/he_is_a_hero_why_the_kkk_is_raising_money_for_ferguson_police_officer_who_shot_michael_brown/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/10/the_week_in_pictures_41-slide-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Desperate for publicity and any opportunity to spread hate, the KKK said more white cops should follow suit", "title": "\u201cHe is a hero\u201d: Why the KKK is raising money for Ferguson police officer who shot Michael Brown", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/10/the_week_in_pictures_41-slide-1.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Don Terry", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ferguson, KKK, Ku Klux Klan, michael brown, Mike Brown, Police brutality, Southern Poverty Law Center", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe294f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are setting up a reward/fund for the police officer who shot this thug,\u201d the Klan group said in an email.\nPolice officials say Brown assaulted the officer and tried to wrestle away his gun before fleeing and being shot.\nSuddenly, the friend said, the officer grabbed Brown by the neck and tried to pull him into the police car.\nTopics: Ferguson, KKK, Ku Klux Klan, michael brown, Mike Brown, Police brutality, Southern Poverty Law Center, NewsThis article was originally published by The Southern Poverty Law CenterThe one thing the racially charged and besieged city of Ferguson, Mo.\nThe South Carolina-based New Empire Knights of the Ku Klux Klan says its Missouri chapter is raising money for the still unidentified white police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, 18, who was scheduled to begin college classes this week."}
