Broncos coach John Fox left the playing status of receiver Wes Welker for Sunday’s game in Seattle to one word Friday as his team completed its final practice for the Super Bowl rematch.

“Probable,” Fox answered when asked about Welker’s status.

Welker rejoined the team this week after missing the first two games of the regular season sitting out a four-game suspension for violating provisions of the NFL’s anti-drug policy. His suspension was reduced this week when the league and players’ union reached a new agreement on a drug policy.

Fox didn’t say anything about what role Welker might have.

Otherwise Fox listed linebacker Lerentee McCray, injured this past Sunday, as out for the game. Linebacker Danny Trevathan was listed as limited, but will travel and be a game-time decision.

“I know Danny was excited to be out there and we’ll make a decision come game time,” Fox said.
