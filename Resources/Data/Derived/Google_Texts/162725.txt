Austin (KXAN)- The Austin Apartment Association has been granted an injunction by the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stopping the City of Austin from enforcing a Source of Income ordinance.

We covered the lawsuit brought by the AAA back in December. The city unanimously passed the ordinance that would end housing discrimination across the city in April 2014.

In its petition, the AAA stated that the ordinance passed by the city council last year “contravenes both state and federal law and should be declared invalid and unenforceable.”

The group said they’re not opposed to government assistance but that the 400 pages of voucher rules is a big mess.

“The program is historically troubled, bureaucratic and underfunded,” said AAA President Robbie Robinson. “Every property owner wants good residents; what we don’t want is a forced partnership with a governmental agency that significantly impacts businesses and operations.”

It’s unknown what steps the city will take to change the ordinance.
