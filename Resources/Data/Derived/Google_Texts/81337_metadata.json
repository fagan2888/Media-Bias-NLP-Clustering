Mr. Finkel wrote in a blog post that the tablet turned out to be \u201cone in a million.\u201d\n\nThe tablet describes an ark very similar to Noah\u2019s ark, and would carry two of each animal, the instructions specify a circular vessel, not the traditional rectangular ark.\n\n\u201cIt was really a heart-stopping moment\u2014the discovery that the boat was to be a round boat,\u201d Mr. Finkel told Fox News. \u201cThat was a real surprise.\u201d\n\nHe added that a circular boat would be a \u201cperfect thing,\u201d because it never sinks and is light to carry.\n\nHowever, Mr. Finkel said that the tablet does not provide evidence supporting the Biblical story of Noah\u2019s ark and theorized that the story was likely passed down from Babylon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the story of the flood and a boat to rescue life is a Babylonian invention,\u201d he told Fox News.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the ark existed\u2014but a lot of people do. It doesn\u2019t really matter. The Biblical version is a thing of itself and it has a vitality forever.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An ancient tablet has been recently deciphered and purportedly lists instructions for building an ark to endure a great flood.", "Author": "Kellan Howell", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "An ancient tablet has been recently deciphered and purportedly lists instructions for building an ark to endure a great flood.", "title": "Ancient tablet with ark instructions predates Biblical story of Noah", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/25/ancient-tablet-ark-instructions-predates-biblical-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/24/213254f56449d603490f6a706700cf64.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/24/213254f56449d603490f6a706700cf64.jpg", "title": "Ancient tablet with ark instructions predates Biblical story of Noah", "description": "An ancient tablet has been recently deciphered and purportedly lists instructions for building an ark to endure a great flood.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Irving Finkel"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfdca\"", "article_summary": "An ancient tablet has been recently deciphered and purportedly lists instructions for building an ark to endure a great flood.\n\u201cIt was really a heart-stopping moment\u2014the discovery that the boat was to be a round boat,\u201d Mr. Finkel told Fox News.\nThe Mesopotamian tablet was determined to be 4,000 years old, pre-dating the Biblical story of Noah, The Blaze reported.\nHowever, Mr. Finkel said that the tablet does not provide evidence supporting the Biblical story of Noah\u2019s ark and theorized that the story was likely passed down from Babylon.\nMr. Finkel wrote in a blog post that the tablet turned out to be \u201cone in a million.\u201dThe tablet describes an ark very similar to Noah\u2019s ark, and would carry two of each animal, the instructions specify a circular vessel, not the traditional rectangular ark."}
