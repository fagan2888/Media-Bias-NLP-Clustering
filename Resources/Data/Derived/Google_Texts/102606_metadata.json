It scares away the clients,\u201d he told me, establishing the terms of our relationship.\n\n\u201cBut I am your client. And I\u2019m the one who brought it up,\u201d I pointed out, trying to renegotiate our contract. Sam Jr. frowned in the mirror as he circumnavigated my chair and fastened the barber\u2019s cloth under my chin. \u201cSo what happens when a client wants to talk politics and asks for your thoughts?\u201d I pressed.\n\n\u201cI tell \u2019em it\u2019s none of their business,\u201d he sniffed.\n\nI would have to try a gentler approach.\n\nI came to South Carolina to find out just how serious a problem Bernie Sanders has with African-American voters, especially younger ones. Apparently I was having some issues of my own. It wasn\u2019t an entirely unexpected reaction to a nettlesome, whey-faced stranger nosing into decent folks\u2019 political views.\n\nMost of South Carolina\u2019s Democratic electorate was African-American in 2008, the last time the Democratic primary here was contested. Next Saturday\u2019s primary is expected to be the Democratic candidates\u2019 first test in a state where a majority of the voters are a different color than they are. That could be big trouble for Bernie, who\u2019s polling way behind Hillary among black voters.\n\nBernie has started to collect some African-American endorsements, but it\u2019s most likely not enough to tip the scales in South Carolina, where Hillary recently had a 60-percentage-point lead among black voters. Bernie\u2019s best scenario would probably be to narrow the gap enough to make a respectable loss look like a win. On the other hand, if Hillary does put the smack down, it could be cause for serious pause among black voters in other states who are still considering Bernie\u2019s viability.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s African-American voters could give Bernie a major bounce heading into Super Tuesday, or they could apply the aloe that soothes the Bern.\n\nWith all those exciting possibilities to consider, I went to South Carolina last week in hopes of finding some answers and getting a stylish haircut. But first I had to persuade Sam Jr. to talk to me.\n\nThe barbershop decor at Sam\u2019s Uni-Sex, which specializes in \u201cafros & afro blowouts, perms, braiding, fades and curls,\u201d belied Sam Jr.\u2019s reluctance to discuss politics. Posters of President Obama, Martin Luther King, Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali and other African-American greats gazed proudly over the barbershop from all four walls. A TV in the corner blared an Obama press conference, and muffled conversations overheard from nearby barbers\u2019 chairs were unmistakably political.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re the only guy in the shop who doesn\u2019t talk politics?\u201d I asked Sam Jr.\n\n\u201cI just listen,\u201d he said, avoiding my narrowed eyes in the mirror.\n\nThen a brief smile twitched the corners of his mouth and betrayed his reticence. I was making progress.\n\nSouth Carolinians are slightly more guarded about politics than those chatty folks in Iowa and New Hampshire, who seem to take a garrulous delight in their outsized roles in picking presidential candidates every quadrennial snowfall.\n\nIn Myrtle Beach, there are few indications that voters are about to participate in what could be the most important primary so far this year.\n\nWith the exception of a few Trump signs littering the roadside, most of the political propaganda here seems to be limited to the confines of cable TV, which is incessantly aglow with hate-filled, fear-mongering political ads about how John Kasich is a closet Democrat, or how Marco Rubio is part of an international conspiracy to establish a caliphate in Charleston. The ads are always paid for by groups with ominous-sounding names like New America Rising, Americans for an American America, or Responsible Lobotomy Patients for Ben Carson.\n\nBernie doesn\u2019t have a big TV presence in South Carolina, but he\u2019s crushing it on social media. And that\u2019s allowing him get up close and personal with young black voters who otherwise don\u2019t run in the same circles as the loud man from the northern woods.\n\nOlder African-Americans I talked to seem to think Bernie is still too much an unknown\u2014a mysterious ideologue they\u2019ve never seen in the flesh. But younger people don\u2019t seem to be as mystified. After all, Bernie\u2019s all over their phones and social feeds.\n\n\u201cHillary has got the bigger name, but I\u2019m hearing a lot of Bernie among my peers on social media. That\u2019s who I\u2019m seeing pop up in my news feed. I hear more about him than Hillary,\u201d said DeAndrae Preston, a 21-year-old music student at Coastal Carolina University. \u201cI hear about Hillary from older people, but young people are feeling the Bern.\u201d\n\nCuriously, most of the African-American college students I talked to seemed to identify with the 25% of young black people who said in a recent NBC News poll that they\u2019re voting for Bernie. The 64% who said they were voting for Hillary were harder to find.\n\nThe top reasons that young people I talked to cited for supporting Bernie are college tuition, legalization of marijuana, jobs and civil rights\u2014and not necessarily in that order.\n\nRelated Why Trayvon Martin's family attorney is endorsing Bernie Sanders\n\n\u201cNo one should go to jail for a nonviolent crime,\u201d said 19-year-old sophomore Chantin Tolliver, who cited legalization of weed as his top reason for backing Bernie. \u201cMy mom is voting for Hillary and my dad is voting for Ben Carson, but I\u2019m voting for Bernie. Bernie has our vote\u2014the younger generation.\u201d\n\nJohn Thompson, a biochemistry major who also lists decriminalization of marijuana and college tuition as his top priorities, says he, too, is voting for Bernie because \u201cBernie is pushing harder.\u201d\n\nI did find one African-American student who said she\u2019s planning to vote for Hillary, but even she added, a touch noncommittally, \u201cI could be swayed.\u201d Shannen Holliday, a 24-year-old grad student, says she\u2019s always liked Hillary\u2019s \u201caggressive stance on civil rights, education and student debt,\u201d but recently found out her 21-year-old sister is voting for Bernie, and is now intrigued to learn more about his campaign.\n\nBack at the barbershop, Sam Jr., who\u2019s 32, says he \u201cused to roll with Bernie\u201d after first learning about him on the hip-hop website World Star. But he\u2019s since decided to back Hillary instead because he thinks Bernie\u2019s ideas are \u201ctoo far-fetched\u201d to get past \u201cthe old heads in Congress.\u201d\n\nSam says his biggest campaign issue is access to affordable health care. He\u2019s one of the millions of Americans who\u2019ve recently started benefiting from Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, and he doesn\u2019t want that taken away by Republicans or tinkered with by an overly zealous social democrat. Sam thinks Hillary will be a steady hand on the tiller to hold the course set by Obama.\n\nThe idea of building slowly and steadily on the accomplishments of the Obama administration, rather than tacking left, is something I heard more from older African-American voters. While Sanders\u2019 ideology and passion attracts younger voters, Hillary\u2019s experience and hard work for the Obama administration seems to be appreciated by folks over 40.\n\n\u201cHillary is vetted. She\u2019s the status quo candidate,\u201d says Rev. Joe Washington, who leads a non-denominational church in Myrtle Beach.\n\nWashington says younger black voters in his church like Bernie because they think of him as \u201cunbought and unsold.\u201d But many older black voters feel they owe Hillary a debt of gratitude for supporting Obama\u2019s nomination eight years ago, and then working for his administration afterward.\n\nEqually important, Washington says, is that a Hillary presidency would be a \u201ctwofer\u201d that includes Bill Clinton\u2014a man Toni Morrison famously called \u201cthe first black president.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I think about her, I think about him,\u201d Washington said.\n\nOthers, however, think Hillary is plenty tough and qualified to do the job on her own.\n\n\u201cHillary knows how to work the old boy network in Washington, and Bernie is a babe in the woods,\u201d said Cheryl Bell, a Myrtle Beach realtor who works for a local low-income literacy tutoring program called The Freedom Readers. Bell says she understands why some younger black voters like Bernie\u2019s idealism, but for older African-American voters like herself, Hillary\u2019s experience, toughness and pragmatism are what really counts. \u201cWe\u2019re all starting from different places,\u201d she says of the perceived generational split among black voters.\n\nBut on election day, the voters who vote count more than the voters who don\u2019t. And it remains to be seen whether Bernie\u2019s social media appeal among young black voters will translate into actual ballots in South Carolina. Or whether he can pull undecideds to his side before Saturday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not into politics much,\u201d says 18-year-old high school senior and potential first-time voter Essence Smith. \u201cI\u2019m not for Clinton and I haven\u2019t felt the Bern yet. I\u2019m waiting for my turn, when I can develop my own opinions about the candidates.\u201d\n\nThe clock is ticking for Essence. But for others, the clock has already stopped.\n\nSadly, there are many black people whose votes will never count. Though both Bernie and Hillary have denounced the systemic racism behind the United States\u2019 culture of mass incarceration, the people nodding the most vigorously at that message still can\u2019t vote for either of them.\n\nBack in the barber\u2019s chair, I ask Sam Jr. if he talks about politics with his buddies outside of work, when he\u2019s not holding clippers to someone\u2019s head. He tells me it\u2019s a moot point with most of his friends.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to vote. They don\u2019t qualify because of past felonies. They\u2019re not involved in the political process.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "Saturday\u2019s primary is expected to be the Democratic candidates' first test in a state where a majority of the voters are a different color than they are.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "Saturday\u2019s primary is expected to be the Democratic candidates' first test in a state where a majority of the voters are a different color than they are.", "title": "Can Sanders Narrow the Gap With Black Voters in South Carolina?", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/271265/south-carolina-primary-black-voters/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i0.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cover-bernie-black-voters.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Saturday\u2019s primary is expected to be the Democratic candidates' first test in a state where a majority of the voters are a different color than they are.", "title": "Can Sanders narrow the gap with black voters in South Carolina?", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/271265/south-carolina-primary-black-voters/", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cover-bernie-black-voters.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/tim.rogers.79"}, "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders South Carolina, Bernie Sanders black voters, African American vote in South Carolina, Hillary Clinton South Carolina, south carolina primary, when is the south carolina primary"}, "article_summary": "I came to South Carolina to find out just how serious a problem Bernie Sanders has with African-American voters, especially younger ones.\nAnd it remains to be seen whether Bernie\u2019s social media appeal among young black voters will translate into actual ballots in South Carolina.\nBell says she understands why some younger black voters like Bernie\u2019s idealism, but for older African-American voters like herself, Hillary\u2019s experience, toughness and pragmatism are what really counts.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all starting from different places,\u201d she says of the perceived generational split among black voters.\nThat could be big trouble for Bernie, who\u2019s polling way behind Hillary among black voters."}
