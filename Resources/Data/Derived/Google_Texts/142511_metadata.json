The changes you make now will take effect Jan. 1.\n\nEven if you are happy with the plan you have, it\u2019s important to review your options.\n\nPlans change every year and so does your health. You want to make sure the plan you choose for 2015 matches your needs and your pocketbook.\n\nGetting focused during open enrollment is a good thing to do every year, but it\u2019s especially important now.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has brought changes to Medicare, including big funding cuts to Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nAs a result, you might see higher premiums or changes in your plan\u2019s network.\n\nThere are positives, too.\n\nSenior citizens should take a close look to see if their coverage meets their current needs and make a switch if it doesn\u2019t. (Monkey Business Images Ltd/Getty Images)\n\nAs a result of the new health law, Medicare is providing financial incentives to Medicare Advantage plans that meet certain quality standards.\n\nThat means you might see some plans offering added wellness benefits, such as gym memberships.\n\n\u201cHealth reform has brought notable changes to Medicare, from more preventive care benefits to changes in costs,\u201d said Jennifer Cohen-Smith, regional vice president of UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement in New York.\n\n\u201cBeneficiaries need to understand both the upside and the downside of those changes to best evaluate their options.\u201d\n\nThe Daily News is here to help.\n\nThis second guide to Medicare (the first can be found by clicking here) will update you on Medicare news, provide a guide to choosing a Medigap plan, and tell you what to do if your Medicare claim is denied.\n\nWe\u2019ll also point you to helpful resources.\n\nBy now, you should have received your Annual Notice of Change from your insurance provider.\n\nIt will tell you about any changes in your plan, such as increases in premiums and deductibles.\n\nPlans \u201cmay have changed their (drug) formularies, or changed their network of providers,\u201d said Jocelyne Watrous of the Center for Medicare Advocacy.\n\nYou can compare plans by checking out the Medicare Plan Finder at Medicare.gov/find-a-plan.\n\nPlug in information about yourself, such as where you live and what drugs you are taking.\n\nThe plan finder will give you your options, the estimated costs and the plans\u2019 ratings.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t just assume if the plan was good for you this year, it will work for you next year,\u201d Watrous said.\n\n\u201cThis is your opportunity to evaluate the coverage you currently have and change it if it no longer meets your needs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "PHYLLIS FURMAN", "twitter": {"description": "William David Binn, 84,
