It's an incredible coup to lock up NorthShore. It's a great market and it's a great system,\" said Jordan Shields, a vice president at Juniper Advisory, a Chicago-based investment bank that provides merger and acquisition services to hospital systems.\n\nThe deal, Shields said, \"is going to shake people. What this does is change the gravity in the metropolitan area.\"\n\nCombined, the new health system will serve an estimated 3 million patients a year at more than 350 facilities including hospitals, clinics, doctors' offices and outpatient centers.\n\nBoth health systems' boards voted unanimously this week to approve the deal, which also will unite two of the region's largest medical groups, giving Advocate NorthShore more than 2,000 employed physicians.\n\nThe deal still requires approval from the United Church of Christ, which is affiliated with Advocate; the Federal Trade Commission; and state regulators.\n\nUnder terms of the merger, both health systems will contribute six members of a 12-member board of directors. Jim Skogsbergh, president and chief executive officer of Advocate, and NorthShore CEO Mark Neaman will be co-CEOs of the combined enterprise.\n\nThe agreement calls for Neaman to step aside after two years, leaving Skogsbergh as the lone chief executive. The new organization's 11-person executive team will include leaders from both systems.\n\n\"These are two great organizations coming together, and we intend to see it continue to grow and be successful in the future,\" Skogsbergh said. \"For patients, it means better health outcomes, a safer hospital environment, lower costs and improved access.\"\n\nThis is a huge win for Advocate. It's an incredible coup to lock up NorthShore. \u2014 Jordan Shields, a vice president at Juniper Advisory\n\nThe decision by Advocate, which booked just under $5 billion in revenue in its most-recent fiscal year, and NorthShore, which reported $1.8 billion in revenue, to combine represents a continuation of the consolidation of the Chicago hospital market and reflects growing pressure on hospitals' finances that has nudged longtime competitors to pair up.\n\nEven after the deal is completed, the new system will control less than 25 percent of the local health care market, which remains fragmented compared with other metro areas, despite a spate of mergers in recent years. Skogsbergh said the two systems anticipate the FTC will review the proposed transaction but are confident the deal will be approved.\n\nA merger of this magnitude, however, is a major shake-up in the Chicago market that will force competing hospital systems and insurance companies to re-evaluate their businesses.\n\n\"This will probably trigger another set of consolidations; it's bound to occur,\" said Michael Sachs, chairman of Sg2, a Skokie-based health care consulting firm.\n\nThe deal represents a consolidation of market power for Advocate, particularly in the northern suburbs, which have a prized demographic of well-paying customers.\n\nIt also will allow the health system to broaden its geographic coverage, a key component in creating larger, more integrated networks of hospitals and physicians that executives believe will help lower costs and improve patient care.\n\nThe merger also will enhance Advocate's buying power with suppliers and market clout with insurers at a time when hospital patient volumes are declining and payments from government and commercial insurance are under pressure.\n\nSkogsbergh said the enhanced geographic spread that the NorthShore merger offers was a prime consideration in Advocate's decision to pursue the combination because it would position Advocate as a more attractive network for insurance companies and employers.\n\nNorthShore, with its historically strong balance sheet and four acute-care hospitals in Evanston, Skokie, Glenview and Highland Park, was among the most-coveted systems in Chicagoland.\n\nThe mostly wealthy North Shore suburbs it serves are lucrative for health care providers because they boast large concentrations of patients with commercial health insurance coverage, which tends to pay better than government programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nFurther, it is widely recognized as a well-run, efficient enterprise. Those factors made it an appealing partner for Advocate.\n\nSkogsbergh acknowledged the potential for layoffs because of \"a fair amount of redundancy across the two organizations.\"\n\n\"As we eliminate and reduce that redundancy, we'll reduce costs,\" he said. \"Both organizations are aggressively managing costs today. If we reduce our workforce, it will be (primarily) through normal attrition and turnover.\"\n\nBoth systems intend to maintain their teaching relationships: NorthShore's with the University of Chicago and Advocate's with the University of Illinois, Midwestern University and Rosalind Franklin University. NorthShore also intends to maintain its clinical relationship with Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic. Advocate has a similar arrangement with Houston-based MD Anderson Cancer Center that will not be renewed.\n\nNorthShore has been locked in fierce competition with Northwestern Medicine, which completed a merger Sept. 1 with Cadence Health, a two-hospital system in the western suburbs.\n\nNorthwestern, which recently announced plans to overhaul its Lake Forest Hospital, continues to push deeper into the northern suburbs. It has opened a series of health clinics between its flagship hospital, in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood, and the northern suburbs in an attempt to broaden its reach and serve patients closer to where they live.\n\nNorthwestern declined to comment.\n\nNeaman and Skogsbergh had been talking about a potential partnership for several years, but it wasn't until Neaman brought the issue to the table a few months ago that the talks gained traction.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Advocate Health Care and NorthShore to merge", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Two of Chicago's largest hospital systems on Thursday approved plans to combine, creating a 16-hospital, $6.8 billion system that promises to change the competitive landscape of health care in the Chicago region.", "title": "Advocate Health Care and NorthShore to merge", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-advocate-north-shore-0912-biz-20140912-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-541280c7/turbine/ct-advocate-north-shore-0912-biz-20140912", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp01.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Advocate Health Care, NorthShore University HealthSystem, mergers, hospitals", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/81344031", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-09-12", "Description": "Two of Chicago's largest hospital systems on Thursday approved plans to combine, creating a 16-hospital, $6.8 billion health system.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Advocate Health Care, NorthShore University HealthSystem, mergers, hospitals"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf06\"", "article_summary": "Advocate Health Care, the state's largest hospital system, and NorthShore University HealthSystem, the dominant hospital chain in the North Shore suburbs, said Thursday they will merge to create Advocate NorthShore Health Partners in a deal that's expected to close in early 2015.\n\"This will probably trigger another set of consolidations; it's bound to occur,\" said Michael Sachs, chairman of Sg2, a Skokie-based health care consulting firm.\nUnder terms of the merger, both health systems will contribute six members of a 12-member board of directors.\nBoth health systems' boards voted unanimously this week to approve the deal, which also will unite two of the region's largest medical groups, giving Advocate NorthShore more than 2,000 employed physicians.\nCombined, the new health system will serve an estimated 3 million patients a year at more than 350 facilities including hospitals, clinics, doctors' offices and outpatient centers."}
