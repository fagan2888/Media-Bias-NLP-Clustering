And 22 of the 24 GOP Senate seats up for election next year are in those states.\n\nObama\u2019s law offers subsidized private insurance to people not covered on the job.\n\nIn the court case, opponents of the law argue that its literal wording allows subsidies only in states that set up their own health insurance markets.
