Brandon, SD

When doctors diagnosed Brandon first-grader Ashley Johnson with leukemia last month, friends and family were quick to show their support.

We told you on Valentine's day about the prom dress sale they organized to help pay Ashley's medical bills.

And Saturday, dozens of supporters hit the floor at the Brandon Country Club for a Zumbathon. That's right: a Zumba marathon.

Suggested admission was $10, with all proceeds going to the Johnson family.

"One of the reasons we're trying to push this is not just to help Ashley, but to help other people bring awareness to childhood cancer, and, I mean, it's not just leukemia. It's all forms of cancer that we want to bring awareness to," Team Ashley member Jodi Beach says.

If you'd like to help out, Beach says Team Ashley will hold its next fundraiser April 11 at the Safari Bar And Grill in Renner.
