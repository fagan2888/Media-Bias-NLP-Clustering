Have we got a treat for you, “Bachelor” fans!

ProFlowers has partnered with Warner Bros. to bring you a new bouquet that “celebrates the romance and glamour of hit ABC series ‘The Bachelor.'” Because nothing says glamour like rhinestones the size of a baby’s fist nestled amongst long-stemmed red roses.

The bouquet’s guaranteed freshness means recipients can “enjoy their own red roses for at least seven days” … which is approximately how long “Bachelor” romances last. Hey-o!

ProFlowers and Warner Bros. are also announcing a sweepstakes where one grand prize winner will receive an all-expenses-paid trip for two to Los Angeles for this season’s “After the Final Rose” episode. Details on the Facebook page.

“The Bachelor” airs Monday nights at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.
