So what can employers expect moving forward?\n\nMore on-site FMLA investigations by the feds where firms will be asked to fork over increasingly detailed info regarding their administration processes.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what Helen Applewhaite said at a recent FMLA/ADA compliance conference.\n\nAnd she should know. Applewhaite just became the DOL\u2019s new FMLA Branch Chief. Here\u2019s a rundown of what Applewhaite said employers can expect regarding the agency\u2019s FMLA enforcement agenda.\n\nA big year for FMLA enforcement\n\n1. Prepare for the DOL to come on-site more often. If employers take one thing from Applewhaite\u2019s presentation, it should be this: You need to prepare for a DOL visit. On-site visits by the DOL were virtually unheard of just a few years ago. But now it\u2019s clear we\u2019ve entered into the age of on-site FMLA investigations. And Applewhaite\u2019s prediction that 2014 will be a \u201cpivotal\u201d year for FMLA should serve as a warning to employers everywhere that there\u2019s no excuse for being unprepared when the DOL comes knocking.\n\n2. Solid recordkeeping is a must. Applewhaite also said the DOL will be focusing on \u201csystemic FMLA issues.\u201d And FMLA Insights founder Jeff Nowak believes the DOL\u2019s investigations will likely mirror the EEOC model moving forward. Translation: The feds will be asking for a slew of info beyond anything complained about in a single charge. Applewhaite herself said a standard request from the DOL will be for information over a two-year period.\n\n3. Managers and employees will be involved. The DOL wants to know that both front-line supervisors and individuals in the leave process are clear on your FMLA policy \u2014 and that the policy gibes with the actual law. Managers will actually be expected to walk an agency investigator through an employee\u2019s leave request, which makes supervisor training that much more important.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "In the past year, we\u2019ve seen the DOL ratchet up its on-site FMLA investigations.
