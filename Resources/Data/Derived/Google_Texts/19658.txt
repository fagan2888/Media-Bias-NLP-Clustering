The Internal Revenue Service has adjusted the Affordable Care Act fee amounts for the 2015-2016 policy plan years, according to JD Supra Business Advisor.

For 2013-2014, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute fees were $2 per insured life; they will be $2.17 per life for the 2015-2016. The transitional reinsurance fee, however, will drop from $44 per covered life in 2015 to $27 per covered life in 2016.

In the past, the Department of Health and Human Services didn't permit contributing entities to make the entire benefit year's reinsurance contribution by Jan. 15; now, entities can either pay for the entire year in one payment no later than Jan. 15 or they can make two separate payments for the benefit year, according to the publication.
