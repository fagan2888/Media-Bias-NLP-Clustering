In that play, he\u2019s a gourmand and bon vivant. Here, he\u2019s a fulsome, self-interested boor whose main ambition is to humiliate a couple of husbands by bedding their wives.\n\nDirector Seth Panitch sets \u201cMerry Wives\u201d in mid-century America, in a rundown Catskills resort. There, Falstaff serves up corny, innuendo-filled jokes, but his eye is on the comely mistresses Ford ( Vanessa Morosco) and Page (Mare Trevathan), and wooing them, temporarily, from their unsuspecting husbands (respectively, anxious Peter Simon Hilton and laid-back Scott Bellot).\n\nWhen wives Ford and Page discover that Falstaff has written them identical love letters seeking their favors, the women come up with a plot to school the lecher. Their husbands find out, initially misinterpreting their plans. As Ford, Peter Simon Hilton is hilariously suspicious, especially in disguise as a beatnik.\n\nComedy ensues, abetted by a subplot involving winsome Anne Page ( Kyra Lindsey) and paramour Fenton (a consciously Ken-doll-ish Joshua Archer). Both of Anne\u2019s parents roundly despise Fenton, preferring disastrously unsuitable bachelors.\n\nSetting \u201cMerry Wives\u201d in the nifty \u201950s is inspired. This Falstaff was made for white shoes and velour smoking jackets, and the women\u2019s clothing, either bouffant skirts and wasp waists or snug suits that might have come from Joan Harris\u2019s \u201cMad Men\u201d closet, have a visual sexiness absent in Elizabethan drag.\n\nWhile director Panitch leaves Shakespeare largely intact, the actors freely riff a bit. Falstaff\u2019s scruffy accomplices Nym and Pistol, normally a pair of actors, are interpreted by Sammie Joe Kinnett as a talentless ventriloquist whose dummy gets most of the good lines.\n\nThere\u2019s a reference to Strunk & White, and in attempting to be seductive, Falstaff pleads, \u201cYou love Lowenbrau, and so do I.\u201d Swords are updated to golf clubs, shuffleboard tangs and tennis racquets, and a choreographed number about cuckolds could have been on the Ed Sullivan show.\n\nThe supporting cast is excellent, with pages dressed in preppy khaki pants or skirts, and Tammy Meneghini\u2018s Mistress Quickly is wonderfully arch.\n\nClaire Martin: 303-954-1477, cmartin@denverpost.com or twitter.com/byclairemartin", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Theater review: Colorado fest\u2019s very \u201cMerry Wives,\u201d set in nifty \u201950s", "title": "Theater review: Colorado fest\u2019s very \u201cMerry Wives,\u201d set in nifty \u201950s", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/24/theater-review-colorado-fests-very-merry-wives-set-in-nifty-50s-2/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140724__AE26THMERRYp1.jpg", "height": 462}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140724__AE26THMERRYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-24T11:57:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:39:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c3d\"", "article_summary": "Setting \u201cMerry Wives\u201d in the nifty \u201950s is inspired.\nDirector Seth Panitch sets \u201cMerry Wives\u201d in mid-century America, in a rundown Catskills resort.\nHere, he\u2019s a fulsome, self-interested boor whose main ambition is to humiliate a couple of husbands by bedding their wives.\nWhen wives Ford and Page discover that Falstaff has written them identical love letters seeking their favors, the women come up with a plot to school the lecher.\nBOULDER \u2014 Poor, hapless buffoon John Falstaff, played to a frustrated fare-thee-well by Michael Winters in the Colorado Shakespeare Festival production of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe Merry Wives of Windsor.\u201d* * * \u00bd comedyThe Falstaff here is a different man than the Falstaff in \u201cHenry IV,\u201d though."}
