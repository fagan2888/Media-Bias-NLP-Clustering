On March 24, and ever since, Republicans have fought tooth and nail to chip away at and dismantle President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement.\n\nThe newest threat to the law, though, is unique. It came this week from one of Obama\u2019s friendliest allies \u2014 the Democratic front-runner to succeed him in the Oval Office.\n\nHillary Clinton, Obama\u2019s former secretary of state, said Tuesday that she favoured repealing the law\u2019s so-called Cadillac tax.\n\n\u201cToo many Americans are struggling to meet the cost of rising deductibles and drug prices. That\u2019s why, among other steps, I encourage Congress to repeal the so-called Cadillac tax, which applies to some employer-based health plans, and to fully pay for the cost of repeal,\u201d Clinton said in a statement.\n\nRepeal of the tax, which isn\u2019t scheduled to be implemented until 2018, doesn\u2019t necessarily represent a threat to the law itself. Coverage expansion, both through federal- and state-based insurance marketplaces and through the federal Medicaid program, can go on without the tax.\n\nBut its repeal would pose a significant problem for one of Obamacare\u2019s main goals: constraining healthcare costs in the US.\n\nClinton\u2019s statement quickly set off a firestorm. In the days that have followed her statement, economists and deficit hawks, who favour the tax, have expressed concern and defended the important role they claim it will play in the overall effectiveness of the law.\n\nThe tax, however, is reviled by just about everyone else \u2014 especially labour unions, which represent a major Democratic constituency. It has crept into the presidential campaign, as both top Democratic contenders are now calling for its repeal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s big,\u201d Larry Levitt, the senior vice president for special initiatives at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told Business Insider of Clinton\u2019s call for repeal. \u201cIt is hard to think of a health care issue that unifies politicians and interest groups more than the \u2018Cadillac\u2019 plan tax.\u201d\n\nDemocrats often argue the tax \u2014 a 40% excise tax on employer plans whose premiums exceed $US10,200 for individuals and $US27,500 for families \u2014 is more in reality a tax on most employer-sponsored health plans.\n\nProponents say that over time, employers will likely manoeuvre around the excise tax by looking for cheaper, more efficient plans with more affordable premiums. But critics say employers are more likely to shift the costs to workers with higher deductibles, co-payments, and other costs. Labour unions, in particular, have taken pride in negotiating premium benefits for their workers \u2014 and some of those resulting plans would likely be affected by the tax.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), Clinton\u2019s main rival in the Democratic presidential primary race, and eight Democratic senators recently introduced legislation to repeal the tax. When introducing the legislation, Sanders dismissed the conventional wisdom that a \u201cCadillac\u201d tax would disproportionately affect more well-off plans.\n\n\u201cSome have said that this tax only falls on \u2018Cadillac\u2019 healthcare plans, but the reality is that the plans this bill will tax are more like Chevrolets,\u201d Sanders quipped.\n\nThey have public opinion on their side \u2014 a recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 60% of Americans said they oppose the tax. (Such vehement opposition changes when respondents heard more about the tax, including that it could help reduce healthcare costs.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch \u2014 an $US87 billion catch. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the tax is expected to bring in $US87 billion in revenue by 2025. Revenue brought in from the tax is expected to grow exponentially in the years that follow.\n\nEconomists and those who have pushed the US to reign in healthcare costs consider it essential to balance out the cost that comes from one of Obamacare\u2019s other major goals: universal health coverage.\n\nOn Thursday, 101 health economists signed a letter to key congressional players defending the controversial tax. The letter included names from the administrations of both Republican and Democratic presidents who hold different views on the law as a whole.\n\nSome of the more notable signers of the letter included Jonathan Gruber, the MIT economist and Obamacare architect who came under fire last year for comments he made about the law leading up to its passage; Douglas Elmendorf, the director of the Congressional Budget Office from 2009 until earlier this year; and Ezekiel Emanuel, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress whose brother, Rahm, was Obama\u2019s chief of staff\n\n\u201cWe, the undersigned health economists and policy analysts, hold widely varying views on other provisions of the Affordable Care Act, and we recognise that measures other than the Cadillac tax could have been used to restrict the open-ended health insurance tax break,\u201d the economists wrote.\n\nJason Miczek U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks to supporters as he campaigns in Greensboro, North Carolina, September 13, 2015.\n\nEmanuel and Bob Kocher, a former special adviser to Obama on healthcare and economic policy, further expanded on their stance in a New York Times op-ed on Friday. They argued that the rich benefit more from the current government subsidy of employer-sponsored health insurance that the tax would fix.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy has created serious problems. For one thing, it is hugely regressive. The rich receive nearly triple the financial benefits from the tax exclusion than those with lower incomes because they are taxed at a higher rate and tend to have much more expensive health insurance,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThey added: \u201cThe health care tax exclusion is the single largest tax break in the United States, reducing federal revenue by more than $US250 billion per year.\u201d\n\nNOW WATCH: The CEO who raised the price of a life-saving pill 5,000% is doubling down\n\n\n\nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=5; cycle=1", "publisher": "Business Insider Australia", "description": "The Affordable Care Act was signed into law on...", "application-name": "Business Insider Australia", "author": "Brett LoGiurato", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_310_wide.png", "twitter": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act was signed into law on...", "title": "Hillary Clinton wants to repeal a key part of Obamacare", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com.au/obamacare-cadillac-tax-obama-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-2015-10", "image": "http://static.businessinsider.com/image/560ec9679dd7cc0f008beedc/image.jpg", "site": "@BIAUS", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_70.png", "robots": "noarchive", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_310.png", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider Australia", "description": "The Affordable Care Act was signed into law on...", "title": "Hillary Clinton wants to repeal a key part of Obamacare", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com.au/obamacare-cadillac-tax-obama-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-2015-10", "image": "http://static.businessinsider.com/image/560ec9679dd7cc0f008beedc-640/image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_144.png", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-05T05:21:01+11:00"}, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton, Obama\u2019s former secretary of state, said Tuesday that she favoured repealing the law\u2019s so-called Cadillac tax.\nThat\u2019s why, among other steps, I encourage Congress to repeal the so-called Cadillac tax, which applies to some employer-based health plans, and to fully pay for the cost of repeal,\u201d Clinton said in a statement.\nWhen introducing the legislation, Sanders dismissed the conventional wisdom that a \u201cCadillac\u201d tax would disproportionately affect more well-off plans.\nRepeal of the tax, which isn\u2019t scheduled to be implemented until 2018, doesn\u2019t necessarily represent a threat to the law itself.\nBut its repeal would pose a significant problem for one of Obamacare\u2019s main goals: constraining healthcare costs in the US."}
