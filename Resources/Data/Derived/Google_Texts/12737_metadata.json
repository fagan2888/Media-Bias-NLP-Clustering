Bill Shuster, the incumbent for Pennsylvania's 9th Congressional District, on Tuesday night was on his way to holding on to a re-election bid in November's general election.\n\nShuster narrowly bested challenger, Art Halvorson, to secure the Republican nomination for the fall's contest.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith 78 percents of precincts reporting, Shuster was leading Halvorson 51 percent to 48 percent. Less than 2,000 votes separated the candidates.\n\nNo Democratic candidates ran in Tuesday's primary.\n\nShuster, of Hollidaysburg, was elected in 2001, after his father Bud Shuster retired. Like his father, Bill Shuster is chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Shuster has backed major transportation bills, including the long-term highway bill Fast Act, which was enacted in 2015.\n\nHe has come under fire from some conservative sectors for backing programs that increase government spending.\n\nLast year, he came under scrutiny for dating a top lobbyist for the leading U.S. airline trade association amid high-stakes negotiations to overhaul the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nShuster was endorsed by the National Rifle Association, the National Right to Life Committee and the Tea Party Nation, a group of constitutional and limited government conservatives. The 9th congressional district includes Franklin County and parts of Huntington County, among its nine-county swath.\n\nShuster has supported such conservative issues as repeal of the Affordable Care Act and opposition to President Obama's amnesty measure for millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\nHalvorson, of Manns Choice, Bedford County, was a Tea Party candidate. He is a small-business owner and a retired U.S. Coast Guard Captain. Halvorson ran against Shuster in 2014. Shuster retained his seat and won 52.8 of the vote.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Bill Shuster, art-halvorson, bill-shuster, election-2016, elections, primary-election-2016", "title": "House Republican Bill Shuster secures re-election bid for congressional district", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "House Transportation Committee chairman Bill Shuster narrowly beats his Tea Party challenger to secure re-election bid in the fall.", "title": "House Republican Bill Shuster secures re-election bid for congressional district", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/04/bill_shuster_art_halvorson_9th.html", "image": "http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/news/photo/2016/04/26/20217989-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Transportation Committee chairman Bill Shuster narrowly beats his Tea Party challenger to secure re-election bid in the fall.", "creator": "@iveydejesus", "image": "http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/news/photo/2016/04/26/20217989-standard.jpg", "title": "House Republican Bill Shuster secures re-election bid for congressional district", "site": "@pennlive", "card": "summary"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, April 26, 2016, 11:47 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, April 26, 2016, 11:40 PM", "article_author": "Ivey DeJesus | idejesus@pennlive.com", "Description": "House Transportation Committee chairman Bill Shuster narrowly beats his Tea Party challenger to secure re-election bid in the fall."}, "article_summary": "In a close contest, Rep.
