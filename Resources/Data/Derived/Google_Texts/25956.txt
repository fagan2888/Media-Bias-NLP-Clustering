Holtzclaw has been on administrative leave pending a full investigation of the allegations. After the criminal investigation was concluded, the Oklahoma City Police Department said it began an internal investigation into the various alleged incidents. After all formal protocol was followed, the result of the internal investigation is the termination of Daniel Holtzclaw from employment with the Oklahoma City Police Department.

Chief William Citty said in the termination letter to Holtzclaw,

â€œYour offenses committed against women in our community constitute the greatest abuse of police authority I have witnessed in my 37 years as a member of this agency. These violations more than warrant your termination from the Oklahoma City Police Department."
