So this launch has nothing to do with China,\" he said.\n\nChinese Internet companies are required to censor any content the ruling Communist Party deems unlawful, a sweeping power which has been used to block content that clashes with the official party line.\n\nChina frequently upgrades its Internet censorship mechanism, which is widely considered the world's most sophisticated and known as the Great Firewall. This has often rendered VPNs impotent in China.\n\nOpera is the subject of a $1.28 billion acquisition by a consortium of Chinese firms, including web search and security firm Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd and Beijing Kunlun Tech Co.\n\nLast week the group said it had received acceptances on its offer for 72.19 percent of the shares in Opera, below the required level of over 90 percent, and had extended the deadline for acceptances to May 24.\n\nThe deal also needs to be approved by the Chinese and U.S. authorities.\n\nQihoo 360 and Kunlun declined to comment when contacted by Reuters on Thursday about whether Opera's new VPN tool might affect its bid.\n\nAsked whether installing a built-in VPN in its browser could be a problem for the deal, Opera's Boilesen said it would be \"completely unproblematic\", given it was running it through a Chinese IT company already.\n\n(Reporting by Paul Carsten; additional reporting by Beijing Newsroom and Ole Petter Skonnord in Oslo; editing by David Clarke)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/Opera-browser-sought-Chinese-buyers-embeds-anti-censorship-tool", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Opera said on its blog on Thursday that the newest version of its desktop Internet bro", "title": "Chinese takeover target Opera Software embeds browser security tool"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/Opera-browser-sought-Chinese-buyers-embeds-anti-censorship-tool", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Opera said on its blog on Thursday that the newest version of its desktop Internet bro", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd186\"", "article_summary": "\"Regarding China we already have servers in China and are running this through a Chinese IT company which is in compliance with Chinese laws,\" Opera CEO Lars Boilesen told Reuters.\nQihoo 360 and Kunlun declined to comment when contacted by Reuters on Thursday about whether Opera's new VPN tool might affect its bid.\nChina frequently upgrades its Internet censorship mechanism, which is widely considered the world's most sophisticated and known as the Great Firewall.\n(Reporting by Paul Carsten; additional reporting by Beijing Newsroom and Ole Petter Skonnord in Oslo; editing by David Clarke)\nChinese Internet companies are required to censor any content the ruling Communist Party deems unlawful, a sweeping power which has been used to block content that clashes with the official party line."}
