For those who have recently watched the Oscar-contending film Selma, which follows Martin Luther King Jr. through a series of pivotal 1965 marches that helped win public support for the Voting Rights Act, the room will look familiar. The film\u2019s designers did an admirable job recreating Johnson\u2019s White House. It\u2019s possible they even visited the Austin museum for research. The screenwriters, however, were less diligent.\n\nThe events of the film stray far from the historical record, which record it is the LBJ Library\u2019s mission to preserve. One heated Oval Office scene has Johnson informing King that he won\u2019t introduce a voting rights bill to Congress because it would interfere with the president\u2019s domestic priority, the War on Poverty. After the meeting, Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover seem to discuss the idea of assassinating King. It\u2019s implied that Johnson declines only because he\u2019s afraid that Malcolm X will assume leadership of the civil rights movement in King\u2019s absence. Later, enraged by King\u2019s insistence on marching through Selma, Johnson instructs Hoover to send audio tapes of one of King\u2019s extramarital affairs to King\u2019s wife, Coretta, hoping to destabilize the movement.\n\nIn fact, as LBJ Library Director Mark Updegrove has written convincingly since the film\u2019s release, the historical Johnson and King were allies on civil rights, and were both indispensible to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Johnson supported King\u2019s strategy of exploiting incidents of oppression of black would-be voters to help convince members of Congress to pass meaningful legislation. The LBJ Library houses tape of Johnson advising King in January 1965 to \u201cfind the worst condition that you run into in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana or South Carolina \u2026 and get it on radio, get it on television, get it in the pulpits, get it in the meetings, get it every place you can; pretty soon, the fellow that didn\u2019t do anything but drive a tractor will say, \u2018That\u2019s not right, that\u2019s not fair.\u2019 And then, that\u2019ll help us in what we\u2019re going to shove through in the end.\u201d\n\nEyewitnesses and historians have come forward to support Updegrove\u2019s critique of the film. Former Atlanta mayor, congressman and United Nations ambassador Andrew Young was present at the meeting between King and Johnson depicted in the film. \u201cIt was not very tense at all. We were very much welcomed by President Johnson,\u201d Young told The Washington Post recently. \u201cHe and Martin never had that kind of confrontation.\u201d\n\nAs for the tape of King\u2019s affair: \u201cIf the movie suggests LBJ had anything to do with the tape, that\u2019s truly vile and a real historical crime against LBJ,\u201d Pulitzer-winning MLK biographer David Garrow told The New York Times. In the same article, Diane Whorton, another Pulitzer-winning historian of the civil rights movement, summed up her reaction to the film\u2019s depiction of Johnson: \u201cI kept thinking, \u2018Not only is this not true, it\u2019s the opposite of the truth.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor those who follow the headlines, the outcry over Selma\u2019s historical inaccuracies may feel like old news. It has been covered in national and local media as the film has slowly widened its release. The reaction began with Updegrove\u2019s op-ed in Politico on Dec. 22. Former Johnson staffer Joseph Califano Jr. chimed in with an op-ed four days later in The Washington Post. Within a week, the Post and Times had delivered in-depth reporting on the issue. Before long, it was on everyone\u2019s radar.\n\nHistorical inaccuracy in Hollywood films is as old as The Birth of a Nation and Gone With the Wind. What\u2019s salient about the Selma criticism is that it has stuck. How that happened\u2014and the role played by the LBJ Library and its supporting organization the LBJ Foundation\u2014sheds light not just on our changing appreciation for one of the most maligned American presidents, but also on how vital passages of our history are written, rewritten and adjudicated in the public sphere.\n\nJen Reel\n\nIn Austin\u2019s Oval Office recreation, behind the desk where so many bills were signed, there\u2019s a locked door leading to an apartment off-limits to museum-goers. I\u2019m in that inner sanctum, designed by Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird, for working and entertaining guests during his post-presidency career. Since Johnson\u2019s death in 1973, the suite has been stuck in a time warp: groovy lime-green carpet in the bathroom off the office, puke-yellow upholstered Brady Bunch chairs around a conference table in the main room. A painting given to Johnson by Pope Paul VI hangs alongside a panel screen given to his daughter, Lucy, as a wedding gift by Chinese leader Chiang Kai-Shek.\n\nWhen Updegrove enters with Anne Wheeler, head of publicity for the LBJ Library, I\u2019m staring at a coffee table inlaid with 25 pens. Each one was used to sign a landmark bill or executive order. I point and say something about the breadth of Johnson\u2019s legislative accomplishments, how it\u2019s scarcely imaginable in the modern era of Washington gridlock.\n\nUpdegrove blinks, confused. \u201cOh,\u201d says Wheeler, realizing I haven\u2019t looked closely enough at the table. \u201cYou know those pens are just from the education bills.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking broadly, 1965 is the most remarkable legislative year of the 20th century, with the possible exception of 1933, the first year of the New Deal,\u201d Updegrove tells me. Now we\u2019re sitting on a sofa almost as old-fashioned and stiff-backed as the ideals set forth in Johnson\u2019s January 1965 State of the Union address, delivered 50 years ago last month: \u201cThe Great Society asks not how much, but how good; not only how to create wealth, but how to use it; not only how fast we are going, but where we are headed.\u201d\n\nSuch sentiments are often echoed by Democratic politicians, but Updegrove wants to talk about how much Johnson actually accomplished in keeping with those ideals. \u201cLBJ wanted to do the greatest good for the greatest number. That\u2019s not an expression you hear a lot anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if you measure LBJ\u2019s legacy in those terms, he\u2019s one of the greatest presidents we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nSpeaking broadly, 1965 is the most remarkable legislative year of the 20th century, with the possible exception of 1933, the first year of the New Deal.\n\nThat opinion is not widely held. Conservatives such as Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan have taken the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty as an opportunity to criticize and attempt to dismantle the social safety net that Johnson envisioned and built. Generations of Democratic politicians have run from Johnson\u2019s legacy and the taint it acquired from the Vietnam War. (In 1992, candidate Bill Clinton visited the LBJ Library but did not speak the ex-president\u2019s name or recognize Lady Bird, who was present on the stage where Clinton spoke.) And Hollywood has tended to find LBJ\u2019s craggy face and Southern accent more useful as the traits of a villain than of a hero\u2014even when dramatizing domestic victories like the Voting Rights Act, where Johnson\u2019s progressive leadership is undeniable.\n\nSpeaking up for Johnson against such headwinds can be a lonely battle, and Updegrove sometimes seems self-conscious about his position. \u201cI would characterize our role not as defending the legacy but as explaining the era and offering material for people to learn more themselves,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI happen to believe as a historian that Lyndon Johnson is one of our great and underrated presidents. But I don\u2019t feel any responsibility to defend his legacy in my role as the director of the LBJ Library.\u201d\n\nAs for his Selma editorial, he says, \u201cMany people, young folks in particular, get their history from popular culture, and they believe that there\u2019s some sort of standard in place for those movies based on history, to ensure that it\u2019s depicted responsibly and accurately. So I felt the need to speak out and set the record straight.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresidential libraries find themselves sometimes caught between two schools,\u201d explains H.W. Brands, a historian at the University of Texas at Austin and author of several books about American presidents. \u201cOne is, they\u2019re the neutral arbiter of the historical record. Wearing that hat, library directors have really no stake in what the story is. But on the other hand, if you\u2019re running a group called Friends of the LBJ Library, then it behooves you to make LBJ seem like someone you\u2019d want to be friends with.\u201d Indeed, Amy Barbee, the LBJ Foundation president, tells me that she discussed the Politico editorial with Updegrove ahead of its publication, saying, \u201cWe work together on the legacy issues.\u201d\n\nStill, says Brands, \u201cOf all the libraries I\u2019ve worked with, and I think I\u2019ve worked with just about all of them, LBJ handles this as well or better than any other. LBJ is really a model of openness to researchers to come in and see what the record is and tell the story however you like it. And at the same time it tries to make it accessible to people who are not professional historians.\u201d\n\nJen Reel\n\nThe LBJ Library perhaps has more misconceptions to correct than the average presidential library. Long before Selma, Oliver Stone\u2019s JFK suggested to a generation of filmgoers that Johnson was involved in his predecessor\u2019s assassination. (\u201cNothing that I have found in my research\u201d implicates him, Pulitzer-winning Johnson biographer Robert Caro has written.)\n\nBy several accounts, the custodians of Johnson\u2019s legacy had not been planning to spend the first months of 2015 defending the former president from historical misrepresentations such as those made in Selma. Instead, as The New York Times reported last year, Johnson\u2019s heirs and supporters were engaged in \u201cone last campaign\u201d to rehabilitate the ex-president\u2019s tarnished legacy. They planned to focus in particular on the anniversaries of his myriad legislative accomplishments of 1965.\n\nTheir case, which Updegrove pitches to me in the presidential suite, is compelling. Johnson\u2019s policy-enacting efficiency as president is legendary, but 1965 stands alone as an annus mirabilis for socially progressive legislation. Even a heavily abridged recounting of the year reads like a Book of Genesis of American social democracy.\n\nIn January 1965, Johnson was inaugurated into his first full term as president with supermajorities in both houses and a landslide electoral victory at his back. In April he signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which established the federal government\u2019s role in funding disadvantaged schools and students. The law remains on the books to this day, amended, beaten, bloodied, and renamed as the No Child Left Behind Act. In July, Johnson and Congress raised Social Security payments, immediately lifting 2.5 million seniors out of poverty, and created Medicare and Medicaid. In August, the Voting Rights Act finally assured African Americans of access to the ballot box. In 1965, 6.7 percent of African Americans in Mississippi were registered to vote. By 1967, that number would rise to 59.8 percent.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a single president who wouldn\u2019t stake his entire domestic reputation on just one of those bills,\u201d Updegrove says. But Johnson was just getting started.\n\nThe genius of Johnson\u2019s Great Society was to wed the civil rights revolution to New Deal liberalism. In 1965, those ideals marched hand in hand. Selma captures none of that unity.\n\nOver the next two months he created the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the National Endowment for the Arts. In October he signed the Immigration and Nationality Act, which dispensed with a racial quota system that had favored immigration from Western- and Northern-European countries and had barred entry for most Asian and African immigrants; this act opened the door to the vibrantly multicultural society that Americans now take for granted. In November came the Higher Education Act, which remains the primary public mechanism for helping lower-income Americans pay for college. Johnson\u2019s 1965 successes also included a major farm bill, legislation protecting clean air and creating new national parks, an executive order mandating affirmative action for government contractors, and a highway-beautification bill that permanently transformed America\u2019s roadways.\n\nReading over the list, a modern-day liberal can\u2019t help salivating. What might 2009 have been if Barack Obama had attacked his window of supermajority opportunity with the same gusto and arm-twisting savvy? We might have half a dozen progressive accomplishments on the scale of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nJohnson\u2019s legacy, of course, carries a major caveat, and 1965 contains a much less laudable set of milestones. At the start of the year, there were no U.S. combat troops in Vietnam. In March, Johnson launched the ground war with a small force of Marines. By the end of the year, combat troops totaled more than 200,000. Any estimation of Johnson\u2019s record regarding \u201cthe greatest good for the greatest number\u201d must reckon with the 60,000 Americans killed and the 300,000 maimed in that misguided war.\n\nMany presidential historians, Updegrove included, see Vietnam as the primary reason that LBJ\u2019s domestic legacy has been so consistently overlooked and underrated. Author and radio commentator Sarah Vowell, who has written about presidential libraries, has an additional take. \u201cHis most famous speech is about not seeking reelection,\u201d Vowell tells me in an email. \u201cHe\u2019s not an inspiring figure. His greatness\u2014his political mind, the way he worked behind closed doors to talk Congressmen into doing his bidding\u2014is probably too back room, too blatantly political, to capture our imaginations. Look at the current president. I think history will generally be kind to him because there\u2019s so much good tape of him talking. But he has none of LBJ\u2019s offstage talents at squeezing the legislative branch. Effective but distasteful isn\u2019t the sort of legacy that sells tickets.\n\n\u201cEven after Watergate and Iran-Contra and the Clinton impeachment, Americans still want to think of the president as a role model,\u201d Vowell adds. \u201cWhich is insane.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that Johnson\u2019s \u201cdistasteful\u201d political biography includes stealing a Senate election in Texas in 1948, according to Caro. Still, both the Vietnam War and power-hungry Johnson himself have been history for more than 40 years. Medicare, Medicaid, the Voting Rights Act, Pell grants, the NEA, and our multi-cultural immigration system live on. Right?\n\nJen Reel\n\nThat\u2019s the problem, defenders of the Johnson legacy argue. Without an ongoing appreciation for the Great Society vision that united these signature achievements, they\u2019ve been subject to piecemeal attacks and weakening modifications over the years. In 2013, for example, the Republican-controlled Supreme Court gutted Section IV of the Voting Rights Act, which protects voters in historically segregationist areas, including swaths of Texas. President George W. Bush wagered the political capital of his 2004 presidential victory on an unsuccessful push to privatize Medicare. As noted above, Johnson\u2019s Elementary and Secondary Education Act has been altered beyond recognition by testing-happy reformers, and efforts are underway to divert its funding mechanisms toward private charter schools.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to look historically at what has been achieved, to highlight how far we\u2019ve come in 50 years due to these laws that were passed,\u201d says Barbee, the LBJ Foundation\u2019s director. \u201cMedicare and the Voting Rights Act are part of the fabric of American life. It\u2019s frightening to think that these laws have been weakened somewhat.\u201d\n\nBarbee and Updegrove have been central to efforts to promote appreciation for the historic and modern-day significance of such laws, and of the Great Society and War on Poverty in general. Last year, the LBJ Library hosted a summit on the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Four American presidents\u2014Carter, Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama\u2014took the stage to praise the bill, which effectively ended Jim Crow. This year, the LBJ Foundation will support a conference to examine the history and future of Medicare and a concert to celebrate the legacy of the National Endowment of the Arts. Both events will be held in Washington, D.C., within earshot of the halls of power.\n\nVowell argues that the museum components of presidential libraries can also play an important role in helping ordinary people grasp the importance of a complex legacy like Johnson\u2019s. \u201cI do think empathy can be educational,\u201d she tells me.\u201cTrying to see anything, including historical events, from the perspective of those who lived them, is an important component of piecing together what happened.\n\n\u201cI remember in the Johnson library there are display cases about the president\u2019s work as a teacher among impoverished Mexican-American children,\u201d she adds. \u201cI seem to recall a letter from one of his students. Just seeing the pictures explained a thing or two about how weird it was that a Texan who looked and talked like a good old boy made such progress on poverty and civil rights.\u201d\n\nPressed by interviewers, Selma director Ava DuVernay has taken several tacks in defense of her film, including denying that her Johnson is a villain, impugning Johnson\u2019s reputation generally (telling NPR host Terry Gross, \u201cIf I had wanted to paint someone as a villain, particularly LBJ, there\u2019s a lot I could do in that regard\u201d), and defending her right to tell \u201cthe truth, not the facts.\u201d Of course, it would be unfair to imagine Selma as the product of a single creator. Though she has indicated that she rewrote the movie\u2019s screenplay, DuVernay is not credited as Selma\u2019s screenwriter, and she signed on to the project after an early draft had been written and the film had been partially cast. Selma is a commercial dramatization of history, aimed first at attracting investors, and, later, at selling tickets. In the process of its creation, one or more people decided that a fictitiously villainous Johnson would sell better than the historical Johnson.\n\nIt does contemporary politics no favors to paint the epochal year of 1965 as one of conflict between an anti-poverty agenda and the civil rights movement, when neither King nor Johnson would have seen it that way.\n\nThe reasons for that are complex and have been addressed above. But even aside from questions of one man\u2019s legacy, it does contemporary politics no favors to paint the epochal year of 1965 as one of conflict between an anti-poverty agenda and the civil rights movement, when neither King nor Johnson would have seen it that way.\n\n\u201cIt was about leveling the playing field,\u201d Updegrove says. \u201cMedicare is not just about health care. It was a poverty bill. When it was passed, over a third of Americans over 65 lived in poverty. They were unable to afford medical care in their older age and were essentially put out to pasture.\u201d Likewise, he says, \u201cThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as LBJ told Martin Luther King, was one of the most potent civil rights acts you could put on the books.\u201d Indeed, the LBJ Library houses tape of Johnson and King discussing the bill\u2019s transformative implications for poorly funded black and mostly black schools across the country.\n\nThe genius of Johnson\u2019s Great Society was to wed the civil rights revolution to New Deal liberalism. In 1965, those ideals marched hand in hand. Selma captures none of that unity, but it does reflect a modern split on the left, where identity politics are often divorced from the issue of economic inequality, and historically marginalized groups are instead assuaged with better representation in the media and in the upper ranks of institutional power.\n\nAlong those lines, DuVernay, too, deserves to be regarded as a sympathetic figure in the story of Selma. She is historically significant as the first black female director of a major Oscar-contending film. That job entails skillfully directing the script her producers signed off on and quarterbacking an unapologetic Oscar campaign. DuVernay has succeeded in both tasks, perhaps even in the mold of the historical Johnson\u2014as a savvy political operator with her eyes on the prize of long-lasting institutional change.\n\nPerhaps it was never DuVernay\u2019s job to sincerely consider the presidential history her movie depicts. That task falls to critics, historians and audiences. And thanks in part to Updegrove and Califano, the system has worked: All but the lowest-information moviegoers are now likely aware that Selma\u2019s depiction of Johnson is problematic.\n\nLooking ahead to other upcoming anniversaries of major legislation, Updegrove is ready to move on from the Selma controversy. He has other historical fish to fry. For instance, Ronald Reagan\u2019s old line: \u201cWe had a war on poverty, and poverty won.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at the statistics, that\u2019s not true,\u201d Updegrove tells me, leaning forward on the sofa and speaking excitedly. \u201cThe poverty rate before the War on Poverty was waged was about 20 percent. And after LBJ left office, that number fell to 13 percent. That\u2019s the largest one-time reduction in our history. That is staggering.\u201d\n\nThe poverty rate before the War on Poverty was waged was about 20 percent. And after LBJ left office, that number fell to 13 percent. That\u2019s the largest one-time reduction in our history.\n\nIn 1968, that 13 percent poverty rate was the lowest America had ever seen. Since then, it\u2019s been a reliable average, with minor fluctuations in either direction, except during the recent financial crisis, when it ballooned again to pre-1966 levels. It might have stuck there, too, if proposed Republican austerity measures had found political traction.\n\nInstead, we happen to have a president in the White House who respects Johnson\u2019s legacy\u2014the first, in fact to visit the LBJ Library as a sitting president and praise that legacy. (No small coup for Updegrove, that.) At last year\u2019s Civil Rights Summit, hosted by the LBJ Library, Barack Obama answered Reagan head on:\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s true that, despite laws like the Civil Rights Act, and the Voting Rights Act and Medicare, our society is still racked with division and poverty. \u2026[I]t\u2019s perhaps easy to conclude that there are limits to change; that we are trapped by our own history; and politics is a fool\u2019s errand, and we\u2019d be better off if we roll back big chunks of LBJ\u2019s legacy\u2026\n\n\u201cI reject such thinking. Not just because Medicare and Medicaid have lifted millions from suffering; not just because the poverty rate in this nation would be far worse without food stamps and Head Start and all the Great Society programs that survive to this day.I reject such cynicism because I have lived out the promise of LBJ\u2019s efforts. \u2026 Because I and millions of my generation were in a position to take the baton that he handed to us.\u201d\n\nReagan\u2019s take on Johnson\u2019s legacy was just as wrong as Selma\u2019s, or maybe worse, considering the damage his misreading may still cause. Here\u2019s hoping that in 2015, Obama\u2019s response to Reagan\u2014and Updegrove\u2019s response to Selma\u2014is a correction that sticks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The LBJ Library has aimed to set the record straight on Lyndon Johnson after the film \"Selma\" cast him as something of a villain.", "og": {"site_name": "The Texas Observer", "description": "The LBJ Library has aimed to set the record straight on Lyndon Johnson after the film \"Selma\" cast him as something of a villain.", "title": "Visiting the LBJ Library in the Shadow of Selma", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/w425-21-rev1.jpg", "height": 692}, "updated_time": "2015-09-09T12:03:28-05:00", "url": "https://www.texasobserver.org/visiting-lbj-library-shadow-selma/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The LBJ Library has aimed to set the record straight on Lyndon Johnson after the film \"Selma\" cast him as something of a villain.", "title": "Visiting the LBJ Library in the Shadow of Selma", "image": "https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/w425-21-rev1.jpg", "creator": "@magresta", "site": "@TexasObserver", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=417283609", "fb": {"pages": 21002115613, "app_id": 902538479865047}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/texasobserver", "section": "Culture", "tag": "Selma", "published_time": "2015-02-11T11:29:14-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-09T12:03:28-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf6f6\"", "article_summary": "Last year, the LBJ Library hosted a summit on the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\nAnd at the same time it tries to make it accessible to people who are not professional historians.\u201dJen ReelThe LBJ Library perhaps has more misconceptions to correct than the average presidential library.\nWhen Updegrove enters with Anne Wheeler, head of publicity for the LBJ Library, I\u2019m staring at a coffee table inlaid with 25 pens.\n(In 1992, candidate Bill Clinton visited the LBJ Library but did not speak the ex-president\u2019s name or recognize Lady Bird, who was present on the stage where Clinton spoke.)\n\u201cI remember in the Johnson library there are display cases about the president\u2019s work as a teacher among impoverished Mexican-American children,\u201d she adds."}
