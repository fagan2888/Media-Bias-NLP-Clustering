Researchers from McGill University found a link between a baby boy\u2019s exposure to hormones in the womb, their hand development, and their behavior toward women as adults. They published their findings in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.\n\n\u201cIt is fascinating to see that moderate variations of hormones before birth can actually influence adult behavior in a selective way,\u201d said the study\u2019s co-author Simon Young, a psychiatry professor at McGill University, in a press release. The study may also provide a new research perspective on why certain men tend to have more children.\n\nThe smaller the ratio is between a man\u2019s index finger (pointer) and his ring finger, the nicer his behavior is toward women, according to the findings. Finger length is determined by the levels of male hormones, particularly testosterone, a baby is exposed to while in their mother\u2019s belly. The lower the male hormone levels are, the kinder the man is toward a woman.\n\n\u201cWhen with women, men with smaller ratios were more likely to listen attentively, smile and laugh, compromise, or compliment the other person,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Debbie Moskowitz, psychology professor at McGill University, in the press release.\"Our research suggests they have more harmonious relationships with women; these behaviors support the formation and maintenance of relationships with women. This might explain why they have more children on average.\"\n\nResearchers studied the behavior of 155 participants over 20 days, evaluating their social interactions, levels of agreeableness, and frequency of quarrels. They found men with smaller differences between their ring and index fingers' length were a third more agreeable and a third less quarrelsome. This isn\u2019t the first time fingers have been able to predict behavior. Hands have now become clues to what happened to a person while they were in the womb, and have also been linked to fertility, female assertiveness, happiness, and even a person's susceptibility to certain diseases.\n\nResearchers from Northumbria and Oxford Universities found that the length of the ring finger when compared to the index finger could also reveal infidelity. The study analyzed finger length of both men and women and found that the shorter someone\u2019s index finger is in relation to their ring finger, the more testosterone they were exposed to in the womb. Sexual promiscuity is linked to higher levels of testosterone, which means a simple measurement of the fingers could clue you in to your partner's likelihood of having a higher amount of sexual partners, or their tendency to wander.\n\nIf you grab your partner\u2019s hand, however, and discover their ring finger is significantly longer than their index finger, it\u2019s not a guarantee they\u2019ll cheat or that they\u2019ll be less nice to women \u2014 it's just a risk factor after all.\n\nSource: Young SN, Moskowitz DS, Sutton R, and Zuroff DC.
