LANDOVER — What appeared to be a matchup nightmare all week ended up being handled fairly well by the Washington Redskins’ young offensive linemen.

Second-year right tackle Morgan Moses and rookie right guard Brandon Scherff, the No. 5 overall pick in April, survived their test against the Miami Dolphins’ duo of defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, the Dolphins’ marquee free agent signing, and defensive end Cameron Wake.

“The guys knew they had a big challenge,” left tackle Trent Williams said. “They came out here with their big hat on today. Brandon did a good job on [Suh]. Morgan did a good job on [Wake]. You know, we just knew we had to keep [quarterback] Kirk [Cousins] clean a few seconds and let him find his receivers downfield and he was going to let the ball go.”

They foiled Suh with double-teams and cut blocks, especially early, and ran the ball in the direction of Suh and Wake just twice in the first half. Cousins was sacked just once — an eight-yard loss on the opening drive — in the Redskins’ 17-10 loss on Sunday.

“We were just playing football,” said Moses, who played 12 percent of all offensive snaps last season as a rookie. “He happened to be in the position where we could get some cuts on him and try to slow him down a little bit and that’s the way we executed. [Offensive line coach Bill] Callahan gave us a plan earlier in the week, and you know, it’s our job to come in and execute it on Sundays.”
