MacArthur Foundation as part of the Safety and Justice Challenge.\n\nOn an overcast autumn morning, 21-year-old Joey Fiala sits on a sprawl of sleeping bags and blankets, watching Colorado\u2019s prolonged summer yield to winter. Fiala, originally from Kansas City, Missouri, is among a group of homeless people who gather most days in Jefferson Park on the north end of the Old Town Square section in Fort Collins. Here, a grassy lot sidles up to a busy railroad track and serves as a sort of daytime rest stop for folks without shelter. The men and women socialize and sneak catnaps in between hustling for cash and shuttling around the community to make use of its spread-out resources. When night falls, however, residents without shelter rush to get out of sight. Groups disperse and individuals head off in pairs or on their own.\n\nMore from Narratively and the Vera Institute of Justice: \u201cReturn to Rikers\u201d\n\nRay Lyall, 57, homeless for two years, has worked with Denver Homeless Out Loud (DHOL) for the past 22 months. He was arrested on October 24, along with others working on DHOL\u2019s Tiny Homes project. Since he was released from jail, he has been camping with a group at a site in Denver at 26th and Lawrence Streets, which was raided on December 3. Lyall says the camping ban is used to target people sleeping outside and give tickets for other offenses. \u201cCan\u2019t have anything under or over you,\u201d he says, explaining the camping ban. \u201cI can lay in the freezing snow but I can\u2019t have anything on my back.\u201d\n\nMore from Narratively and the Vera Institute of Justice: \u201cLegal Perils of Homelessness\u201d\n\nFort Collins, a college town at the base of the Rocky Mountain foothills, prohibits practices such as loitering, \u201cmisuse of public waters,\u201d and \u201ccamping or pitching a tent without permission.\u201d Being homeless here necessitates invisibility, and consequently, isolation. Things that offer safety and even comfort at night\u2014tents or multi-person encampments\u2014make hiding difficult, and often land homeless people in jail.\n\nMore from Narratively and the Vera Institute of Justice: \u201cThe Human Toll of Jail\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to jail twice for camping,\u201d Fiala says between swigs of coffee and bites of a doughnut, pulling his jacket tight around his small frame.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in for camping and for trespassing,\u201d chimes in Steve, who doesn\u2019t give his last name. A dad with a perfect goatee and cheeks rosy from the incoming chill, Steve hesitates to offer more. But others in the group nod in agreement.\n\n\u201cYeah, I got ticketed twice for sleeping under the Linden Street Bridge,\u201d Fiala says, jumping back in. \u201cI was sick, sleeping on a mattress under the bridge, and they woke me up and gave me a ticket. I balled it up and threw it in their face. \u2018F\u2014 you! I\u2019m not gonna pay that. I can\u2019t pay that.\u2019 So I ended up in jail for failure to appear.\u201d\n\nRecent years have seen a surge of policing efforts throughout Colorado targeting those without shelter. Numerous communities have banned panhandling, camping, or sleeping in cars on public property. Loitering and trespassing laws prevent homeless individuals from having a safe place to rest\u2014or options for washing up or using a bathroom. Violators face fines of $100 or more, an expense that quickly adds up for repeat offenders, landing many with warrants and, eventually, jail time. (Officials in Fort Collins have said they are looking into proposals that would allow people to sleep outside in certain places.)\n\nAccording to the 2015 report \u201cNo Right to Rest: Criminalizing Homeless in Colorado,\u201d more than half of the state\u2019s homeless population has been in jail for minor infractions.\n\nFiala has been homeless about three years, or pretty much his entire adult life. When he first moved to Fort Collins with his then-girlfriend, they slept in their car. \u201cBut,\u201d he sputters, in sequential bursts of frustration, \u201cshe cheated on me\u2026.She wrecked [our car].\u201d He dunks a doughnut in his rapidly cooling cup of coffee and shudders. \u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d\n\nWes Hammond, a middle-aged man who has been listening quietly, suddenly plunges into the exchange. Hammond has been homeless on and off for much of his life. Born in Kentucky, he lived briefly in Tennessee before heading west. \u201cI hitchhiked for three days to Colorado and this guy picked me up, asked if I wanted to work on a ranch,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I did, up in the mountains, but I got tired of that, so I built a bike and I rode it off that mountain.\u201d\n\nHe arrived in Fort Collins in 2010, initially finding stability in a relationship. When that \u201cblew up\u201d a year ago, he found himself back on the streets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had three camping tickets, two trespassing tickets, open container, parks violation, and urinating in public,\u201d he claims. \u201cMy fines come to $2,009\u2026.I just got out of jail last night. Just one night this time. Failure to appear. Tacked on a $50 fine.\u201d He takes a drag off the spliff that\u2019s been floating around the circle and shakes his head ruefully. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to pay it. And all my stuff\u2019s there at the police station. I can\u2019t get to it.\u201d\n\nSteve, eyeing the joint, chimes in once more. \u201cYou better be careful with that. We may be in Colorado, but our house doesn\u2019t have any walls,\u201d he says, referring to the state\u2019s legalization of marijuana use in private, but not in public spaces. As with open alcohol containers and intoxication, smoking cannabis is permitted only for those with the means to do so behind some sort of closed door. Individuals who lack shelter automatically miss out on key benefits afforded by seclusion. The very invisibility they seek when scattering at night is almost impossible to come by without the security of a safe and private place to rest.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jurisdictions across the country are adopting legislation to prevent tent cities, leaving thousands vulnerable VIDEO", "author": "Stacey McKenna", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Jurisdictions across the country are adopting legislation to prevent tent cities, leaving thousands vulnerable VIDEO", "title": "Jailed for being homeless", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/28/jailed_for_being_homeless_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/military_jacket.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jurisdictions across the country are adopting legislation to prevent tent cities, leaving thousands vulnerable VIDEO", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/military_jacket.jpg", "title": "Jailed for being homeless", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Jailed for being homeless", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Colorado, Homelessness, Kansas City, Missouri, Narratively", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "According to the 2015 report \u201cNo Right to Rest: Criminalizing Homeless in Colorado,\u201d more than half of the state\u2019s homeless population has been in jail for minor infractions.\nMore from Narratively and the Vera Institute of Justice: \u201cReturn to Rikers\u201dRay Lyall, 57, homeless for two years, has worked with Denver Homeless Out Loud (DHOL) for the past 22 months.\nThings that offer safety and even comfort at night\u2014tents or multi-person encampments\u2014make hiding difficult, and often land homeless people in jail.\nLoitering and trespassing laws prevent homeless individuals from having a safe place to rest\u2014or options for washing up or using a bathroom.\nFiala has been homeless about three years, or pretty much his entire adult life."}
