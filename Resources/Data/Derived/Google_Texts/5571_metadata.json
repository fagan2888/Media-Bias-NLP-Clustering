That was second only to Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Ohio, which posted profit of $392.5 million on total revenue of $5.2 billion last year, according to the trade group\u2019s annual report.\n\nRounding out the top five by premium revenue were Aetna Health Inc. ($3 billion); Medical Mutual of Ohio ($2.5 billion); and Molina Healthcare of Ohio Inc. ($1.2 billion).\n\nThe total gain last year for the 22 health insurers who submitted financial statements to the Ohio Department of Insurance was $939 million on premium revenue of $23 billion, according to the OHA report. Premium revenue was up 2 percent over 2012, and profit margin was up 4.2 percent for the group.\n\nTotal membership grew by 2 percent, but the numbers did not include new members gained through the expansion of Medicaid in Ohio and plans sold directly to consumers through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance marketplace.\n\nCareSource has added more than 107,000 new members through the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to anyone earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, and the company has enrolled more than 35,000 in its CareSource Just4Me brand health plans that it began selling in the marketplace for the first time this year.\n\nThe company expects total enrollment to grow by 20 percent from about 1.3 million by the end of year, and premium revenues to grow 38 percent to $5.7 billion.\n\n\u201cA 38 percent growth rate is substantial and it surprised us a little bit. Revenue growth means a greater opportunity to serve those who need coverage. We knew we were going to be close to $5 billion, but we didn\u2019t expect $5.7 billion this year,\u201d said CareSource President and CEO Pam Morris.\n\nThe bulk of the growth in membership and revenues will come from new product lines, including expanded Medicaid, Just4Me plans and MyCare Ohio, which combines Medicare and Medicaid into a single health plan for dual eligible members. Together, new products will account for just over $1 billion in revenues by the end of the year, company officials said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CareSource, a downtown Dayton-based Medicaid managed care provider, was the No.", "og": {"url": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/business/caresource-no-2-health-insurer-in-ohio/ng4t3/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2013/08/19/ce/6e/caresource1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "CareSource, a downtown Dayton-based Medicaid managed care provider, was the No.", "title": "CareSource No. 2 health insurer in Ohio"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2013/08/19/ce/6e/caresource1.jpg", "title": "CareSource No. 2 health insurer in Ohio", "site": "@daytondailynews", "card": "summary", "description": "CareSource, a downtown Dayton-based Medicaid managed care provider, was the No. 2 health insurer in the state by premium revenue in 2013, according to a recent report from the Ohio Hospital Association."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/business/caresource-no-2-health-insurer-in-ohio/ng4t3/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2583959/news/business/caresource-no-2-health-insurer-in-ohio/ng4t3/", "keywords": "justinbnt,ACA", "google-site-verification": "fR8PW_DfizdYW0uymF5VkAzfbNKqKxqfnhqsbXSP7oI", "news_keywords": "ACA"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc97db\"", "article_summary": "2 health insurer in the state by premium revenue in 2013, according to a recent report from the Ohio Hospital Association.\nRounding out the top five by premium revenue were Aetna Health Inc.
