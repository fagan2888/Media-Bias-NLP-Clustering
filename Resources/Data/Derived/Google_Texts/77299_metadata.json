Automated supermarket checkout, 3D printing, driverless vehicles . . . what has the \u201cminimum wage\u201d to do with any of that? To get your minimum wage increased, you first have to have a minimum-wage job.\n\nIn my book (which I shall forbear to plug, but is available at Amazon, and with which Jeff Bezos will be happy to drone your aunt this holiday season), I write:\n\nOnce upon a time, millions of Americans worked on farms. Then, as agriculture declined, they moved into the factories. When manufacturing was outsourced, they settled into low-paying service jobs or better-paying cubicle jobs \u2014 so-called \u201cprofessional services\u201d often deriving from the ever swelling accounting and legal administration that now attends almost any activity in America. What comes next? Or, more to the point, what if there is no \u201cnext\u201d?\n\nWhat do millions of people do in a world in which, in Marxian terms, \u201ccapital\u201d no longer needs \u201clabor\u201d? America\u2019s liberal elite seem to enjoy having a domestic-servant class on hand, but, unlike the Downton Abbey crowd, are vaguely uncomfortable with having them drawn from the sturdy yokel stock of the village, and thus favor, to a degree only the Saudis can match, importing their maids and pool-boys from a permanent subordinate class of cheap foreign labor. Hence the fetishization of the \u201cundocumented,\u201d soon to be reflected in the multi-million bipartisan amnesty for those willing to do \u201cthe jobs Americans won\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nSo what jobs will Americans get to do? We dignify the new age as \u201cthe knowledge economy,\u201d although, to the casual observer, it doesn\u2019t seem to require a lot of knowledge. One of the advantages of Obamacare, according to Nancy Pelosi, is that it will liberate the citizenry: \u201cThink of an economy where people could be an artist or a photographer or a writer without worrying about keeping their day job in order to have health insurance.\u201d It\u2019s certainly true that employer-based health coverage distorts the job market, but what\u2019s more likely in a world without work? A new golden age of American sculpture and opera? Or millions more people who live vicariously through celebrity gossip and electronic diversions? One of the differences between government health care in America compared to, say, Sweden is the costs of obesity, heart disease, childhood diabetes, etc. In an ever more sedentary society where fewer and fewer have to get up to go to work in the morning, is it likely that those trends will diminish or increase?\n\nConsider Vermont. Unlike my own state of New Hampshire, it has a bucolic image: Holsteins, dirt roads, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Howard Dean . . . And yet the Green Mountain State has appalling levels of heroin and meth addiction, and the social chaos that follows. Geoffrey Norman began a recent essay in The Weekly Standard with a vignette from a town I know very well \u2014 St. Johnsbury, population 7,600, motto \u201cVery Vermont,\u201d the capital of the remote North-East Kingdom hard by the Quebec border and as far from urban pathologies as you can get. Or so you\u2019d think. But on a recent Saturday morning, Norman reports, there were more cars parked at the needle-exchange clinic than at the farmers\u2019 market. In Vermont, there\u2019s no inner-city underclass, because there are no cities, inner or outer; there\u2019s no disadvantaged minorities, because there\u2019s only three blacks and seven Hispanics in the entire state; there\u2019s no nothing. Which is the real problem.\n\nLarge numbers of Vermonters have adopted the dysfunctions of the urban underclass for no reason more compelling than that there\u2019s not much else to do. Once upon a time, St. Johnsbury made Fairbanks scales, but now a still handsome town is, as Norman puts it, \u201chollowed out by the loss of work and purpose.\u201d Their grandparents got up at four in the morning to work the farm and their great-great-great-whatever-parents slogged up the Connecticut River, cleared the land, and built homes and towns and a civilization in the wilderness. And now? A couple of months back, I sat in the caf\u00e9 in St. Johnsbury, and overheard a state official and a Chamber of Commerce official discuss enthusiastically how the town could access some federal funds to convert an abandoned building into welfare housing.\n\n\u201cWork\u201d and \u201cpurpose\u201d are intimately connected: Researchers at the University of Michigan, for example, found that welfare payments make one unhappier than a modest income honestly earned and used to provide for one\u2019s family. \u201cIt drains too much of the life from life,\u201d said Charles Murray in a speech in 2009. \u201cAnd that statement applies as much to the lives of janitors \u2014 even more to the lives of janitors \u2014 as it does to the lives of CEOs.\u201d Self-reliance \u2014 \u201cwork\u201d \u2014 is intimately connected to human dignity \u2014 \u201cpurpose.\u201d\n\nSo what does every initiative of the Obama era have in common? Obamacare, Obamaphones, Social Security disability expansion, 50 million people on food stamps . . . The assumption is that mass, multi-generational dependency is now a permanent feature of life. A coastal elite will devise ever smarter and slicker trinkets, and pretty much everyone else will be a member of either the dependency class or the vast bureaucracy that ministers to them. And, if you\u2019re wondering why every Big Government program assumes you\u2019re a feeble child, that\u2019s because a citizenry without \u201cwork and purpose\u201d is ultimately incompatible with liberty. The elites think a smart society will be wealthy enough to relieve the masses from the need to work. In reality, it would be neo-feudal, but with fatter, sicker peasants. It wouldn\u2019t just be \u201ceconomic inequality,\u201d but a far more profound kind, and seething with resentments.\n\nOne wouldn\u2019t expect the governing class to be as far-sighted as visionaries like Bezos. But it\u2019s hard to be visionary if you\u2019re pointing in the wrong direction. Which is why the signature achievement of Obama\u2019s \u201chope and change\u201d combines 1940s British public-health theories with 1970s Soviet supermarket delivery systems. But don\u2019t worry: Maybe one day soon, your needle-exchange clinic will be able to deliver by drone.

What comes next?\n\nOr, more to the point, what if there is no \u201cnext\u201d?\n\n\nWhat do millions of people do in a world in which, in Marxian terms, \u201ccapital\u201d no longer needs \u201clabor\u201d? America\u2019s liberal elite seem to enjoy having a domestic-servant class on hand, but, unlike the Downton Abbey crowd, are vaguely uncomfortable with having them drawn from the sturdy yokel stock of the village, and thus favor, to a degree only the Saudis can match, importing their maids and pool-boys from a permanent subordinate class of cheap foreign labor. Hence the fetishization of the \u201cundocumented,\u201d soon to be reflected in the multi-million bipartisan amnesty for those willing to do \u201cthe jobs Americans won\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nSo what jobs will Americans get to do? We dignify the new age as \u201cthe knowledge economy,\u201d although, to the casual observer, it doesn\u2019t seem to require a lot of knowledge. One of the advantages of Obamacare, according to Nancy Pelosi, is that it will liberate the citizenry: \u201cThink of an economy where people could be an artist or a photographer or a writer without worrying about keeping their day job in order to have health insurance.\u201d It\u2019s certainly true that employer-based health coverage distorts the job market, but what\u2019s more likely in a world without work? A new golden age of American sculpture and opera? Or millions more people who live vicariously through celebrity gossip and electronic diversions? One of the differences between government health care in America compared to, say, Sweden is the costs of obesity, heart disease, childhood diabetes, etc. In an ever more sedentary society where fewer and fewer have to get up to go to work in the morning, is it likely that those trends will diminish or increase?#page#\n\nConsider Vermont. Unlike my own state of New Hampshire, it has a bucolic image: Holsteins, dirt roads, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Howard Dean\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0And yet the Green Mountain State has appalling levels of heroin and meth addiction, and the social chaos that follows. Geoffrey Norman began a recent essay in The Weekly Standard with a vignette from a town I know very well \u2014 St. Johnsbury, population 7,600, motto \u201cVery Vermont,\u201d the capital of the remote North-East Kingdom hard by the Quebec border and as far from urban pathologies as you can get. Or so you\u2019d think. But on a recent Saturday morning, Norman reports, there were more cars parked at the needle-exchange clinic than at the farmers\u2019 market. In Vermont, there\u2019s no inner-city underclass, because there are no cities, inner or outer; there\u2019s no disadvantaged minorities, because there\u2019s only three blacks and seven Hispanics in the entire state; there\u2019s no nothing. Which is the real problem.#ad#\n\nLarge numbers of Vermonters have adopted the dysfunctions of the urban underclass for no reason more compelling than that there\u2019s not much else to do. Once upon a time, St. Johnsbury made Fairbanks scales, but now a still handsome town is, as Norman puts it, \u201chollowed out by the loss of work and purpose.\u201d Their grandparents got up at four in the morning to work the farm and their great-great-great-whatever-parents slogged up the Connecticut River, cleared the land, and built homes and towns and a civilization in the wilderness. And now? A couple of months back, I sat in the caf\u00e9 in St. Johnsbury, and overheard a state official and a Chamber of Commerce official discuss enthusiastically how the town could access some federal funds to convert an abandoned building into welfare housing.\n\n\u201cWork\u201d and \u201cpurpose\u201d are intimately connected: Researchers at the University of Michigan, for example, found that welfare payments make one unhappier than a modest income honestly earned and used to provide for one\u2019s family. \u201cIt drains too much of the life from life,\u201d said Charles Murray in a speech in 2009. \u201cAnd that statement applies as much to the lives of janitors \u2014 even more to the lives of janitors \u2014 as it does to the lives of CEOs.\u201d Self-reliance \u2014 \u201cwork\u201d \u2014 is intimately connected to human dignity \u2014 \u201cpurpose.\u201d\n\nSo what does every initiative of the Obama era have in common? Obamacare, Obamaphones, Social Security disability expansion, 50 million people on food stamps\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0The assumption is that mass, multi-generational dependency is now a permanent feature of life. A coastal elite will devise ever smarter and slicker trinkets, and pretty much everyone else will be a member of either the dependency class or the vast bureaucracy that ministers to them. And, if you\u2019re wondering why every Big Government program assumes you\u2019re a feeble child, that\u2019s because a citizenry without \u201cwork and purpose\u201d is ultimately incompatible with liberty. The elites think a smart society will be wealthy enough to relieve the masses from the need to work. In reality, it would be neo-feudal, but with fatter, sicker peasants. It wouldn\u2019t just be \u201ceconomic inequality,\u201d but a far more profound kind, and seething with resentments.\n\nOne wouldn\u2019t expect the governing class to be as far-sighted as visionaries like Bezos. But it\u2019s hard to be visionary if you\u2019re pointing in the wrong direction. Which is why the signature achievement of Obama\u2019s \u201chope and change\u201d combines 1940s British public-health theories with 1970s Soviet supermarket delivery systems. But don\u2019t worry: Maybe one day soon, your needle-exchange clinic will be able to deliver by drone.
