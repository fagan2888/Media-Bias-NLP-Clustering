Last year's poorly-attended staging of Handel's \"Orlando\" at First United Methodist Church was artistically solid, and the Western staging of the baroque piece actually worked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014, the company's first full production was an atmospheric, haunting performance of Barber's \"Vanessa.\" The vast floor space at the Dairy Arts Center, which amply accommodated the staging and the orchestra, was a wonderful venue.\n\nBoulder Opera returns to the Dairy this week with Mozart's \"Don Giovanni,\" a far more \"standard\" opera than the previous two. One of the very greatest operas, \"Giovanni\" has universal themes that lend themselves well to re-imagination. Opera Colorado set it in the 1950s in 2013, for example.\n\nAndrew Crust conducts the Boulder Opera Company.

Crust told the Camera that Mozart's masterpiece was his choice. He said that Mozart's three operas with the great Italian librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte are satisfying and great fun to conduct.\n\n\"For the budget of Boulder Opera, and in a venue like the Dairy, it really is a perfect choice,\" Crust said.\n\nHe will direct a 13-piece orchestra that is \"basically the real deal, but slightly smaller,\" including single coverage on the string parts.\n\n\"The chamber-like setting of the venue brings the audience close to the music and the action, and the power really comes across,\" he said.\n\nStage director Michael Travis Risner comes to \"Don Giovanni\" with 20 years of operatic and theatrical experience. Risner attended high school in Broomfield and holds a master's degree in vocal performance and pedagogy from Colorado State University. He directed the Boulder Symphony's successful performance of Bizet's \"Carmen\" last year.\n\nRisner told the Camera that he had reimagined the story of the womanizing Don for the 21st century, and has added a strong psychological element.\n\nMichael Travis Risner serves as stage director for the Boulder Opera Company.

The Commendatore, whose murder at the hands of Giovanni opens the action, is a police chief.\n\n\"We're doing a lot with tech, using lighting and projections to establish an ambience,\" Risner said. \"We really want the focus to be on the characters, and the interplay of their relationships.\n\nCrust concurred, stating that \"the music and the text come first.\" Crust said that Mozart and Da Ponte laid bare the gamut of human emotions, including fear, excitement and a fair dose of humor. Risner emphasized that while the humor still comes through in places, like the famous \"catalog aria\" from Giovanni's servant Leporello, the approach is more serious than usual. This means that the opera's most serious (and problematic) characters, the Commendatore's daughter, Donna Anna, and her fianc\u00e9, Don Ottavio, are given weight and substance and can be treated in a fresh way.\n\n\"The concept is closely related to the Freudian concepts of id, ego and superego, with the Don representing the id, Leporello the ego, and Donna Anna the superego,\" Risner said.\n\nHe added that Da Ponte's designation of \"Dramma giocoso\" implies both comedy and tragedy. \"It's got real darkness, despite the levity.\"\n\nThe strong cast is filled with professionals and CU alumni, including baritone Malcolm Ulbrick as the Don and soprano Emily Murdock as Zerlina. Soprano Ruth Carver, whom Crust called \"a tremendously dramatic voice,\" plays Donna Anna, while tenor Pablo Romer\u00f3 is a noble Don Ottavio. Soprano Phoenix Gayles plays the much-abused Donna Elvira. Baritone Tom Sitzler is Leporello. Bass Andrew Potter, who made a strong impression in last season's \"Orlando,\" returns to play the Commendatore. Crust said that Potter, who is large in stature, is \"imposing\" in the role.\n\nAs for Mozart's score, it is mostly intact (including Elvira's great aria \"Mi trad\u00ec,\" a late Mozart addition), and will have almost all of the recitative. But in a provocative and possibly controversial decision, Mozart's joyous closing sextet, which follows the dramatic damnation scene and has always been somewhat problematic, is being cut.\n\n\"It just didn't fit my concept, especially a twist at the end,\" Risner said.\n\nThe opera thus closes with the heavy, imposing minor-key music of the damnation scene.\n\nAfter the two main performances in Boulder and Broomfield, Longmont's Dickens Opera House will host a smaller-scale production on April 22 with piano-only accompaniment and a cover cast, including Risner himself as Leporello.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_29743743/boulder-opera-stages-contemporary-psychological-giovanni", "sailthru.author": "By Kelly Dean Hansen \n \n  Camera Classical Music Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:29743743:view"}, "startDate": "2016-04-09T12:33:19-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Boulder Opera Company's annual spring opera has already gained a reputation for high quality and imaginative concepts.", "title": "Boulder Opera stages contemporary, psychological 'Giovanni'", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_29743743/boulder-opera-stages-contemporary-psychological-giovanni", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2016/0408/20160408__10DCPDON~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Entertainment", "modificationDate": "2016-04-09T12:45:48-0600", "endDate": "2026-04-08T17:34:03-0600", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Entertainment news, Boulder Colorado Entertainment news, Boulder Colorado news, Entertainment Boulder news, Entertainment Colorado news, US Entertainment news, world Entertainment news.", "byline": "By Kelly Dean", "pubDate": "2016-04-09T12:46:19-0600", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-09T12:33:19-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder Opera stages contemporary, psychological 'Giovanni'", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2016/0408/20160408__10DCPDON~1_300.jpg", "description": "Boulder Opera Company's annual spring opera has already gained a reputation for high quality and imaginative concepts.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_29743743/boulder-opera-stages-contemporary-psychological-giovanni", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Boulder Opera Company's annual spring opera has already gained a reputation for high quality and imaginative concepts.", "title": "Boulder Opera stages contemporary, psychological 'Giovanni'"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2016/0408/20160408__10DCPDON~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d75\"", "article_summary": "Click photo to enlarge \u00ab123\u00bb Malcolm Ulbrick as Don Giovanni and Emily Murdock as Zerlina in Boulder Opera Company's Don Giovanni.\nBoulder Opera returns to the Dairy this week with Mozart's \"Don Giovanni,\" a far more \"standard\" opera than the previous two.\n(Boulder Opera Company / Courtesy photo)If you go What: The Boulder Opera Company presents Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" When: 7 p.m. Friday in Boulder, Saturdayin Broomfield, and April 22 in Longmont Where: Dairy Arts Center's Gordon Gamm Theater, 2590 Walnut St., Boulder; Broomfield Auditorium, 3 Community Park Road; Dickens Opera House, 300 Main St., Longmont Cost: $20-$30 in Boulder; $25 in Broomfield and Longmont.\n(Boulder Opera Company / Courtesy photo)\"The Don is a white-collar professional of some kind,\" Risner said, \"and he owns a nightclub.\"\nAndrew Crust conducts the Boulder Opera Company."}
