January Jones flashes taut tummy in black crop top as she sips on a Coca-Cola while lounging in the sun in Mexico



It's Memorial Day weekend so she did what any other patriotic American would do on a national holiday.

Baring her midriff in a low-cut crop top, January Jones looked to be having a blast as she kicked back and relaxed in the sunshine with a refreshing Coca-Cola.



The 36-year-old actress shared the sunny snap on her Instagram on Sunday to show her followers that she celebrated in style.



Celebrations: January Jones took time to chill out for Memorial Day weekend and posted this photo to her Instagram on Sunday

Some may say the Mexican version of Coca Cola is better than the American recipe and it seems the Mad Men actress agrees as she captioned: 'Happy Memorial Day wknd USA! #mexicancoke'

The Mexican recipe is supposed to be better as it uses cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup and as an additional perk comes in the classic glass bottle packaging.

The blonde beauty wore a plunging top, which showed off her tiny waist and layered on a beige cardigan over the top.

Shading her face from the sun's rays, she donned a straw fedora and oversized sunglasses with silver trim.



Luxury: The 36-year-old was seen shopping in Beverly Hills on Friday in a beautiful magenta jacket The X-Men star accessorized with a dainty gold chain and matching gold bracelet. Although usually photographed with son Xander by her side, he was nowhere to be seen on Sunday.

Similarly on Friday as she shopped in Beverly Hills she opted to go solo without the two-year-old.

Meanwhile, January recently put her 1920's-era, 2,200-square-foot Los Feliz home on the market for $1,495,000. She is said to have purchased a $1.7 million home in Topanga Canyon.
