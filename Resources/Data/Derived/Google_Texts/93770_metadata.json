While most survival studies stop at five years, the California researchers took a longer look and found that almost a third of patients \u2014 including older women with advanced cancer \u2014 survive at least 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe common belief is that it\u2019s a uniformly fatal disease, but that is not correct. It\u2019s surprising how many women are surviving, even those given a poor prognosis,\u201d study coauthor Gary Leiserowitz, M.D., chief of the division of gynecologic oncology at UC Davis Medical Center, said in an interview. The study was published in the journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n\nThe Dana-Farber study examined what\u2019s been called \u201cthe gold standard\u201d for treating women with advanced ovarian cancer: a dual technique that administers chemotherapy drugs directly into the abdomen, where they can be sloshed around to kill any cancer cells remaining after surgery, as well as into a vein, the traditional method.\n\nNearly a decade ago, the National Cancer Institute issued a \u201cclinical advisory\u201d urging doctors to use this method on women with stage 3 ovarian cancer, meaning it had spread to the abdomen.\n\nThe advisory was issued after clinical trials found that the dual route could extend a woman\u2019s survival by 16 months or more. Ovarian cancer, which is difficult to detect early, kills more than 14,000 women a year, half of them older than 63.\n\nNine years after the advisory, researchers looked at how many ovarian cancer patients eligible for the dual technique had actually used it. The surprising result: only 41 percent.\n\n\u201cTragic,\u201d is how oncologist Maurie Markman, president of medicine and science at Cancer Treatment Centers of America, described the study\u2019s results to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cDisappointing. We need to do much better,\u201d the study\u2019s senior author, David O\u2019Malley, a gynecologic oncologist at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, told AARP.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, also examined whether the dual technique worked as well when used by physicians \u201cin the real world, outside of a clinical trial,\u201d as oncologist and study lead author Alexi Wright of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute put it.\n\nThe researchers looked at 823 women with stage 3 ovarian cancer who were treated at six top cancer centers across the country between 2003 and 2012. Of those who received the dual therapy, 81 percent were alive three years after treatment, compared with 71 percent of those who received chemotherapy only intravenously. The researchers also found that side effects from the dual therapy were less severe than had been reported in the clinical trials.\n\nSo why is the technique so underused? The reasons are complex, O\u2019Malley said.\n\n\u201cThere may be a bias against the [abdominal infusion technique] among physicians\u201d because it can be difficult to administer and it\u2019s not as convenient as traditional IV chemotherapy, he said. Patients and physicians also worry that the side effects from the abdominal chemo will be more toxic.\n\nGet discounts on prescriptions, health exams, eye care and more \u2014 AARP Member Advantages \u00bb\n\nUC Davis\u2019 Leiserowitz agrees. \u201cThere is a lot of discomfort for patients,\u201d he says, and even in the clinical trial, only 42 percent of women could finish all six cycles of abdominal chemo. Still, he notes, women who could tolerate even a few cycles did better than those who got IV chemo alone.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, doctors need more more training in how to do the procedure, and \u201cthey need to do a better job at educating patients\u201d about the benefits and what to expect, O\u2019Malley said.\n\nDoctors should also realize that the dual regimen can be personalized for each patient, he added. Modifications \u2014 such as lower chemo doses, giving patients more fluids and antinausea drugs, and other adjustments \u2014 can help patients better tolerate a treatment that could extend their survival.\n\nAs for patients, they should seek out a second opinion if they\u2019re unsure about the dual treatment. In addition, it\u2019s important to find a cancer center that specializes in ovarian cancer treatment and to discuss the surgery with an experienced gynecologic oncologist, O\u2019Malley advised.\n\nPhoto: Annebaek/iStock\n\nAlso of Interest\n\n\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Two new studies this week have upended some basic assumptions about ovarian cancer, questioning both the survival rate of this dangerous disease and the best type of chemotherapy to improve those survival odds.
