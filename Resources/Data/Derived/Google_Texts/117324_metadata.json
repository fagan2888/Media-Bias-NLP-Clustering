Twitter/Screenshot\n\nIn his first interview since being involved in a fatal crash on the New Jersey Turnpike in June 2014, comedian Tracy Morgan spoke with Today show anchor Matt Lauer Monday about the pain he says he will always feel after losing his fellow comedian and friend, James \"Jimmy Mack\" McNair.\n\nMorgan sustained broken bones and, as it was revealed later, a traumatic brain injury after a Walmart tractor trailer rear-ended his limousine. The truck driver, Kevin Roper, was driving over 20 miles over the speed limit and hadn\u2019t slept for more than 24 hours. Although Morgan continues on the mend physically, it's the emotional pain he says will make recovery most difficult. He learned of McNair's passing after awakening from his coma.\n\nOnce home, Morgan says he felt the weight of what had happened and began to watch the video of the crash as a way to accept the loss of his friend. \u201cI had to know what happened to my friend. I had to know. And I had to pay my respects, and that was my way,\u201d Morgan told Lauer of his decision to replay the footage.\n\nIn March, Walmart agreed to pay a $10 million settlement to McNair's family, which Morgan applauded in the interview. \u201cThey took full responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\nAt various points during the interview, Morgan became visibly emotional and continued to thank those who have been involved in his rehabilitation process, from therapists to nurses and doctors. He plans to continue rehab until his health is restored and then wants to get back to comedy.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m in front of you,\u201d Morgan told Lauer.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tracy, morgan, emotional, first, interview, deadly, crash, loss, my, friend, will, never, heal", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In an interview with Matt Lauer, Morgan spoke publicly for the first time since losing his friend in the deadly New Jersey Turnpike car crash last June.", "title": "Tracy Morgan Emotional In 1st Interview Since Deadly Crash [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/tracy-morgan-emotional-first-interview-deadly-crash-loss-my-friend-will-never-heal-335928", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/06/01/tracy-morgan-interview.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In an interview with Matt Lauer, Morgan spoke publicly for the first time since losing his friend in the deadly New Jersey Turnpike car crash last June.", "title": "Tracy Morgan Emotional In 1st Interview Since Deadly Crash [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/tracy-morgan-emotional-first-interview-deadly-crash-loss-my-friend-will-never-heal-335928", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/06/01/tracy-morgan-interview.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/01/tracy-morgan-interview.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-01T16:31:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-01T16:31:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In an interview with Matt Lauer, Morgan spoke publicly for the first time since losing his friend in the deadly New Jersey Turnpike car crash last June."}, "article_summary": "In an interview with Matt Lauer, Morgan spoke publicly for the first time since losing his friend in the deadly New Jersey Turnpike car crash last June.\nAt various points during the interview, Morgan became visibly emotional and continued to thank those who have been involved in his rehabilitation process, from therapists to nurses and doctors.\nIn March, Walmart agreed to pay a $10 million settlement to McNair's family, which Morgan applauded in the interview.\nAlthough Morgan continues on the mend physically, it's the emotional pain he says will make recovery most difficult.\nAnd I had to pay my respects, and that was my way,\u201d Morgan told Lauer of his decision to replay the footage."}
