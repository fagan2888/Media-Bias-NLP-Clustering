For a family of four, 200 percent of the federal poverty level is $48,500.\n\nLee Memorial's current policy also provides a 40 percent discount off a hospital bill when a patient's income is between 200 percent and 300 percent of the poverty limit. For a single person, the maximum income is $35,310; for a family of four, the maximum is $72,750.\n\nA 30 percent discount is available now for a single person whose income ranges from $35,310 and $47,080, and for a family of four, it applies with an income range of $72,750 and $97,000\n\nThe updated policy taking effect Jan. 1 eliminates the 40 percent and 30 percent discounts. An 80 percent discount will apply for anyone with income between 200 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. For a single person, the income range is $23,540 to $47,080. For a family of four, it is $48,500 to $97,000.\n\n\"It's a very generous policy,\" Rose said.\n\nThe charity care policy also applies to employed physicians and their care of patients for hospital-based services, she said.\n\nBoard member Nancy McGovern wanted to know which residents are eligible for charity care and discounts and whether the system would screen people in the United States illegally.\n\nThe policy applies to anyone who lives in the Southwest Florida market which Lee Memorial serves, and staff members do not screen to see if someone is in the country illegally, said Mary McGillicuddy, Lee Memorial's in-house attorney.\n\n\"If somebody presents, we got them,\" Jim Nathan, president of Lee Memorial, said. \"If they don't have any money, they don't have any money.\"\n\nThe NCH Healthcare System in Collier County, also a nonprofit hospital, updated its charity care policy in March 2015 to ensure compliance with the health reform law, spokeswoman Debbie Curry said in a statement.\n\n\"To ensure compliance, NCH has established written charity, financial assistance, and emergency medical care policies,\" she said. \"NCH makes every effort to determine if an individual is eligible for assistance under the hospital's charity and financial assistance policies. In addition, NCH assists the uninsured or underinsured patients to qualify for Medicaid or other public assistance programs.\"", "article_metadata": {"title": "New rules give uninsured, low-income patients a break", "og": {"url": "http://www.naplesnews.com/news/health/new-rules-give-uninsured-low-income-patients-a-break-24edda9e-aac3-5de4-e053-0100007f4ffd-351943861.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/cp_goltour006_9460247_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 427}, "type": "article", "description": "<br /><br />Uninsured and low-income patients who get medical care at the public hospitals run by the Lee Memorial Health System will get a more generous discount off their medical bills, thanks to a revised financial assistance policy.<br />", "title": "New rules give uninsured, low-income patients a break"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/cp_goltour006_9460247_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "title": "New rules give uninsured, low-income patients a break", "description": "<br /><br />Uninsured and low-income patients who get medical care at the public hospitals run by the Lee Memorial Health System will get a more generous discount off their medical bills, thanks to a revised financial assistance policy.<br />", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ndn"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ndn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The charity care policy also applies to employed physicians and their care of patients for hospital-based services, she said.\nFor a single person, 200 percent of the federal poverty level is income limit at $23,540, according to 2015 federal poverty guidelines.\nThe elected board of directors for Lee Memorial approved the revisions Thursday and the changes will take effect Jan. 1.\nA worker washes glass railings Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2014 at the Golisano Children's Hospital of Southwest Florida, part of Lee Memorial Health System.\nFor a family of four, 200 percent of the federal poverty level is $48,500."}
