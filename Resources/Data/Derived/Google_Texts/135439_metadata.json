In a typical corporate inversion, a U.S. firm buys a smaller company in a country whose tax laws it finds favorable. Then, the merged companies announce that they are moving their headquarters to the second country, which allows profits earned outside the U.S to be repatriated at the lower rate.\n\nHowever, when Reuters analyzed the tax liability of half a dozen U.S. firms that entered inversion deals, the results undercut the general consensus. The study looked at Medtronic, Applied Materials, Steris, Mylan, C&J Energy Services, and Burger King, and found that most of them weren\u2019t paying anything near the 35 percent top rate.\n\nRelated: HSBC Admits It Helped Wealthy Customers Dodge Taxes\n\nThe companies\u2019 average effective tax rate, at 20.3 percent, was nearly 15 percentage points lower than the top U.S. rate. And some of the companies relocated to countries with rates higher than those they had been paying in the U.S. The Pharmaceuticals firm Mylan, for instance, moved its headquarters to the Netherlands, where companies pay a 25 percent rate, despite that fact that its U.S. tax liability had not topped 20 percent for the past several years.\n\nThe study did not look companies\u2019 total tax liability when state and local taxes were added to federal rates.\n\nThe study highlights a fact about the U.S. tax system that is often lost in debates about tax rates \u2013 its complexity. Chock full of loopholes, deductions, exclusions and refunds, the U.S. corporate tax code is susceptible to exploitation by smart tax planners and accountants, who are typically able to reduce firms\u2019 liability substantially.\n\nFamously, some large U.S. firms often have a negative tax liability \u2013 meaning that the government pays them at tax time.\n\nRelated: Obama Juggles the Numbers to Save SSDI Benefits\n\nBoth President Obama and Republican leaders in Congress have called for an overhaul of the U.S. tax code, which hasn\u2019t been substantially overhauled since 1986, and the prevalence of inversions in the past few years is often cited as evidence for the need.\n\nWhile the findings won\u2019t likely sink the chances of tax reform getting done, they do take away one of the most high profile arguments made by those arguing that the need is urgent.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A study by Reuters concludes that changes to the tax laws being suggested by the Obama administration would do little to entice companies to keep their headquarters in the United States.", "title": "Report Claims Tax Law Changes Won\u2019t Keep Companies in U.S.", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/09/Report-Claims-Tax-Law-Changes-Won-t-Keep-Companies-US", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142011_taxes_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/09/Report-Claims-Tax-Law-Changes-Won-t-Keep-Companies-US", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142011_taxes_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A study by Reuters concludes that changes to the tax laws being suggested by the Obama administration would do little to entice companies to keep their headquarters in the United States.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Famously, some large U.S. firms often have a negative tax liability \u2013 meaning that the government pays them at tax time.\nThe study highlights a fact about the U.S. tax system that is often lost in debates about tax rates \u2013 its complexity.\nThe study did not look companies\u2019 total tax liability when state and local taxes were added to federal rates.\nThe prevailing wisdom is that the U.S. federal corporate tax rate which, with a top bracket of 35 percent, is the largest in the developed world, was driving companies overseas.\nHowever, when Reuters analyzed the tax liability of half a dozen U.S. firms that entered inversion deals, the results undercut the general consensus."}
