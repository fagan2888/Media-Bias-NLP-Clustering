The foundation provided a recording of the call. [\u2026] Mr. Ryan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the GOP vice presidential nominee in 2012, asked the state legislators to hold firm and promised them congressional Republicans would have alternative health-care legislation\u2014with an official cost estimate\u2014introduced by June 20. The bill, he said, would revive lower-cost, limited coverage insurance plans in states that didn't want their own exchanges. Currently, 37 states use HealthCare.gov. \"If people blink and if people say this political pressure is too great, I'm just going to sign up for a state-based exchange and put my constituents in Obamacare, then this opportunity will slip through your fingers,\" he said.\n\nunicorn\n\nIf the Supreme Court strikes down subsidies to states using the federal health insurance exchanges, Rep. Paul Ryan was asked , should they set up their own exchanges to prevent people from losing their insurance?And if you really believe congressional Republicans are going to have a bill by June 20\u2014and that they could actuallythat bill? Well, he's got a bridge he'd like to sell you, too. Ryan told the legislators that he had talked to the plaintiffs' lawyer in the case\u2014Michael Carvin\u2014who told him he was convinced that the court would strike down the subsidies and that \"Justice Samuel Alito, in particular, was likely to ensure any decision voiding the credits would have a delayed effect,\" giving Republicans time to produce areplacement plan.\n\nBy the way, what Republicans in Congress are most enthusiastic about, Ryan told the group, is \"allowing states to strip some of the health law\u2019s requirements that insurance plans must provide certain minimum benefits and a requirement that insurers sell to all customers equally regardless of their medical history.\" In other words, returning to the pre-Obamacare status quo.
