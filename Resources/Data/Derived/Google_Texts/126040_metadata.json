As first lady in the 1990s, she pioneered efforts for universal health insurance \u2014 which didn\u2019t succeed, but were followed by the Affordable Care Act. As a U.S. senator from New York state, she championed progressive causes to help average American families. As secretary of state, she dealt commendably with complex world conditions and the rise of dangerous terrorism.\n\nMore than all other aspirants in this year\u2019s colorful field, we think Clinton has wisdom, judgment and presidential stature to lead the world\u2019s greatest superpower. Therefore, we endorse her for the Democratic nomination in West Virginia\u2019s May 10 primary election.\n\nClinton is the only candidate who speaks specifically to the economic hardship felt by West Virginia families and communities as the coal industry shrinks. She would invest federal money in a way similar to what President Obama has proposed to help people and towns get through the transition and on to more prosperous times.\n\nMore than 50 U.S. newspapers have endorsed Clinton \u2014 most of them saying that Democratic socialist challenger Bernie Sanders is an appealing idealist, but with little chance of achieving tangible improvements in the cesspool of Washington politics.\n\nFor example, the Hartford Courant said Clinton is a practical leader who is able to \u201csolve problems, whether negotiating a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas or getting Republican support for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\u201d It added:\n\n\u201cMrs. Clinton has turned dreams into laws. She has fought for the underclass, championing the causes of women and children around the world. Her grasp of foreign policy is deep. ... Given her resume, few people today are more qualified for the Oval Office than she is.\u201d\n\nThe tabloid New York Daily News blared:\n\n\u201cVote Hillary Clinton: Her plans to give working- and middle-class Americans a fighting chance at rising incomes are far superior to Bernie Sanders\u2019.\u201d It said:\n\n\u201cClinton would enable every student to graduate debt-free from public higher education. \u2026 She would use substantial tax hikes on the wealthy and breaks for the middle class both to tilt the scales away from the rich and to jump-start the economy by giving many others more money to spend. ... Big businesses would face heavy penalties for moving money abroad to avoid corporate taxes \u2026 . Clinton\u2019s proposals are shaped for the world in which we live, not the world in which we might wish to live.\u201d\n\nWe welcome the prospect of America\u2019s first female president. We urge West Virginia Democrats to choose her on May 10.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "title": "With \u2018Star Wars\u2019 album release, Wilco proves it\u2019s still a rebel", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160526/GZ0607/160529692/AR/0/AR-160529692.jpg", "url": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/ae-music/20160526/with-star-wars-album-release-wilco-proves-its-still-a-rebel", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "description": "See attached", "creator": "@wvgazettemail", "image": {"src": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160526/GZ0607/160529692/AR/0/AR-160529692.jpg"}, "title": "With \u2018Star Wars\u2019 album release, Wilco proves it\u2019s still a rebel", "site": "@wvgazettemail", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-site-verification": "1bw05nOwAmeGwNrWfrMp361tiStYbQbOwqqj_P_-LVA", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/charlestongazettemail"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "dc.title": "With \u2018Star Wars\u2019 album release, Wilco proves it\u2019s still a rebel"}, "article_summary": "We urge West Virginia Democrats to choose her on May 10.\nAs a U.S. senator from New York state, she championed progressive causes to help average American families.\nThe clear answer in 2016 is Hillary Clinton.\nClinton is the only candidate who speaks specifically to the economic hardship felt by West Virginia families and communities as the coal industry shrinks.\nAs secretary of state, she dealt commendably with complex world conditions and the rise of dangerous terrorism."}
