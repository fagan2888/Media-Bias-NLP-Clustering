Last week that number jumped to 176.\n\nBy Thursday, this week's total had already tripled to over 450 cases.\n\nEpidemiologist Patrick Burke with the Cincinnati Department of Health said the situation is quite as bad north of the Ohio River but they have seen a recent spike.\n\nThere\u2019ve been 64 influenza-associated hospitalizations among residents of Cincinnati between Dec. 1 and Dec. 17. That\u2019s a seven-fold increase over November. There were just nine hospitalizes due to the flu during the entire month.\n\nThe illness is affecting people across all age groups.\n\n\u201cI've been in the Northern Kentucky/Cincinnati area for 15 years and I have never seen a flu season hit this hard,\" said Dr. Chuck Kelly of St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Edgewood, Kentucky. He added that an unrelated stomach bug that\u2019s making the rounds is adding to the patient count.\n\nBoth illnesses are highly contagious.\n\nDr. Lynn Saddler, district director for the Northern Kentucky Health Department, drafted a letter being sent to all Northern Kentucky school districts so administrators know how to handle the situation.\n\n\"Most kids are going to be out of school after (Friday for winter break). That will help with stopping the transmission, but while the kids are out from school, we'd like them to make sure they do a good, thorough cleaning of surfaces,\u201d she said.\n\nThat's what they're doing at Kenton County Schools \u2013 spraying disinfectant on surfaces kids tend to touch and wiping them down several times a day. They're also notifying parents with an auto-call system to keep them in the loop about the situation.\n\nAbove all, it's important to be smart and considerate when dealing with the flu, so if you're not feeling way, stay home.", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "The flu is hitting the Tri-State hard and an additional stomach bug is making it worse.", "author": "WCPO Staff", "og": {"site_name": "WCPO", "description": "The flu is hitting the Tri-State hard and an additional stomach bug is making it worse.", "title": "VIDEO: Flu cases climbing in Northern Kentucky", "url": "http://www.wcpo.com/news/health/video-flu-cases-climbing-in-northern-kentucky", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media2.wcpo.com/photo/2014/12/19/Flu_bug_hitting_Northern_Kentucky_hard_2379690000_11417514_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 481447058, "iphone": 487285628}}, "site": "@wcpo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "shortHeadline": "VIDEO: Flu cases climbing in Northern Kentucky", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.wcpo.com,recp.mkt32.net", "p": {"domain_verify": "a78af9666708be3dd31e4873ef3fe3bb"}, "fb": {"app_id": 158963910840295}, "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "false", "author": "WCPO Staff"}, "keywords": "Health,Homepage Showcase,Mobile Showcase,News,Tablet Showcase,Most Recent,Region Northern Kentucky", "google-site-verification": "sm7O5zR5rUkxnJfpcpz3wyw0vAlwmh13H5_FvJEfM-g", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WCPO9", "section": "Health", "published_time": "2014-12-19T08:15:02+0000", "modified_time": "2014-12-19T08:15:02+0000", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/"}, "hasVideo": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd7a\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Lynn Saddler, district director for the Northern Kentucky Health Department, drafted a letter being sent to all Northern Kentucky school districts so administrators know how to handle the situation.\nThe Northern Kentucky Health Department had just five confirmed cases in November.\nThat's what they're doing at Kenton County Schools \u2013 spraying disinfectant on surfaces kids tend to touch and wiping them down several times a day.\nAbove all, it's important to be smart and considerate when dealing with the flu, so if you're not feeling way, stay home.\nFlu season is hitting the Tri-State hard and an additional stomach bug is making it even worse."}
