The group purchased the loans for pennies on the dollar from the notorious for-profit Everest College. And it\u2019s only the beginning \u2013according to Rolling Jubilee\u2019s website, they\u2019ve forgiven more than $18.5 million in debt, much of it medical, on only $701,000 raised.\n\nSuch activism cannot be praised enough. It\u2019s entirely selfless, brings important issues to light and directly aids many Americans. But it can only go so far. The total national debt, both public and private, is a preposterous $60 trillion. If Rolling Jubilee succeeded in wiping out $4 million of that total every day, it would take more than 41,000 years for America to be debt-free. Even if they focused only on, say, mortgages, it would take more than 9,000 years.\n\nOf course, a lot more than $4 million moves through the American economy every day. But the numbers still help illustrate the obvious: something much more radical has to be done, a fact that Rolling Jubilee organizer Astra Taylor concedes. In a recent New Yorker profile, Taylor said, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to buy this debt. It\u2019s treating a symptom without ever treating the disease.\u201d\n\nThe problem of debt is far beyond the scope of any one person or organization to take care of. Acting en masse, however, there is a great deal Americans can do. The best solution to the student loan crisis is a very elegant and simple one: stage a collective refusal to make good on student loan debt. Such a boycotting of payments is well within the power, not to mention the rights, of the American citizenry, and it makes good sense to take such a collective action.\n\nIn the past, activists have resisted paying taxes on the basis of disagreement with government policies. Among the signatories of a 1968 refusal to pay a Vietnam War tax were Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn and Gloria Steinem, but the practice dates back centuries \u2013 Jesus\u2019s famous \u201cRender unto Caesar\u201d quote relates to the idea. Refusing to pay student loan debt is a similar form of resistance.\n\nThe total national student loan debt is more than $1.2 trillion, the bulk of which \u2013 about $1 trillion \u2013 is owed by students to the federal government. According to a 2013 study, the average debt held by a graduate in 2012 was almost $30,000. Forty million young Americans are saddled with this burden and 7 million of them have defaulted already.\n\nTo slap such exorbitant debt on new graduates, especially in this economy, is an aggressive undermining of human rights. And the punishment for not paying, for those who either can\u2019t find work or are courageous enough to pursue their dreams despite their debt, can be severe: ruined credit, wage garnishment (for those lucky enough to have wages), vicious harassment from collectors and enormous fees as collection of the debt is outsourced to private entities. All of this effectively penalizes poverty. With such immense pressure funneling millions of graduates into whatever menial job they can find in order to begin making payments, student loan debt has been compared to a modern form of indentured servitude.\n\nAnd there is no indication that help is forthcoming from Washington. For all his talk and campaign promises, the most President Obama has done to offer relief is to lower interest rates from 6.8 percent to 4.66 percent, a paltry offering that will be all but undone as the rates go back up over the next couple of years. Meanwhile, the Department of Education outsources a great deal of its debt collection to private companies that aggressively bully, intimidate, harass and lie to consumers in an attempt to retrieve the money. Far from helping, this \u201cgovernment of the people\u201d has sent the most bloodthirsty financial bulldogs from the corporate sector after their own weary, broke citizens.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Young people and their future families are being bankrupted.
