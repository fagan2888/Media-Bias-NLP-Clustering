Robert Creamer, who served time for fraud and tax charges, and who is married to Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), is coordinating pro-Iran efforts through the liberal Ploughshares group, which held a conference call with President Barack Obama\u2019s aides earlier this week, as reported by Adam Kredo of the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nKredo obtained an audio recording of the call. \u201cProgressive leaders on the call told participants to prepare for a \u2018real war\u2019 and repeatedly declared that \u201cthe other side will go crazy\u201d in the coming days,\u201d he reported.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWhite House officials stressed \u201cthe importance of this to the president,\u201d and Creamer told activists they should be \u201cblitzing the hell out of the Hill,\u201d particularly Democrats. His wife, self-styled \u201cpro-Israel\u201d Rep. Schakowsky, reportedly shouted her encouragement during the call.\n\nCreamer rose to public attention in 2009, when Breitbart News revealed that he had written the political blueprint for passing Obamacare while serving time in federal prison. Anticipating the election of a \u201cprogressive\u201d president in 2008, Creamer had advised a campaign for \u201cuniversal health care\u201d that would serve as the first of several radical policy changes aimed at transforming America and the world. Creamer, a community organizing guru in Chicago, had advised the Obama campaign upon leaving prison.\n\nWriting in Israel Hayom, Richard Baehr notes that Creamer and fellow activists aim to reduce the Iran deal to political terms: \u201cThis is to be all about party loyalty, \u200eand supporting the president and his agenda, because this is very \u200eimportant to him,\u201d Baehr notes. \u201cIn time, after the critics make their case, the deal \u200ewill likely be sold as a choice between war and peace\u2026\u201d.\n\nGiven that the emerging deal favors Iran, Baehr adds, the left-wing activists backed by the White House are effectively lobbying for the regime.\n\nThe author ran against Schakowsky in 2010.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Convicted Felon Leads Obama-Backed Effort to Lobby for Iran Deal", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Convicted Felon Leads Obama-Backed Effort to Lobby for Iran Deal", "title": "Convicted Felon Leads Obama-Backed Effort to Lobby for Iran Deal - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-08-at-4.52.12-AM.png", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-07-08T05:04:38-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/08/convicted-felon-leads-white-house-backed-effort-to-lobby-for-iran-deal/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Convicted Felon Leads Obama-Backed Effort to Lobby for Iran Deal", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-08-at-4.52.12-AM.png", "title": "Convicted Felon Leads Obama-Backed Effort to Lobby for Iran Deal - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "adam kredo, iran deal, Jan Schakowsky, nuclear Iran, obama iran, robert creamer, Vienna,Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-07-08T04:53:16-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-07-08T05:04:38-07:00", "tag": "Vienna", "categories": "Big Government,National Security,Breitbart Jerusalem"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Given that the emerging deal favors Iran, Baehr adds, the left-wing activists backed by the White House are effectively lobbying for the regime.\nHis wife, self-styled \u201cpro-Israel\u201d Rep.
