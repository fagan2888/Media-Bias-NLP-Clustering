What the duck, right?\n\nJulianne Hough\n\n\n\nWhile actress and dancer Julianne Hough typically keeps a low profile, that all changed on Halloween night when she donned blackface as part of her costume. Hough went as \"Crazy Eyes\", a character from the hit show \"Orange is the New Black,\" and used bronzer and other make-up items to darken her complexion.\n\nAfter receiving angry messages from Twitter users, Hough issued an apology about the costume, tweeting \"I am a huge fan of the show Orange Is the New black, actress Uzo Aduba, and the character she has created. It certainly was never my intention to be disrespectful or demeaning to anyone in any way. I realize my costume hurt and offended people and I truly apologize.\"\n\nPaula Deen\n\n\n\nAfter being sued by a former employee, butter lovin' Paula Deen admitted to using the \"n-word\" during a deposition taken in May of this year. Following the admission and public outcry, Deen released an apology video on YouTube, saying \"inappropriate, hurtful language is totally unacceptable.\"\n\nThe apology came too late for The Food Network though, which announced it would not be renewing Deen's contract when it expired that month. The discrimination lawsuit was dismissed in August by a federal judge after a settlement was reached, but the damage was already done, ya'll.\n\nLil Wayne\n\nIn June of 2013, rapper Lil Wayne was videotaped trampling an American flag while filming the music video for his song \"God Bless Amerika\" in New Orleans. While the public was outraged by the act, the rapper said it was completely unintentional, tweeting \"I didn't step on the flag on purpose! It's a scene in a video where the flag drops behind me and after it drop it's just there as I perform.\"\n\nAlec Baldwin\n\nIn November, actor Alec Baldwin lost his place at the MSNBC desk after yelling a gay slur at a paparazzi cameraman and videographer. While Baldwin's representative insisted the actor wasn't fired from his show, \"Up Late with Alec Baldwin,\" the decision to suspend the talk show came two weeks after video of Baldwin's exchange was posted on TMZ.com.\n\nJustin Bieber\n\nWhile singer Justin Bieber has experienced a fall from his squeaky clean appearance over the past few years, he made waves in April after he left a note at Amsterdam's Anne Frank House saying that \"Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.\" The comment received a lot of criticism in the following weeks, despite Frank's stepsister;s support of it. Bieber has yet to release an official statement on the matter.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\n\n\n\nOf course, celebrities aren't the only ones that might want to think before they speak. President Barack Obama has received plenty of heat this year following his infamous \"if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your healthcare plan, period\" statement in 2010.\n\nWhile the statement may have been technically true for some people, it probably should have included an asterisk at the end to indicate a mountain of fine print. The \"grandfather\" clause of the Affordable Care Act maintains that those who signed up for their insurance plan before the act went into effect can keep their same plan. However, many others had their plans canceled only to be offered Affordable Care Act compliant plans at higher premiums.\n\nOf course, those who received the \"your current plan will be discontinued effective January 1, 2014, and you will need to select a new plan by the end of December to avoid any interruption in coverage\" letters from various insurance companies know all about that.\n\nBarry Hinson\n\n\n\nSouthern Illinois basketball coach Barry Hinson was also in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons this year after he went on a 6-minute rant following a game loss. During the rant, he called out players for being \"absolutely awful,\" and screamed comments about his wife being a better basketball player, among other things.\n\nHinson later went on \"The Dan Patrick Show\" to apologize for the comments, sorta. Well, he said he probably shouldn't have called anyone out by name and his wife may not be that good at basketball. Okay, so he really didn't apologize all that much, but he, so far, hasn't lost his job.\n\nKanye West\n\n\n\nRapper Kanye West hasn't let anyone down when it comes to starting controversy this year. Whether it was he decision to wear the confederate flag in November, have a look-a-like Jesus appear on stage with him during a concert in October or name his album 'Yeezus,' West created a storm of public outcry and dispute in 2013.\n\n\"React how you want. Any energy is good energy,\" said West in regards to the Confederate flag debacle. \"You know the Confederate flag represented slavery in a way -- that's my abstract take on what I know about it. So I made the song 'New Slaves.' So I took the Confederate flag and made it my flag. It's my flag. Now what are you going to do?\"\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Amber Sutton | asutton@al.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "entertainment", "title": "Phil Robertson of 'Duck Dynasty' and 8 other controversial celebrities of 2013 (photos)", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "If you need proof, look no farther than this gang of celebrities, who have experienced first-hand just how much damage a simple comment or action can cause.\n\nWhether they were fired, suspended, lost the public's trust or were simply just removed from the general population's good graces, these public figures all suffered from a controversial 2013.", "title": "Phil Robertson of 'Duck Dynasty' and 8 other controversial celebrities of 2013 (photos)", "url": "http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/12/they_said_what_controversial_c.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/entertainment_impact/photo/13961930-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you need proof, look no farther than this gang of celebrities, who have experienced first-hand just how much damage a simple comment or action can cause.\n\nWhether they were fired, suspended, lost the public's trust or were simply just removed from the general population's good graces, these public figures all suffered from a controversial 2013.", "title": "Phil Robertson of 'Duck Dynasty' and 8 other controversial celebrities of 2013 (photos)", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/entertainment_impact/photo/13961930-large.jpg", "creator": "@AmberlaSutton/", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, December 19, 2013, 10:39 AM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, December 19, 2013, 10:38 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "If you need proof, look no farther than this gang of celebrities, who have experienced first-hand just how much damage a simple comment or action can cause.
