People were really dragging their butts in Times Square on Wednesday.

That's because Guinness World Records, in collaboration with truTV, invited the public to come attempt to break world records that included "most seated free throws in one minute," "fastest time for two people to make a bed" and -- most embarrassingly for participants -- the "fastest 20-meter butt scoot."

That last record was broken Wednesday afternoon by Samuel Jackson, (no, not THAT Samuel Jackson) a professional vocalist from the Bronx. Jackson scooted 20 meters on his butt -- no hands allowed -- in 20.41 seconds, shattering the earlier record of 22.03 seconds.

Jackson failed to beat the record on his first attempt, but decided to give it another go. “I was like ‘let me take off my glasses, take off my jacket’ and then I just kind of focused on going, going, going, and that was it,” he told The Epoch Times.

A couple of HuffPost reporters attempted to beat some records, too, but with far less successful results:

The event kicked off the new season of truTV's series "Guinness World Records Unleashed," which aired Thursday.

This has been a big past few weeks for Guinness World Record holders. Last month, the world's tallest man, 8-foot-3 Sultan Kosen, tied the knot in Mardin, Turkey.

His bride, 5-foot-9 Merve Dibo, told Turkey's state-run news agency, "I found the love of my life."
