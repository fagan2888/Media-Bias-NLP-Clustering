It was attached to the heart wall and can be repositioned if needed, Minneapolis-based Medtronic said.\n\nAnd it marks the start of a competition for what could be a huge market for such devices. In October, Medtronic\u2019s crosstown rival, St. Paul, Minn.-based St. Jude Medical Inc. /quotes/zigman/242119/delayed /quotes/nls/stj STJ , purchased Nanostim Inc., a private manufacturer of a similar device that is also implanted through the femoral vein.\n\nBut it may be a while before we see either of these devices in the U.S. Nanostim\u2019s device is being readied for European markets but has yet to win approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA, however, has given conditional approval for an exemption granted to what are known as \u201cinvestigational\u201d devices.\n\nMeanwhile, Medtronic\u2019s pacemaker, which it says is comparable in size to a large vitamin, has been granted investigational status worldwide.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nObamacare signups accelerate in California\n\nNew Obamacare wrinkle: Deadline is pushed back on early payments\n\nPet biotech firm up as much as 80% on first trading day", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-12-13T10:58:25-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "A product development earlier this week may be worth noting: Medtronic says it has implanted the world's smallest pacemaker without having to perform surgery.", "title": "Medtronic implants tiny pacemaker without using surgical procedure", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/12/13/medtronic-implants-tiny-pacemaker-without-using-surgical-procedure/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BQ906_medtro_ME_20131213104426.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Medical device makers,Medtronic Inc.,pacemakers,St. Jude Medical Inc.,Transcatheter heart valves", "article.headline": "Medtronic implants tiny pacemaker without using surgical procedure", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Medical device makers,Medtronic Inc.,pacemakers,St. Jude Medical Inc.,Transcatheter heart valves", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "A product development earlier this week may be worth noting: Medtronic says it has implanted the world's smallest pacemaker without having to perform surgery.", "article.published": "2013-12-13T10:58:25-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/12/13/medtronic-implants-tiny-pacemaker-without-using-surgical-procedure/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "A product development earlier this week may be worth noting: Medtronic says it has implanted the world's smallest pacemaker without having to perform surgery.", "title": "Medtronic implants tiny pacemaker without using surgical procedure", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/12/13/medtronic-implants-tiny-pacemaker-without-using-surgical-procedure/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DR328_mw_soc_NS_20150801233302.png", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1722", "article.updated": "2013-12-13T11:01:51-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Medtronic Medtronic video still shows pacemaker at right.\nMeanwhile, Medtronic\u2019s pacemaker, which it says is comparable in size to a large vitamin, has been granted investigational status worldwide.\nMedical-device giant Medtronic Inc. /quotes/zigman/233680/delayed /quotes/nls/mdt MDT announced on Monday that it implanted the world\u2019s smallest pacemaker without surgery into a patient in Austria.\nIt was attached to the heart wall and can be repositioned if needed, Minneapolis-based Medtronic said.\nThe device, called a Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, was inserted through the femoral vein via a catheter."}
