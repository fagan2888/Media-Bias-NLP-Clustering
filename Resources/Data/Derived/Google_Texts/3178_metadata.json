The massive dataset includes 4.2 million individual payments made to physicians (including dentists) for things like meals, consulting fees and royalty payments for devices they have helped invent. The new data includes 360,000 doctors by name.\n\nIn the days leading up the release of the information, physician groups mobilized to argue that the data, which the 2010 Affordable Care Act mandates be disclosed, is incomplete and misleading. For their part, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversaw the release, states that, \u201cJust because there are financial ties doesn\u2019t mean that anyone is doing anything wrong.\u201d CMS withheld the names of the recipients on 40 percent of the payments over concerns about data quality.\n\nUsing the following tool, you can search for any physician in the database by last name and see any gifts, consulting fees, paid travel, or other payment he or she received between August and December of 2013.\n\nCritics of this sort of disclosure are quick to point out that there are many positive benefits to relationships between drug and device companies, which produce new life-saving treatments every year, and the doctors who get those treatments to patients who need them. Meanwhile, some research suggests that even cursory relationships with industry do affect a doctor\u2019s behavior.\n\nAmong those doctors who were identified, orthopedic surgeons were by far the most compensated. They account for 11 of the 18 physicians who received over $1 million over the five covered months in the data:\n\nName Specialty Location Amount Stephen S Burkhart Orthopaedic Surgery San Antonio, TX $7,356,276 Chitranjan S.

In some cases, doctors are receiving thousands of dollars in royalties for these devices because they have a stake in the intellectual property rights. (This is separate from owning part a stake in the company itself, which is reported separately.)\n\nThe picture of which pharmaceutical company pays doctors the most is less clear because payments are often recorded under the name of the subsidiary company making the payment. DePuy Synthes, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson that manufactures orthopedic and neurosurgery devices, tops the list of companies making payments to doctors during the period with $34.5 million. Arthrex, Inc., a manufacturer of orthopedic surgical supplies, came in second with $15.5 million. Astra Zeneca and Pfizer are also among the top 10 with $15.3 million and $10.01 million respectively. This analysis does not include anonymized payments.\n\nCompany Total Payments State DePuy Synthes Sales Inc. $34,542,816 Massachusetts Arthrex, Inc. $15,506,504 Florida AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP $15,385,817 Deleware Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc $13,778,926 Pennsylvania Smith & Nephew, Inc. $12,020,808 Tennessee Forest Laboratories, Inc. $10,398,208 California Pfizer Inc. $10,017,632 New York Allergan Inc. $9,709,723 California Biomet, Inc. $9,675,365 Florida Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc. $9,238,383 Maryland\n\nOf all payments, $109 million is documented as \u201ccompensation for services other than consulting, including serving as faculty or as a speaker at a venue other than a continuing education program.\u201d Consulting fees accounted for $91 million. Food and beverages accounted for $57.4 million, and travel and lodging accounted for $45 million. Because the disclosures require that the location of travel be disclosures, we are able to build a picture of where companies like to fly doctors for conferences, speeches, meetings, and other events:\n\nCity No. of Payments Total Payments Chicago 7098 $2,182,736 New York 5757 $2,100,144 Dallas 5453 $1,333,772 Atlanta 4087 $1,056,913 Miami 3081 $930,366 San Diego 2751 $717,280 San Francisco 2696 $1,022,034 Las Vegas 2503 $750,983 Philadelphia 2478 $597,493 Houston 2368 $623,391\n\nData that was withheld because of unresolved disputes will be published in future disclosures.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Use this search tool to find out", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Use this search tool to find out", "title": "How Much Money Does Your Doctor Get From Medical Companies?", "url": "http://time.com/3453649/doctors-drug-company-search-tool/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/medical-money-doctor.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/medical-money-doctor.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "How Much Money Does Your Doctor Get From Medical Companies?", "description": "Use this search tool to find out", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde802\"", "article_summary": "The massive dataset includes 4.2 million individual payments made to physicians (including dentists) for things like meals, consulting fees and royalty payments for devices they have helped invent.\nDePuy Synthes, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson that manufactures orthopedic and neurosurgery devices, tops the list of companies making payments to doctors during the period with $34.5 million.\nDoctors received $3.5 billion from pharmaceutical companies and device makers over a five month period in 2013, according to figures the federal government released this week.\nAstra Zeneca and Pfizer are also among the top 10 with $15.3 million and $10.01 million respectively.\nThe picture of which pharmaceutical company pays doctors the most is less clear because payments are often recorded under the name of the subsidiary company making the payment."}
