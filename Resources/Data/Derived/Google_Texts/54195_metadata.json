As Policy Watch\u2019s courts and law reporter Sharon McCloskey explains, opponents are seeking relief from what they say is the most restrictive law of its kind in the nation:\n\nThe gist of the case against the state is that the challenged provisions made voting harder for North Carolinians \u2014 \u201cburdened\u201d their fundamental right to vote \u2014 in violation of the 14th Amendment, and that those burdens fell disproportionately upon minority voters, giving them \u201cless opportunity\u201d to participate in the political process, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe challengers ask the court to view the voting changes through a wide lens, taking into consideration the cumulative impact HB 589 has on all voters and the historical and social implications it has in particular for black voting opportunity in North Carolina.\n\nWith testimony from some of the nearly 100 voters, lawmakers and experts the challengers have identified as possible witnesses along with other evidence to be introduced at trial, they\u2019ll argue that North Carolina voters in large numbers came to rely on measures like same-day registration and two weeks of early voting \u2013 which were intended to and did increase voter participation.\n\nFor example, over 90,000 voters relied on same-day registration in each of the presidential elections it was available, the challengers contend in their trial brief, and some 700,000 ballots were cast on the specific early voting days eliminated by the new law in each of those elections.\n\nAfrican-American voters in particular relied on those changes to expand their voting options \u2014 using same-day registration twice as much as white voters in three of the last six elections in which it was available, casting out-of-precinct provisional ballots twice as often as white voters, and using early voting at increasingly higher rates than white voters in recent general elections.\n\nScaling back voting options which increased black participation was not unintended, the challengers say, pointing to demographic voting date lawmakers requested when considering HB 589.\n\nAs the Justice Department argues in its trial brief:\n\nThe General Assembly adopted HB 589 in part for the racially discriminatory purpose of rolling back the gains black citizens had achieved under the State\u2019s prior election laws. This intent forms a second basis for holding that HB 589 violates Section 2.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbb2\"", "article_summary": "The much-anticipated federal trial over North Carolina\u2019s \u2018monster\u2019 voting rights law gets underway today in Winston-Salem.\nScaling back voting options which increased black participation was not unintended, the challengers say, pointing to demographic voting date lawmakers requested when considering HB 589.\nThis intent forms a second basis for holding that HB 589 violates Section 2.\nAfrican-American voters in particular relied on those changes to expand their voting options \u2014 using same-day registration twice as much as white voters in three of the last six elections in which it was available, casting out-of-precinct provisional ballots twice as often as white voters, and using early voting at increasingly higher rates than white voters in recent general elections.\nAs the Justice Department argues in its trial brief:The General Assembly adopted HB 589 in part for the racially discriminatory purpose of rolling back the gains black citizens had achieved under the State\u2019s prior election laws."}
