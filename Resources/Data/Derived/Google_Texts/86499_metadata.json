A 2013 survey found 28 percent of hospitals were interested in launching their own plans by 2018.\n\n\"Most of the providers we have spoken with highlight PSHPs [provider-sponsored health plans] as helping their organizations develop a true integrated delivery system capable of meeting the broad goal of improving quality at a lower cost--at least on an inflation-adjusted basis,\" wrote S&P analyst Martin Arrick. \"As a result, providers are increasingly embracing PSHPs and have learned the hard lessons of the late 1990s, when many providers entered and exited the PSHP business often with sizable and embarrassing losses.\"\n\nContracting with insurers on the basis of performance and care quality will positively impact healthcare providers' credit, according to S&P. Not only will PSHPs allow health systems to leverage narrow networks, the plans can be a learning tool as providers work to provide higher-quality care and more convenient patient options.\n\nEven commercial insurers' reluctance about risk-sharing can benefit providers, according to Arrick. As hospitals increase their own risk-management expertise, they can offer products that insurers currently dominating the market don't provide. The proliferation of PSHPs is part of a new wave of post-ACA cost-containment efforts that address medical management, Arrick said. This trend will increase overlap between the insurance and provider spheres.\n\nWhile PSHPs require substantial startup expenditures, large regional systems are generally financially equipped to take that risk, according to the report. Existing PSHPs have had little to no effect on their parent companies' credit. Of the 16 largest such plans with S&P ratings, the two lowest grades are in the B category. UPMC Health Plan, the nation's second-largest PSHP, serves 2.6 million members and is considered a model by many providers seeking to establish plans, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- view the report (purchase required)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHospitals as insurers: Competition, costs, and considerations [Special Report]\n\nMore hospitals interested in launching health plans\n\nMontefiore Medical Center gets into insurance business\n\nHospitals expand offerings with insurance plans\n\nHealth systems get into insurance biz\n\nWill more providers make a splash into insurance business?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The growing trend of provider-sponsored insurance plans helps drive needed change within the healthcare industry post-Affordable Care Act,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new\u00a0report\u00a0from Standard & Poor's.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The growing trend of provider-sponsored insurance plans helps drive needed change within the healthcare industry post-Affordable Care Act,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new\u00a0report\u00a0from Standard & Poor's.", "title": "Provider-sponsored insurance plans can boost outcomes, credit", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/how-provider-sponsored-insurance-plans-can-boost-outcomes-credit/2015-06-10", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Commercial Insurers,narrow networks,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,provider-sponsored insurance plans,risk-sharing,Standard & Poor's,UPMC Health Plan", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1be\"", "article_summary": "The growing trend of provider-sponsored insurance plans helps drive needed change within the healthcare industry post-Affordable Care Act (ACA), according to a new report from Standard & Poor's.\nContracting with insurers on the basis of performance and care quality will positively impact healthcare providers' credit, according to S&P.\nOf the 16 largest such plans with S&P ratings, the two lowest grades are in the B category.\nEven commercial insurers' reluctance about risk-sharing can benefit providers, according to Arrick.\nA 2013 survey found 28 percent of hospitals were interested in launching their own plans by 2018."}
