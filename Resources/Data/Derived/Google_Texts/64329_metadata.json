The accepted wisdom is that City Councilman Kevin Faulconer, a Republican who\u2019d like voters to forget about that fact, will take \u201cfirst place.\u201d\n\nFaulconer would prefer that we ignore the sources of his cash, since voter registration in San Diego is tilted in favor of the Democratic Party. The local GOP is currently less popular than even Congress, with a mere 3% of newly registered voters willing to affiliate themselves with the Party of Lincoln.\n\nWhat we\u2019re really voting on is who makes it to the runoff election, which will take place at sometime in February\u2026 Or maybe March, depending on when this round\u2019s votes are certified.\n\nAnd it\u2019s that runoff election I\u2019ll be talking about today, in the hopes you\u2019ll be further inspired to vote this time around. (Did I mention yet how important it is to vote?)\n\nKevin Faulconer\u2019s hope for the runoff round has to be in lulling infrequent voters to sleep. No matter what the election, turn out is consistently higher in the older, mostly white districts North of Interstate 8.\n\nThis will result in two pronged campaign, with Official Faulconer Marketing made up of smiling ads with sunny happy people and a Dark Lords Marketing blitz designed to scare the hell out of people in La Jolla and Rancho Bernardo.\n\nThe other two candidates of the Democratic persuasion face a more challenging course. Rifts within the party that started in the downward spirals of the He Who Should Not Be Named former mayor have spilled over into the campaigns of Nathan Fletcher and David Alvarez.\n\nWhoever \u201cwins\u201d second place will face the daunting task of making their supporters mea culpas for utterances made during the past five months sound sincere enough to gain some measure of support from the third place finisher\u2019s supporters. And I have real doubts about that happening.\n\nI\u2019m sure that Fletcher and/or Alvarez will make the \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together speech;\u201d I\u2019m just not so sure that it will be accepted by the people in the political trenches.\n\nThe Fletcher campaign, if victorious but not able to sell themselves to Alvarez supporters, will have to be more reliant on the registration advantage Democrats have. Not being able to build bridges to the more activist wing of the party means they\u2019ll have a much weaker ground game in South of Interstate 8 neighborhoods.\n\nI\u2019ll go so far as to predict they\u2019d opt to go head-to-head in the city\u2019s more affluent neighborhoods. If they can sell Fletcher as being one of \u201cthem\u201d and \u201csomebody you can trust\u201d that could be a winning strategy\u2026unless you happen to live in City Heights or Barrio Logan, in which case the candidate will owe you nothing.\n\nThe Alvarez campaign has, in my opinion, the harder sell in trying to win over Fletcher supporters. They will have defeated an \u201cinsider\u201d and while the insider types will give lip service to supporting the winner, I have a hard time believing the big money types at Qualcomm will follow their lead.\n\nThe support that organized labor has generated for David Alvarez has been impressive thus far; he\u2019s gone from single digits to being contender. The ground game that ironically vaunted Fletcher supporter Lorena Gonzalez into greater prominence has been unrelenting and thorough.\n\nShould the Alvarez campaign pull off a more impressive margin of victory than the razor thin margin pollsters are currently predicting, his task will be easier, since the argument being advanced in Fletcherland is that David \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d win.\n\nWhoever wins the right to face Kevin Faulconer will be facing a tidal wave of negativity from the Lincoln Club /Lynchester cabal. The Republicans winning strategy will be based on discouraging voting by convincing Democrats that their candidate isn\u2019t worth the effort to cast a ballot. That\u2019s the only path open when you don\u2019t have actual ideas.\n\nThis entire story is about tactics and probabilities. To the Mike Aguirre supporters that will undoubtedly write in to complain that I\u2019ve left them out, I say \u201cprove me wrong.\u201d\n\nAlvarez and Fletcher are different in their approach to governance. On the issues/ideology scale it\u2019s clear to me David Alvarez is the better candidate. Nathan Fletcher\u2019s past record makes it hard for me to believe in him, even as I recognize the difficulty he\u2019s faced in moving away from the GOP.\n\nI urge you, if you haven\u2019t voted, to vote. Not voting at all is worse than voting for the \u201cwrong\u201d candidate.\n\nI voted for David Alvarez last week. I think he\u2019s the right guy for the job.\n\nWalmart! Walmart! Walmart!\n\nI saw the tree lot going up in Mission Valley last week and my Christmas cactus is starting to bloom, so that means it must officially be The Holiday Season. From here on out I won\u2019t get angry at hearing Holiday Harmonies or seeing newspaper inserts flogging mostly worthless merchandise.\n\nIt\u2019s time to spend, my friends!\n\nIn order to get you in the \u201cmood\u201d, I hereby present a few horror stories about the Grinch that is Walmart.\n\nFrom the Cleveland Plain Dealer:\n\nThe storage containers are attractively displayed at the Walmart on Atlantic Boulevard in Canton. The bins are lined up in alternating colors of purple and orange. Some sit on tables covered with golden yellow tablecloths. Others peer out from under the tables.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a merchandise display. It\u2019s a food drive \u2013 not for the community, but for needy workers.\n\n\u201cPlease Donate Food Items Here, so Associates in Need Can Enjoy Thanksgiving Dinner,\u201d read signs affixed to the tablecloths.\n\nThe food drive tables are tucked away in an employees-only area. They are another element in the backdrop of the public debate about salaries for cashiers, stock clerks and other low-wage positions at Walmart, as workers in Cincinnati and Dayton are scheduled to go on strike Monday.\n\nIs the food drive proof the retailer pays so little that many employees can\u2019t afford Thanksgiving dinner?\n\nIt\u2019s my understanding that Walmart\u2019s Chula Vista location has been selected (there will be others) for San Diego\u2019s part in this ongoing struggle against low wages and lower expectations.\n\nThe Teamsters aren\u2019t waiting for the end of the month. From Salon, a prelude to the wildcat type actions being organized for Stupor Thursday / Black Friday around the country:\n\nIn labor\u2019s latest challenge to a low-wage economy and a legal system that excludes huge swathes of the workforce, hundreds of non-union Portof Los Angeles truck drivers plan to stage surprise strikes against three companies Monday. The workers transport goods from the port to companies including Costco, Forever 21, Sketchers and Wal-Mart. They allege their companies \u2014 Green Fleet Systems, American Logistics International, and Pac 9 \u2014 illegally punished workers for organizing and exposing wrongdoing. While drivers striking at GFS and ALI (starting at 5 a.m. PST and 4 p.m. PST respectively) are legally employed by those logistics companies, the workers at the third company, Pac 9, are among the growing ranks of so-called \u201cindependent contractors\u201d who legally aren\u2019t employed by anyone at all. They plan to walk (or drive) off the job at 5 p.m. PST Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m demanding what a worker deserves,\u201d Pac 9 driver Jose Galindo told Salon in Spanish in a pre-strike interview. Wal-Mart, Sketchers, Costco, Forever 21, GFS, ALI and Pac 9 did not provide comment on the workers\u2019 allegations in response to Friday inquiries (Pac 9 referred Salon to a communications firm, which did not respond to a Friday request for comment).\n\nThe port truckers, backed by the Teamsters union, are the latest to take up tactics that have characterized a wave of low-wage, non-union strikes since 2012. Like strikes targeting the Wal-Mart supply chain and the fast food industry\n\nAnd if you want a reason to really get fired up about just how bad they are, check out this story from Gawker:\n\nNo one cares more about poor Americans than the Wal-Mart corporation does. That\u2019s why Wal-Mart is speaking up to say: The government must stop forcing Americans to waste money on health care, when that money could be spent buying crap at Wal-Mart.\n\nWal-Mart has so many customers that its economic fortunes are considered to be a strong indicator of the economic fortunes of the middle and lower classes as a whole. No one sells more stuff to poor Americans than Wal-Mart does, and no company is responsible for keeping as many Americans poor as Wal-Mart is. Wal-Mart is the shining symbol of American poverty!\n\nOf course, this means that whenever Wal-Mart has a bad quarter, it can just point to various ongoing national issues as an excuse. Well, sales were poor in the most recent quarter. Why might that be, Wal-Mart? From the Wall Street Journal:\n\n\u201cWhile it is not coming through in customer research, we do know that some of our customers are concerned about the impact of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Carol Schumacher, vice president of investor relations, told analysts on Thursday. \u201cFor many of our customers, having to afford health care and insurance may be another line item in their personal budget that they may not have had to cover previously.\u201d Wal-Mart says it has 140 million customers a week.\n\nAlternatives to Obamacare\n\nBy now you should be aware of the Republican alternative to Obamacare:\n\nDon\u2019t get sick.\n\nIf you do get sick, don\u2019t worry, as one of the Daily Fishwrap\u2019s letter writers\u2019 tells us today, \u201c\u2026this country has free clinics and abounds with hospitals that must provide care to all without insurance or ability to pay.\u201d\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the oft repeated claim that we have the finest health care system in the world. So the status quo is fine\u2026.\n\nExcept that isn\u2019t true, as we learn in the New York Times today:\n\nEven as Americans struggle with the changes required by health care reform, an international survey released last week by the Commonwealth Fund, a research organization, shows why change is so necessary.\n\nThe report found that by virtually all measures of cost, access to care and ease of dealing with insurance problems, Americans fared poorly compared with people in other advanced countries. The survey covered 20,000 adults in the United States and 10 other industrial nations \u2014 Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Britain, all of which put in place universal or near-universal health coverage decades ago. The United States spends far more than any of these countries on a per capita basis and as a percent of the national economy.\n\nFor that, it gets meager results. Some 37 percent of American adults went without recommended care, did not see a doctor when sick or failed to fill prescriptions in the past year because of costs, compared with 4 percent in Britain and 6 percent in Sweden. Nearly a quarter of American adults could not pay medical bills or had serious problems paying them compared with less than 13 percent in France and 7 percent or less in five other countries. Even Americans who were insured for the entire year were more likely than adults abroad to forgo care because of costs, an indication of how skimpy some insurance policies are.\n\nThen there\u2019s the sick little game being played by insurers on hard working Americans like \u201cDonna\u201d from Seattle Washington. Via Talking Points Memo:\n\nAcross the country, insurance companies have sent misleading letters to consumers, trying to lock them into the companies\u2019 own, sometimes more expensive health insurance plans rather than let them shop for insurance and tax credits on the Obamacare marketplaces \u2014 which could lead to people like Donna spending thousands more for insurance than the law intended. In some cases, mentions of the marketplace in those letters are relegated to a mere footnote, which can be easily overlooked.\n\nThe extreme lengths to which some insurance companies are going to hold on to existing customers at higher price, as the Affordable Care Act fundamentally re-orders the individual insurance market, has caught the attention of state insurance regulators.\n\nThe insurance companies argue that it\u2019s simply capitalism at work. But regulators don\u2019t see it that way. By warning customers that their health insurance plans are being canceled as a result of Obamacare and urging them to secure new insurance plans before the Obamacare launched on Oct. 1, these insurers put their customers at risk of enrolling in plans that were not as good or as affordable as what they could buy on the marketplaces.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just letters being sent out before October 1st. There\u2019s a new variation called \u201cyou can only buy this or that policy\u201d being pushed by medical groups like Sharp.\n\nBoogie \u2018Till You Puke, But Don\u2019t Expect to See a Doctor\n\nFinally, in our round up of ObamaScareScams \u2122 we have the latest efforts by the Koch brothers funded \u201cGeneration Opportunity\u201d which is touring college campuses urging young people NOT to sign up for Health Insurance.\n\nFrom the Los Angeles Times:\n\nThe raucous scene at a University of Miami tailgate party on a recent weekend might have seemed an unlikely spot for a debate over Obamacare. But with six dozen pizzas in hand, the youthful staffers from Generation Opportunity rolled up in Hummers and Ford F-150s to claim their spot.\n\nWith \u201cDJ Joey\u201d spinning electronic dance beats, the group lured Miami\u2018s revelers to their tent with beer pong tables and plenty of swag, including bottle openers and beer cozies bearing the group\u2019s logo on a black-and-white pill capsule: \u201cOpt Out.\u201d\n\nThey were seeking to keep out of President Obama\u2018s healthcare plan a group that, more than any other, must be in the program for it to succeed. Eighteen- to 34-year-olds, that demographic group courted relentlessly by television advertisers and presidential candidates, are needed in the insurance exchanges to offset, with their youth and health, the pool of older and sicker Americans expected to sign up.\n\nSo the battle for their hearts is unfolding this fall on campuses such as Miami\u2018s.\n\nConservative groups including Generation Opportunity \u2014 which counts the Koch brothers among its major donors \u2014 are trying to push young people away from the exchanges and toward shopping for private-market plans at websites like Esurance, which over time could cause the collapse of Obamacare by driving up its prices.\n\nCheck Out the SDFree Press Calendar\n\nThanks to the efforts of Brent Beltran, the San Diego Free Press now has an on-line calendar of events.
