Health Reform: By now, ObamaCare was supposed to have 21 million enrollees. A new study says it’s not likely to ever attract even 15 million. Even for government work, that’s a big miss.

President Obama has been bragging about ObamaCare’s great “successes” in the run-up to its sixth anniversary, including the claim that 20 million have gained coverage (highly dubious) and that health care inflation is low (which has little to do with the law).

But as the years progress, it’s the failings of ObamaCare that have become more apparent.

The latest evidence of this is from a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation — which has been supportive of the law — that says overall paid enrollment is likely to top out at 14.7 million.

That’s almost 10 million shy of what the Congressional Budget Office had originally projected ObamaCare would enroll. And it means that ObamaCare will only sign up about half of the “potential market.”

And, to add further perspective, there were 15 million people who bought individual insurance plans before ObamaCare, a number that Obama himself once dismissed as an insignificant 5% of the insurance market.

Kaiser says one reason for the sharp drop in enrollment expectations is that employers aren’t dumping as many people into the exchanges as the CBO had expected. But that’s a marginal reason at best, since the CBO originally expected few to lose work-based coverage as a result of the law.

Many also continue to buy plans outside the exchanges, the report says. That’s another sign of ObamaCare’s failure, since the exchanges were billed as a fantastic new service that would let consumers easily compare plans, a la Travelocity.

Kaiser does finally get around to the nut of the problem with ObamaCare: affordability.

Even though the official name of the law is the “Affordable Care Act,” Kaiser says that “the overwhelming reason why people who are uninsured say they are uncovered is cost.” In fact, most of the uninsured said they tried to get a plan but found it too expensive.

That’s backed up by a recent survey sponsored by National Public Radio and the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation. Among its startling findings, 34% say the cost of health care has gotten less affordable over the past two years, compared with just 9% who say it’s more affordable. Forty-five percent say premiums have gone up, compared with 4% who said insurance is cheaper.

The kicker is the survey’s finding that 25% of Americans say ObamaCare has “directly hurt” them, compared with 15% who say it’s “directly helped.”

The problem is that if few sign up for ObamaCare plans, the markets will remain unstable and will be less attractive for private insurers.

Add to all this the billions wasted on failed insurance co-ops and failed state exchanges, the skyrocketing premiums, rising deductibles, access problems for those with ObamaCare plans, big insurance losses, and the fact that ObamaCare will still leave tens of million uninsured.

No wonder the administration has to make things up about ObamaCare to brag about.
