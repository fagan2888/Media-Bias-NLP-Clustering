The DEQ says the discoloration is from the large amount of iron in Wewoka Lake.

Angry Wewoka residents are sounding off about the dark color of the city's water supply.

The State Department of Environmental Quality says the city of Wewoka is working hard to fix the discoloration issue, which the DEQ says is from the large amount of iron in Wewoka Lake.

While they say tests show the water is still safe to drink, angry residents have constructed a “Crappy Water in Wewoka” Facebook page.

Brandon Streater's home sits not far from Wewoka's water tower. He says he can't stand to bathe his seven-month old daughter in the tub.

“It's ridiculous," said Streater. "This isn't a third-world country; this is the state of Oklahoma.”

The city of Wewoka says residents can get water stains out of clothes by using a product called “Iron Out,” which is available at area hardware stores.
