Spending stepped across a wide variety of categories, including hospitals, nursing homes, home health, and physician and other clinical services. Spending on pharmaceuticals and other medical goods rose even more sharply, rising over 9 percent in 2014, according to data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in February.\n\nThe pickup in health spending in 2014 is consistent with the view that much of the slowdown in health spending over the past years is attributable to two factors:\n\nthe lagged effects of the Great Recession, and the surge in the use of generic drugs as many commonly used drugs came off patent (the \u201cpatent cliff\u201d).\n\nUnder this view, a pickup in health spending was to be expected as the economic recovery strengthened and as new and expensive drugs (like Sovaldi, the new hepatitis C drug) entered the market. On the other hand, the pickup in health spending growth in 2014 may be temporary. Health spending growth tends to be volatile, as can be seen below, so one can\u2019t make too much of year-to-year gyrations. In addition, health spending growth in 2014 was likely boosted by the one-time increase in demand for health services by those newly insured under the ACA.\n\nIt is too soon to know whether health spending growth will continue to increase, and, if so, by how much. The answer to that question has broad implications for the economy and, particularly, for the federal budget. For example, largely in response to slow national health spending growth through 2013, CBO recently lowered the expected costs of the ACA\u2019s health insurance coverage provisions by 10 percent. If spending growth rises sharply in years ahead, so too will those estimates.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Louise Sheiner and Brendan Mochoruk take a look at the latest health spending data and account for causes of the increase, including marked economic recovery from the Great Recession and the influx of new, more expensive drugs.", "title": "Health spending growth picks up", "og": {"site_name": "The Brookings Institution", "description": "Louise Sheiner and Brendan Mochoruk take a look at the latest health spending data and account for causes of the increase, including marked economic recovery from the Great Recession and the influx of new, more expensive drugs.", "title": "Health spending growth picks up", "url": "http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/health360/posts/2015/03/13-health-spending-growth-picks-up-sheiner", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/blogs/health360/community%20health/health_prescriptions/health_prescriptions_16x9.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en", "type": "website", "determiner": "auto"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 151106990, "title": "Health spending growth picks up", "image": {"width": 560, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu//~/media/blogs/health360/community%20health/health_prescriptions/health_prescriptions_16x9.jpg?w=560", "height": 315}, "site": {"identifier": "BrookingsInst", "id": 151106990}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Louise Sheiner and Brendan Mochoruk take a look at the latest health spending data and account for causes of the increase, including marked economic recovery from the Great Recession and the influx of new, more expensive drugs."}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 137459917707}, "ces": {"broadcontenttype": "Commentary ; Blog Posts", "title": "Health spending growth picks up", "topicsspecialized": "Medicare", "topicsbroad": "Health", "centers": "Center for Health Policy ; The Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy", "experts": "Louise Sheiner", "programs": "Economic Studies", "authors": "Louise Sheiner ; Brendan Mochoruk", "contentdate": "2015/03/13 09:31:00", "researchactivities": "Center for Health Policy ; The Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy ; Economic Studies", "topics": "Health ; Medicare"}, "article": {"tag": "Medicare", "published_time": "2015-03-13", "modified_time": "2015-3-13", "author": "Louise Sheiner"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3c88\"", "article_summary": "In addition, health spending growth in 2014 was likely boosted by the one-time increase in demand for health services by those newly insured under the ACA.\nFor example, largely in response to slow national health spending growth through 2013, CBO recently lowered the expected costs of the ACA\u2019s health insurance coverage provisions by 10 percent.\nIt is too soon to know whether health spending growth will continue to increase, and, if so, by how much.\nHealth spending growth tends to be volatile, as can be seen below, so one can\u2019t make too much of year-to-year gyrations.\nOn the other hand, the pickup in health spending growth in 2014 may be temporary."}
