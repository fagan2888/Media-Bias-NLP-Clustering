A reason they own the National League\u2019s second-best record.\n\nThey make the plays that matter.\n\nThe Pirates did it again Friday night at PNC Park in front of 32,607 fans, beating the Rockies 5-3.\n\nThe loss snapped Colorado\u2019s modest two-game winning streak.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a well-rounded team, not many holes. So they can beat you in a lot of ways,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said of the Pirates. \u201cThey have a really good bullpen, and that\u2019s been one of their strengths.\u201d\n\nThe Pirates won the game in the eighth inning, making struggling reliever Scott Oberg pay for his mistakes. Oberg issued back-to-back walks to catcher Francisco Cervelli and Pedro Alvarez. Run-scoring singles by pinch- hitter Josh Harrison and right fielder Gregory Polanco gave the Pirates the victory.\n\nOberg, who took the loss, saw his ERA rise to 5.76. He has issued 21 walks in 46 innings this season.\n\nIn the top of the eighth, Polanco (3-for-5) made the kind of play that playoff teams make. With Rockies shortstop Jose Reyes perched on third base, Nolan Arenado hit a sinking line drive to shallow right. Reyes attempted to tag up and score, but Polanco made a running catch and threw a strike to Cervelli, who tagged out the sliding Reyes. Polanco received a standing ovation from the black and gold-clad crowd.\n\n\u201cSometimes you have to take a chance,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cWe know what kind of athlete Polanco is. But it was a shallow ball, not too deep, but he had to make a great throw. Not too many right fielders can do that.\u201d\n\nWeiss had no problem with Reyes trying to score.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the right play right there,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI was glad he took off. It took a great throw by Polanco, and it was right on the money.\u201d\n\nBehind a competitive start from Jon Gray, the Rockies hung tough before falling to 24-39 away from home.\n\nThe Rockies had only five hits, but two of them were monsters.\n\nReyes hit a two-out, two-run homer in the fifth off starter Francisco Liriano. Reyes said he sat on Liriano\u2019s changeup.\n\n\u201cI was looking for it, and I was able to put a pretty good swing on it,\u201d Reyes said.\n\nCarlos Gonzalez silenced PNC with a solo homer to right-center in the sixth, tying the game 3-3.\n\nIt was Reyes\u2019 third homer since joining the Rockies in the trade that sent Troy Tulowitzki to Toronto. It was CarGo\u2019s 31st homer of the season, his 27th since June 1.\n\nGray didn\u2019t dominate the Pirates by any means, but he kept the Rockies in the ballgame and gave them a chance to win. The rookie right-hander departed with one out in the fifth, trailing 3-2, having thrown a season-high 89 pitches (55 strikes). After five starts, he has five no-decisions and a 6.00 ERA.\n\n\u201cI thought I pitched OK, maybe better than my line showed,\u201d Gray said.\n\nThe Pirates tagged Gray for seven hits, and he stuck out six. It was a quantum leap of improvement over his last start when the New York Mets shelled him for seven runs and eight hits in just 1 innings, including a second-inning grand slam by Yoenis Cespedes.\n\n\u201cJon threw the ball well,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI wanted to give him an opportunity to get through the fifth there, but he started to get extended a little bit.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s Andrew McCutchen used pure speed to score in the first. He singled to right, stole second and scored on Jung Ho Kang\u2019s bloop single to right. The Pirates extended their lead to 2-0 in the third when Polanco singled, stole second and scored on Kang\u2019s double.\n\nPittsburgh took a 3-2 lead in the fifth. Polanco ripped a leadoff double off Gray, scampered to third on a wild pitch and scored on Starling Marte\u2019s sacrifice fly.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Scott Oberg struggles in Rockies\u2019 loss to Pirates", "title": "Scott Oberg struggles in Rockies\u2019 loss to Pirates", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/28/scott-oberg-struggles-in-rockies-loss-to-pirates/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150828__DJ-LeMahieu-Rockiesp1-1.jpg", "height": 457}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150828__DJ-LeMahieu-Rockiesp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-28T20:36:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T07:22:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd175f\"", "article_summary": "So they can beat you in a lot of ways,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said of the Pirates.\nThe Pirates did it again Friday night at PNC Park in front of 32,607 fans, beating the Rockies 5-3.\nIt was Reyes\u2019 third homer since joining the Rockies in the trade that sent Troy Tulowitzki to Toronto.\nRun-scoring singles by pinch- hitter Josh Harrison and right fielder Gregory Polanco gave the Pirates the victory.\nThe Pirates extended their lead to 2-0 in the third when Polanco singled, stole second and scored on Kang\u2019s double."}
