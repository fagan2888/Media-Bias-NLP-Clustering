A western Kansas county has a new transportation service organized to help residents get to appointments, visit friends or collect their groceries.

Gray County Transit is a door-to-door minivan service administered by Dodge City's R-Tran Public Transportation, under the Dodge City Parks and Recreation Department. The project, which got underway recently, is funded through a Federal Rural Transportation Grant and state Rural Transportation money that was matched by Gray County.

Organizers hope it will grow into a popular service. There are currently two part-time drivers, who split the day in half. Residents have been working on the program for years.

The Hutchinson News reports the service offers $15 monthly pass for unlimited rides. The van operates all over Gray County, from Cimarron to Ingalls, Montezuma, Copeland and Ensign.
