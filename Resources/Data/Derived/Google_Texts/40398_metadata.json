Bringing previously physician-owned practices under the control of hospitals would increase efficiency and allow physicians and hospitals to better coordinate care, advocates claimed.\n\nThe key finding of the researchers was that practices owned by local hospitals or multihospital systems incur significantly higher expenditures per patient than integrated medical groups and IPAs owned by participating physicians.\n\nThe researchers did find physician practices owned by local hospitals and multihospital systems may better coordinate care than organizations owned by their participating physicians. But any resulting improvements through coordination of care were not associated with lower expenditures per patient.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2012 the total expenditures for care per patient were 10 percent higher in physician organizations owned by a local hospital and 20 percent higher in organizations owned by a multihospital system than in organizations owned by participating physicians, after adjusting for patient disease severity and other factors, the researchers found.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, included incentives for hospitals to buy physician practices in order to benefit from coordinated care.\n\n\u201cWith the Obama administration\u2019s encouragement and as a result of demographic factors, physicians increasingly began to work for hospitals and hospitals bought physician practices in large numbers,\u201d Herrick said. \u201cNow, just over half of physicians work for a hospital.\u201d\n\nKenneth Artz (iamkenartz@hotmail.com) is a freelance writer for The Heartland Institute", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Coordinated Care Savings IllusoryCoordinated care has been promoted as a solution to insufficient coordination of hospital care and physician care, which is thought to lead to increased and unnecessary costs.\nThe Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, included incentives for hospitals to buy physician practices in order to benefit from coordinated care.\nThe researchers did find physician practices owned by local hospitals and multihospital systems may better coordinate care than organizations owned by their participating physicians.\nBringing previously physician-owned practices under the control of hospitals would increase efficiency and allow physicians and hospitals to better coordinate care, advocates claimed.\n\u201cWith the Obama administration\u2019s encouragement and as a result of demographic factors, physicians increasingly began to work for hospitals and hospitals bought physician practices in large numbers,\u201d Herrick said."}
