If you’ve ever seen the movie John Wick, you’d notice that things turn out very poorly for any one who messed with Keanu Reeves. In the film, Reeves plays a retired hitman who seeks vengeance after a group of punks steal his car and kill his puppy that was given to him before his late wife, played by Michelle Moynahan (Blue Bloods), who dies of cancer.

The sequel has currently wrapped filming, but it seemed Reeves decided to brush up, or improve, his handling of firearms prior to production (or during) by visiting the range of Taran Tactical. In short, the man just shreds the course.
