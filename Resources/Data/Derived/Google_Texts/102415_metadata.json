Humans actually developed a sense of disgust as a form of self-protection: to recognize slimy, rotten foods or other items like vomit or feces that might be highly-infectious or diseased. Sensitivity to disgusting things, then, helps humans avoid bacteria and sickness.\n\nBut why are we so afraid of spiders? It\u2019s usually their creepy-crawliness that gives us the shudders, and makes the hair on our necks stand on edge: not necessarily any fear about them spreading bacteria. But psychologists overall link humans\u2019 sensitivity to disgust to not only diseased things like human fluids or old food, but also \u201cfear-relevant\u201d animals like slugs, rats, bats, snakes, cockroaches \u2014 and, of course, spiders. These animals are usually involved in some way in the spread of disease: rats spread the bubonic plague, and bats carrying the Ebola virus are what may have started the epidemic in West African countries.\n\nOf course, there are some poisonous spiders out there \u2014 those are certainly dangerous and related to illness. But most spiders are harmless. It\u2019s possible that in the past, humans associated all spiders with poison and illness, thus harboring a fear that was then conditioned generations down the line. Fear of spiders, or arachnophobia, is one of the most common phobias; it is, however, mostly irrational because we\u2019re far more powerful than itsy-bitsy spiders. It you want to overcome your fear of spiders, there\u2019s an app for that: you can condition yourself to playing with cute spiders on your phone before they graduate to more realistic ones.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "arachnophobia, fear of spiders", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Spiders are mostly harmless and we're far more powerful than them, so why are we so afraid of them?", "title": "This Is Why We\u2019re Scared Of Spiders [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/why-were-scared-spiders-and-cause-other-irrational-fears-315494", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/23/tarantula.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Spiders are mostly harmless and we're far more powerful than them, so why are we so afraid of them?", "title": "This Is Why We\u2019re Scared Of Spiders [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/why-were-scared-spiders-and-cause-other-irrational-fears-315494", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/23/tarantula.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/23/tarantula.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2014-12-23T19:25:33-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-23T19:30:46-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Spiders are mostly harmless and we're far more powerful than them, so why are we so afraid of them?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1af9\"", "article_summary": "Fear of spiders, or arachnophobia, is one of the most common phobias; it is, however, mostly irrational because we\u2019re far more powerful than itsy-bitsy spiders.\nIt you want to overcome your fear of spiders, there\u2019s an app for that: you can condition yourself to playing with cute spiders on your phone before they graduate to more realistic ones.\nFor a while, psychologists assumed that we\u2019re so afraid of creepy crawlers like spiders and other bugs because of their association with a \u201cdisgust\u201d level.\nOf course, there are some poisonous spiders out there \u2014 those are certainly dangerous and related to illness.\nIt\u2019s possible that in the past, humans associated all spiders with poison and illness, thus harboring a fear that was then conditioned generations down the line."}
