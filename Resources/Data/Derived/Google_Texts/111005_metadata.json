Since Obamacare became the law of the land in 2010, many charities and businesses have struggled under the weight of the federal government who insist they provide abortifacient drug insurance.\n\nThe American people are standing against this, according to a Marist poll released Monday. According to the poll, which was sponsored by the Catholic organization Knights of Columbus, 53 percent of Americans stand with the nuns of the Little Sisters of the Poor and against the government in the Supreme Court case. About 15 percent of respondents were undecided.\n\n\u201cIt is not reasonable for the government to demand that some \u2014 and only some \u2014 religious employers engage in activity that is totally unnecessary to the government\u2019s stated purpose of providing elective and morally problematic drugs to employees,\u201d Knights of Columbus supreme knight Carl Anderson said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cSuch action doesn\u2019t just violate the rights of employers like the Little Sisters, it is also at odds with the American people\u2019s understanding of basic fairness and our long-standing commitment to protecting the deeply-held beliefs of every American \u2014 especially when those beliefs are the minority view,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case on March 23. On March 29, it sent out an unusual request, asking both sides in the case how to \u201cavoid forcing religious women to provide services against their faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an excellent development,\u201d said Mark Rienzi of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which is representing the Denver-based nuns of the Little Sisters of the Poor. \u201cClearly the Supreme Court understood the Sisters\u2019 concern that the government\u2019s current scheme forces them to violate their religion. We look forward to offering alternatives that protect the Little Sisters\u2019 religious liberty while allowing the government to meet its stated goals.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel David Cortman, who is supporting the nuns, spoke out strongly against the government position.\n\n\u201cThe government is forcing our clients to offer access to abortion-inducing drugs through their insurance plans. That is no accommodation. The government has many other ways to make sure women may access these drugs, but it has chosen the unjust, unlawful, and unnecessary path of forcing people of faith to participate in acts that violate their deepest convictions,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is an easy solution: The government can offer these services to women who want them without forcing Christian schools, nuns, and priests to abandon their belief that life is sacred.\u201d\n\nh/t: TheBlaze\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"... unjust, unlawful, unnecessary ...\"", "author": "Jack Davis", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "\"... unjust, unlawful, unnecessary ...\"", "title": "The American People Just Sent Obama A HUGE Message That Not Even He Can Spin", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 914, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/littlesistersofthepoorobama.jpg", "height": 424}, "updated_time": "2016-04-19T09:37:24-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/abortion-case-poll-shows-americans-taking-a-strong-stand/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"... unjust, unlawful, unnecessary ...\"", "title": "Abortion Case Poll Shows Americans Taking A Strong Stand", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/littlesistersofthepoorobama.jpg", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-04-18T15:24:21-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Featured Stories", "tag": "Religious Freedom", "published_time": "2016-04-18T15:24:21-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T09:37:24-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "little sisters of the poor, religious freedom, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "According to the poll, which was sponsored by the Catholic organization Knights of Columbus, 53 percent of Americans stand with the nuns of the Little Sisters of the Poor and against the government in the Supreme Court case.\n\u201cClearly the Supreme Court understood the Sisters\u2019 concern that the government\u2019s current scheme forces them to violate their religion.\nThe American people are standing against this, according to a Marist poll released Monday.\nAdvertisement - story continues belowThe federal government is demanding a Catholic charity betray its religious integrity and conscience by forcing it to provide insurance coverage for drugs that induce abortion.\n\u201cThe government is forcing our clients to offer access to abortion-inducing drugs through their insurance plans."}
