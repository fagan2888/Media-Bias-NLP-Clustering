"The Government of Ecuador has accepted the United Statesâ€™ offer of assistance with disaster relief efforts," a USAID official said, adding that the experts would help the government with damage assessments and identifying humanitarian needs, while also providing analysis of the situation on the ground.

The official said a small support team would also work with the U.N.'s Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team, which is helping Ecuador coordinate international rescue efforts.
