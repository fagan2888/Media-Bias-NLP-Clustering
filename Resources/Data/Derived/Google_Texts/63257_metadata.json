For nearly three months, the siblings comforted each other when rolling waves thrashed their boat, when their empty bellies ached and when they were beaten for trying to stand up to stretch their legs.\n\nAs the oldest, Mohammad Aesop \u2013 just 10 years old \u2013 knew it was his job to keep his 8-year-old sister safe. But with the Thai crew wielding guns and threatening to throw troublemakers overboard, he felt helpless.\n\nTheirs was the first boat to wash ashore in Indonesia two weeks ago, followed by a number of other wooden trawlers crammed with hungry, dehydrated people. Many were abandoned at sea by their captains following a regional crackdown on human trafficking networks.\n\nSo far, nearly 3,100 Rohingya and Bangladeshis have landed in three Southeast Asian countries, according to the International Organization for Migration. More than half of them wound up in Indonesia, where nearly 170 children who traveled alone \u2013 some after being tricked or kidnapped \u2013 wait to learn what will happen next.\n\n___\n\nLabeled one of the world\u2019s most persecuted minorities, the Rohingya have been fleeing predominantly Buddhist Myanmar for decades.\n\nBut it was only after the country started moving from dictatorship to democracy in 2011 that the numbers really spiraled, with newfound freedoms of expression lifting the lid off deep-rooted hatred felt by many toward the ethnic Muslims. Hundreds were killed, and thousands more were placed in internment camps where they cannot work and medical care is scarce.\n\nIn recent months, however, flight from the area has been triggered less by fear than by desperation and greed.\n\nRohingya brokers, eager to fill boats with human cargo that fetch $100 each, roam villages and displacement camps touting stories of jobs waiting overseas.\n\nBored, frustrated and naive, youngsters are the easiest to trick. Once on board the ships, they are also the most vulnerable.\n\nAt the Indonesian seaside camp in Aceh province\u2019s Kuala Cangkoi where Mohammad and his sister now stay, nearly a third of the migrants are children. Some of the smallest Rohingya suck on lollipops and munch on potato chips passed out by local residents and students who come to snap photos of the group. Other exhausted little ones, who went three days without food on the boat, lie face down asleep on the cool white tile of a pavilion where fish is normally hawked.\n\n\u201cThe vulnerability of these children can never be overstated,\u201d said Steve Hamilton, deputy chief of mission at the International Organization for Migration in Indonesia, adding that the government has said special care will be provided to ensure the safety of unaccompanied minors. \u201cThe hardships they have endured at such young ages are heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nMohammad and his sister, Untas Begum, lost their mother three years ago, when sectarian violence in Myanmar\u2019s troubled state of Rakhine reached its peak. She was killed by a machete during an attack at a market in the state capital, Sittwe. Her children were taken in by a relative, who struggled to care for them with little money for food.\n\nTheir father has been living in Muslim-majority Malaysia, one of the few places where Rohingya can find menial jobs and a semblance of acceptance. He decided it was time for his children to join him, and paid a broker in March to put them on a boat in the Bay of Bengal.\n\nThe siblings were forced to sit with their knees bent so that another person could be seated in between their legs \u2013 like human dominos stacked together as closely as possible to ensure the biggest payoff from ransoms of around $2,000 per person demanded from the migrants\u2019 families after they left Myanmar\u2019s territorial waters.\n\nTo sleep, they simply leaned back into the chest of the person behind them. When their legs shook and ached from being locked in one position for so long, they were beaten for moving or trying to stand.\n\nThe heat on the boat was oppressive, and the stench of sweat and soured vomit was nauseating. They were given only a few spoonfuls of rice gruel twice a day. Fever, diarrhea and dehydration were common among the children and adults, but no medicine was provided. Untas said she once shivered while burning hot and freezing at the same time.\n\n\u201cWe were given a little food and water, and we were on the sea for a long time,\u201d she said, sipping water casually though a straw, a precious commodity that such a short time ago was rationed to keep her alive during the journey. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have our mom or dad on the boat, so we were scared.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "170 kids on their own among migrants to arrive in Indonesia", "title": "170 kids on their own among migrants to arrive in Indonesia", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "170 kids on their own among migrants to arrive in Indonesia", "title": "170 kids on their own among migrants to arrive in Indonesia", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/170_kids_on_their_own_among_migrants_to_arrive_in_indonesia/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/indonesia-boat-people-kids-at-sea.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "170 kids on their own among migrants to arrive in Indonesia", "title": "170 kids on their own among migrants to arrive in Indonesia", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/indonesia-boat-people-kids-at-sea.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Margie Mason", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd281\"", "article_summary": "More than half of them wound up in Indonesia, where nearly 170 children who traveled alone \u2013 some after being tricked or kidnapped \u2013 wait to learn what will happen next.\nSo far, nearly 3,100 Rohingya and Bangladeshis have landed in three Southeast Asian countries, according to the International Organization for Migration.\nAt the Indonesian seaside camp in Aceh province\u2019s Kuala Cangkoi where Mohammad and his sister now stay, nearly a third of the migrants are children.\nTheirs was the first boat to wash ashore in Indonesia two weeks ago, followed by a number of other wooden trawlers crammed with hungry, dehydrated people.\nAs the oldest, Mohammad Aesop \u2013 just 10 years old \u2013 knew it was his job to keep his 8-year-old sister safe."}
