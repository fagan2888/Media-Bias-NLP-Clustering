They insist they\u2019ve already paid their monthly insurance premium.\n\n\u201cThey call us and say, \u2018it\u2019s a scam\u2019,\u201d says Abouarabi, an insurance navigator for the Arab Community Center for Economic & Social Services (ACCESS), a nonprofit agency that specializes in helping the largest Arab-American population in any U.S. city.\n\nThat\u2019s just one example of the confusion immigrants face as they try to navigate the U.S. health care system. Even after signing up for insurance through the Affordable Care Act, advocates find that explaining to clients that they will still have to pay out of their own pockets each time they go to the doctor or get lab tests requires more than translating words like \u201cpremium\u201d and \u201cdeductible\u201d for non-English speakers.\n\n\u201cThis whole concept of insurance doesn\u2019t exist in the Eastern world,\u201d said Madiha Tariq, public health manager for ACCESS. \u201cPeople are always confused about the health care system when they come to this country.\u201d\n\nProblems like this are arising all over the country where Latino, Asian and other immigrant populations face cultural as well as language barriers.\n\nNon-citizens are three times more likely to be uninsured than U.S.-born residents, according to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. As many as 10 million non-citizens living legally in the U.S. are expected to gain health insurance through the Affordable Care Act although it\u2019s unclear how many have gained coverage so far.\n\nMandate Covers Legal Immigrants\n\nMany of these immigrants are getting insurance because the ACA requires them to do so just as it does for U.S. citizens and because it may be affordable for the first time. Like citizens, legal immigrants can use the law\u2019s online exchanges to sign up for coverage and find out if they are eligible for government subsidies. They also face a tax penalty if they don\u2019t sign up.\n\nImmigrants who are not in the country legally, however, are barred from using the exchanges and aren\u2019t required to have coverage.\n\nACCESS clients typically hail from places such as Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, Bangladesh and Syria. Besides training navigators and helping clients enroll, the center offers primary care services, cancer screenings and various public health awareness workshops in the community.\n\nSome of them are not easy to convince that they should enroll in health coverage.\n\n\u201cIraqis don\u2019t believe in insurance,\u201d said Hasanain Al Ani, a case manager at ACCESS and a refugee from Iraq, who says people from his country are accustomed to government-sponsored health care. \u201c\u2026They don\u2019t know about it [health insurance] and they don\u2019t want to know about it.\u201d\n\nTariq said another challenge has been helping clients understand how access to doctors works in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIn their country, the wait time depends on socioeconomic status \u2026 the lower the status, the longer the wait time,\u201d she said.\n\nBarra K., 27, who didn\u2019t wish to be identified by her full name, came to Dearborn as a refugee from Baghdad in February and developed a severe sore throat. She was shocked at the prices for the medication, let alone what it costs to see the doctor as someone without health insurance.\n\n\u201cHere I have to pay $70 to see a doctor, but in Iraq I only have to pay $15 and do not have to wait as long,\u201d she said.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t afford the doctor or the medication so she had to wait the illness out. She does not qualify for full Medicaid services because she hasn\u2019t been in the country for five years, but Michigan\u2019s Medicaid program does give her access to some limited emergency services.\n\nCultural Issues Can Be Barrier To Care\n\nBut toughing it out is harder for people with chronic diseases, which are a big problem among ACCESS clients who suffer from diabetes, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease and, oftentimes among refugees, depression.\n\nCultural barriers also make it difficult to get some clients to come in for care.\n\n\u201cWe have ladies who have never had a mammogram,\u201d Tariq said. \u201cCancer is stigmatized in the Arab culture. [Women] were scared no one would marry their daughters if others found out they were diagnosed.\u201d That\u2019s because people worry the cancer is hereditary and can be passed down from mother to daughter.\n\nTo persuade women to come in for mammograms, Tariq said, ACCESS has an unmarked door that allows them to slip in and out of the testing area without being identified. ACCESS also distributes a special pamphlet for Arab American women, explaining the importance of mammograms and how to examine themselves. It also pairs women diagnosed with cancer with survivors who can help them navigate the system and give them support. Public health workshops have also helped get others to come in regularly for testing and physicals.\n\nACCESS also helps people with chronic illness navigate how to pay for their care.\n\n\u201cAs a diabetic I was walking on eggshells,\u201d said Najwa Dahdah, 48, as she talked about paying for the insulin she needed to manage her diabetes.\n\nShe had had insurance but after getting diagnosed with diabetes while she was pregnant with her third child in 2005, her premium skyrocketed from $400 a month to almost $900 a month. She canceled the policy and started paying for doctors\u2019 appointments out of pocket. She clipped manufacturer coupons and constantly asked her doctors for insulin samples to help her manage her ailment.\n\nBut since signing up again under the health law, which prohibits charging higher premiums to those with health issues, Dadah and her husband receive $430 in subsidies toward their monthly insurance premium, while her children qualify for Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for the poor.\n\nThe premium \u201cis now $133 for both my husband and I through Blue Care Network,\u201d Dahdah said. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.

Well, it's true that if you want the experience the pinnacle of medical care, you come to the United States. And if you want the pinnacle of haute cuisine, you go to Per Se. If you want the pinnacle of commercial air travel, you get a first class seat on British Airways. Now, naturally, you wouldn't let just anyone mess with someone's tasting menu or state-of-the-art air-beds. But like anything that's \"the best,\" the best health care in the world isn't for everybody. The costs are prohibitively high, the access is prohibitively exclusive, and the resources are prohibitively scarce. What do the people in America who \"fly coach\" in the health care system get? Well, at the time of the health care reform debate, they were participating in a system that was, by all objective measurements, overpriced and underperforming -- if you were lucky enough to be participating in it. As anyone who's fortunate enough to have employer based health care or unfortunate enough to have a pre-existing condition can tell you, health care for ordinary people already involved all of those things that we were told would be a feature of the Affordable Care Act -- long waits, limited choice, and rationing. When the Commonwealth Fund rated health care systems by nation , the top marks in the surveyed categories went to the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Ezra Klein examined the study, and observed : \"The issue isn't just that we don't have universal health care. Our delivery system underperforms, too. 'Even when access and equity measures are not considered, the U.S. ranks behind most of the other countries on most measures. With the inclusion of primary care physician survey data in the analysis, it is apparent that the U.S. is lagging in adoption of national policies that promote primary care, quality improvement, and information technology.'\" Share this slide:\n\nGetty\n\nMore: Obamacare Immigrants", "article_metadata": {"description": "DEARBORN, Mich.--Signing people up for health insurance is the easy part of Rawha Abouarabi\u2019s job ministering to immigrants and Arab Americans in this...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-09-04 12:21:13 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "DEARBORN, Mich.--Signing people up for health insurance is the easy part of Rawha Abouarabi\u2019s job ministering to immigrants and Arab Americans in this...", "title": "Health Care Workers Struggle To Enroll People Who Have No 'Concept Of Insurance'", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/03/immigrants-obamacare-enrollment_n_5759734.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2018082/images/o-DOCTOR-PATIENT-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2018082/images/o-DOCTOR-PATIENT-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "DEARBORN, Mich.--Signing people up for health insurance is the easy part of Rawha Abouarabi\u2019s job ministering to immigrants and Arab Americans in this...", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Health Care Workers Struggle To Enroll People Who Have No 'Concept Of Insurance'"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-03 12:21:13 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5759734", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Asian enrollment obamacare,middle easterners health insurance,affordable care act immigrants,arab muslims obamacare,Latino enrollment obamacare,health insurance immigrants,muslim americans obamacare,obamacare immigrants,access", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Asian enrollment obamacare,middle easterners health insurance,affordable care act immigrants,arab muslims obamacare,Latino enrollment obamacare,health insurance immigrants,muslim americans obamacare,obamacare immigrants,access", "published_time": "2014-09-03 12:21:13 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-09-03 12:59:06 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ce3\"", "article_summary": "Also on HuffPost: Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate1 of 12 Healthcare In America Is Already 'The Best In The World' One of the more positive sounding admonitions from health care reform opponents was that the United States had \"the best health care in the world,\" so why would you mess with it?\nWhat do the people in America who \"fly coach\" in the health care system get?\nThat\u2019s just one example of the confusion immigrants face as they try to navigate the U.S. health care system.\nAs anyone who's fortunate enough to have employer based health care or unfortunate enough to have a pre-existing condition can tell you, health care for ordinary people already involved all of those things that we were told would be a feature of the Affordable Care Act -- long waits, limited choice, and rationing.\nBut like anything that's \"the best,\" the best health care in the world isn't for everybody."}
