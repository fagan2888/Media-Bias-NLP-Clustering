Jaleel Awini countered Smith with 89 yards passing and 68 yards on the ground with one rushing touchdown.\n\nThe game started at 8:15 p.m. to accommodate a national television audience. The game ended well past 11:30 p.m. mountain standard time.\n\nThe 56 points were the most ever scored by a winner in the 52 game series between Air Force and Wyoming.\n\nThe loss dropped Air Force (1-3, 0-3 MW) two losses in its first three Mountain West games for only the second time since the conference was formed in 1999.\n\nIn the previous two conference games, Utah State quarterback Chuckie Keeton thrashed the Falcons for 437 yards of total offense and five passing touchdowns. The Boise State\u2019s Joe Southwick accounted for 340 yards of total offense and a passing and rushing touchdown. Utah State won 52-20 and Boise State won 42-20.\n\nBut this may have been the bitterest defeat of all because of the intense rivalry between the Cowboys and Falcons. After the Falcons won 28-27 last year in Laramie, Wyoming coach Dave Christensen aimed inflammatory comments at Air Force coach Troy Calhoun.\n\nThere was no need for any bluster in this one. The Cowboys (3-1, 1-0 MW) did all the necessary talking on the field. They weathered Air Force\u2019s early success and then piled on the points.\n\nWith the Falcons ahead 10-7 on Will Conant\u2019s 33-yard field goal with 8:50 left in the first, the momentum turned on a defensive play by the Cowboys.\n\nCalhoun elected to gamble on fourth down and one at the Wyoming 34-yard line with 4:40 left in the opening 15 minutes.\n\nBut Wyoming defensive end Eddie Yarbrough stopped running back Anthony LaCoste short of the first down.\n\nSmith\u2019s 61-yard touchdown pass to Dominic Rufran, out of Colorado Springs, followed two plays later and the Cowboys were off to the races.\n\nThe Cowboys outscored the Falcon 28-7 the rest of the half.\n\nSmith took the Cowboys on an 83-yard scoring march early in the third quarter, running back Shaun collecting the final three yards for a 32-point lead.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wyoming quarterback Brett Smith downs Air Force 56-23 at Falcon Stadium", "title": "Wyoming quarterback Brett Smith downs Air Force 56-23 at Falcon Stadium", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/21/wyoming-quarterback-brett-smith-downs-air-force-56-23-at-falcon-stadium/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130922_013224_brett-smith.jpg", "height": 460}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130922_013224_brett-smith.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-22T01:27:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T10:42:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The 56 points were the most ever scored by a winner in the 52 game series between Air Force and Wyoming.\nAIR FORCE ACADEMY \u2014 Wyoming quarterback Brett Smith took his turn reaching into Air Force\u2019s candy store defense and came away with enough goodies to last the late night ride back home to Laramie.\nJaleel Awini countered Smith with 89 yards passing and 68 yards on the ground with one rushing touchdown.\nAfter the Falcons won 28-27 last year in Laramie, Wyoming coach Dave Christensen aimed inflammatory comments at Air Force coach Troy Calhoun.\nThe loss dropped Air Force (1-3, 0-3 MW) two losses in its first three Mountain West games for only the second time since the conference was formed in 1999."}
