By Harry Reid and Barack Obama. Goodbye moderation and sweet reason,\u201d he wrote in his weekly column.\n\n\u201cIn the fourth quarter of his presidency, Obama unbound is abusing presidential authority at will to secure a legacy on everything from environmental regulation to immigration, the laws of which he would unilaterally suspend,\u201d Krauthammer wrote.\n\nAnd the 46 Senate Democrats are using the filibuster rules to block the GOP\u2019s 54-seat majority to paralyze the GOP\u2019s pushback.\n\nObama and the Democrats failed to pass his top-priority amnesty in 2013 and 2014, and he\u2019s lost the fight for public opinion on the immigration issue. Without a path forward through Congress, he escalated the fight by declaring in November he has the right to hand out nearly 5 million work-permits to illegal immigrants, even though many Americans don\u2019t have jobs.\n\nCongressional \u201cRepublicans find themselves on the sidelines bleating plaintively about violations of the separation of powers,\u201d Krauthammer wrote.\n\n\u201cThey thought they found an instrument of resistance in funding for the Department of Homeland Security [until Feb. 27, but]\u2026 as the night follows day, Republicans, not the filibustering Democrats, will be blamed for shutting down DHS and jeopardizing the nation\u2019s safety at a time of heightened international terrorism,\u201d he added.\n\nWith no way to block Obama\u2019s power-grab, the GOP needs to match the Democrats\u2019 ruthlessness, according to Krauthammer.\n\n\u201cPush the button,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cAbolish the filibuster\u2026 immediately pass the House homeland security bill [which bars spending on the amnesty] and send it to the president\u2026 the politics will have been radically changed,\u201d Krauthammer stated.\n\n\u201cThe current story line is: Republican Congress won\u2019t fund DHS, threatening to shut it down. New story line: Obama vetoes funding for DHS, threatening to shut it down,\u201d he continued. \u201cA presidential veto would lead to a more fair allocation of blame. And it\u2019s blame allocation that determines which side blinks first. The president will have a major incentive to find some face-saving finesse.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut filibuster abolition is more than a one-shot proposition. It would radically change the next two years. It would give Republicans full control of the Congress and allow swift passage of a GOP agenda,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThe GOP could be sending bill after bill to the president\u2019s desk \u2014 on tax reform, trade, Obamacare and, if it has the guts, immigration,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s choice? Sign, veto or negotiate a compromise. If he vetoes, then Republicans take that issue to the country in 2016,\u201d the conservative columnist wrote.\n\n\u201cGo bold. Go nuclear. Abolish the filibuster.\u201d\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "No alternative if the GOP wants to stop Obama's 'lawlessness'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Republican Senate majority should kill the Senate\u2019s traditional 60-vote filibuster, and gain a huge advantage over the rule-breaking, lawless Democratic Party, says syndicated columnist Charles", "title": "Krauthammer: End Filibuster To Block Obama\u2019s Amnesty Grab", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/02/22/krauthammer-end-filibuster-to-block-obamas-amnesty-grab/", "image": {"width": 1277, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-05-at-11.05.03-PM-e1423196036870.jpg", "height": 549}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No alternative if the GOP wants to stop Obama's 'lawlessness'", "title": "Krauthammer: End Filibuster To Block Obama\u2019s Amnesty Grab Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/02/22/krauthammer-end-filibuster-to-block-obamas-amnesty-grab/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-05-at-11.05.03-PM-e1423196036870.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-22 09:10:24", "sailthru.title": "Krauthammer: End Filibuster To Block Obama's Amnesty Grab", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "amnesty,barack-obama,charles-krauthammer,neil-munro", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "amnesty,barack obama,charles krauthammer", "sailthru.description": "The Republican Senate majority should kill the Senate\u2019s traditional 60-vote filibuster, and gain a huge advantage over the rule-breaking, lawless Democratic Party, says syndicated columnist Charles", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-05-at-11.05.03-PM-e1423196036870.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe14cb\"", "article_summary": "With no way to block Obama\u2019s power-grab, the GOP needs to match the Democrats\u2019 ruthlessness, according to Krauthammer.\nAnd the 46 Senate Democrats are using the filibuster rules to block the GOP\u2019s 54-seat majority to paralyze the GOP\u2019s pushback.\n4477721The Republican Senate majority should kill the Senate\u2019s traditional 60-vote filibuster, and gain a huge advantage over the rule-breaking, lawless Democratic Party, says syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.\nThe president will have a major incentive to find some face-saving finesse.\u201d\u201cBut filibuster abolition is more than a one-shot proposition.\nCongressional \u201cRepublicans find themselves on the sidelines bleating plaintively about violations of the separation of powers,\u201d Krauthammer wrote."}
