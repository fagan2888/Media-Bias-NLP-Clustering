The Kansas native\u2014who still puts in five-day, 30-hour work weeks\u2014was joined by 200 of his closest family and friends for a daylong outdoor celebration.\n\nThe party included a congratulatory phone call from 92-year-old Bob Dole, who told Wade he may \u201ccatch [him] one of these days.\u201d Wade\u2019s son, now in his 80s, was also at the party.\n\n\u201cThe company seems to like me and I appreciate it so much that they still let me work,\u201d Wade told a local FOX affiliate in Winfield. \u201cThey are so good to me. It\u2019s a great company.\u201d\n\nWade is Walmart\u2019s oldest employee in the States and, though they cannot confirm it, Walmart representatives say he may be their oldest employee worldwide.\n\nWade found his job at Walmart after retiring at age 70. He found retirement \u201cpretty boring,\u201d and he applied to work for the retail giant to help keep busy. Having taken his first job in Winfield at age 12, he has now been in the American workforce for more than 90 years.\n\nWade is a store \u201cfixture,\u201d according to locals, watering plants, greeting customers and running the cash register.\n\n\u201cI like to meet people and, being here, I get to talk to a lot of people,\u201d Wade told TODAY\u2019s Sheinelle Jones. \u201cI like being occupied. I usually keep very busy, one thing or another. They see to it that I do.\u201d\n\nWade is no stranger to hard work, having spent time in the Air Force during World War II. He was stationed for 43 months in India and China.\n\nAfter World War II, Wade owned his own flooring business, where he laid carpet, sanded floors, and installed ceramic tile. He then held a couple of jobs with the United States Postal Service prior to retiring.\n\n\u201cYou come to work and there is this role model that everyone is amazed by,\u201d store manager Tonya Villar told KWCH-TV. \u201cHe works in lawn and garden, gives his all, he never misses work. He really is an inspiration to everyone.\u201d\n\nIn honor of Wade\u2019s birthday and service in World War II, Walmart is donating $125,000 to the Friends of the National World War II Memorial.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time he has been honored. In 2012, Experience Works, a job-training non-profit for older workers, awarded Wade with the title of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Outstanding Oldest Worker.\u201d\n\nWade credits his job at Walmart for keeping him active and healthy.\n\n\u201cI appreciate getting to be old and being recognized,\u201d Wade told TODAY. \u201cBut like I say I\u2019m still just a normal human being. I just happen to be lucky enough to still be around.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "His story is inspiring.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "His story is inspiring.", "title": "Meet the 103-Year-Old World War 2 Vet Still Working", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Loren-Wade.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-27T18:34:38+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1MvQpuH"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "His story is inspiring.", "title": "Meet the 103-Year-Old World War 2 Vet Still Working", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Loren-Wade.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "American Dream", "published_time": "2015-07-27T14:58:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-27T18:34:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Walmart, Loren Wade, Kansas, Birthday, Old Age, Outstanding Oldest Worker"}, "article_summary": "He really is an inspiration to everyone.\u201dIn honor of Wade\u2019s birthday and service in World War II, Walmart is donating $125,000 to the Friends of the National World War II Memorial.\nAfter World War II, Wade owned his own flooring business, where he laid carpet, sanded floors, and installed ceramic tile.\nThey see to it that I do.\u201dWade is no stranger to hard work, having spent time in the Air Force during World War II.\n\u201cI like to meet people and, being here, I get to talk to a lot of people,\u201d Wade told TODAY\u2019s Sheinelle Jones.\n\u201cThe company seems to like me and I appreciate it so much that they still let me work,\u201d Wade told a local FOX affiliate in Winfield."}
