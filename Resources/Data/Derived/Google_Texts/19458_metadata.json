Nine months ago, the senator from Vermont insisted he\u2019d get in the presidential race only if he determined the country was ready for a grass roots revolution. But the massive, enthusiastic turnouts at his campaign rallies these days have exceeded even his expectations and forced him to hire more staff.\n\nHis message is resonating, Sanders told Des Moines Register writers and editors last week, because he\u2019s telling truths that people are hungry to hear from a leader: That there\u2019s something \u201cfundamentally wrong\u201d when the world\u2019s richest country has the highest rate of child poverty among Western industrialized nations, while our top 1 percent gets the overwhelming share of income. That a \u201ccorrupt\u201d campaign finance system means members of Congress are so focused on funding and winning the next election, they can\u2019t represent their constituents.\n\nThat climate change is real, war should be the last resort of a great nation, and otherwise law-abiding undocumented immigrants deserve legal status. That the war on drugs needs to be rethought, and preschool and public college tuition need to be free, because most intellectual development happens between birth and age 4, and college can move working class people into the middle class.\n\n\u201cI want to see people as excited about becoming child care workers as college professors,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nHe supports public campaign financing and says he\u2019d only appoint Supreme Court justices who would vote to overturn rulings allowing unfettered outside spending on elections. He opposes fast-track trade agreements that he says sell American workers short and compromise labor, health and environmental standards. He favors a single-payer, Medicare-type health insurance program for every American because, despite gains from the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. remains the only major Western industrialized country that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care as a right.\n\nWith his stances, Sanders is tapping into a frustration many Americans are feeling but don\u2019t know how to address, and he\u2019s connecting the dots.\u201d\n\nWith his stances, Sanders is tapping into a frustration many Americans are feeling but don\u2019t know how to address, and he\u2019s connecting the dots. That\u2019s putting the Democratic Party establishment in something of a pickle. They\u2019re casting about for a mainstream alternative in case Clinton\u2019s email problems blow up. Sanders suggests party leaders \u201cdon\u2019t like me very much.\u201d Or maybe they think he can\u2019t win. When I ask Democratic friends about him, many say they like him but couldn\u2019t see him being elected president.\n\nHe says the political pundits think that in order to win, a candidate must be \u201cmiddle or the road and get a substantial percentage of their money from the party establishment.\u201d Sanders says he relies on small individual donations that have averaged $31.20 apiece. And he believes if Democrats are to win, \u201cthey must create enthusiasm and a very different type of campaign than we\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy efforts for the Democrats are not going to be with the billionaire class, trust me,\u201d he said. His strategy is to appeal to underrepresented voters by talking about \u201cthe real issues impacting real people.\u201d Of course that was also a route taken by Dennis Kucinich, John Edwards and Howard Dean, but none got the nomination.\n\nWhether Sanders has the wherewithal to not just win but bring about the sweeping structural changes he\u2019s calling for is an open question. It\u2019s not that he isn\u2019t sincerely committed to the principles he espouses or seriously outraged by the current state of affairs. But implementing his agenda would require some Supreme Court vacancies, undoing some international treaties and more. It would take more compromise-minded members of Congress than the current ones, whose GOP leadership, in Sanders\u2019 words, \u201cnever had any intention of negotiating\u201d with President Obama. Sanders, who represents a state that he says has virtually no gun control, offers that as an issue he has compromised on, though some of us might prefer that he hadn\u2019t.\n\nLast November\u2019s Republican landslide in Congress wasn\u2019t so much about Republicans winning as it was about Democrats losing, Sanders declares; more than 60 percent of people didn\u2019t vote. He says when he ran for re-election to the Senate from Vermont in 1983, voter turnout nearly doubled because he was able to get first-time and low-income voters engaged. He acknowledges that he has yet to draw a significant number of African-American supporters but says he isn\u2019t yet widely known, and that Clinton benefits from her husband\u2019s popularity with black voters. Sanders says his economic and criminal-justice priorities would benefit African-Americans, who disproportionately suffer in those areas.\n\nIf you focus on how much some of Sanders\u2019 intentions depart from even mainstream Democrats\u2019, it\u2019s a longshot campaign. Then again, consider what could happen if Clinton\u2019s numbers go down, the Democratic establishment can\u2019t succeed at throwing a fresh roadblock in Sanders\u2019 path, and the Republican establishment doesn\u2019t succeed at doing the same to Donald Trump. In a matchup between those two, I\u2019d put my money on Sanders, who\u2019s not only speaking for real people, but actually making a lot of sense.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bernie Sanders has a longshot campaign, but his message is resonating with Democratic voters.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "Bernie Sanders has a longshot campaign, but his message is resonating with Democratic voters.", "title": "Sanders\u2019 message catches on in key states", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/sanders-message-catches-on-in-key-states/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-facebook.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bernie Sanders has a longshot campaign, but his message is resonating with Democratic voters.", "site": "@seattletimes", "card": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-twitter.png", "title": "Sanders\u2019 message catches on in key states"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2015-09-10 17:13:51", "modified_time": "2015-09-10 17:40:30"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Opinion, Editorials"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1566\"", "article_summary": "Bernie Sanders has a longshot campaign, but his message is resonating with Democratic voters.\nThat\u2019s putting the Democratic Party establishment in something of a pickle.\nAs poll after poll shows him inching toward Hillary Clinton among Democratic voters \u2014 and overtaking her in New Hampshire \u2014 Bernie Sanders admits he\u2019s stunned.\nIf you focus on how much some of Sanders\u2019 intentions depart from even mainstream Democrats\u2019, it\u2019s a longshot campaign.\nSanders suggests party leaders \u201cdon\u2019t like me very much.\u201d Or maybe they think he can\u2019t win."}
