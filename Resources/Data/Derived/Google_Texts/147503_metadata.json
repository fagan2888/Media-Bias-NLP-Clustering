Bernie Sanders, who happens to be rising in the polls in early voting states Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\n\"Your campaign is essentially fighting with him now in a way that is casting aspersions on his character, calling him dishonest,\u201d Maddow said to Clinton.\n\nEarlier this week, Clinton attacked Sanders for a vote he made in 2005 on a bill backed by the NRA that would provide legal immunity to gun manufacturers if their weapons were used to commit a crime.\n\nChelsea Clinton also hammered the candidate on Tuesday over health care, saying he would \"dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the [Children's Health Insurance Program], dismantle Medicare and dismantle private insurance.\"\n\nMaddow called out Hillary Clinton on her campaign's recent attacks.\n\n\u201cThe character of the campaign, the tone of the campaign, the way you are trying to persuade those undecided voters seems to have changed a little bit in the last week or so. Just this afternoon, your campaign, in my estimation, set its hair on fire a little bit,\u201d Maddow told the candidate, pointing to a press phone call that happened earlier that day in which Clinton's campaign asserted that Sanders attacked her in his latest ad.\n\nWatch the Bernie Sanders' advertisement \"Two Visions,\" mentioned by Clinton's campaign, here:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clinton insisted she and Sanders \"engage on substantive differences.\"", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-01-16 18:10:39 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Clinton insisted she and Sanders \"engage on substantive differences.\"", "title": "Rachel Maddow Accuses HIllary Clinton Of 'Casting Aspersions' On Bernie Sanders' Character", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rachel-maddow-hillary-clinton-sanders_us_569901f6e4b0b4eb759e124e", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/569955d81a00005a00ab0aea.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Clinton insisted she and Sanders \"engage on substantive differences.\"", "creator": "@judah_robinson", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/569955d81a00005a00ab0aea.png", "height": 1000}, "title": "Rachel Maddow Accuses HIllary Clinton Of 'Casting Aspersions' On Bernie Sanders' Character", "site": "@HuffPostMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-15 18:10:39 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_569901f6e4b0b4eb759e124e", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "media", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "MSNBC,Rachel Maddow,Hillary Clinton,2016,election,Democratic Primary,Iowa,Bernie Saners", "article": {"section": "Media", "tag": "MSNBC,Rachel Maddow,Hillary Clinton,2016,election,Democratic Primary,Iowa,Bernie Saners", "published_time": "2016-01-15 18:10:39 -0500", "modified_time": "2016-01-15 18:10:39 -0500", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/JudahRobinson"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "\"Your campaign is essentially fighting with him now in a way that is casting aspersions on his character, calling him dishonest,\u201d Maddow said to Clinton.\nChelsea Clinton also hammered the candidate on Tuesday over health care, saying he would \"dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the [Children's Health Insurance Program], dismantle Medicare and dismantle private insurance.\"\nEarlier this week, Clinton attacked Sanders for a vote he made in 2005 on a bill backed by the NRA that would provide legal immunity to gun manufacturers if their weapons were used to commit a crime.\nWatch the Bernie Sanders' advertisement \"Two Visions,\" mentioned by Clinton's campaign, here:\nMaddow called out Hillary Clinton on her campaign's recent attacks."}
