The Kootenay Lake trip is free; the ride to Saltspring Island costs nearly $60 for a car and two passengers.\n\nThe government provides, for free, the 20-minute ferry ride from Shelter Bay across Upper Arrow Lake to Galena, but its ferry corporation charges $35 for the 10-minute ride from Buckley Bay to Denman Island.\n\nThe inland ferry system is regarded as part of the highway system, the coastal ferry system isn\u2019t. Why?\n\nIf the Kootenay ferry service stopped, the result would be, at most, inconvenience \u2014 people could still drive from Nelson to Creston on pavement. Without the Saltspring ferry service, the island\u2019s residents would be stranded and its commerce crippled.\n\nB.C.\u2019s inland ferry service is part of the Ministry of Transportation and charges no fares, while coastal ferries operate under a supposedly independent corporation that is constantly raising fares. Those rising fares, says a study done by the Union of B.C. Municipalities, have reduced ridership and have hit coastal communities with higher costs, reduced business and lower real-estate values. The result, says the report, is a $2.3-billion loss to the B.C. economy.\n\nThe dichotomy of the two ferry services is no mystery. Most of the inland ferry routes take five or 10 minutes, and the vessels required are much cheaper to operate than those that ply coastal routes. It\u2019s all about money.\n\nSweet things were whispered in our ears when the B.C. Liberal government went through the motions of privatizing B.C. Ferries: \u201cThe new structure will help ensure services are delivered on time and on budget,\u201d said Judith Reid, transportation minister at the time. \u201cIt will create a vibrant, properly managed ferry system that improves customer service, creates new jobs for coastal communities, ensures stable rates and is sustainable for the future.\u201d\n\nTrouble is, we Islanders \u2014 and others who depend on coastal ferries \u2014 are not a cheap date when it comes to ferry service. While the two major ferry routes make money, the others can never be profitable, especially the northern routes.\n\nBut then, highways and bridges aren\u2019t profitable either, and no one expects them to be. It is accepted that the cost of building and maintaining transportation infrastructure is something we share as taxpayers. Ferries should be regarded as part of that infrastructure and ferry routes as extensions of highways.\n\nB.C. Transit fares pay about a third of the cost of running the system; ferry passengers pay more than 70 per cent of the ferry system\u2019s costs. Vancouver Islanders\u2019 taxes help build highways through the province, including the $800-million Sea-to-Sky Highway. We understand \u2014 it\u2019s good for the whole province. Let\u2019s regard ferries in the same light.\n\nWhen his government formed the provincial ferry system more than 50 years ago, former premier W.A.C. Bennett understood that ferries were vital to the well-being of island and coastal communities.\n\nB.C.\u2019s ferry system has enabled regions to grow and thrive that would have otherwise dwindled. People built homes and followed dreams on the promise that ferries would serve them. Raising fares beyond affordability breaks that promise.\n\nWhile we might look with envy at the free inland ferries, we also recognize reality. The operation of those little ferries is minute compared to the cost of the coastal ferry system.\n\nWe do not expect nor do we propose that coastal ferry fares be abolished \u2014 that would be unwise \u2014 but the fares should be affordable, and that can be achieved by spreading the load among all British Columbians.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Times Colonist", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ferry ride from Balfour to Kootenay Bay takes 35 minutes, the same time as the trip from Swartz Bay to Saltspring Island\u2019s Fulford Harbour.
