These infection may occur in a postoperative wound or as a complication unrelated to the disease or condition. This report, Healthcare-Associated Infection (HAI) Control Markets: focuses on the market opportunities for companies that can assist hospitals and other healthcare facilities with important HAI mitigation tasks including: preventing, testing and treating infections in the healthcare environment.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that around 1 in 20 or 5% of hospitalized patients will contract an HAI. Worldwide, the rate of nosocomial infections is between 3.5% and 12% of admissions in developed regions. This is driving the demand for products and services. The report focuses on three areas: Prevention, Testing and Treatment and will provide a market analysis for each of the important segments:\n\nDisinfection\n\nWide-Area Sterilization\n\nDevice Sterilization\n\nHAI Testing \u2013 C.diff\n\nHAI Testing \u2013 MRSA\n\nHAI Testing - Others\n\nHAI Treatment \u2013Antibiotic Products\n\n\n\nFor each larger segment (Prevention, Testing and Treatment) company market share is provided. For each larger segment (Prevention, Testing, Treatment) regional market share is provided for the following countries and regions: US, Europe, Eastern Europe, Japan, Canada, China, Mexico, Brazil, Africa, India, Rest of World.\n\nMarket analysis in this report considers primarily the epidemiological considerations and the size patient groups both in the United States and globally, where available. We have accumulated the most recent data available, understanding that virtually no organization does extensive studies on these applications on a regular basis. Many studies are highly localized and may only apply to a community, state or country (more often countries that are not a part of the majormarkets for nosocomial diagnostic and therapeutic products). In many instances, we have had to draw from broader epidemiologic data, that is, on data that reach outside of the hospital and primary care environment in order to construct a picture of the infection prevention, testing and treatment needs.\n\nAs part of the report's coverage, the following trends are discussed:\n\n\n\nNosocomial Infection Statistics\n\nAffordable Care Act (ACA) Funding\n\nPopulations at Risk for Infection\n\nInfection Risk Assessments by Hospital Department\n\nIncreased Hospital Length of Stay for HAIs\n\nInternational Trends in Nursing Facilities\n\nU.S. Government's National Plan to Prevent Healthcare\n\nGovernment Funding for HAI Prevention Infrastructure Activities\n\nIsrael Reduction in HAIs\n\nArizona Prevention Study\n\nConnecticut Funding for HAI Prevention and Reporting\n\nPennsylvania Study of HAI Admissions and Readmissions\n\nInfections and Drug Resistance\n\nScreening Trends\n\nTrends in Partnerships and Alliances\n\nCurrent Burden of HAI Statistics\n\nThe analysis presented in this report is based on data from a combination of company, government, industry, institutional and private sources. It includes information from extensive literature reviews and discussions with experts in the field, including microbiologists, pathologists, hospital authorities, reimbursement specialists, research scientists, business development managers and marketing managers.\n\nONE: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nOverview\n\n\n\nThe Nosocomial Infection\n\n\n\nScope and Methodology\n\nTotal Size and Growth of the
