Partial-birth abortion with taxpayer funding, with no notification for parents in any circumstances \u2013 91 percent of Americans say that\u2019s nuts,\u201d Cruz told an Iowa crowd last Monday, according to CNN.\n\n\u201cSo what do they do, they try to shift it. The war on women wasn\u2019t that, it was contraceptives,\u201d Cruz continued. \u201cNow listen, I have been a conservative my entire life. I have never met anybody, any conservative who wants to ban contraceptives.\u201d\n\nThe so-called \u201cwar on women\u201d was \u201cconcocted\u201d by the Democratic Party to attack conservatives and pro-lifers and divert the public\u2019s attention away from the party\u2019s radical stance on abortion, Cruz said.\n\nSIGN THE NEW PLEDGE: I Pledge to Vote for a Pro-Life Candidate for President\n\n\u201cImagine for a second you\u2019re Hillary Clinton,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to think, \u2018How do I run?\u2019 Well you can\u2019t run on the economy because we have the lowest percentage of Americans working any year since 1977. You can\u2019t run on Obamacare because millions of people have lost their jobs, lost their health care, lost their doctors, seen their premiums skyrocket. You certainly can\u2019t run on foreign policy because every country you touched as secretary of state is a disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what do you do? You go, \u2018Ah, ha! Condom police. I\u2019m gonna make up a completely made up threat and try to scare a bunch of folks into thinking someone\u2019s going to steal their birth control,\u2019\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWhat nonsense.\u201d\n\nCruz is correct that Clinton\u2019s abortion stance is out of touch with most Americans. A May 2015 Gallup poll found that 54 percent of Americans want all or most abortions to be illegal. Only 29 percent, like Clinton, said abortion should be legal under any circumstances, according to the poll.\n\nA 2014 CNN poll also confirmed that a majority of Americans want all or most all abortions made illegal.\n\nCruz has been a vocal opponent of abortion and Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion business. Last Thursday, Cruz voted with fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate to de-fund the Planned Parenthood abortion business after it was caught selling the body parts of aborted babies.\n\n\u201cThe vote we took today is a significant step towards repealing every word of Obamacare,\u201d Cruz said in a statement after the vote. \u201cThis bill repeals as much of that failed law as we can under arcane Senate rules and the narrow guidelines of the budget. I am also encouraged that this bill prohibits taxpayer funds from going to abortion-providers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "title": "Ted Cruz: Pro-Abortion Claim There\u2019s a Pro-Life War on Women is \u201cNonsense\u201d", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/12/10/ted-cruz-pro-abortion-claim-theres-a-pro-life-war-on-women-is-nonsense/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tedcruz8.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw=="}, "article_summary": "SIGN THE NEW PLEDGE: I Pledge to Vote for a Pro-Life Candidate for President\u201cImagine for a second you\u2019re Hillary Clinton,\u201d Cruz said.\nRepublican presidential candidate Ted Cruz called out Hillary Clinton last week for trying to hide her radical position on abortion behind fake \u201cwar on women\u201d rhetoric.\nThe war on women wasn\u2019t that, it was contraceptives,\u201d Cruz continued.\n\u201cThe vote we took today is a significant step towards repealing every word of Obamacare,\u201d Cruz said in a statement after the vote.\n\u201cHillary Clinton embraces abortion on demand in all circumstances up until the moment of birth."}
