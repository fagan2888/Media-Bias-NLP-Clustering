The image is so vivid that you almost forget you are actually sitting in an office in San Francisco, wearing a virtual reality (VR) headset.\n\nImportance of mindfulness\n\nMoodMe, a new VR application, gives users similar experiences with the aim to change moods in a positive way, specifically through yoga and meditation. Co-founders Oksana Zavoyko, a psychologist and author of \u201cDreambook,\u201d and Nisa Ahmadova, a software engineer, developed MoodMe, an app in which a user can step onto the beach in Bali, to see, hear and \u201cjoin\u201d the practice of a yoga expert.Through virtual reality, the brain can succumb to compelling evidence that you are actually somewhere else. The MoodMe team believes that not only putting users in a relaxing location, but also completing the exercises, can shift your mood and teach you to live a more mindful life \u2014 overcoming the stresses encountered in everyday life.Others believe that mediation\u2019s goal in being mindful is best applied to daily life: practicing yoga or meditation on a beach in Bali removes one\u2019s self from reality and avoids life\u2019s stress-triggering events.The MoodMe team aims for their app to become a place to find calm, focus and energy. A use case is if you are at work and just came out of a stressful meeting, you can put the headset on and be transported to a different place, in order to instantly change your mood.Additionally, in virtual reality, you can enter the space with yoga or meditation masters from around the world. For those who practice regularly, they can learn from a wide range of teachers who come from different backgrounds. For yoga novices, mind and body experiences are shared with the teacher, something only possible when physically present with the teacher, or with MoodMe through immersion in virtual reality.\n\nMindfulness, writes Karen Kissel Wegela Ph.D. in Psychology Today, teaches us how to be unconditionally present, no matter what is happening. \u201cWhen we are mindful, we show up for our lives.\u201d\n\nVR\u2019s role in meditation, mindfulness\n\nFor example: have you ever felt, when you are running late, that you must get there on time, no matter the consequences? You\u2019ll swerve between traffic, almost hit a pedestrian, lash out at the driver who took too long at the stop sign, a danger to yourself and others.\u201cYou\u2019re basically a lizard, you\u2019re basically a reptile because you\u2019re in your reptilian brain, or you\u2019re an early mammal that doesn\u2019t have the capacity for higher order functioning,\u201d says Donnovan Somera Yisrael, health educator for iThrive Vaden Health Promotion Services at Stanford University.Our brain and emotions have developed further since this reptilian or early mammal phase, but under stress conditions, like you feel when you are running late, you can revert back to this primitive state. \u201cYou cannot manage your emotions and body and central nervous system when you don\u2019t know what it needs,\u201d Yisrael said. That\u2019s when mindfulness can come into play.Yisrael told Peninsula Press that the central nervous system is the body\u2019s operating system. It needs a feedback loop \u2014 like a fire alarm needs to know there is smoke to turn on the sprinklers. Since you need to know what your system needs to calm down, to focus and to be present, mindfulness can help you become aware of yourself and your body.\u201cIdeally, mindfulness can be practiced in our real lives,\u201d said Yisrael, but it can also be practiced in a controlled setting through meditation. Being fully present in the body, according to Zavoyko, makes the environment in which we choose to meditate, crucial. The MoodMe app lets users choose a space \u2014 a feature that might help users feel more comfortable in an ideal environment.Zavoyko is currently in India, filming yoga classes and scenery in 360-degree video.\n\nWith the MoodMe app, the team combines \u201cmodern virtual reality and ancient yoga technique\u201d to bring a sense of presence to the user. With the immersive nature of virtual reality, the body can feel present in Bali, Thailand or India.\n\nBut while VR can help people be mindful by virtual means, some argue that if you need your virtual reality headset to be mindful, you are relying too much on the technology. MoodMe\u2019s Zavoyko and Ahmadova hope their users will be able to take what they practice inside of virtual reality back to the real world, where mindfulness can be applied.(Editor\u2019s Note: Reporter Naomi Cornman works in the Stanford Virtual Human Interaction Lab as a graduate student researcher and is the media and communications lead with Rabbit Hole VR.)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "A new VR application hopes to change moods in a positive way through virtual yoga and meditation.", "title": "Meditating in virtual reality - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/VR-meditation.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-17T06:58:46+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/12/16/virtual-reality-and-meditation/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Business + Tech", "tag": "VR app", "published_time": "2015-12-16T07:01:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-17T06:58:46+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new VR application hopes to change moods in a positive way through virtual yoga and meditation.", "creator": "@naomicornman", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/VR-meditation.jpg", "title": "Meditating in virtual reality - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The image is so vivid that you almost forget you are actually sitting in an office in San Francisco, wearing a virtual reality (VR) headset.\nBut while VR can help people be mindful by virtual means, some argue that if you need your virtual reality headset to be mindful, you are relying too much on the technology.\nWith the immersive nature of virtual reality, the body can feel present in Bali, Thailand or India.\nWith the MoodMe app, the team combines \u201cmodern virtual reality and ancient yoga technique\u201d to bring a sense of presence to the user.\nMoodMe\u2019s Zavoyko and Ahmadova hope their users will be able to take what they practice inside of virtual reality back to the real world, where mindfulness can be applied."}
