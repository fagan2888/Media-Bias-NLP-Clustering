The fee is $300 for a house call.\n\nPager, the app created by former Uber engineer Oscar Salazar and funded by venture capitalist Gaspard de Dreuzy, launched in Manhattan in May and has been making pin-dropped house calls ever since. Now the company is looking to expand to other areas like Boston.\n\nRelated: Telemedicine: Can \u2018Docs in a Box\u2019 Save the Health Care System?\n\n\u201cThe company is definitely considering Boston, because average waits there for primary care appointments exceed the national average,\u201d a Pager spokeswoman told the Boston Business Journal.\n\nTo use Pager, people just open the app and hit a button that searches for the closest available physicians \u2013 similar to how Uber searches for cars. The screen displays board-certified doctors\u2019 pictures, credentials and specialties \u2013 and users can choose which one they want.\n\nThen, within five minutes, the doctor of your choice will call you. The service does not accept insurance. Consultations by phone cost $50 and house calls are $300. Unlike Uber, Pager doesn\u2019t have surge pricing\u2026yet.\n\nAccording to the service\u2019s website, Pager is available for iPhone in Manhattan and Brooklyn from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day. It cautions that people should not use the app in cases of emergencies. The app isn\u2019t meant to replace hospital visits or trips to the emergency room either; it\u2019s aimed at relieving wait times at walk-in clinics.\n\nA spate of other telemedicine companies are trying to serve the same purpose, as well as cutting health care costs. Apps like Doctor on Demand and MDLive connect physicians and patients through skype-like video conferencing.\n\nA study by the Affiliated Workers Association found that more than 36 million Americans have already used telemedicine in some way, and as many as 70 percent of doctor visits can be handled over the phone \u2013 which typically cost much less than an in-person visit.\n\nRelated: Another Lawmakers Sues Obama Over Health Care Law\n\nThe move toward more telemedicine has received attention from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who are pushing for more federal programs to use the technology.\n\nCurrently Medicare reimburses telehealth for patients only outside city limits or in areas with a provider shortage. One measure, sponsored by Rep. Gregg Harper (R-MS), would expand that to large metropolitan areas as well.\n\nTelemedicine proponents say the technology can produce major cost savings to both doctors and patients.\n\nA study by researchers at Health Affairs measured the spending difference between chronically ill Medicare patients who used a telehealth program compared to those who did not. The patients who had used the telehealth program had spending reductions of 7 to 13 percent or $312\u2013$542 per person per quarter compared to those who didn\u2019t.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "\u201cYour doctor is arriving now.\u201d", "title": "The App That Brings a Doctor to Your Door", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/05/App-Brings-Doctor-Your-Door", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08042014_iPhone_Stethoscope.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/05/App-Brings-Doctor-Your-Door", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08042014_iPhone_Stethoscope.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "\u201cYour doctor is arriving now.\u201d", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde16c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYour doctor is arriving now.\u201dA new Uber-like smartphone app that allows people to order a doctor to their home for a consultation by just touching a button is gaining traction across the Northeast.\nA spate of other telemedicine companies are trying to serve the same purpose, as well as cutting health care costs.\nRelated: Telemedicine: Can \u2018Docs in a Box\u2019 Save the Health Care System?\nUnlike Uber, Pager doesn\u2019t have surge pricing\u2026yet.\nTo use Pager, people just open the app and hit a button that searches for the closest available physicians \u2013 similar to how Uber searches for cars."}
