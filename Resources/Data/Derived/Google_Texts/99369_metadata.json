The current bull market has been on an easy ride for 5 \u00bd years and some believe it is well overdue for a correction.\n\nRelated: Stock Selloff Could Get Better Before It Gets Worse\n\nCorrections can be healthy for markets, say experienced investors. Barring a worldwide disaster \u2013 Earth Hit by Gigantic Asteroid, for instance \u2013 the correction is like a house cleaning that is short lived, allows markets to consolidate, and paves the way for new highs.\n\nStill, many investors were hoping for a strong finish to the calendar year despite the confluence of negative headwinds, which include a possible recession in Europe, the war against ISIS, and even headlines about Ebola in the U.S.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s October \u2013 a month that often takes a chunk out of your portfolio. As of Thursday morning, the DJIA hasn\u2019t hit a 10 percent correction \u2013 it\u2019s down 7 \u00bd percent.

Your emotions. The market goes up and down \u2013 and over time it has gone up. If you\u2019re comfortable your asset allocation is correct, then you\u2019re in a good position to ride through the anxiety that goes hand-in-hand with a correction.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A correction, like the one some benchmark indices have entered or are approaching, is", "title": "Stock Market Correction: What It Is and What You Need to Know", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/16/Stock-Market-Correction-What-It-and-What-You-Need-Know", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07092014_Stock_Market_Ticker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/16/Stock-Market-Correction-What-It-and-What-You-Need-Know", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07092014_Stock_Market_Ticker.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@maurmack"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A correction, like the one some benchmark indices have entered or are approaching, is", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd15e0\"", "article_summary": "A correction, like the one some benchmark indices have entered or are approaching, is a normal, if painful, part of stock market cycles.\nThe market goes up and down \u2013 and over time it has gone up.\n\u201cA bear market happens when equity prices keep falling and investors keep selling into a downturn of 20 percent or more for the overall market.\u201dThe ripple effects once in bear market territory could be far more dramatic.\nRelated: Fear Goes Viral on Wall Street\u201cA correction is shorter in length and generally less damaging to investors than a bear market,\u201d as CNBC put it.\nThe current bull market has been on an easy ride for 5 \u00bd years and some believe it is well overdue for a correction."}
