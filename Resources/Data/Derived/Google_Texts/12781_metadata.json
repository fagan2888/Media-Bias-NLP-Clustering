In a lengthy Twitter essay, the humorist offered an elegant rebuttal to Jonathan Chait\u2019s New York Magazine piece decrying political correctness as a threat to the left. Read the full argument below:\n\n1 I acknowledge the phenomena he is describing is an actual thing. I was on a campus in the 90s and am on the Internet now. \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\n2 I've seen and occasionally been confronted by principled passion and vitriol in response to what I thought was a mild opinion \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\n3 I have flustered at the suggestion that my opinion is simply invalid due to my privilege. \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\n4 I have watched sides entrench, circular arguments tighten into sanctimonious death spirals and jockeying for grievance status \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\n5 sometimes I conclude that some people just want to fight for its own sake. It offers them something. The other is not important. \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\n6 it was ever thus online, however, as it was ever thus in every smelly college coffee house ever. \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\n8 there are toxic, pointless arguments all over the Internet since internet began. Social justice is just one flavor of contentiousness. \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\n9 but I will say that the \"PC\" critiques, even at their most infuriating to me, almost always make me think and yes check my privilege \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\n10 I'd never heard of cis-gender until it had been hurled at me as an invalidating insult on Twitter. I bet it's true for @jonathanchait too \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\n11 but I am glad I know it now. I am glad to give these issues thought. It enlarges me \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\n12 it enlarges me to be called out, even when I conclude the caller is a troll, and especially when it's by a person I respect. \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\n13 and @jonathanchait offers very little evidence against this form of contentiousness other than anxiety/hurt feelings of some colleagues \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\n14 to suggest that somehow this discourse is hurting its own side has a name: concern trolling. \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\n15 but I don't want to invalidate @jonathanchait's argument but to make a counter argument of my own. \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\n16 if @jonathanchait and heroes of mine like @sullydish want to make common cause against \"SJW\"s with gamergate that's fine. \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\n17 but that's the first time I've ever typed gamergate into a tweet ever. \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015", "article_metadata": {"description": "The humorist and former \"PC guy\" had an eloquent response to Chait's anti-political correctness screed", "author": "Anna Silman", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The humorist and former \"PC guy\" had an eloquent response to Chait's anti-political correctness screed", "title": "John Hodgman rebuts Jonathan Chait in dazzling Twitter essay", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/27/pc_guy_john_hodgman_rebuts_jonathan_chaits_anti_political_correctness_argument_with_an_epic_twitter_essay/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-19-at-12.27.04-PM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The humorist and former \"PC guy\" had an eloquent response to Chait's anti-political correctness screed", "creator": "@annaesilman", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-19-at-12.27.04-PM.png", "title": "John Hodgman rebuts Jonathan Chait in dazzling Twitter essay", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "John Hodgman rebuts Jonathan Chait in dazzling Twitter essay", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 20154 I have watched sides entrench, circular arguments tighten into sanctimonious death spirals and jockeying for grievance status \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 20155 sometimes I conclude that some people just want to fight for its own sake.\n\u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015\n\u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 20156 it was ever thus online, however, as it was ever thus in every smelly college coffee house ever.\n\u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 201513 and @jonathanchait offers very little evidence against this form of contentiousness other than anxiety/hurt feelings of some colleagues \u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 201514 to suggest that somehow this discourse is hurting its own side has a name: concern trolling.\n\u2014 John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 201517 but that's the first time I've ever typed gamergate into a tweet ever."}
