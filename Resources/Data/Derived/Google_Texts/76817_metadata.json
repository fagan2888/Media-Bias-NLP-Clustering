They thought maybe she\u2019d picked up a little bit from them about how people respond to awkward secret arrangements and contrived ways of not telling the full story.\n\nThis has been a surprising two weeks for aides in President Barack Obama\u2019s orbit as they\u2019ve watched Hillary Clinton\u2019s email mess unfold.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt isn\u2019t that Obama and Clinton like or don\u2019t like each other, or that their aides still have hard feelings left over from the 2008 primary campaign. In the White House, as conversations with current and former aides make clear, they want her to win \u2014 after all, so much of what they\u2019ve achieved depends on her getting into the Oval Office to keep it going. The Democratic nomination is all but hers, the Republican field still looking weak to them, and they\u2019re counting on her.\n\nAnd now?\n\nTo sum up the feelings, all the way up to the highest levels: What. The. Hell.\n\nWith so much on the line, with so much time to prepare, she\u2019s back to classic Clinton? She\u2019s flubbing a campaign kickoff eight years in the making because she somehow thought that no one would ever care that she set up a secret email server? That anyone would then accept her word that it was OK that she deleted 30,000 emails even though the State Department had been asking for some of them? And then go silent again?\n\nAfter all, 2008\u2019s \u201cChange you can believe in\u201d campaign slogan wasn\u2019t just a reference to George W. Bush. It was also about her, and the uneasy feeling many people had that with Clinton, something else was always going on.\n\nObama aides had had that feeling themselves, even after she joined the administration and their staffs tried following Obama\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s leads in building mutual trust, almost to the point of suspension of disbelief.\n\n\u201cYou never feel like you\u2019re quite getting the full story, because everyone\u2019s got some side deal or some complicating factor,\u201d said one former Obama aide, reflecting on dealing with Clinton and her circle. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a conscious effort to watch out for scams. It was more just, you know who you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\n\nObama put the priority on keeping clear records when he issued guidelines about using official email accounts, one White House aide noted after Clinton\u2019s news conference, while obviously the former secretary of state determined her priority was something else.\n\nSay what you will about the Obama White House \u2014 and there is a lot to say, from what allies gripe is a disregard for any political interests other than the president\u2019s, to a stumbling learning curve for how things actually get done in Washington \u2014 but the scandals of Obama\u2019s past six years have never been about personal gain.\n\nPolitical malpractice, ridiculous management failures, an often insistently tin ear for what Americans say they want to hear out of their leaders, sure. As much as critics complain that Obama\u2019s not running the country or the world well, no one\u2019s said that he or the people close to him are putting money in their pockets, or cutting a corner or fudging the rules out of \u201cconvenience,\u201d or because technically it\u2019s allowed, or because no one specifically told them no.\n\nRewind to the 1990s and it\u2019s almost amazing to think about: More than two years into Obama\u2019s second term and more than two months into Republican control of Congress, there still hasn\u2019t been a special prosecutor. The situations that seemed like they were getting close\u2014 the supposed IRS investigation into tea party groups, probably most of all \u2014 have fizzled under more scrutiny and information. The Veterans Affairs scandal, the only one that got so bad he had to toss out a Cabinet secretary over it, has stabilized enough that Obama\u2019s comfortable making a special trip Friday to the Phoenix facility that sparked the outrage to brag about how much his administration\u2019s gotten changed. And nothing shook the West Wing like the Obamacare website launch, that still, no one\u2019s really been able to explain how it went that wrong.\n\nRepublican rhetoric has burned hot: \u201cThis looks an awful lot like Iran-Contra,\u201d Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), then-chairman of the Government Oversight Committee, said at one point about the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d gun operation. \u201cThis makes Watergate look like child\u2019s play,\u201d then-Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) said about Solyndra. Also said to be worse than Watergate over Obama\u2019s time in office: Fast and Furious, national security leaks, the efforts to keep Joe Sestak out of a 2010 Pennsylvania Senate primary, and, of course, Benghazi.\n\nBut no charges ever stuck, and Benghazi is the only one that\u2019s drawn a special House committee to investigate. It\u2019s the only one that continues to unspool new questions. But that one is about Clinton, not Obama \u2014 and has stayed alive not because anyone has yet found anything actually wrong but because there keeps being just enough there to raise more questions about what exactly she was up to.\n\nA lot of this has to do with what Obama aides refer to as a culture clash. The Clintons look for loopholes, they say, while Obama takes a special pride, particularly on transparency issues, in sticking to the letter of the law: a combination of cockiness that he\u2019s right, so why not let everyone see how he got there, as well as a background awareness that any scandal would be a scandal for the first African-American president.\n\n\u201cThe president has been willing to say and implement provocative policies to shake up Washington,\u201d said one current White House aide. \u201cWillingness to send those signals is a good way to make clear to people that this is the way we\u2019re going to do business: differently.\u201d\n\nStill, Obama aides make sure to acknowledge, Clinton is, of course, held to a different standard: Her email\u2019s a major scandal, while no one except the people sending out pro-Clinton talking points pays any attention to Jeb Bush\u2019s or Scott Walker\u2019s.\n\nWhat\u2019s confusing to them is how she didn\u2019t acknowledge that herself, or care. They don\u2019t like to admit it around the West Wing, but as a former first lady and Obama\u2019s main opponent in 2008, Clinton did get more latitude than other Cabinet secretaries in all sorts of decisions, from staffing on down. They\u2019re just hoping that this email server \u2014 \u201cthe president 100 percent would not have done it this way,\u201d the former aide said, \u201cthis is such a clearly nontransparent way of going about it\u201d \u2014 is the extent of the latitude she took that they didn\u2019t know about.\n\nThen again, the White House didn\u2019t know she deleted 30,000 emails until they watched her announce it at her news conference on Tuesday. And aides acknowledge that they don\u2019t know how much more they don\u2019t know.\n\nFor now, they\u2019re holding off on their complaints. Dismissive of the actual importance of the email flap and sensitive to how rough the past two weeks have been for Clinton, current and former aides say they want to avoid piling on.\n\nAnd in the West Wing, they say they feel satisfied with this test run of how the dynamic between the White House and the Clinton campaign is going to work.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be other issues that crop up,\u201d the current White House aide said, \u201cand we want to maintain the kind of relationship that will allow us to coordinate our efforts effectively.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "To sum up the feelings, all the way up to the highest levels: What.
