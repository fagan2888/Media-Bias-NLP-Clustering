As such, the emergence of skinny plans is best viewed as one of the more significant unintended consequences of the ACA.\n\nSo, why is AB 248 necessary? Without this law, employers will be able to avoid the \u201cfailure to offer\u201d penalty because the skinny plans are considered minimum essential coverage, even though they fail to meet the 60% minimum value requirement of the ACA. So, employers offering a skinny plan may still be subject to penalties, but only for those employees who turn down the skinny plan and who qualify for a subsidy in Covered California.\n\nThese skinny plans hurt employees because they open the door to an erosion of benefits among large employers who currently offer health insurance \u2014 clearly not an intention of the ACA. And for employers who previously did not offer health insurance benefits, skinny plans provide a mechanism for avoiding or reducing tax penalties, while shifting most of the real costs of health insurance onto employees and taxpayers. Skinny plans may also offset some or all of the benefits of recent successful efforts to raise the minimum wage in cities throughout California, including Los Angeles. These plans may increase the likelihood that employers in low-wage industries simply pay for these recent hard-fought wage gains by dramatically reducing health benefits.\n\nSkinny plans hurt California employees by rewarding employers for doing less for their workers, and allowing those costs to continue to be borne (mostly) by others. These plans also create an incentive for employers to pressure their employees not to seek more comprehensive insurance in Covered California, because every employee who receives a subsidy triggers an additional cost to the employer. It\u2019s not difficult to imagine how this \u201cchoice\u201d might create hostility in the workplace, and place employees in an untenable situation where they are viewed as directly responsible for fining their employer.\n\nThe ACA was intended to stabilize health insurance benefits in the large group market and extend similar benefits to those in the small group and individual markets. Congress is gridlocked and, thus unable to fix the unintended consequences caused by skinny plans, but California can and should close this loophole.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>We asked legislators, consumer advocates, employers and insurers to weigh in on a bill in the California Legislature that would prohibit large employers from offering workers \"skinny\" health plans in California.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "We asked legislators, consumer advocates, employers and insurers to weigh in on a bill in the California Legislature that would prohibit large employers from offering workers \u201cskinny\u201d h\u2026", "title": "Should California Prohibit \u2018Skinny\u2019 Health Insurance Plans From Large Employers?", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/should-california-prohibit-skinny-health-insurance-plans-from-large-employers/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-06-22T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And for employers who previously did not offer health insurance benefits, skinny plans provide a mechanism for avoiding or reducing tax penalties, while shifting most of the real costs of health insurance onto employees and taxpayers.\nThe ACA was intended to stabilize health insurance benefits in the large group market and extend similar benefits to those in the small group and individual markets.\nAs such, the emergence of skinny plans is best viewed as one of the more significant unintended consequences of the ACA.\nCongress is gridlocked and, thus unable to fix the unintended consequences caused by skinny plans, but California can and should close this loophole.\nThese skinny plans hurt employees because they open the door to an erosion of benefits among large employers who currently offer health insurance \u2014 clearly not an intention of the ACA."}
