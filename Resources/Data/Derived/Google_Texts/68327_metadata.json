Standing in front of an idyllic waterfall, Ryan said he wanted to see \u201ca standard-bearer that bears our standards\u201d and called on Trump to rein in his worst impulses if he wanted Ryan\u2019s support.\n\nThe two men met days later in Washington, amid wall-to-wall coverage. The meeting was amicable, though noncommittal, with the duo issuing a post-confab statement saying, \u201cWe \u2026 remain confident there\u2019s a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall.\u201d\n\nIn our interview, the speaker put a finer, sharper point on that \u2014 and positioned himself as the conscience of the conservative movement, with plans to counterprogram Trump\u2019s bombast with the low-tax, lean-government budget substance that has made him a darling on the right. And he doesn\u2019t seem to be willing to relinquish the leverage he has gained by holding out, even as top House deputies, like Kevin McCarthy, flock to Trump\u2019s banner.\n\nWhen I asked Ryan whether he intends to keep calling out Trump, he responded like a high school dean talking about a truant who happens to be the most popular kid at school. \u201cI will,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done that in the past, and I will do that in future if need be, and I hope it\u2019s not necessary.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Trump is a conservative \u201cat his core,\u201d Ryan punted.\n\n\u201cYou should ask him those questions,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cI\u2019m not the person to be giving you the breakdown of Donald Trump. That\u2019s not my job and responsibility.\u201d\n\nOK, how about Trump\u2019s prospects in November against Hillary Clinton?\n\nSure, Ryan allowed, he\u2019s got a chance \u2014 and he predicts the rise of \u201cTrump Democrats.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n(Subscribe to POLITICO\u2019s Off Message podcast with Glenn Thrush.)\n\nBut when I pushed him, asked whether he would bet his own money on a Trump victory, he demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not going to \u2014 I\u2019m not a betting man,\u201d he said \u2014 adding a list of conditions that, more or less, contradicted Trump\u2019s entire approach to politics thus far. \u201cI think if we get our party unified, and if we do the work we need to do to get ourselves at full strength, and if we offer the country a clear and compelling agenda that is inspiring, that is inclusive, that fixes problems, that is solutions-based and based on good principles, then, yes, I think we can win.\u201d\n\nRyan wears his new power easily. As House Ways and Means chairman he\u2019d breeze past reporters, earbuds affixed, Zeppelin or AC/DC blaring over questions shouted in his wake by reporters. And he\u2019s retained that same sense of gliding ease after his ascent to the speakership last October.\n\nIn public, he projects an air of bemused tranquility, the more frenzied the moment \u2014 like the mayhem surrounding the Trump state visit \u2014 the wider the Eddie Haskell grin, the sprightlier the stride past the press pack. But there\u2019s an edge to Ryan in private, a whiff of vigilant anxiety \u2014 the knee pivots under the table when we talk.\n\nThe 2012 vice presidential nominee said his biggest regret about that campaign was his excessive seriousness (\u201cI needed to be more unplugged\u201d). He admires Trump\u2019s shoot-from-the-lip style. \u201cI think he\u2019s refreshing in that he takes on political correctness \u2026 the off-the-cuff, more natural, unscripted element is what is refreshing to people,\u201d he said \u2014 but added, \u201cwithin limits.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked whether he thinks he defeated an aggressive and dismissive Joe Biden during their one debate in 2012, Ryan said, \u201cI got exactly what I wanted to get out of that debate. I think I won.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cVoters were asking \u2018Who is this young guy? He looks pretty young. Can he handle himself?\u2019 Joe tried getting me to get rattled, to lose my thought or become intemperate, and an intemperate 68-year-old usually beats an intemperate 42-year-old.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s nothing if not temperate. Ryan still sleeps in his drafty personal office in a House office building, travels back to his family in Janesville, Wisconsin, almost every weekend, rises at dawn to work out, drifts off to bed at 9 most nights and exorcises his demons by mind-moshing to the hard-rock and metal playlist of a Midwestern bro in early middle age. (Among the most animated moments of our conversation: When I mention my annoyance at the installation of screechy Guns N\u2019 Roses singer Axl Rose as a raspy-voiced Brian Johnson\u2019s replacement in AC/DC. \u201cHas he put gravel in his voice?\u201d Ryan asks about Rose. \u201cIf he smoked a couple of packs a day for the last 10 years, maybe he\u2019d be better.\u201d)\n\nSituational awareness, the wary scanning of every situation for hazards, is a hallmark of Ryan\u2019s rapid rise in GOP politics but also a product of childhood tragedies. During high school, he found his father, who ran the family\u2019s generations-old contracting business, dead in bed. Soon after, his grandmother, who was dying of Alzheimer\u2019s, moved in to live out her final years.\n\nWhen I asked one longtime Ryan observer to describe him, he pointed me to New Yorker writer John McPhee\u2019s mid-1960s essay on a then-Princeton basketball player named Bill Bradley. McPhee titled his essay \u201cA Sense of Where You Are,\u201d a reference to Bradley\u2019s intuitive ability to maneuver deftly in tight spaces despite possessing limited athletic talent. \u201cThat\u2019s Paul, too,\u201d the friend said.\n\nIt remains to be seen how deft Ryan really is, although he\u2019s certainly in a tight spot. On one side, he\u2019s hemmed in by Trump \u2014 a more popular figure than he is among Republicans \u2014 an interloper who seized the mantle of party pathfinder that Ryan wanted to occupy when he accepted the speaker\u2019s gavel last fall. On the other is the raucous, ferociously uncooperative Freedom Caucus of hard-core conservatives spooked (and befuddled) by the emergence of a presidential candidate who shares their rage but not necessarily their hard-right policy positions.\n\nRyan\u2019s ability to keep them from sidetracking his speakership is the biggest question he faces. \u201cHopefully, what House conservatives can do is add \u2026 a rudder to the ship to give it some substance and some direction and some vision, along with our nominee,\u201d he said over yards of polished oak tabletop in his conference room on the second floor of the Capitol.\n\nThe carpet and drapes in the speaker\u2019s suite are new \u2014 he ripped out John Boehner\u2019s smoke-sallowed leftovers shortly after taking over \u2014 although half the paintings on the wall are pasteboard replicas of Washington and Jefferson because the Library of Congress wouldn\u2019t subject real oil paintings to Boehner\u2019s nicotine fog.\n\nRyan is only now facing his biggest test as speaker, as he dives into the messy budget process, more than half a year after Boehner did him the supreme favor of finalizing a deal to give his successor breathing room.\n\nRyan\u2019s attitude toward Boehner is ambivalent: He likes the former speaker personally but thinks he didn\u2019t adjust to the changes in his ranks \u2014 and jokes that the Ohio Republican laid on \u201cthe Catholic guilt\u201d with him when McCarthy, who was in line for the job, belly-flopped.\n\n\u201cI think one of the reasons the members wanted me to do this, and get whatever people think power is here, is because I didn\u2019t want it,\u201d Ryan told me. \u201cJohn did everything he could. It\u2019s just I think they realized that I\u2019m more responsible with it and I\u2019m more in this for serving our principles, not serving my career, because I didn\u2019t want this as my career. I think that\u2019s why people are more receptive to my style of leadership and in the kind of direction we\u2019re trying to go.\u201d\n\nBut the notion that the Republican House of Representatives \u2014 the problem child of GOP politics, the source of civil-war government shutdowns, an institution whose approval rating is still sub-20 percent \u2014 can be a rock of reasonable policy stability in the Trump era seems like a frozen-taffy stretch.\n\nTo do that, Ryan is urging his members to do something they have never been able to do: shut up.\n\n\u201cI think some people led others to believe that we could, for instance, get rid of Obamacare while Obama was in office,\u201d he told me, clearly referring to the dozens of feckless anti-Obamacare votes pushed by the tea party. \u201cI think we allowed expectations to rise beyond our capabilities, and that demoralized not only our supporters, our constituents, but our members. And I have worked hard at trying to keep expectations rooted in reality so that we don\u2019t oversell and underdeliver.\u201d\n\nFor all his criticism of Trump, Ryan reserves the real vitriol for Hillary Clinton, dismissing her as \u201cold-fashioned\u201d \u2014 and echoes Trump in suggesting that the former secretary of state hasn\u2019t done much in public life besides soaking up reflected glory. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s been successful in her own right, especially with foreign policy as secretary of state,\u201d he tells me.\n\nHis views on Barack Obama, his bargaining partner for the next nine months, are just as jaundiced. Ryan doesn\u2019t forget the slights over the years \u2014 the president ran against Ryan\u2019s belt-tightening budget plan in 2012 \u2014 and repeatedly attacked him in public. \u201cI think he\u2019s a very dogmatic, ideological person,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m an ideological guy, too, and, you know, to a degree I am. I mean, I\u2019m a conservative.\u201d\n\nRyan offers tempered praise for two Democrats \u2014 both of them Clinton foils. He thinks Joe Biden would have been a \u201ctougher opponent\u201d than Clinton, \u201cfor sure.\u201d\n\nAnd Ryan \u2014 since his teens, a disciple of the conservative, anti-communitarian Austrian school of economic theory \u2014 grudgingly admires the populist messaging of socialist Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cLook, as conservatives, we hate crony capitalism,\u201d added Ryan, who has raised more than his share of cash from the financial services industry. \u201cWe need to do a better job as Republicans, going after crony capitalism. \u2026 In a weird way, this is what Bernie Sanders is railing against, which is a rigged system.\u201d\n\nThe other candidate who has also been raising that issue, of course, is a certain billionaire reality-show star who is targeting the GOP establishment Ryan now (by default) represents.\n\nAnd that\u2019s probably Ryan\u2019s biggest problem with Trump: They don\u2019t agree on policy specifics, despite the businessman\u2019s willingness to shape-shift. Ryan opposes Trump\u2019s Muslim ban, the candidate\u2019s newfound openness to hike taxes on the rich and the minimum wage and Trump\u2019s proposed immigration crackdown, which Ryan views as extreme and impractical.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made no secret about my concern for the tone,\u201d the speaker said of his disagreements with Trump. \u201cBut it was [on] the substance, too.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked him the ultimate question \u2014 is Trump capable of the change Ryan seeks? \u2014 he offered a wry grin.\n\n\u201cAnything is possible.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Sitting down for a lengthy interview, a relaxed but adamant Ryan talks up 'unity' \u2014 but still wants the nominee to clean up his act.", "title": "Ryan: Trump could win, but I\u2019m not \u2018betting\u2019 on it", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/off-message-paul-ryan-trump-could-win-223458", "image": "http://static.politico.com/67/1d/44a00fb140559d45e079070ad136/160522-paul-ryan-bm-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Sitting down for a lengthy interview, a relaxed but adamant Ryan talks up 'unity' \u2014 but still wants the nominee to clean up his act.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Sure, Ryan allowed, he\u2019s got a chance \u2014 and he predicts the rise of \u201cTrump Democrats.\u201d(Subscribe to POLITICO\u2019s Off Message podcast with Glenn Thrush.)\n\u201cBut it was [on] the substance, too.\u201dWhen I asked him the ultimate question \u2014 is Trump capable of the change Ryan seeks?\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to \u2014 I\u2019m not a betting man,\u201d he said \u2014 adding a list of conditions that, more or less, contradicted Trump\u2019s entire approach to politics thus far.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a very dogmatic, ideological person,\u201d Ryan said.\nRyan opposes Trump\u2019s Muslim ban, the candidate\u2019s newfound openness to hike taxes on the rich and the minimum wage and Trump\u2019s proposed immigration crackdown, which Ryan views as extreme and impractical."}
