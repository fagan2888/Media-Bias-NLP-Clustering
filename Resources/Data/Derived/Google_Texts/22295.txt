DENVER — Snow showers are on tap for Sunday afternoon’s Broncos match-up with the Patriots, with as much as 2 inches falling over the urban corridor, according to Kyle Frieden, National Weather Service meteorologist.

The dusting will leave behind messy driving conditions for Monday’s morning commute.

Showers, possibly a mix of snow and rain, are expected to begin between 3 p.m., and 6 p.m., Frieden said.

Denver’s temperature Sunday could reach 48 degrees. Monday is expected to be colder, with a high of 37 degrees.

Temperatures will warm throughout the rest of the week, Frieden said. “If we can get through tomorrow, I think we will see 60 degrees by Friday to remind us that spring is coming.”

The NWS has issued a winter weather advisory for 24 hours beginning at noon Sunday for the northern Colorado mountains where 5 to 13 inches of snow could fall beginning late Sunday morning.

The heaviest snow will fall in the Park Range, north of Rabbit Ears Pass.

“Winter is on up there but it will take a while for the snow to develop down here,” Frieden said.
