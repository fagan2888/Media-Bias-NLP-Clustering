The New York billionaire routinely attacks Carrier Corporation since it announced in February that it would close two Indiana factories and shift about 2,000 heating and air-conditioning jobs to Mexico. Recently a high school basketball game west of here drew national attention after students hoisted Trump signs and taunted \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d at fans from the rival, heavily Latino school.\n\nMany workers remain discouraged. Around Elkhart, \u201cPeople still don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re doing well,\u201d said Mike Perez, a director at Faith Mission, which provides meals for the poor and shelter for about 150 who are homeless. Many earn less than before the recession, he said. \u201cThere still isn\u2019t a sense that everything\u2019s O.K.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2008 Mr. Obama won Indiana, the first Democratic presidential candidate to do so since 1964. In 2012 he did not even contest the state. Among those who opposed him was Mr. Neufeldt. Now 69, he holds four part-time jobs, but boasts that a daughter and three sons-in-law again have good jobs in Elkhart\u2019s boom-and-bust recreational vehicle industry where he worked 32 years. His problem with the president is over abortion.\n\nBrian A. Howey, publisher of the Howey Politics Indiana newsletter and once a reporter in Elkhart, sounded stumped, even allowing for the state\u2019s conservatism: \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong Hoosier. I\u2019m just amazed that not only do people not appreciate what happened in \u201909, but there\u2019s a lot of hostility toward Obama. I think part of it is racial and a lot of it is political.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis state stood to lose 150,000 auto jobs if Chrysler and G.M. had liquidated,\u201d Mr. Howey added. \u201cWe would have had a bona fide depression here.\u201d\n\nSenator Joe Donnelly, a Democrat who represented this area in the House until his election to the Senate in 2012, likewise praised the administration\u2019s auto and financial rescues for averting disaster. \u201cPresident Obama had about half the people on his own team telling him to let Chrysler go,\u201d he recalled.\n\nNow, Mr. Donnelly noted, Chrysler plants employ more than 5,000 people to the south in Kokomo, up from 100 at their nadir, and 7,000 statewide. Yet autoworkers are more apt to complain about the president\u2019s gun proposals than to acknowledge the auto turnaround.\n\nWhile Indiana\u2019s presidential primaries are relatively late in the race \u2014 May 3 \u2014 and polls are lacking, Mr. Howey predicted that Mr. Trump would do well.\n\nPhoto\n\nNearly half of Elkhart County\u2019s jobs are in manufacturing, a higher proportion than in all but 13 of the 3,140 counties nationwide, according to Jerry Conover, director of the Indiana Business Research Center at Indiana University. With so many skilled factory workers, he said, local wages are above national averages though education levels are relatively modest.\n\nFor 2014, economic growth was up 48 percent from 2001, double the nation\u2019s growth rate. Yet the area\u2019s reliance on a narrow range of manufacturing, mostly R.V.-related, makes it \u201cquite vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Conover said. Locals\u2019 awareness of that possibility explains some of their economic insecurity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Obama sought to help the county diversify, with $39 million from the stimulus money to develop electric trucks at a former R.V. factory. But the effort fizzled, the owners sold the plant and now it is back to making R.V.s exclusively. (Mr. Neufeldt, still a believer in Mr. Obama\u2019s push for green jobs, again wears green wristbands to signify that cause.)\n\nAdditional stimulus money went to improve the municipal airport and local highways, buy law enforcement equipment, remove lead and weatherize buildings \u2014 purposes that did not create many jobs but helped avoid layoffs, said Kyle Hannon, the president of the Greater Elkhart Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\u201cWe knew we would be back,\u201d Mr. Hannon said, reflecting locals\u2019 sense of their resilience and self-sufficiency, regardless of government\u2019s hand.\n\nNow, with unemployment so low, local leaders say the challenge is finding workers who can pass employers\u2019 drug tests.\n\n\u201cEverybody is back to work,\u201d Mr. Neufeldt said recently, driving past once-closed plants lining county roads, their lots full of employees\u2019 vehicles and, in many, newly manufactured R.V.s.\n\nMark Dobson, the president of the Economic Development Corporation of Elkhart County, said his group was using social media to advertise widely that Elkhart offers \u201chead-of-household opportunities\u201d \u2014 industrial jobs that pay perhaps $75,000, enough for a single wage earner to sustain a family.\n\n\u201cAnytime we see a mention of a plant closure and some significant number of people who have been laid off\u201d \u2014 like from Carrier \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re making sure they know there are jobs in Elkhart County,\u201d Mr. Dobson said.\n\nBusy employers also are turning to Faith Mission, the homeless shelter. Dan Browning, its programming director, said he gets dozens of calls monthly \u2014 the previous day a boat maker sought 75 workers \u2014 and no longer deals with companies that will not pay more than minimum wage.\n\n\u201cNow the employers are desperate,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore it was the workers who were desperate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160402114813, "twitter": {"description": "Few people are thanking the president for low unemployment.
