After filling out paperwork and presenting an apparently fake identification she was told to wait, according to her attorney, Clarissa Guajardo.\n\nTwo hours later Borrego was finally shown into an examination room but instead of receiving her annual examination she was arrested and taken into custody.\n\nBorrego, 44, was charged with a felony for presenting false identification and has been held in the Harris County jail on a $35,000 bond.\n\n\n\nGuajardo said on Monday said the case could have \u201ca chilling effect\u201d on women seeking medical care, and expressed concern that Borrego has still not received the examination for which she went to the clinic.\n\n\n\nThe attorney said that the family is trying to put together the money to bail Borrego out, after weighing up the risk that federal immigration authorities may take her into custody immediately after she leaves jail and begin deportation proceedings.\n\nAna Rodriguez DeFrates of the Texas Latina Advocacy Network said that the arrest \u201craises serious questions about patient privacy and human rights of immigrant women in Texas\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe sad fact is that many immigrant women in Texas, and across the country, already forgo needed healthcare, live with lumps in their breasts and daily pain, because clinics are inaccessible or put them at risk for deportation,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis is an ongoing human rights crisis, and Blanca Borrego\u2019s arrest shines a light on the struggles of immigrant women, who are routinely denied driver\u2019s licenses, affordable healthcare, and other basic human and civil rights.\u201d\n\n\n\nRodriguez DeFrates said that activists are planning a rally in support of Borrego in Houston this weekend.\n\nBorrego and her family moved from Mexico to Houston in 2003 but overstayed their visas. Borrego and her husband have two daughters, one of whom was born in the US.\n\nBoth accompanied their mother to the Northeast Women\u2019s Healthcare clinic on 27 August, Guajardo said.\n\nGuajardo said she believed the clinic\u2019s actions are a potential violation of federal healthcare privacy laws. Under the HIPAA Act, not only treatment details but also demographic information that can link an individual with his or her health record, such as social security numbers and driving license details, is protected.\n\n\n\nHealthcare providers may only disclose private information to law enforcement in limited circumstances, such as in violent crimes or if workers suspect a crime is being committed on the premises.\n\nGabrielle Lessard, health policy attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, an immigrant rights organisation, said the clinic\u2019s behaviour was \u201creally shocking\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d given the ethical duty of healthcare providers to put their patients\u2019 needs first. She said she had never come across a similar case before.\n\nAlex Loessin, a spokeswoman for Memorial Hermann, the not-for-profit medical group that runs the clinic, did not respond to a request for comment. Last week she told the Houston Press, which first reported the arrest, that she was \u201cunable to provide comment\u201d at the time.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, the clinic issued a statement in which it said it first learned of her residency status from media reports of her detention.\n\n\u201cAs part of our policy and patient privacy requirements, we do not report any undocumented patients to law enforcement,\u201d the clinic said in a statement. \u201cIn this case, law enforcement was called because of a potentially false identification presented at the clinic. Memorial Hermann was never aware of the patient\u2019s resident status.\u201d\n\nContrary to perceptions that undocumented immigrants are a drain on the US healthcare system, a recent study found that they contributed $2.2bn to $3.8bn more than they withdrew annually from 2000 to 2011, creating a surplus that is prolonging the financial viability of Medicare, the federal health insurance programme that covers elderly and disabled people.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers agreed in June to allow undocumented children to receive public healthcare coverage. A proposal that would see California become the first state in the country to allow undocumented immigrants to buy Obamacare coverage is currently before the state legislature.\n\n\n\nIts proponents argue that expanding healthcare access is both humane and financially prudent because people without adequate insurance are more likely to delay treatment until they are seriously ill and need expensive emergency care.\n\nAnthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, an advocacy group, said that the consensus in the state is that \u201chealthcare is no place to do immigration enforcement. You don\u2019t want to have a chilling effect of people not getting emergency, or just needed, care.\u201d\n\nWright said that migrants often express concern about the possible consequences of seeking healthcare and appearing on the radar of government authorities \u2013 including some who are in the country legally but have undocumented relatives. \u201cNo one wants to be the family member that because they signed up for coverage got grandma deported,\u201d he said.\n\nDeFrates, the Texas Latina advocate, said that her group hears every day from women who worry about seeking medical care, which she attributes \u201cto a pervasive fear of deportation that exists when undocumented families are interacting with anyone in a position of authority\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Lawyer for woman who was arrested after providing an apparently false social security card says arrest could have \u2018chilling effect\u2019 on woman seeking care", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Tom Dart", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Lawyer for woman who was arrested after providing an apparently false social security card says arrest could have \u2018chilling effect\u2019 on woman seeking care", "title": "Mexican woman's arrest at clinic 'may deter migrants from seeking healthcare'", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/14/mexican-woman-arrest-clinic-undocumented-migrants-health", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0273d943c0000ac058d3f45ea88a4c0901abc8e1/0_353_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=109aeba358fa62b7e9004d6f63d2132b", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2015/sep/14/mexican-woman-arrest-clinic-undocumented-migrants-health?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/14/mexican-woman-arrest-clinic-undocumented-migrants-health", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2015/sep/14/mexican-woman-arrest-clinic-undocumented-migrants-health?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "creator": "@Tom_Dart", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0273d943c0000ac058d3f45ea88a4c0901abc8e1/0_353_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2015/sep/14/mexican-woman-arrest-clinic-undocumented-migrants-health?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Texas,Mexico,US immigration,US healthcare,Americas,US news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-09-14T19:57:43.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tom-dart", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2015-09-15T13:47:18.000Z", "tag": "Texas,Mexico,US immigration,US healthcare,Americas,US news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0273d943c0000ac058d3f45ea88a4c0901abc8e1/0_353_3504_2103/3504.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=82cb27012819a714709b7eaeef16757a", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Texas,Mexico,US immigration,US healthcare,Americas,US news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1bd7\"", "article_summary": "The arrest of a Mexican woman who was detained after staff at a Texas clinic called the police may deter other undocumented migrants from seeking healthcare, the woman\u2019s lawyer has warned.\nBoth accompanied their mother to the Northeast Women\u2019s Healthcare clinic on 27 August, Guajardo said.\nAna Rodriguez DeFrates of the Texas Latina Advocacy Network said that the arrest \u201craises serious questions about patient privacy and human rights of immigrant women in Texas\u201d.\nBlanca Borrego was detained after she went to a Houston-area clinic on 27 August to see her gynecologist.\nGuajardo said on Monday said the case could have \u201ca chilling effect\u201d on women seeking medical care, and expressed concern that Borrego has still not received the examination for which she went to the clinic."}
