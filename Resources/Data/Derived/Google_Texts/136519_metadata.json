During the broadcast they explained away the Nuggets\u2019 win over Philadelphia on Wednesday as blah between two teams \u201cgoing nowhere.\u201d\n\nThat caught the ears of Nuggets coach Michael Malone, perked them up, and became a phrase that further motivated the already always-motivated Malone to want to get the win over the Lakers even more.\n\n\u201cGoing nowhere?\u201d Malone said. \u201cNo, we\u2019re improving.\u201d\n\nThen his team, now 4 1/2 games out of a playoff spot in the Western Conference, went out and trounced the 15-win Lakers, 116-105.\n\n\u201cI loved how we played,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI thought our defense was pretty good for the most part; we had some lapses. And then I really liked the fact that we are playing for each other. That\u2019s so important going into these last nine, playing for each other on both ends of the floor. It\u2019s another good road win for us, and we have another tough one here on Easter Sunday.\u201d\n\nMudiay vs. Russell. Round four of the Emmanuel Mudiay vs. D\u2019Angelo Russell rivalry \u2014 which was really round three because an injured Mudiay missed the Dec. 22 matchup \u2014 won\u2019t go down as a classic. Russell went down with a sprained ankle, and Mudiay played just 21 minutes in the contest. But Nuggets coach Michael Malone knows what\u2019s brewing between the best point guards of the 2015 draft class.\n\n\u201cI could tell ever since draft night when (Russell) went before Emmanuel that that\u2019s probably going to be a competitive rivalry for many, many years.\u201d Malone said. \u201cAnd I think Emmanuel is a competitor no matter who he\u2019s playing against, but anytime you get a chance to go against D\u2019Angelo Russell, a guy that was taken ahead of him, his antennas were up a little bit. They are going to go after each other.\u201d\n\nBoth have seen gains in their game as the season has worn on. Before Friday\u2019s game, Russell had scored 20 points in seven of his previous 10 games. Mudiay, meanwhile, is averaging 16.8 points per game in March.\n\n\u201cBoth of those young men have really made improvements over the course of the year,\u201d Malone said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what you want to see as a young team with young players, are your players getting better? Are they developing? Obviously, how (Lakers coach) Byron (Scott) does it is his own way and how I do it is my own way. But the bottom line is the guys have improved\u2026\u201d\n\nFaried doesn\u2019t play. Kenneth Faried was available to play, but didn\u2019t on Friday night against the Lakers. He did suit up after going through shootaround in the morning. His next chance to play will be on Sunday when the Nuggets face the L.A. Clippers at the Staples Center.\n\nFollow Chris Dempsey on Twitter @dempseypost or email him at cdempsey@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Nuggets coach Michael Malone motivated by a Lakers pre-game broadcast, round four of Emmanuel Mudiay vs. D'Angelo Russell and other Nuggets notes.", "title": "Pre-game Lakers broadcast gets under Nuggets coach Michael Malone's skin", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2016/03/26/lakers-broadcast-nuggets-michael-malone/14103/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2016/03/JOFFREYAXEL-495x334.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Nuggets coach Michael Malone motivated by a Lakers pre-game broadcast, round four of Emmanuel Mudiay vs. D'Angelo Russell and other Nuggets notes.", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2016/03/26/lakers-broadcast-nuggets-michael-malone/14103/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2016/03/JOFFREYAXEL-495x334.jpg", "title": "Pre-game Lakers broadcast gets under Nuggets coach Michael Malone\u2019s skin", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Christopher Dempsey,D'Angelo Russell,Denver Nuggets,Emmanuel Mudiay,Kenneth Faried,L.A.
