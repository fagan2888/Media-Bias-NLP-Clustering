And yet he was oddly deferential to Fiorina, and at one point suggested that the U.S. should have sent her to the bargaining table to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran rather than Secretary of State John F. Kerry.\n\nThat line may come back to haunt him.\n\nIn the wake of his recent assertion that Trump was a \u201ccancer\u201d on the Republican party and conservative movements after the billionaire businessman and TV showman openly questioned the heroism of Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), a Vietnam War era prisoner of war, one might have expected much sharper rhetoric about Trump tonight.\n\nInstead, he watered down his rhetoric in response to a question of whether, as evidenced by his poll numbers, that Trump was \u201cgetting the best\u201d of the Republicans in the field.\n\n\"When you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, I think that says a lot about him,\u201d Perry said. \u201cOne thing I like to remind people is back in 2007 Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year. I\u2019ll suggest a part of that was his celebrity. Fred Thompson was the other man who spent a lot of time on that screen.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve had my issues with Donald Trump,\u201d Perry prattled on. \u201cI talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism. How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single payer healthcare. I ask that with all due respect. And nobody, nobody on these stages has done more than I have done and the people of the state of Texas to deal with securing that border.\u201d\n\nFor Fiorina, Perry and five others, it was embarrassing to be relegated to the warm up act for the Big Boys who were scheduled to go on the air at 9 p.m. EST. The political world is riveted on that debate, pitting Trump against Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and seven other top-tier GOP candidates gathering in Cleveland at the Quicken Loans Arena.\n\nYet those seven Republican presidential candidates made the best of a bad situation during an early evening consolation round in the near-empty arena hours before the main event.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina who dubbed this the \"happy hour debate\" was hoping to showcase his hardline stands on defense and the war against ISIS. He repeatedly touted his bonafides to be the next commander in chief, and vowed to crush the terrorists with U.S. ground troops and a simple strategy: \u201cWhatever it takes as long as it takes to defeat them.\u201d But he seemed almost lethargic at times, and repeatedly returned to his comfort zone of defense related issues, even when talking about the economy or women\u2019s reproductive rights.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, once a rising star within the GOP, provided scripted, well-rehearsed responses to most of the questions asked of him. The only time he went off book was when he was pressed on whether he thought Ohio Gov. John Kasich was wrong to expand Medicaid in his state. \"I don't think anyone should expand Medicaid, in Ohio and across the country,\u201d according to Jindal. He saved his best comments for his closing remarks, calling out former Florida governor Jeb Bush for arguing that a candidate needs to be willing to \u201close the primary to win the general.\u201d And, in his most eyebrow raising statement, Jindal took on illegal immigration. \u201cWe must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion. We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally. They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, the winner of the 2012 Iowa caucuses, was furious that he was left out of the main event. He had demonstrated why he was able to attract significant support last time \u2013 especially among social conservatives and anti-abortion forces -- even though his latest bid for his party\u2019s nomination is falling flat. Santorum repeatedly mentioned his \u201c20-20 perfect vision for America\u201d economic plan that includes replacing the current tax code with a 20 percent flat tax and overhauling food stamps, Medicaid and housing programs to force beneficiaries to find work and to limit their stay on the rolls. He also vowed to slash immigration to preserve good manufacturing jobs for Americans.\n\nFormer New York governor George Pataki, stuck near the bottom of the polls and the only pro-choice candidate on the stage, said the recent hidden-camera videos of Planned Parenthood hadn\u2019t changed his view on abortion. \u201cMy heart was not changed, because I\u2019ve always been appalled by abortion,\u201d Pataki said. He said the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion has been settled law for decades. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should continue to try to change it,\u201d according to Pataki.\n\nFormer Virginia governor Jim Gilmore, the last to enter the race and probably the single most obscure of the 17 GOP candidates, spent most of the night explaining why he\u2019s the man to sit in the Oval Office, despite the fact that he hasn\u2019t held elected office in 13 years. When it comes to national security, Gilmore talked said he\u2019s \u201cproposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.\u201d\n\nRob Garver contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In a showdown of second-tier Republican presidential candidates Thursday evening, form", "title": "Fiorina Trumps Six Other GOP Candidates in the \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 Debate", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/06/Fiorina-Trumps-Six-Other-GOP-Candidates-Happy-Hour-Debate", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTX1NDWD.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/06/Fiorina-Trumps-Six-Other-GOP-Candidates-Happy-Hour-Debate", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTX1NDWD.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In a showdown of second-tier Republican presidential candidates Thursday evening, form", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe154d\"", "article_summary": "Yet those seven Republican presidential candidates made the best of a bad situation during an early evening consolation round in the near-empty arena hours before the main event.\nThe political world is riveted on that debate, pitting Trump against Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and seven other top-tier GOP candidates gathering in Cleveland at the Quicken Loans Arena.\nSen.
