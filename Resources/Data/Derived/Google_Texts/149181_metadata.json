Most of these uninsured\u2014414,000 veterans and 113,000 spouses\u2014have incomes below 100 percent of FPL, and will therefore only have new coverage options under the ACA if their state expands Medicaid. However, fewer than half live in states in which the governor supports their state participating in the expansion, while the majority live in states that have chosen not to expand Medicaid or have not yet decided whether to expand. The extent to which uninsured veterans and their family members with incomes below the FPL will have access to new\n\ncoverage options under the ACA will depend on whether they live in a state that adopts the Medicaid expansion.\n\nPew used the Urban Institute data, and the state by state neglect of veterans on this map:\n\nThe real scandal is that Republicans continue to deny over a quarter million veterans healthcare because they think it is good politics to oppose Obamacare. The 258,000 number is a bit of an underestimate, because it does not include the tens of thousands of thousands of spouses and children who are also being denied healthcare.\n\nRepublicans can try to make the bipartisan issues at VA an Obama scandal, but if they really cared about veterans they be demanding that the states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid do so right away.\n\nBlaming Obama isn\u2019t going to get Republicans out of this one. For the last two years, congressional Republicans have voted against bills that would have created jobs, and provided better healthcare for our vets. House Republicans even voted to throw 170,000 veterans off of food stamps.\n\nThe great hypocrisy is that while Republicans are blaming President Obama for the VA, they refusing to provide hundreds of thousands of veterans and their families healthcare. They can wave the flag all they want, but when the rubber hits the road, Republicans have repeatedly betrayed our veterans.\n\nIt is tragic that any veteran died while waiting for care from the VA, but how many veterans are dying or losing family members because Republicans refuse to expand Medicaid?\n\nThat is a question that Republicans don\u2019t want to have to answer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While Republicans are trying to blame the problems at the VA on President Obama, the real scandal is that the Republican refusal to expand Medicaid in 23 states has left 258,6000 veterans without healthcare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "While Republicans are trying to blame the problems at the VA on President Obama, the real scandal is that the Republican refusal to expand Medicaid in 23 states has left 258,6000 veterans without healthcare.", "title": "The Real Scandal: 258,000 Veterans Lack Healthcare Because Republicans Won't Expand Medicaid", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/05/22/real-scandal-258000-veterans-lack-healthcare-republicans-refuse-expand-medicaid.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/VETERANS-salute-flag.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-05-22T12:50:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,258000 veterans medicaid expansion,ACA,republicans refuse to expand medicaid,VA,veterans lack healthcare,veterans obamacare,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-05-22T12:50:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-22T12:50:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "258000 veterans medicaid expansion, ACA, republicans refuse to expand medicaid, VA, veterans lack healthcare, veterans obamacare"}, "article_summary": "It is tragic that any veteran died while waiting for care from the VA, but how many veterans are dying or losing family members because Republicans refuse to expand Medicaid?\nWhile Republicans are trying to blame the problems at the VA on President Obama, the real scandal is that the Republican refusal to expand Medicaid in 23 states has left 258,6000 veterans without healthcare.\nThe great hypocrisy is that while Republicans are blaming President Obama for the VA, they refusing to provide hundreds of thousands of veterans and their families healthcare.\nThey can wave the flag all they want, but when the rubber hits the road, Republicans have repeatedly betrayed our veterans.\nThe 258,000 number is a bit of an underestimate, because it does not include the tens of thousands of thousands of spouses and children who are also being denied healthcare."}
