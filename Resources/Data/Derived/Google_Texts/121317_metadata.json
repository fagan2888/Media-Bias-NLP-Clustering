(AP) \u2014 The Connecticut Huskies are back in a very familiar position, undefeated and playing for a national championship.\n\nThey\u2019ll be going for an unprecedented ninth national championship after Breanna Stewart scored 18 points and the Huskies advanced to another title game with a 75-56 win against Stanford on Sunday night.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy early, though the Huskies (39-0) did part and set up the highly anticipated championship showdown of undefeated teams.\n\nThey will square off against Notre Dame, an 87-61 winner over Maryland, on Tuesday night in the title game. It will be the first women\u2019s national title game between unbeaten teams.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be any fun if you didn\u2019t beat teams that were any good,\u201d UConn coach Geno Auriemma said of the matchup with Notre Dame. \u201cI think women\u2019s basketball needs rivalries like this, teams that aspire to be great and want to win championships.\u201d\n\nThe Huskies also won their 45th straight game after overcoming another sluggish start. Stewart, the Associated Press player of the year, missed her first four shots and UConn was up just 28-24 at halftime.\n\nBut Connecticut settled down and put the Cardinal away in the second half, outscoring them 47-32. Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis found her shooting stroke, scoring all of her 15 points in the second half.\n\nBria Hartley added 13 points for UConn and Stefanie Dolson and Moriah Jefferson each finished with 10.\n\nStanford (33-4) lost its third national semifinal since reaching the 2010 championship against UConn, which the Huskies also won. All-American Chiney Ogwumike finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds.
