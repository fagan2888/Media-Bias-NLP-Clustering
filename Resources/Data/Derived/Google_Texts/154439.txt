Corker slams Cruz on Obamacare

It’s not just House members who are taking shots at Ted Cruz on Twitter: One of his Senate colleagues is turning on him as well.

Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) on Thursday took a whack at Cruz over social media for leading the charge to push Republicans to back only spending bills that defund Obamacare, which many in his own party have predicted will result in a government shutdown blamed on Republicans.

“I didn’t go to Harvard or Princeton, but I can count — the defunding box canyon is a tactic that will fail and weaken our position,” Corker said, a clear reference to the Harvard- and Princeton-educated Cruz.

A Cruz spokeswoman defended the tactic as “the way to do it” later Thursday.

“Sen. Cruz was elected by Texans to represent their interests. They want Obamacare defunded and this is the way to do it before it is implemented,” she said.

On Wednesday evening, several House Republicans also dinged Cruz, who admitted on Wednesday that being in the minority likely Senate Republicans can’t do anything to stop Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) from moving his own spending bill that funds Obamacare. He said in that event, “House Republicans must stand firm.”

On the Senate floor Thursday morning, Reid said of Republicans: It’s “good political theater to watch them-self-destruct.”

“House agrees to send #CR to Senate that defunds Obamacare. @SenTedCruz & @SenMikeLee refuse to fight. Wave white flag and surrender,” said Sean Duffy of Wisconsin.

“So far Sen Rs are good at getting Facebook likes, and townhalls, not much else. Do something,” added Tim Griffin of Arkansas.

Chip Roy, Cruz’s chief of staff, said over Twitter that establishment Republicans have been “itching” to shift blame to Cruz.

“The votes won’t exist if Senate R’s don’t stand up like House Conservatives,” Roy added.
