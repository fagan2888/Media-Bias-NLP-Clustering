It\u2019s been a whirlwind month for Chris and Whitney, but it sounds like they\u2019re very much in love and making serious strides toward building a future together. What\u2019s the latest from them?\n\nSoules actually impressed a lot of fans with his DWTS debut Monday night with Witney Carson. Chris\u2019 parents were in the audience, and he shared with Glamour that they are big fans. Whitney naturally was there too, and host Chris Harrison shared a shot showing how excited they were for Chris and Witney to take the stage. Soules says that his mom wasn\u2019t about to miss watching him dance in person.\n\nChris has been putting in the hours rehearsing with Witney and he says that so far his fiancee Whitney hasn\u2019t visited the studio. He notes that\u2019s because he\u2019s focusing on learning all of the steps, and he wants Bischoff to wait to visit until he doesn\u2019t feel as if he\u2019ll look foolish. Whitney adds that she doesn\u2019t want to make him feel nervous by having her there as he rehearses with Carson.\n\nWhile some are trying to stir up drama over Chris and Witney\u2019s dance partnership, he makes it clear via his Glamour chat that he sees himself as something of an uncle to Carson, nothing more. He says he\u2019s been giving her dating advice and that he\u2019ll have to meet and approve of any guy she considers. Witney and former partner Alfonso Ribiero had a fun relationship and it seems that her partnership with Soules is following along the same lines.\n\nAs for what comes after life in Los Angeles, Chris and Whitney say that they\u2019re on the same page regarding their future. After the Bachelor finale aired, the two talked about how they plan to move forward.\n\nAs Reality TV World shares, Bischoff says that she won\u2019t be quitting her job and she has no plans to lose herself in a guy. She has changed her job, though, and her new position will allow her to work from anywhere and she won\u2019t have to be in Chicago to maintain her career.\n\nWhitney adds that she is anxious to learn about farming since it\u2019s something Chris is passionate about. Both Chris and Whitney talk about how they\u2019re looking at ways that she can get more involved in the family farm business in the future and Soules says his fiancee has several attributes that could definitely compliment his weaknesses in maintaining the business.\n\nWhitney and Chris have both talked quite a bit about wanting children, and both seem to be on the same page about Whitney focusing on motherhood once they do head down that path. While there are Bachelor fans who doubt this relationship will last, Soules says that it\u2019s been a smooth transition so far. Chris adds that she\u2019s exactly who he\u2019s always wanted and has been looking for, while fans have already seen that Whitney is definitely \u201call-in.\u201d\n\nHow will Chris fare with partner Witney Carson this season on Dancing With the Stars? Will Chris Soules and Whitney Bischoff make it down the aisle and eventually have a big family on their Arlington, Iowa farm? Bachelor fans are hoping for the best for Chris and Whitney and can\u2019t wait to see what comes next for them.\n\n[Image via Chris Soules\u2019 Instagram]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chris Soules and Whitney Bischoff got engaged in The Bachelor 2015 finale and now they're together in Los Angeles as he tackles a run on Dancing With the Stars.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Chris Soules and Whitney Bischoff got engaged in The Bachelor 2015 finale and now they\u2019re together in Los Angeles as he tackles a run on Dancing With the Stars.", "title": "\u2018Bachelor\u2019 Stars Chris Soules, Whitney Bischoff Talk \u2018DWTS,\u2019 Public Relationship And Big Future Plans", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1932212/bachelor-stars-chris-soules-whitney-bischoff-talk-dwts-public-relationship-and-big-future-plans/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Whitney-Bischoff-and-Chris-Soules-of-The-Bachelor-2015-season.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-17T14:22:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-17T15:19:23+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Whitney-Bischoff-and-Chris-Soules-of-The-Bachelor-2015-season.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-03-17T14:22:35+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "celebrity news,chris soules,dancing with the stars,dwts,entertainment,famous relationships,reality tv,the bachelor,tv,whitney bischoff", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Whitney-Bischoff-and-Chris-Soules-of-The-Bachelor-2015-season.jpg", "width": 670, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Chris Soules and Whitney Bischoff got engaged in The Bachelor 2015 finale and now they\u2019re together in Los Angeles as he tackles a run on Dancing With the Stars."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6dbf\"", "article_summary": "Will Chris Soules and Whitney Bischoff make it down the aisle and eventually have a big family on their Arlington, Iowa farm?\nBachelor fans are hoping for the best for Chris and Whitney and can\u2019t wait to see what comes next for them.\nChris Soules and Whitney Bischoff got engaged in The Bachelor 2015 finale and now they\u2019re together in Los Angeles as he tackles a run on Dancing With the Stars.\nWhile there are Bachelor fans who doubt this relationship will last, Soules says that it\u2019s been a smooth transition so far.\n[Image via Chris Soules\u2019 Instagram]"}
