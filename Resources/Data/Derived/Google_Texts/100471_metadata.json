The spent grains are then sold or given to local farmers to feed livestock.\n\nIn changes to the Food Safety Modernization Act that were proposed in December, the government has said it wants to have more regulation of animal feed.\n\nOne consequence, however, could be unnecessary expenses for breweries \u2014 requiring them to dry, analyze and package spent grains before sending them to farmers.\n\nMost breweries surely would rather just dump the grains into a landfill \u2014 also a new expense.\n\nSen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., on Monday sent a letter to the FDA calling for a \u201crisk assessment\u201d of reusing grains, adding that the regulation could add nearly $43 million per year in extra costs for small breweries. That would surely be passed on to you, dear beer drinker.\n\nChad Melis, spokesman for Oskar Blues Brewery, said his brewery produces roughly 250 tons of wet spent grains every week.\n\nThe brewery uses the grains to feed cattle on its farm that in turn provides beef for the brewery\u2019s restaurants.\n\n\u201cWe have a very sustainable and healthy model,\u201d Melis said. \u201cIf we had to dry it, process it and package it, it wouldn\u2019t be sustainable. Financially, it would probably drive us to dump our grain.\u201d\n\nWhat a waste.\n\nSpent grain is perfectly healthful livestock feed. Cattle have been eating it for centuries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about as close as it gets to its original state,\u201d Melis said. \u201cThe only thing that has been done is water has been run through it.\u201d\n\nNo need exists for the extra regulation that will mess up what has become a perfect symbiotic relationship between two industries.\n\nAbsent evidence that any hazard exists for humans or animals, the FDA needs to dump this rule.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "FDA rule change would harm Colorado craft beer industry", "title": "FDA rule change would harm Colorado craft beer industry", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/01/fda-rule-change-would-harm-colorado-craft-beer-industry/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140401__beerp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140401__beerp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-01T17:47:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T20:04:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd178c\"", "article_summary": "Chad Melis, spokesman for Oskar Blues Brewery, said his brewery produces roughly 250 tons of wet spent grains every week.\nThe spent grains are then sold or given to local farmers to feed livestock.\nOne consequence, however, could be unnecessary expenses for breweries \u2014 requiring them to dry, analyze and package spent grains before sending them to farmers.\nBrewers soak grains in hot water to expunge their sugars, which are fermented with yeast to make beer.\nThe brewery uses the grains to feed cattle on its farm that in turn provides beef for the brewery\u2019s restaurants."}
