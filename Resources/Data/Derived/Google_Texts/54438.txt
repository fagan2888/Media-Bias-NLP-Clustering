The community is invited to the Cañon City Music & Blossom Festival's Cluster Duck event from 4 to 11 p.m. May 2, Centennial Park.

Headlining the event this year is singer/song writer Megan Rüger, who appeared on season 6 of NBC's "The Voice." Opening the show are Jake Loggins, performing blues and country, and Donovan Lee, who will perform country and classic rock. Rüger will perform at 9 p.m.

Tickets are $5 at the door, or pre-purchased VIP tickets are $12, which include fast pass entry to the show and one free beer. Tickets are available now through Friday at DiRito's Italian Restaurant, 231 Main St.

"The nice part about the fast pass is oftentimes people are waiting in line, so we came up with the fast pass to try to divert that," said event organizer Greg DiRito.

He said the event is meant to be a place for locals to go and have a good time.

"Oftentimes people say they don't want to go to the bars or there are too many people in town — but it's Blossom and they want to get out and do something," he said.

Now in its sixth or seventh year, the Cluster Duck started out with 600 to 700 attendees. Last year, there were 1,500. There will be food vendors and other activities in Veterans and Centennial parks throughout the weekend.

"It's going to be a really nice afternoon," DiRito said. "People can just pick up right after the parade and just keep the fun moving on."
