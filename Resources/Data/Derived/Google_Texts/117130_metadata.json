That\u2019s what critics typically want to know. In the age of fractured demographics, divided loyalties and close elections, those critics have a point.\n\nSEE RELATED:\n\nYet RINO has now become a rallying cry for Republican Party unity - at least according to former presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee, who wants his fellow Republicans to stop using the term.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the Republican Party\u2019s biggest obstacle in this year\u2019s elections? Republicans! With Benghazi, Obamacare, NSA spying, al Qaeda and the still-staggering economy, 2014 should be a record year for the GOP. But they risk disaster if they let the primaries be hijacked by ad campaigns by groups that don\u2019t target Democrats, but fellow Republicans who aren\u2019t \u2018pure\u2019 enough,\u201d Mr. Huckabee declared on his Facebook page, and in several other spots.\n\n\u201cAnd one term that I\u2019d like to see outlawed from the vernacular of the party is RINO. It stands for \u2018Republicans in name only\u2019 and it\u2019s a pejorative term that questions the authenticity and orthodoxy of someone\u2019s party purity. I\u2019ve been called that myself, even though I fought in the trenches of Republican politics for over two decades. Even so, I would never pretend that I\u2019m lord over determining who the real Republicans are,\u201d Mr. Huckabee concluded.\n\nYes, well. Historic records indicate RINO was part of the vernacular as early as the 1920s - with sporadic use in the 1950s, and during the Reagan administration. RINO appeared in print for the first time in the Nashua Telegraph - a New Hampshire newspaper - in 1992.", "article_metadata": {"description": "RINO: It is a popular acronym among conservatives who ponder political intricacies. \"Republican in name only\" designates elected officials whose liberal leanings outshine their conservative values.
