Well, he was an Obamacare enrollee. Unfortunately, Kaiser Permanente terminated his coverage in January. And now the health care behemoth is threatening to refer him to a collections agency. Why? Well, we\u2019ll let him explain in his own words:\n\n@KPMemberService dropped my #ObamaCare in Jan, didn't tell me until Feb, blamed it on @CoveredCA, who blame it on @KPShare & won't return the $1600 premiums I paid. Now I'm being sent to collections for $0.00, due to services I received in Jan. Anyone need a good news story?

Harry Reid?\n\nWe look forward to Fischbach\u2019s review of Covered California on Yelp.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "title": "Kaiser Permanente threatens to send Obamacare enrollee to collections over failure to pay $0.00 - twitchy.com", "og": {"site_name": "twitchy.com", "description": "A smashing success.", "title": "Kaiser Permanente threatens to send Obamacare enrollee to collections over failure to pay $0.00 - twitchy.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/obamacare-going-to-hurt.jpg", "url": "http://twitchy.com/jessem-34/2015/04/28/kaiser-permanente-threatens-to-send-obamacare-enrollee-to-collections-over-failure-to-pay-0-00/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "twitchy.com", "description": "A smashing success.", "image": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/obamacare-going-to-hurt.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kaiser Permanente threatens to send Obamacare enrollee to collections over failure to pay $0.00 - twitchy.com"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/smalltile.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/largetile.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/widetile.png", "article": {"section": "US Politics", "tag": "ObamaCare", "published_time": "2015-04-28T20:57:37+00:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Jeff Fischbach is a digital forensics expert and an Obamacare enrollee.\nWell, he was an Obamacare enrollee.\nA photo posted by Jeff Fischbach (@fischtech) on Apr 28, 2015 at 4:49pm PDTThat\u2019s what Democrats call a smashing success, right Sen.
