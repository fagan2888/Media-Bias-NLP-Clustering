From Dr. Joni Doherty and Dr. Jack Shohet through medical support staff members to front and back office support staff, everyone treats you as though you are the most important person in the world to their full-spectrum ear, nose, and throat (ENT) medical practice. Diagnosis to surgery to hearing aid battery dispensing \u2014 Shohet offers complete ENT services.\n\nIn addition to Dr. Shohet \u2014 who splits his week between an original office in Newport Beach and a new office in Seal Beach \u2014 and Dr. Doherty, the new office has one-and-a-half full-time audiologists available to perform comprehensive hearing exams on all new patients.\n\nComprehensive care\n\nShohet Ear Associates offers comprehensive care for all disorders of the ear, including but not limited to balance, tinnatus tinnitus (ringing), and hearing. Each patient is treated as an individual, and the best solution is found for each patient. Children are welcome!\n\nBoth Dr. Shohet and Dr. Doherty are doubly board-certified. The services they offer include surgery through the ear canal, rather than the more prosaic (and invasive) incision behind a patient\u2019s ear.\n\nMany of their patients suffer from \u201csurfer\u2019s ear\u201d caused by prolonged exposure to cold water and wind. (This is a special case of \u201cextosis,\u201d a spur or bony growth that can occur many places in the body.) In some cases, the growth can grow so large that it entirely blocks the ear canal.\n\nShohet Ear Associates can provide the surgery needed to remove the bony growths \u2014 and assistance with ear plugs that will prevent the growths from growing back.\n\n(Skiers and sailors are also vulnerable to surfer\u2019s ear!)\n\nNew services anticipated\n\nWith the new year will come new services, including weekly seminars on Saturday mornings to help keep patients informed about the latest in basic and more advanced understanding of hearing problems and their solutions. Support groups will be organized through to allow patients a regular venue for passing along their own experience and learning from others.\n\nA new surgical theater will allow, among other procedures, local non-invasive (through the ear canal) implantation of extended-wear devices such as the Lyric.\n\nHealth care uncertainty\n\nBoth Dr. Shohet and Dr. Doherty are asked by patients about what impact the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will have.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know,\u201d Dr. Shohet admits.\n\nThey do know that reimbursement for care given to Medicaid patients has been cut back.\n\nThe two doctors have themselves been personally stung \u2014 their own individual insurance policies have been cancelled.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to provide university-level high quality care to our patients,\u201d he adds.\n\nShohet\u2019s new Seal Beach office at 770 Pacific Coast Highway has its own ample parking lot, and is open weekends for hearing aid dispensing.
