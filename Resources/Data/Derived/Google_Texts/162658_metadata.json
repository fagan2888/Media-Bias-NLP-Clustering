Previous closures include the co-ops in Arizona, Utah, South Carolina, Colorado, Iowa/Nebraska, Louisiana, New York, Nevada, Tennessee, Oregon, and Kentucky.\n\nThe Obamacare co-ops are non-profit insurers created to offer lower cost options to consumers on the exchange. Their rates were often among the lowest in a given state. However, those low rates turned out to be a problem when enrollment did not meet expectations or when healthcare claims exceeded expectations. An Inspector General\u2019s report published this summer found that 22 of the 23 co-ops lost money in 2014. Nineteen had claims that exceeded premiums.\n\nNo statement about the closure has, so far, been released by the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services. Several of the co-ops that have failed in the last month cited an announcement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on October 1 that it would only pay 12.6% of requests made under the so-called risk corridors program.\n\nRisk corridors is a pool of money which insurers who earn more than anticipated pay into so that those who earn less than needed to cover expenses can draw from it. In 2014, only $362 million was paid into the pool, and $2.87 billion was requested from it. Because HHS is prevented by law from supplementing the pool with additional funds, it could only pay out 12.6% of claims.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Consumers Mutual Insurance of Michigan announced it will be winding down prior to 2016, making it the 12th Obamacare Co-Op to fail this year.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Consumers Mutual Insurance of Michigan announced it will be winding down prior to 2016, making it the 12th Obamacare Co-Op to fail this year.", "title": "Another Obamacare Co-Op Shuts Down", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Obamacare-AP-Photo.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/05/another-obamacare-co-op-shuts-amassing-50-percent-failure-rate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Consumers Mutual Insurance of Michigan announced it will be winding down prior to 2016, making it the 12th Obamacare Co-Op to fail this year.", "creator": "@verumserum", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Obamacare-AP-Photo.jpg", "title": "Another Obamacare Co-Op Shuts Down", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "affordable care act, Consumers Mutual Insurance of Michigan, Michigan, obamacare, Obamacare co-ops,Big Government, Obamacare,Obamacare Co-Op", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Obamacare co-ops", "published_time": "2015-11-05T11:02:34-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The Obamacare co-ops are non-profit insurers created to offer lower cost options to consumers on the exchange.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe closure of Consumers Mutual represents a grim milestone for the Obamacare co-ops, as more than half of the 23 original co-ops have now failed.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERConsumers Mutual Insurance of Michigan has announced it will be winding down its operation prior to 2016, making it the twelfth Obamacare co-op to fail this year.\nBecause HHS is prevented by law from supplementing the pool with additional funds, it could only pay out 12.6% of claims.\nPrevious closures include the co-ops in Arizona, Utah, South Carolina, Colorado, Iowa/Nebraska, Louisiana, New York, Nevada, Tennessee, Oregon, and Kentucky."}
