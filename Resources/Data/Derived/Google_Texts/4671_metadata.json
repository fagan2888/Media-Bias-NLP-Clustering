As that happens, you can expect increasing numbers of plaintiffs to file \u201cproducts liability\u201d lawsuits against lessors, seeking to hold them \u201cstrictly liable\u201d for \u201cfailure to warn\u201d customers of potential dangers associated with using or misusing rented aerial equipment, such as failing to warn them of potential hazards associated with: (a) working at heights, and/or (b) failing to properly use fall protection devices. Consequently, one of the effects of the above requirements will likely be an increase in the number of lawsuits against rental operators.\n\nDealing effectively with these issues is now a legal imperative for lessors of aerial equipment. Consequently, rental operators are now routinely electing to \u201cextract and emphasize\u201d certain issues, such as the potential dangers associated with working at heights and the need to use fall protection equipment/devices, by having their customers sign written acknowledgments or \u201caddenda\u201d when they sign their rental contracts. Adding such emphasis with respect to critical issues like these helps overcome the inevitable argument made by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers that \u201cthe court shouldn\u2019t allow the rental company to escape liability just because it included a waiver in fine print on the back of its rental contract.\u201d Knowing this, we generally recommend the following two documents for our clients who rent aerial equipment to their customers:\n\nFall Protection Addendum: (a) Provides the necessary written warnings regarding the need to use fall protection equipment (\u201cFPE\u201d); and (b) Obtains the customer\u2019s agreement to \u201cassume the risk of\u201d and \u201cindemnify, defend and hold harmless\u201d the lessor with respect to accidents and mishaps, as well as failure to use FPE.\n\n(a) Provides the necessary written warnings regarding the need to use fall protection equipment (\u201cFPE\u201d); and (b) Obtains the customer\u2019s agreement to \u201cassume the risk of\u201d and \u201cindemnify, defend and hold harmless\u201d the lessor with respect to accidents and mishaps, as well as failure to use FPE. Familiarization Addendum: (a) Reminds your delivery personnel of the familiarization steps to be taken; (b) Obtains the delivery person\u2019s written confirmation that such familiarization was provided; and most importantly, (c) Obtains the customer\u2019s written acknowledgment of his/her receipt of the required familiarization and of each step in the process.\n\nAerial equipment, though enormously valuable, can give rise to substantial liability. The best advice I can give any rental operator is to get out in front and out of the way of these issues while you have the opportunity; meaning before you rent aerial equipment.\n\nJames Waite, Esq. is a rental industry attorney with more than 20 years of experience in renting and leasing equipment.
