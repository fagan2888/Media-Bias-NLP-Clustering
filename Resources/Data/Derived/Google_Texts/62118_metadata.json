First, House and Senate Republicans need to agree on a budget resolution, which could be difficult with fiscal conservatives calling for spending cuts but defense hawks looking for more money for the Pentagon. And, of course, President Barack Obama could veto any reconciliation bill that reaches his desk.\n\nStill, Republicans are hoping the procedural maneuver will get them closer, at least symbolically, to gutting the president\u2019s signature health care law.\n\nThe plans were included in a budget blueprint rolled out Wednesday by the Senate Budget Committee \u2014 a governing document that calls for balancing the budget within a decade, extracting hundreds of billions in savings from Medicare and turning over more responsibility to the states to run Medicaid, reducing costs even further.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake, our fiscal outlook is grim and has been ignored for far too long,\u201d said the budget panel\u2019s chairman, Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) said as he unveiled the document. \u201cBut we have a profound moral responsibility to help hardworking taxpayers see the true picture of our country\u2019s finances.\u201d\n\nWhile Senate and House Republicans share a common goal of substantially trimming the deficit in future years, they\u2019ve got some near term differences to work out, particularly on defense spending.\n\nBoth chambers want to keep the caps on defense spending that were outlined under a 2011 deficit-reduction law. But the House relies heavily on a war contingency fund to boost defense spending to the tune of $94 billion \u2014 an amount that goes too far for Senate Republicans, who have already said using the so-called Overseas Contingency Operations fund is a \u201cgimmick.\u201d\n\nThe Senate wants to match Obama\u2019s request on OCO funds for fiscal 2016 at $58 billion \u2014 far lower than the House. And Senate budget writers included a so-called deficit-neutral reserve fund that could be used for additional defense spending, though details of how that fund would work have yet to be worked out.\n\nBut some Senate Republicans were skeptical of Enzi\u2019s blueprint, arguing it doesn\u2019t go far enough to raise Pentagon spending. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) said on Wednesday that he would oppose it as written \u2014 because it stayed under the military spending caps outlined in the Budget Control Act \u2014 and said he wants to boost defense further, even if that means relying on the Overseas Contingency Operations fund.\n\nStill, Republicans were optimistic about the prospects of striking an agreement with their counterparts in the House.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that as a challenge,\u201d said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a member of the Budget Committee. \u201cI think if we end up getting a budget passed here, and pass a budget in the House, we should not have a difficulty in finding common ground in conference.\u201c\n\nThough budgets are largely partisan documents without the force of law, a budget agreement is important because it paves the way for a reconciliation measure, which can\u2019t be filibustered in the Senate. That means a bill targeting Obamacare can reach the president\u2019s desk without support from Democrats.\n\nOn reconciliation, the Senate GOP budget calls on two key committees that oversee Obamacare \u2014 Senate Finance and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \u2014 to each find at least $1 billion in deficit-reduction savings from the health care law by July 31.\n\nThat number was set intentionally low, according to the committee, to give senators some flexibility on their health-care response depending on how the Supreme Court rules in King vs. Burwell, which targets the subsidies under Obamacare given to lower-income individuals so they can buy coverage on state health-care exchanges.\n\nIf the court rules against the Obama administration and the subsidies are no longer allowed, Congress will be hard-pressed to come up with a quick response. A decision is expected in late June.\n\nEnzi\u2019s counterpart in the House, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), said on Tuesday that House Republicans will use reconciliation to repeal Obamacare provisions \u201cin their entirety\u201d \u2014 in an effort to force Obama to finally veto a rollback of his signature domestic policy achievement.\n\nOverall, the Senate GOP budget envisions about $430 billion of savings from Medicare over a decade, although it doesn\u2019t use the so-called \u201cpremium support\u201d approach used by the House. That method, popularized by former House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), would allow future seniors to choose between private health care plans with government subsidies or stay on Medicare. Democrats have said Ryan\u2019s plan would end Medicare \u201cas we know it\u201d and used it against Republicans on the campaign trail.\n\nInstead, Senate Republicans call on individual committees responsible for Medicare to work to find those savings.\n\nSenate Republicans also want to change Medicaid so it\u2019s administered more like the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which they say gives the states more flexibility to administer health care for lower-income people. The GOP budget estimates savings from Medicaid to be about $400 billion over 10 years. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans see roughly $600 billion in savings over a decade from overhauling welfare programs such as food stamps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a budget that controls spending, reduces the deficit, and improves programs like Medicaid,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said. \u201cIt\u2019s a budget that will support economic growth and more opportunity for hardworking families, while protecting our most vulnerable citizens. And it\u2019s a budget that would allow us to repeal and replace a program that hurts the middle class: Obamacare.\u201d\n\nPredictably, Democrats immediately criticized the blueprint, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) saying that under the budget, \u201cthe rich get much richer, and the Republicans think they need more help.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe middle class and working families of this country become poorer, and the Republicans think we need to cut programs they desperately need,\u201d Sanders, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, said Wednesday. \u201cFrankly, those may be the priorities of some of my Republican colleagues in this room, but I do not believe that these are the priorities of the American people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "But first they have to strike a difficult deal on an overall budget.", "title": "GOP aims to sink Obamacare with reconciliation", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/senate-republicans-obamacare-reconciliation-budget-116190.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/03/18/150318_mike_enzi_js_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Congress,Barack Obama,Health Care,Republicans,White House,Mike Enzi,Affordable Care Act,Tom Price", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "But first they have to strike a difficult deal on an overall budget.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce73d\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, Senate Republicans see roughly $600 billion in savings over a decade from overhauling welfare programs such as food stamps.\nBoth chambers want to keep the caps on defense spending that were outlined under a 2011 deficit-reduction law.\nInstead, Senate Republicans call on individual committees responsible for Medicare to work to find those savings.\nJohn Shinkle/POLITICO GOP aims to sink Obamacare with reconciliation But first they have to strike a difficult deal on an overall budgetSenate Republicans want to use a powerful budget maneuver known as reconciliation to go after President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law \u2014 particularly if the Supreme Court strikes down key provisions of Obamacare this June.\nOn reconciliation, the Senate GOP budget calls on two key committees that oversee Obamacare \u2014 Senate Finance and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \u2014 to each find at least $1 billion in deficit-reduction savings from the health care law by July 31."}
