“You’re my wife? Holy sh*t!”

Here’s your feel good story of the day. The guy in this video, Jason Mortensen, wakes up from surgery to find his wife, who he doesn’t remember being his wife thanks to anesthesia. His response to her being by his side is precious. From the video description:

In response to all of the questions: I had a hernia repair to fix residual tears from a previous surgery.

I wish I could remember this but I was definitely out of it.

This was my fifth surgery within our six years of marriage and she’s been by my side through all of it. In a previous surgery I suffered a severe complication and we didn’t know if I’d ever function the same again. She is the love of my life.



UPDATE: Ed informs me this could be fake, but you know what? It’s still cute.
