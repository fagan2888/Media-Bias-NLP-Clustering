You\u2019re 21, you just graduated and you want to get something good,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton. \u201cYou should be able to go to the same place and get the information about what is going to be available for you to take advantage of.\u201d\n\nThe website plan was part of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s agenda to rebuild the middle class and help people advance in the economy through job training and apprenticeship programs. She pushed the agenda during a swing through North Carolina, home to the second-in-the nation primary and the first nominating contest in the South.\n\nAs part of the agenda, she proposed giving a $1,500 tax credit to business for each apprentice they take on.\n\nA Clinton campaign spokeswoman said details about the website plan were not yet available but that a background briefing would be circulated in the future.\n\nThe campaign did not respond to questions about whether state or federal government would build and maintain the website, whether it would be one national site or individual site for each state as with the Obamacare exchanges, or whether it was modeled after Obamacare.\n\nRepublicans said that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals lacked substance.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s economic proposals have been light on details and heavy on hypocrisy \u2013 another example of why voters overwhelmingly believe she is not honest and trustworthy,\u201d Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short.\n\nHe noted that the South Carolina AFL-CIO gave its endorsement for president to Sen. Bernard Sanders, an avowed socialist from Vermont who is running to the left of Mrs. Clinton in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe union announced its endorsement of Mr. Sanders on Saturday, the same day Mrs. Clinton held the first big rally of her candidacy and launched an aggressive campaign swing through early voting states, including South Carolina.\n\n\u201cBy losing the South Carolina AFL-CIO\u2019s endorsement to Bernie Sanders, it\u2019s clear even Democrats aren\u2019t buying what Hillary Clinton is selling,\u201d said Mr. Short.\n\nAt the technical college, Mrs. Clinton touted the tax credit proposal as a bipartisan idea and promised to embrace good ideas as president regardless of which party came up with them.\n\nThe former first lady, senator and top diplomat also said that job training and apprenticeship programs should not be only for young Americans but available to everybody who wants to get ahead.\n\n\u201cIt also should be older workers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should be for moms re-entering the workforce after raising their children, to be more independent. It should be for our veterans.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton remains the all-but-inevitable Democratic presidential nominee, with a huge lead in the polls and a massive fundraising advantage.\n\nAt an earlier campaign stop, she voiced confident about both succeeding with her plan to revitalize the U.S. economy and about her chances of winning the White House in 2016 and 2020.\n\n\u201cI hope that at the end of my two terms as president, I will have overseen an even bigger peacetime expansion of the economy than my husband [former President Bill Clinton] did, and he had the biggest peacetime expansion in our history,\u201d she said at a town hall-style meeting in Santee, a rural town about 65 miles north of Charleston.\n\nThe line drew the loudest cheers of the event, where about 300 people crowded into a community center to see Mrs. Clinton.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make it our national commitment that we are going to do everything w can to create good jobs that will help people get into and stay in the middle class I want the middle class to mean something again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton floated an idea Wednesday for a government-run website where Americans can go to shop for job training and apprenticeship programs, but the proposals spawned more questions than answers.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton floated an idea Wednesday for a government-run website where Americans can go to shop for job training and apprenticeship programs, but the proposals spawned more questions than answers.", "title": "Hillary Clinton wants to give job training the Obamacare treatment", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/17/clinton-wants-obamacare-treament-job-training/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/15/DEM_2016_Clinton.JPEG-0d958.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/15/DEM_2016_Clinton.JPEG-0d958.jpg", "description": "Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton floated an idea Wednesday for a government-run website where Americans can go to shop for job training and apprenticeship programs, but the", "card": "summary", "title": "Hillary Clinton wants to give job training the Obamacare treatment"}, "Author": "S.A.
