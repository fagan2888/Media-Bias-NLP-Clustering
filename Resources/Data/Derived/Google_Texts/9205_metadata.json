Let us count the ways.\n\nWe hate thee for thy mortgage misdeeds, foreclosure frauds and grotesque fees. For unnecessarily kicking people out of their homes, extorting money from military families through predatory loan rates, and treating thy customers like garbage.\n\nFor basically being too-big-to-fail/too-big-to-jail blight on the economy and society thou hast proven to be, time and again.\n\nBank of America has earned itself the worst reputation of any big lender in the U.S., and that is no small feat. The megabank has incurred so many legal costs for its various frauds and abuses, to the tune of billions, its profits have seen a dip. Whatever is a big bank to do?\n\nUnder increasing pressure from regulators and widely despised by the public, Bank of America now wants us to believe hat it will make nice with poor people. In a recentreportin the New York Times, we learn that BofA and other giant banks are trying to launder their public images by talking about offering low-fee services to people who have been left out of the banking system. BofA has launched a banking account it claims is intended to prevent troubled customers from running up fees for overdrawing their balances.\n\nThat\u2019s very interesting, because so far, its accounts have been designed to do the opposite, which is why a lot of poor people don\u2019t have bank accounts in the first place.\n\nBofA\u2019s public campaign showing us its touchy-feely side involves asking low-income people to create collages representing their emotions about money. One image shows a woman who appears to be naked wearing nothing but words like \u201cpower,\u201d \u201cwant\u201d and \u201cdesire\u201d scrawled across her skin.\n\nOther banks like JPMorgan, are following suit with lower-cost prepaid debit cards, checking accounts and whatnot. As the Times points out, it\u2019s a bit difficult to start cheering:\n\n\u201cIt is hard not to be skeptical, particularly because the banks, most recently in the subprime housing crisis, have traditionally wrung vast profits from some of these same customers, who paid steep rates for loans and high fees on basic checking accounts.\u201d\n\nYou can say that again.\n\nSo here\u2019s the real deal. Under the scrutiny of regulators, these banks have gotten cautious, so they\u2019re trotting out a couple of products that are somewhat less rapacious than their normal fare (nonsensical fees still apply, they\u2019re just lower). We\u2019re guessing that the minute the regulators turn the other way, many of these targeted low-income customers will find themselves hit by some unexpected fee hikes that will send them right back where they came from, the land of the unbanked.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bank of America and others claim they want to offer poor people low-cost banking services.
