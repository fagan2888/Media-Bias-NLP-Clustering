Jay Nixon\u2019s (D) veto of a 72-hour abortion waiting period, ensuring that the policy will go into place in October. The new law triples the state\u2019s former 24-hour waiting period and doesn\u2019t have any exemptions for victims of rape or incest.\n\nSince there\u2019s only one abortion clinic left in Missouri \u2014 located in St. Louis \u2014 the additional two day wait may pose too much of a barrier for the women who have to travel more than 100 miles to get there, particularly if they can\u2019t afford a stay in a hotel or an additional lengthy round trip. Some of those women may instead opt to travel to Illinois or Kansas, where there isn\u2019t such a lengthy waiting period before they\u2019re allowed to have the procedure. Illinois doesn\u2019t require women to wait for any length of time before an abortion, and Kansas\u2019 waiting period is 24 hours long.\n\nThe closest option is in Granite City, Illinois, where there\u2019s an abortion clinic just about 15 minutes from Missouri\u2019s sole provider. Dr. Erin King, the associate medical director there, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that she may hire more staff if necessary to accommodate a rise in out-of-state patients. \u201cWe are prepared to handle women from Missouri that come over the river from Missouri because of the restrictions,\u201d King said.\n\n\u201cWe definitely know that this law is coming,\u201d Julie Burkhart, who runs an abortion clinic in Wichita, Kansas, added. \u201cWe certainly expect that this law is going to be a hardship for women and it\u2019s clear that this law is meant to do nothing but block access when it comes to abortion care.\u201d\n\nThis dynamic is hardly unexpected. Last year, when the legislature was first considering the 72-hour waiting period, reproductive rights advocates argued that the measure may actually represent an indirect method of ending abortion in the state of Missouri. Writer Robin Marty pointed out that if women all start going to Granite City, abortion opponents will have won a significant symbolic victory. \u201cIf it simply becomes that much more convenient to leave the state, the Missouri legislature will have accomplished what multiple states have been itching to do \u2014 be the first to eliminate abortion access in the state altogether,\u201d she wrote last winter.\n\nAcross the country, this has played out over and over again as states have passed increasingly harsh restrictions limiting women\u2019s access to the procedure. These state-level abortion restrictions are designed to force women drive farther to get to a clinic, make additional trips to the same provider before finally completing the procedure, and ultimately pay higher prices for their abortion. Those mounting hurdles mean that women\u2019s reproductive rights are becoming dependent on their zip code.\n\nAs one abortion provider in Maryland put it last year, when stringent laws in Pennsylvania led to an increase in out-of-state patients at her clinic, \u201cAs long as there are clinics, you could make the argument that there is access, but the question is, how Herculean of an effort does one have to put forth in order to gain that access?\u201d\n\nPlus, this points to the fact that state-level abortion laws need to considered in a national context. The implications of new anti-choice restrictions aren\u2019t contained within a single state\u2019s border, particularly if abortion opponents are going after a state that serves a large portion of patients from other places.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s currently threatening to unfold in Tennessee, where anti-abortion activists are attempting to mobilize support for a ballot initiative that would roll back access to abortion in one of the last states in the region where women can still manage to end a pregnancy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one in four abortions performed in Tennessee are sought by a resident of a different state.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Providers in neighboring states are bracing for an influx in out-of-state patients.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Providers in neighboring states are bracing for an influx in out-of-state patients.", "title": "Why More Missouri Women Will Be Forced To Cross State Lines To Get An Abortion", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/09/26/3572568/missouri-state-lines-abortion/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/keep-abortion-legal-e1352311380975.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Providers in neighboring states are bracing for an influx in out-of-state patients.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/keep-abortion-legal-e1352311380975-321x214.jpg", "title": "Why More Missouri Women Will Be Forced To Cross State Lines To Get An Abortion", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/keep-abortion-legal-e1352311380975.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/keep-abortion-legal-e1352311380975.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-26T09:07:10+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3551\"", "article_summary": "Jay Nixon\u2019s (D) veto of a 72-hour abortion waiting period, ensuring that the policy will go into place in October.\nHealth Why More Missouri Women Will Be Forced To Cross State Lines To Get An Abortion CREDIT:As a harsh new abortion restriction is about to take effect in Missouri, clinics in neighboring states are preparing for an influx of women crossing the border to get the reproductive care they need.\nThe closest option is in Granite City, Illinois, where there\u2019s an abortion clinic just about 15 minutes from Missouri\u2019s sole provider.\n\u201cWe definitely know that this law is coming,\u201d Julie Burkhart, who runs an abortion clinic in Wichita, Kansas, added.\n\u201cWe are prepared to handle women from Missouri that come over the river from Missouri because of the restrictions,\u201d King said."}
