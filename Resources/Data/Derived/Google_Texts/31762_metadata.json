To the American people\n\n\u201cI am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,\u201d Obama told Todd on Thursday after millions of Americans found their health insurance plans had been cancelled because of Obamacare.\n\n2. To the American people \u2026 again\n\n\u201cI know the American people are tired of it,\u201d Obama said of the government shutdown during news conference at the White House on Friday. \u201cI apologize that you have to go through this stuff every three months, it seems like. And Lord knows I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d\n\n3. To California Attorney General Kamala Harris\n\n\u201cThey are old friends and good friends and he did not want in any way to diminish the attorney general\u2019s professional accomplishments and her capabilities,\u201d White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in April.\n\nObama called Harris \u201cthe best-looking attorney general\u201d at a fundraiser and called to apologize hours after he made the comment.\n\n4. To Muslims after Benghazi\n\n\u201cI have made it clear that the United States government had nothing to do with this video, and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity,\u201d Obama said at the opening session of the U.N. General Assembly. \u201cIt is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as well \u2013 for as the city outside these walls makes clear, we are a country that has welcomed people of every race and religion.\u201d\n\nObama addressed the General Assembly days after the Sept. 11, 2012, terrorist attack on the American consulate in Libya, but blamed a YouTube video.\n\n5. To Poland\n\n\u201cIn referring to \u2018a Polish death camp\u2019 rather than \u2018a Nazi death camp in German-occupied Poland,\u2019 I inadvertently used a phrase that has caused many Poles anguish over the years and that Poland has rightly campaigned to eliminate from public discourse around the world,\u201d Obama wrote in a letter in June 2012. \u201cI regret the error and agree that this moment is an opportunity to ensure that this and future generations know the truth.\u201d\n\n6. To Afghan President Hamid Karzai\n\n\u201cI wish to express my deep regret for the reported incident,\u201d Obama wrote in the letter to Karzai in February 2012. \u201cI extend to you and the Afghan people my sincere apologies.\u201d\n\nThe President sent the letter after U.S. military personnel burned copies of the Quran at an airbase in Afghanistan.\n\n7. To Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom\n\n\u201cThis is tragic and the United States by all means apologizes to all those who were impacted by this,\u201d White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said in October 2010.\n\nThe President called Colom to apologize for a study conducted between 1946 and 1948. The U.S. Public Health Service purposely injected close to 700 Guatemalans with syphilis.\n\n8. To Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.)\n\n\u201cI hope you know that during my town hall today, I wasn\u2019t saying anything negative about Las Vegas,\u201d Obama wrote in a letter to Reid in February 2010. \u201c\u2026There is no place better to have fun than Vegas, one of our country\u2019s great destinations.\u201d\n\nReid criticized the President for a comment he made during a town hall in New Hampshire after Obama made it \u201cthe poster child for where people shouldn\u2019t be spending their money,\u201d Reid said.\n\n9. To the Special Olympics\n\n\u201cHe expressed his disappointment and he apologized in a way that was very moving. He expressed that he did not intend to humiliate this population,\u201d Tim Shriver, chairman of the Special Olympics, said of Obama\u2019s phone call to him in March 2009. \u201cHe, I think importantly, said he was ready to have some of our athletes over to the White House to bowl or to play basketball, or help him improve his score.\u201d\n\nDuring an appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d Obama said his bowling skills were \u201clike the Special Olympics or something.\u201d\n\n10. To Hillary Clinton\n\n\u201cIt was a dumb mistake on our campaign\u2019s part, and I made it clear to my staff in no uncertain terms that it was a mistake,\u201d Obama said in June 2007.\n\nWhen he was on the campaign trail, the then-Senator\u2019s campaign circulated a memo criticizing Clinton\u2019s financial ties to India. The memo was headlined \u201cHillary Clinton (D-Punjab)\u201d\n\n11. To the U.S. Military\n\n\u201cIt is not at all what I intended to say, and I would absolutely apologize if any (military families) felt that in some ways it had diminished the enormous courage and sacrifice that they\u2019d shown,\u201d Obama said to a crowd in Nashua, N.H. in February 27.\n\nThe President came under fire for implying U.S. troops had died in vain during the Iraq War.\n\nh/t The Hill", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "After weeks of avoidance, President Barack Obama finally came out and apologized for the train wreck that is the Affordable Care Act \u2014 after some prodding from NBC's Chuck Todd.", "title": "11 times Obama said he was sorry - Red Alert Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/08/obama-soldiers-600x336.jpg", "height": 336}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/11/09/11-times-obama-said-he-was-sorry/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "white-house-press-secretary-robert-gibbs", "published_time": "2013-11-09T15:26:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-09T17:57:12+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba7e\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s a list of 11 times Obama said he was sorry, from his apology to the American people Thursday to his days on the campaign trail.\nBut Obama is no stranger to the apology tour, having to swallow his pride on multiple occasions and long before he was in the White House.\nTo the American people \u2026 again\u201cI know the American people are tired of it,\u201d Obama said of the government shutdown during news conference at the White House on Friday.\nTo Afghan President Hamid Karzai\u201cI wish to express my deep regret for the reported incident,\u201d Obama wrote in the letter to Karzai in February 2012.\nObama called Harris \u201cthe best-looking attorney general\u201d at a fundraiser and called to apologize hours after he made the comment."}
