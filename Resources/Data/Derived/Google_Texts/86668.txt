Lyndon B. Johnson delivers his first address to Congress, Nov. 27, 1963

Lyndon B. Johnson, addressed a joint session of Congress as the nation’s 36th president on this day in 1963, even as Americans mourned John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated five days before.

In his 24-minute speech, Johnson called on Congress for “the earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights bill and a tax cut as the best way of honoring” the memory of slain president. Johnson, who had served in the House and as Senate majority leader before joining the Democratic ticket in 1960, remained a popular figure on Capitol Hill.

“All I have I would have given gladly not to be standing here today,” Johnson began. “The greatest leader of our time has been struck down by the foulest deed of our time. Today, John Fitzgerald Kennedy lives on in the immortal words and works that he left behind. He lives on in the mind and memories of mankind. He lives on in the hearts of his countrymen.”

“No words are sad enough to express our sense of loss,” he continued. “No words are strong enough to express our determination to continue the forward thrust of America that he began.”

“I profoundly hope that the tragedy and the torment of these terrible days will bind us together in new fellowship, making us one people in our hour of sorrow,” Johnson concluded.

The Chicago Tribune reported that Johnson received “a two-minute ovation” and “was interrupted 32 times by varying bursts of applause” in the House chamber.

Rep. Carlton Sickles (D-Md.) said, “President Johnson has given us just the reassurance the nation and the world needed. He is going to be a great president. But he can’t do it alone. It is now our turn in Congress to rise to the occasion and pass the legislation essential to our economy and to our well-being.”
