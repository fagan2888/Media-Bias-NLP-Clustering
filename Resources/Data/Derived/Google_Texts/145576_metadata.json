We need about 90 percent of our community to be immune.\u201d\n\nThe screen shot above shows the map. When you visit the site you can click on any of the dots, and a box appears to show you the name of the school, its address and rate of \u201cpersonal belief exemptions.\u201d While state law requires that every child be fully vaccinated to enter kindergarten, parents can opt out by filing a personal belief exemption (PBE), a signed statement that vaccines are against a parent\u2019s beliefs.\n\nPaul Leung, immunization program manager for Contra Costa Public Health, said the goal of producing the map was to increases awareness. \u201cMany community members may not realize this dangerous, disturbing trend of parents choosing to skip vaccines for their children,\u201d he said. \u201cIt not only puts these kids at greater risk of serious, dangerous diseases like measles and polio,\u201d but it also puts others at risk, he said, including those who cannot be vaccinated, such as babies, and children or adults too sick to be vaccinated.\n\nThe map color-codes schools by PBE rates \u2014 green is a PBE rate of 2.9 percent of less; yellow is 3-9.9 percent; red is greater than 9.9 percent.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much wiggle room,\u201d Leung said. \u201cWe need about 90 percent of our community to be immune. What we\u2019ve done with our maps is highlight schools where 10 percent or more of their incoming kids have exempted from vaccines, so these schools are more vulnerable to vaccine-preventable outbreaks.\u201d\n\nContra Costa Health Department says the kindergartens at five elementary schools and students at 22 child-care facilities had PBE rates above 9.9 percent. The schools are both public and private. East Bay Waldorf School, a private school in El Sobrante, has the highest PBE rate in the county, 50 percent, CCHD says. In 2008, county health officials briefly closed the school due to a whooping cough outbreak.\n\nThe statewide average for personal belief exemptions is 3 percent.\n\nIn January, a new state law went into effect, requiring parents seeking a personal belief exemption to first meet with a health care provider to discuss the risks and benefits of vaccines and to learn more about vaccine-preventable illnesses. Washington passed a similar law in 2011, and its personal belief exemption rate has dropped by 40 percent.\n\nContra Costa\u2019s data are for the current school year \u2014 schools are all required to report vaccination rates and PBE rates to the state after school starts in September. The state has not released its data for all counties for this school year as yet, but if you live in one of California\u2019s other 57 counties, you can look up your school\u2019s vaccination rates for 2012-2013.", "article_metadata": {"description": "27 schools and child-care facilities have opt-out rates above 9.9 percent, a risk for disease outbreaks.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Contra Costa County Maps Schools by Vaccination Rates: Find Yours \",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/03\\/04\\/contra-costa-county-maps-schools-by-vaccination-rates-find-yours\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-04 16:53:37\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-03-05 12:08:43\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":17971,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"personal belief exemption\",\"Science\",\"Vaccines\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/03\\/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-3.29.21-PM-e1393975849793.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "27 schools and child-care facilities have opt-out rates above 9.9 percent, a risk for disease outbreaks.", "title": "Contra Costa County Maps Schools by Vaccination Rates: Find Yours", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/03/04/contra-costa-county-maps-schools-by-vaccination-rates-find-yours/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-3.29.21-PM-640x292.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "personal belief exemption,science,vaccines", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde3e0\"", "article_summary": "Contra Costa\u2019s data are for the current school year \u2014 schools are all required to report vaccination rates and PBE rates to the state after school starts in September.\nThe map color-codes schools by PBE rates \u2014 green is a PBE rate of 2.9 percent of less; yellow is 3-9.9 percent; red is greater than 9.9 percent.\nWashington passed a similar law in 2011, and its personal belief exemption rate has dropped by 40 percent.\nThe statewide average for personal belief exemptions is 3 percent.\nPaul Leung, immunization program manager for Contra Costa Public Health, said the goal of producing the map was to increases awareness."}
