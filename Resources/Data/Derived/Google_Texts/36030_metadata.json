As Rep. Rick Glazier \u2014 who tried to amend the budget to shift the money to fund teacher assistants \u2014 said yesterday (as reported by Raleigh\u2019s News & Observer):\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that I believe in the history of the legislature that we\u2019ve done what this is asking. We\u2019re giving $1 million of taxpayers\u2019 money to an entity to then choose the charter schools to fund. \u2026 It is not our job to take away public funds and give them to a private entity to make public decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2010, Allison received $107,889 for his work running the non-profit; in 2012, Allison reported an income of $156,582\u2014a 45 percent pay increase in just two years.\u201d\n\nA check of the PEFNC Form 990 tax return for 2013 reveals that his compensation for that year was $167,085. The 2014 report is not yet available. By way of comparison, Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s salary is $142,265 and State Superintendent of Public Instruction June Atkinson\u2019s is $125,676.\n\nIn addition to the idea of giving public money to a right-wing lobby group, however, the whole thing is rendered even more remarkable by the circumstances that surround PEFNC\u2019s employment of its executive director, Darrell Allison. Mr Allison, who, according to his group\u2019s website , directs a staff of five, including himself, brings home quite a handsome \u2014 even stunning \u2014 salary.
