WASHINGTON — Barack Obama won't be on the ballot next November, and most Americans say the 2016 election isn't a debate over whether to continue his policies as president.

While Republican candidates often rally their supporters by blasting President Obama — for the Affordable Care Act and his leadership on national security, among other things — GOP voters are particularly resistant to the idea that the 44th president should play a central role in the choice of the 45th president to succeed him.

In a national USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll, a 51% majority of all those surveyed disagreed with a statement that the election "boils down to whether or not we want to continue Barack Obama's policies for an additional four years." Forty-four percent agreed with it; the rest were undecided.

Democrats by 51%-43% agreed with the statement, a signal of the continuing influence Obama has over those in his own party.

But Republicans by 57%-40% disagreed. Four in 10 said they "disagreed strongly."

The poll of 1,000 likely voters, taken Dec. 2-6, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
