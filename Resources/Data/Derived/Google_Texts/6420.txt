Five games and the Missouri Valley tournament stand between Wichita State and an unbeaten regular season. Six and the ACC tournament stand in the way for Syracuse.

As the season enters the homestretch, the Shockers and the Orange are locked in an intriguing race against history. The last team to reach its league tournament with a perfect record was Saint Joseph's in 2004. The last team to win a perfect national title was Indiana in 1976.

There have only been seven unbeaten champions since the first NCAA tournament in 1939.

Syracuse has the tougher path with road games against Duke and Virginia on top of a tougher conference tournament. The Shockers only face one winning team before their conference tournament.
