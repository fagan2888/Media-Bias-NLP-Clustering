And the head of the association of foodbanks says it will be a good time for people to start doing their homework.\n\n\u201cA lot of this is about managing the expectations and ... getting our current staff through training,\u201d said Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, executive director of the food bank association.\n\n\u201cI think that if anything, there is just such a media frenzy, I\u2019m likening it to Y2K,\u201d Hamler-Fugitt said. \u201cThe only thing that happens on Oct. 1 is that the federal marketplace comes online.\u201d\n\nThe marketplace is part of the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. Beginning Tuesday, those who need to buy individual policies -- people who do not already have health insurance through their jobs or some other source -- will be able to go to the online marketplace and see what plans are available for Ohio.\n\nThe navigators also are included in Obamacare. They are intended to help guide people through the plans, explaining costs and differences. Navigators will present information on all plans available, unlike brokers and agents who generally have information on the plans that they sell.\n\nThere are a handful of organizations coordinating navigators, but the Ohio Association of Foodbanks is by far the largest. It operates the Ohio Benefit Bank, a large online service that, in partnership with the state and nine of its agencies, four federal agencies and more than 1,100 faith-based and community organizations, connects Ohio\u2019s families with work support programs and tax credits.\n\nAfter the state certifies that the organizations fit the criteria, the individual navigators who work for them also must be cleared.\n\nHamler-Fugitt said the food bank association submitted its paperwork to the state Friday. She expects the navigators -- 30 to 40 paid staff -- will be trained and ready for work sometime between mid October and Nov. 1. That should still leave plenty of time for them to assist those who need help, she said.\n\nOpen enrollment runs through March 31, 2014. People who enroll by Dec. 15 will be able to get coverage effective Jan 1, 2014. After that, the coverage would take effect the next month after it is purchased.\n\nIn the meantime, people looking to buy insurance should start doing their homework, she said.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying to folks is that what people need to start thinking about now is the documentation they have to pull together,\u201d Hamler-Fugitt said. They should gather information like the name of their doctor, a list of their medications, any regular treatments and procedures they now have and an estimate of their income.\n\n\"They're going to have to look at what their budgets can afford, because they'll have premiums, they'll have deductibles, they'll have co-pays.\"\n\nFrom the state\u2019s perspective, even if people need guidance right away, they should be able to find it, Brock said.\n\nAnyone can buy insurance online from the exchange. They may also buy health insurance from agents around the state. Those agents and brokers, Brock said, are licensed and regulated by Ohio.\n\nBrock said he doubts there will be any community in Ohio where someone who needs help sorting out insurance issues will not be able to find it.\n\nThe reason the navigators aren\u2019t trained and ready to go, Hamler-Fugitt said, is a function of time.\n\nOhio Association of Foodbanks was notified Aug. 15 that it would be the main coordinator. The association didn\u2019t have it\u2019s first conversation about the program until Aug. 22.\n\nBut on Aug. 29, the organization was served with a request for vast amounts of information sought by the Republican controlled Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot,\u201d said Hamler-Fugitt. \u201cThat took me personally off line from the project for two weeks.\u201d\n\nThat the program could be up and running by mid October, though, is quick, said Hamler-Fugitt. She credits help from the state Insurance Department with smoothing the process.\n\n\"They have been more than gracious and helpful,\" she said. \"This is all new for all of us.\"\n\nThrough its handling of the Ohio Benefit Bank, which Hamler-Fugitt described as the largest benefit system in the nation, the food bank association has a long history of dealing with programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done this work for a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if was publicly funded or privately funded, we haven\u2019t ever brought in a program of this magnitude without at least six months lead time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "health-care-navigators,lisa hamler-fugitt,obamacare,ohio-association-of-foodbanks,ohio-department-of-insurance,patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act", "title": "Obamacare's insurance exchange for Ohio to launch without navigators to guide customers", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare\\u0027s insurance exchange for Ohio to launch without navigators to guide customers\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/09/obamacares_insurance_exchange.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/open_impact/photo/lisa-hamler-fugittjpg-7985a9aa0ef15cf7.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11325489\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-28T16:01:56Z\", \"author\": \"Robert Higgs, Northeast Ohio Media Group Columbus bureau chief\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"health-care-navigators\",\"lisa hamler-fugitt\",\"obamacare\",\"ohio-association-of-foodbanks\",\"ohio-department-of-insurance\",\"patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/open_impact/photo/9772996-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@RHiggsPD", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Even without navigators, Ohioans who will be purchasing insurance can still go online beginning Tuesday to see what plans are available."}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, September 28, 2013, 12:45 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/open_impact/photo/lisa-hamler-fugittjpg-7985a9aa0ef15cf7.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"RHiggs\", \"author_nickname\": \"Robert Higgs, Northeast Ohio Media Group Columbus bureau chief\", \"author_id\": \"2184\", \"source_blog_name\": \"OPEN: Ohio Politics\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "Even without navigators, Ohioans who will be purchasing insurance can still go online beginning Tuesday to see what plans are available.", "title": "Obamacare's insurance exchange for Ohio to launch without navigators to guide customers", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/09/obamacares_insurance_exchange.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, September 28, 2013, 12:00 PM", "article_author": "Robert Higgs, Northeast Ohio Media Group Columbus bureau chief", "Description": "Even without navigators, Ohioans who will be purchasing insurance can still go online beginning Tuesday to see what plans are available."}, "article_summary": "There are a handful of organizations coordinating navigators, but the Ohio Association of Foodbanks is by far the largest.\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio -- The federally run marketplace offering Ohioans health insurance plans opens for business beginning Tuesday, but Ohio will not have any of the so-called navigators trained and in place to guide people through their options.\nOhio Association of Foodbanks was notified Aug. 15 that it would be the main coordinator.\nShe credits help from the state Insurance Department with smoothing the process.\nNavigators also must be trained, and the first wave of trained navigators will not become available until at least mid-October, according to the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, the lead organization in a large consortium of groups that will provide navigators."}
