Nearly 40 percent of that funding is slated for the NIH, which would receive $30.2 billion, up about 1 percent from $29.9 billion in 2014. (See BioWorld Today, Jan. 16, 2014.)\n\nThe NIH would be in for a larger bump in research funding if Congress buys into the president\u2019s Opportunity, Growth and Security Initiative (OGSI), a $56 billion supplement to the budget. Under the initiative, NIH would receive an additional $970 million to support about 650 new grants and further fund the BRAIN initiative launched last year and other critical research priorities. (See BioWorld Today, May 15, 2013.)\n\nThe president\u2019s $3.9 trillion budget is \u201ca fiscal road map\u201d that sticks to the discretionary spending caps Congress agreed to last December, Sylvia Mathew Burwell, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said in a media briefing Tuesday.\n\nThe congressional deal provided relief from sequestration by raising the discretionary spending triggers to $1.012 trillion for 2014 and $1.14 billion for 2015. If 2015 spending were to exceed that amount, government agencies would face another automatic across-the-board cut in discretionary funds. (See BioWorld Today, Dec. 12, 2013.)\n\nThe 2015 discretionary spending cap isn\u2019t enough, Mathew Burwell said. That\u2019s why the president proposed the OGSI \u2013 separate from the budget \u2013 as a way to increase federal investment in infrastructure, innovation and education. The initiative, to be paid for through tax reforms and program cuts, is intended to infuse more money into the economy.\n\nBy keeping the excess funding separate from the budget, the administration can claim to adhere to the congressional agreement and possibly avoid triggering another sequester when it exceeds the limits of that agreement.\n\nIn addition to the NIH funding, the OGSI would provide $50 million to support clinical trials for promising universal flu vaccines and advance the nation\u2019s pandemic influenza preparedness. That\u2019s in addition to $170 million in the president\u2019s budget to continue support for high-priority pandemic influenza activities.\n\nAside from the OGSI funds, the proposed NIH budget includes increased funding for \u201cinnovative, high-risk, high-reward research to help spur development of new therapeutics to treat diseases and disorders . . . such as cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d according to the administration.\n\nThe budget also includes funding for a new NIH advanced research program modeled after the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and calls on NIH to implement new policies to improve transparency and reduce administrative costs.\n\nFDA AND OTHER PROGRAMS\n\nThe FDA could do even better than NIH in terms of new money. It stands to receive an 8 percent increase in total funding under the president\u2019s budget, but most of it would come from new food safety user fees. Of the $4.7 billion proposed for the agency, $2.6 billion would be from tax revenue, compared with $2.55 billion for 2014. The new funding includes $25 million to strengthen FDA oversight of compounding pharmacies as it implements the Drug Quality and Security Act.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s drug center would receive $480 million, a 3 percent increase over this year\u2019s funding. But the device center, biologics center and the National Center for Toxicological Research all would see slight reductions in funding.\n\nThe budget contains good news for sponsors of medical countermeasures (MCMs), with $462 million set aside to enhance the advanced development of next-generation MCMs, including resources for the NIH\u2019s Concept Acceleration Program and the FDA\u2019s MCM regulatory science initiatives. It also provides $415 million for the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund, used to acquire MCMs for the national stockpile.\n\nIf Congress follows the administration\u2019s recommendations, antibiotic developers also could benefit from new resources. The budget would more than double the funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to combat antibiotic resistance, and it would direct $30 million to an initiative to identify the sources of emerging infectious diseases faster, determine microbe resistance to antibiotics and study how microbes move through a population.\n\nOn the HIV/AIDS front, the budget would expand access to prevention and treatment while focusing resources on implementing effective and sustainable prevention strategies. It includes $2.3 billion for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program and $1.1 billion for CDC\u2019s HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis and hepatitis programs.\n\nFINDING OFFSETS\n\nTo offset some of the increases while still reducing HHS\u2019 total budget by 1 percent, the administration is looking to savings from the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the elimination of duplicative programs and changes in Medicare policy.\n\nFor instance, the budget proposes reductions in HHS\u2019 immunization and cancer screening programs. Such programs will no longer be necessary, the administration said, because the services will be financed and provided through expanded insurance coverage under the ACA.\n\nThe budget also would eliminate the CDC\u2019s Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grants, which enable states to respond rapidly to emerging health issues and to fill funding gaps in programs dealing with the leading causes of death and disability.\n\nThe grants duplicate \u201cexisting activities that could be more effectively implemented through targeted programs within CDC,\u201d the administration said.\n\nAs for Medicare, the budget calls for changes in the payment structure and includes proposals to expand value-based purchasing, strengthen quality incentives and reduce the risk of prescription drug abuse in the Medicare Part D program.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BioWorld Online is the news service of record for the biotechnology industry and is updated  every business morning.
