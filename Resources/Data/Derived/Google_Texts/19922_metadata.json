But it\u2019s been tightening up its audition process lately, making it tougher to actually join the clown ranks these days.\n\nEven so, for those in need of work, maybe being a clown is the answer to a prayer.\n\nClown and filmmaker Jeff Seal told the Gothamist, \u201cThere are still a lot of younger people becoming clowns \u2013 they\u2019re just not joining the Clowns of America International.
