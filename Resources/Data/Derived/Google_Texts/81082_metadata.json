We just want to be able to access it in a way that\u2019s not possible before.\u201d\n\nTechnically, Riley and his kids do have access to health care \u2013they\u2019re Choctaw tribal members and that means they could go to any Indian Health Service hospital. Problem is, the closest one is in Lawton, Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cWhen you have kids and you want to just have a primary care doctor it\u2019s not really practical for every doctor appointment we would drive to Oklahoma,\u201d Riley says.\n\nIn North Texas, Native Americans have even lower rates of health insurance than the general population.
