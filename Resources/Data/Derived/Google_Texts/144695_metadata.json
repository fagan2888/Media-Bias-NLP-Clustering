File/Jeff Chiu/AP\n\nNorthern California is far away from South Carolina, both geographically and stylistically.\n\nMoncks Corner (the hometown of Bruce Ellington) and Santa Clara, Calif. (the residence of Levi\u2019s Stadium, home of Ellington\u2019s San Francisco 49ers) are separated by 2,366 miles as the crow flies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different from the South, man. That plane ride, five hours, it ain\u2019t no joke,\u201d Ellington said Saturday at the Tory Dandy Scholarship event hosted by his agent at Woodruff High School. \u201cBut I\u2019m adjusted to it and I\u2019m loving it out there \u2014 the weather\u2019s great, the people are nice. It\u2019s a little expensive, but it\u2019s all good.\u201d\n\nAfter helping South Carolina to three straight top-10 finishes in the rankings, Ellington was used sparingly his rookie season, catching six balls for 62 yards in 13 games.\n\n\u201cNot having the good season you want, it was kind of hard,\u201d said Ellington, whose team has moved on from the Jim Harbaugh era. Former Charleston Southern assistant Jim Tomsula is now the head man in San Francisco. \u201cBut I think this year with some guys leaving and some guys coming in, we\u2019re going to be pretty good.\u201d\n\nHis two highlight efforts were each in defeat \u2014 at Denver on Oct. 19 (three catches, 44 yards and a touchdown) and at San Diego on Dec. 20 (two touchdowns; one receiving, one rushing.)\n\n\u201cGuys like Anquan Boldin, Michael Crabtree, they helped me learn everything about it,\u201d Ellington said. \u201cI had a guy named Quinton Patton, he was a second-year guy, so he knew what I had to go through my first year. He was a guy I followed behind.\u201d\n\nA fourth-round choice, Ellington was the Gamecocks\u2019 only 2014 NFL draft selection besides top overall pick Jadeveon Clowney.\n\n\u201cI just want to get on the field and be a playmaker out there,\u201d Ellington said.\n\nDon\u2019t forget us\n\nThere\u2019s a group text going around including some of the top running backs in this year\u2019s draft class \u2014 Georgia\u2019s Todd Gurley, Wisconsin\u2019s Melvin Gordon and Miami\u2019s Duke Johnson, to name a few.\n\nThe group\u2019s primary message, according to USC product Mike Davis: running backs are people, too.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our thing. We\u2019re looking to run our value back up,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe want to let people know that we\u2019re here, and don\u2019t try to devalue us.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been two straight years there were zero running backs selected in the first round, which followed a 49-year streak with at least one first-round runner. So it goes in the pass-happy era when running backs are regarded as disposable as Gatorade cups.\n\nGurley is the best bet to end the first-round slide; Davis might go undrafted, though the 2013 All-SEC second-teamer feels positive about recent visits to perennial powers Indianapolis, New England and Seattle, with one more visit to the 49ers lined up for Wednesday.\n\nDavis\u2019 older brother, James, was a 2009 sixth-round pick of the Cleveland Browns out of Clemson.\n\n\u201cMy brother\u2019s advice is to just be patient,\u201d said Mike Davis, who rushed for 2,165 yards and 20 touchdowns the last two years. \u201cJust be ready for anything that happens. Just prepare well.\u201d\n\nThird round a charm?\n\nGamecocks fans might want to target the later hours May 1, a Friday night, to check on where their guys will continue their professional futures.\n\nDavis and offensive linemen A.J. Cann and Corey Robinson are each regarded as third-round prospects, per WalterFootball.com. Cann could have some second-round potential, while Davis and Robinson might end up slipping to the middle or late rounds on Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "South Carolina notes: Ellington hopeful for 49ers future; Mike Davis ready for draft, Sports, \r\nSportssouthcarolina, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nNFL, \r\nNFL, A.J.
