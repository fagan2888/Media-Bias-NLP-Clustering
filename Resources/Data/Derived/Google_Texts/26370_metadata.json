Media watchdogs argue that failure to include this detail in any Post coverage of the CIA means there may be an intentional omission of critical and crucial details of the agency\u2019s work in Post stories.\n\nAlthough $600 million doesn\u2019t sound like much more than pocket change for a multi-billionaire, Norman Solomon, a writer, activist, and media critic, says that\u2019s more than twice as much as Bezos paid to buy the Washington Post.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nSince the paper often reports on the activities of the CIA, there is now a petition and encouragement from media watchdog groups for the paper to disclose to its readers that its owner is in business with the CIA.\n\nMore than 15,000 people signed the petition this past week and expressed their concerns in the comments section, since the \u201cPost functions as a powerhouse media outlet in the nation\u2019s Capital, it\u2019s also a national and global entity \u2014 read every day by millions of people who never hold its newsprint edition in their hands,\u201d according to Solomon, and \u201cHundreds of daily papers reprint the Post\u2019s news articles and opinion pieces, while online readership spans the world.\u201d\n\nStill, the paper has done little or nothing to disclose just how connected it is to the federal agency, which according to journalism scholar Robert W. McChesney is concerning since the Post is \u201cunquestionably the political paper of record in the United States, and how it covers governance sets the agenda for the balance of the news media.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that \u201cIf some official enemy of the United States had a comparable situation \u2014 say the owner of the dominant newspaper in Caracas was getting $600 million in secretive contracts from the Maduro government \u2014 the Post itself would lead the howling chorus impaling that newspaper and that government for making a mockery of a free press. It is time for the Post to take a dose of its own medicine.\u201d\n\nEven former CIA official Ray McGovern has expressed concerns about the Post\u2019s failure to disclose its relationship with the agency, saying that in the intelligence world, such a relationship is called an \u201cagent of influence.\u201d McGovern went on to say that Bezos\u2019s ownership of the Post and \u201chuge financial interest in playing nice with the CIA\u201d could affect the national security state.\n\nThe CIA connection\n\nNews of the Amazon-CIA deal was confirmed this past October when International Business Machines Corp. filed a formal protest over the CIA\u2019s decision to work with Amazon instead of IBM to build its cloud network.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office \u2014 the agency that makes recommendations on contested contracts \u2014 sided with IBM, saying that the CIA \u201cfailed to properly evaluate prices and had waived a contract requirement only for Amazon,\u201d but in the end the U.S. Court of Federal Claims sided with Amazon.\n\nAware of Amazon\u2019s CIA affiliation, Post reporter Andrea Petersen, who covers technology policy, penned a blog post this past September \u2014 a month after it was announced Bezos had purchased the paper \u2014 describing what happened when she asked the new owner about the CIA cloud computing contracts.\n\nPetersen reported she asked Bezos to comment on Amazon\u2019s pursuit of CIA cloud contracts, since there are reports that Amazon has 100-plus postings for engineers and technical positions requiring top secret clearance.\n\nIn response, Bezos reportedly chuckled a bit and then went on to praise Amazon\u2019s cloud computing arm \u2014 Amazon Web Services \u2014 calling it \u201cthe leader in infrastructure cloud computing.\u201d He also \u201cexplained to my less technically inclined colleagues that it basically sells \u2018computing time by the hour to other companies.\u2019\u201d\n\nBezos reportedly continued on to say that the real story about the deal is that Amazon defeated IBM to win a contract with the CIA, and according to Petersen, discussed specifics of the CIA contract that she neglected to include in her post.\n\nAlthough the public, including Post readers, has the ability to connect the dots between the paper\u2019s in-direct relationship with the CIA, since the information is publicly available, media watchdog groups point out that \u201ca basic principle of journalism is to acknowledge when the owner of a media outlet has a major financial relationship with the subject of coverage.\u201d\n\nThey argue that every Post article about the CIA should include full disclosure that the paper\u2019s owner is also the main owner of Amazon, which is receiving huge profits directly from the CIA.\n\nFor Solomon, the fact that the CIA opted to go with Amazon to build and run its \u201ccloud\u201d infrastructure despite the fact that Amazon didn\u2019t have the lowest bid \u2014 IBM did \u2014 is concerning.\n\nAlthough Amazon is only working with the CIA now, Solomon says Bezos may encourage Post reporters to cover fewer pieces criticizing the CIA in the hope that Amazon has an easier time obtaining business from other government agencies.\n\nPlus, Solomon pointed out that last month Amazon said publicly it was looking forward to \u201ca successful relationship with the CIA,\u201d which Solomon says will likely only happen \u201cif [Bezos\u2019s] newspaper does less ruffling and more soothing of CIA feathers.\u201d\n\nNPR media correspondent David Folkenflik agrees the Post should be doing more to disclose its relationship with the CIA since \u201cthere is an \u2018enormous constellation of issues\u2019 that affect Amazon\u2019s bottom line in Washington \u2013 which should raise some concerns about conflicts of interest on issues like internet sales taxes and copyright/intellectual property.\u201d\n\nAnd added that since Amazon is becoming a \u201cmajor vendor\u201d to the U.S. government, especially when it comes to web storage technology, it remains unknown how the paper may censor any negative stories about the intelligence agency.\n\nHistory of censorship\n\nAlthough Folkenflik says he suspects Bezos doesn\u2019t intend to interfere in the paper\u2019s reporting, he said no one really knows whether Bezos would censor information, since he has never operated a paper before.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true Bezos has never owned and operated a newspaper before \u2014 especially one with as large of a readership as the Washington Post \u2014 Amazon\u2019s AWS webhosting service \u2014 the same group that is working with the CIA and hosts Mint Press News\u2019 website \u2014 stopped hosting WikiLeaks content in 2010 after the organization published State Department cables.\n\nAmazon released a statement after pulling the plug on its relationship with WikiLeaks, saying that the decision to no longer host WikiLeaks content was based solely on the organization\u2019s violation of the terms of service agreement. But not everyone was convinced it wasn\u2019t a political decision, since the timing of Amazon\u2019s decision since followed a call from politicians such as Sen. Joe Lieberman to actively retaliate against WikiLeaks.\n\nHowever, even if Bezos did not press Post reporters to cover the CIA in a more favorable manner, former Washington Post reporter John Hanrahan said \u201cPost reporters and editors are aware that Bezos, as majority owner of Amazon, has a financial stake in maintaining good relations with the CIA \u2014 and this sends a clear message to even the hardest-nosed journalist that making the CIA look bad might not be a good career move.\u201d\n\nThough disclosing the relationship that exists between the paper\u2019s owner and the CIA may not ease the Post reporters worries about calling out the CIA, or ease the readers minds that what they are reading is accurate, Solomon says propaganda largely depends on patterns of omission and repetition.\n\n\u201cIf in its coverage of the CIA, the Washington Post were willing to fully disclose the financial ties that bind its owner to the CIA, such candor would shed some light on how top-down power actually works in our society.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Such a relationship is called an \u201cagent of influence\u201d in the intelligence world, a former CIA official said.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Katie Rucke", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Such a relationship is called an \u201cagent of influence\u201d in the intelligence world, a former CIA official said.", "title": "Washington Post, Bezos Must Disclose Relationship With CIA: Media Watchdogs", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/washington-post-bezos-must-disclose-relationship-cia-media-watchdogs/175558/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Bezos_16x9-690x387.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-12-26T10:39:59-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Such a relationship is called an \u201cagent of influence\u201d in the intelligence world, a former CIA official said.", "creator": "@katierucke", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Bezos_4x3.jpg", "title": "Washington Post, Bezos Must Disclose Relationship With CIA: Media Watchdogs", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: Inside Stories", "tag": "Wikileaks", "published_time": "2013-12-26T05:00:26-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-26T10:39:59-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb269\"", "article_summary": "Washington Post, Bezos Must Disclose Relationship With CIA: Media WatchdogsSuch a relationship is called an \u201cagent of influence\u201d in the intelligence world, a former CIA official said.\n\u201cIf in its coverage of the CIA, the Washington Post were willing to fully disclose the financial ties that bind its owner to the CIA, such candor would shed some light on how top-down power actually works in our society.\u201d\nAlthough Amazon is only working with the CIA now, Solomon says Bezos may encourage Post reporters to cover fewer pieces criticizing the CIA in the hope that Amazon has an easier time obtaining business from other government agencies.\nAlthough $600 million doesn\u2019t sound like much more than pocket change for a multi-billionaire, Norman Solomon, a writer, activist, and media critic, says that\u2019s more than twice as much as Bezos paid to buy the Washington Post.\nMedia watchdogs argue that failure to include this detail in any Post coverage of the CIA means there may be an intentional omission of critical and crucial details of the agency\u2019s work in Post stories."}
