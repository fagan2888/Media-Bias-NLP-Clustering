That\u2019s the highest figure ever reported in the nine years since the city started doing this yearly study. It\u2019s an increase from last year's festival, which brought in just over $315 million.\n\nThis year, the festival saw success with some of its first-time events, like the medicine and technology expo.\n\nHugh Forrest, who directs South by Southwest Interactive, says the med expo did well in part because of the upcoming Dell Medical School in Austin.\n\n\"It\u2019s also a reflection on the changes brought by Obamacare, and there are lots of opportunities for startups in the healthcare space now, so we benefited well from that,\" Forrest says.\n\nIn 2016, medical technology will start at the very beginning of the interactive portion. And interactive will bump up against music, in the hopes tech fans will stay in Austin for the bands.\n\nNext year will be SXSW\u2019s 30th anniversary. And as it continues to grow, the festival remains \u201ca key economic driver that supports our local economy and innovation community well after the main event concludes,\u201d says Michael Rollins, President of the Austin Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe service industry in particular feels a lot of SXSW\u2019s economic impact: It\u2019s the single most profitable event for Austin\u2019s hospitality industry.\n\nThe report covers a lot of ground, so we\u2019ve pulled out some of the numbers here.\n\n13,300: The number of hotel reservations booked directly through SXSW this year\n\n5: The average number of nights of those hotel guests\u2019 lengths of stay\n\n60,254: The total number of nights booked in Austin hotels (by people who booked directly through SXSW)\n\n330: The average nightly hotel rate, in dollars, for rooms booked through SXSW in 2015\n\n55: The percent by which hotel rates during SXSW have increased over the past 5 years\n\n90 million: The assessed value, in dollars, of the SXSW coverage in online, print and broadcast media\n\n400: The number of official film screenings at 2015 SXSWFilm\n\n2,275: The number of bands officially featured in 2015 SXSWMusic\n\n85: The number of countries officially represented at the festival\n\nThe study was conducted by Greyhill Advisors.
