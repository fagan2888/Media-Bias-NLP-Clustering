The problem is that inflammation can easily get out of hand. If the inflammatory response to an infection or injury is too robust, it can ultimately cause more tissue damage and lingering health problems than it prevents.\n\nScientists at Chosun University in Gwangju, South Korea, recently began to consider whether exercise might affect the body\u2019s response to germs. Physical activity generally reduces the amount of fat in the body and alters levels of inflammation.\n\nFor the new study, in Scientific Reports, they gathered 28 lab mice and tested them for markers of inflammation. They then had half of the mice begin a swimming regimen \u2014 the equivalent of what 30 minutes of jogging might be for us. The other mice remained sedentary.\n\nAfter three weeks, half of the swimmers and half of the inactive mice were inoculated with Staphylococcus germs. Inflammation rapidly blossomed in the sedentary, infected animals, as their immune systems pumped out high numbers of cells that promote inflammation. The infected swimmers had much lower levels of these pro-inflammatory cells, lower even than in the uninfected swimmers. Overall, the infected swimmers did not become as sick as the infected sedentary mice.\n\n\u2014 Gretchen Reynolds, The New York Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/11/hffit11.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Overall, the infected swimmers did not become as sick as the infected sedentary mice.\nThe infected swimmers had much lower levels of these pro-inflammatory cells, lower even than in the uninfected swimmers.\nInflammation rapidly blossomed in the sedentary, infected animals, as their immune systems pumped out high numbers of cells that promote inflammation.\nIn broad terms, our immune system reacts to invading microbes through inflammation.\nA: Working out could help us fight off colds and other infections, according to a new study on mice."}
