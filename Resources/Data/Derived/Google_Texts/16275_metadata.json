Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) said in a phone interview with Time magazine Thursday that Americans \u201cjust don\u2019t believe\u201d Obama cares about representing his country.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying my grandmother would say, \u2018People don\u2019t care how much you know, until they know how much you care,'\u201d detailed Manchin. \u201cAnd the president is bright and very articulate and speaks very well. People just don\u2019t believe he cares. That\u2019s the disconnect that I\u2019m seeing.\u201d\n\nManchin, recognized as a rather conservative Democrat, expressed his optimism following the midterm election that saw Republicans take hold of Congress.\n\n\u201cI liked everything I heard \u2014 that we\u2019re going to have a process that\u2019s going to work,\u201d explained Manchin, referencing Mitch McConnell\u2019s remarks following his reelection and his own conversations with GOP lawmakers. \u201cNow the Republicans are saying, \u2018Listen, we\u2019re going to have an open process, we\u2019re going to have a committee system.'\u201d\n\nLooking ahead to the new Congress, Manchin described himself as \u201canxious for change.\u201d\n\nThe West Virginia senator specifically said an authorization vote on the Keystone XL pipeline would be a \u201cslam-dunk\u201d and advocated for raising the Obamacare workweek to 40 hours.\n\n\u201cTo say that now we\u2019re going to verify the 30 hours \u2014 we\u2019ll be worse than Europe,\u201d he said of the Affordable Care Act workweek. \u201cI can\u2019t go to West Virginia and try to sell that crap.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, President Obama assured Friday that he will not \u201cjudge ideas based on whether they\u2019re Democratic or Republican\u201d and will instead attempt to work with the Republican-led Congress.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Sen.
