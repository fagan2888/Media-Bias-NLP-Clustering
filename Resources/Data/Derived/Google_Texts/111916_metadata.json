Most gifts-with-purchase tend to be seasonal: the beginning of the summer holidays and Father\u2019s Day on Sunday means there are some good deals around.\n\n\n\nOffers can be limited to one particular outlet. I found an Estee Lauder gift with purchase which is available only at Harrods or harrods.com.\n\n\n\nBuy two or more Estee Lauder products, one to be moisturiser, eye care or repair serum, between June 16 and July 12 and you\u2019ll receive a bag of goodies containing Re-Nutriv Cr\u00e8me Cleanser, Lift Age Correcting Cr\u00e8me, a compact containing six eyeshadows and two blushers, an eye pencil, mascara, lip gloss and lipstick.\n\n\n\nBear in mind these are mini-sized products, but they\u2019re handy for travelling, and they come in a lovely bag.\n\n\n\nDr Perricone online also has a good value offer. The Perricone Sub-D Kit costs \u00a339.99 plus \u00a34.95 postage and packaging (subd.co.uk), and contains Cold Plasma Sub-D (to improve elasticity on the jawline and neck), worth \u00a355, and High Potency Amine Face Lift, \u00a340, saving you a total of \u00a355 \u2014 plus you\u2019ll get the Discovery Collection, worth \u00a345, for free.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth looking out in stores for savings, such as the Soleil Protection Pack from Superdrug, which is half-price at \u00a311.49 until July 29. It contains full-sized bottles of SPF30 and SPF15 sun lotions, plus children\u2019s SPF30 suncream and an aftersun.\n\n\n\nSpend \u00a33.99 on Collection in Superdrug and get a free Mardis Gras Lipbalm\n\nThere\u2019s also a Bourjois offer during June \u2014 buy three products in the \u2018three for two\u2019 range to get a free pair of sunglasses. And if you spend \u00a33.99 on a Collection product in Superdrug, you\u2019ll receive a free Mardi Gras Lip Balm.\n\n\n\nBuy any two products from a Lancome counter nationwide, with one being skincare, and you\u2019ll receive a lovely Jenny Packham-designed cosmetic bag containing a selection of Lancome travel-sized products.\n\n\n\nFor something a bit different, buy 50ml of Agent Provocateur Fatale perfume, from \u00a346 (Boots), from June 30 and get a free pair of Agent Provocateur hold-ups.\n\n\n\nThere are some great offers around for men, which would be good gifts for Father\u2019s Day.\n\n\n\nFor the launch of Montblanc Emblem aftershave, there\u2019s a free toiletry bag with any 50ml purchase from Superdrug and The Perfume Shop.\n\n\n\nClarinsMen has a Grooming Essentials Kit containing four products, including Exfoliating Cleanser, Super Moisture Balm, Smooth Shave and Shampoo and Shower for just \u00a335 (clarins.co.uk) \u2014 a saving of \u00a321.85 \u2014 and it comes with a free washbag.\n\nMY ANTI-AGEING HERO: LINDA BARKER\n\nMY MIRACLE WORKER: Stratum C Menopause Protect Cream, 50ml, \u00a385 (harveynichols.com)\n\nI\u2019ve always looked after my skin and, with a TV career as a designer, I tried to use the best skincare I could. But despite this, I was taken unawares by the impact of the menopause, and had started to develop more lines and wrinkles. Stratum C products have been created for menopausal skin and seem to leave it plumper and firmer.\n\nMore great skincare for menopausal women:\n\nDermol 500 Lotion (\u00a311.94, lloydspharmacy.com)\n\nReplenish Day Cream SPF 15 50ml (\u00a312.95, nurtureskin care.co.uk)\n\nMurad Resurgence range, (from \u00a323 muraduk.com)\n\nUNSUNG HERO\n\n\n\nGarnier Ultimate Blends 7-in-1 Dry Shampoo, \u00a33.99 (Boots)\n\nHow did we manage without dry shampoo? It\u2019s magical on mornings when you don\u2019t have time, or just can\u2019t be bothered, to wash your hair; it\u2019s also great for adding body to hair. There is no powdery residue and it has a lovely vanilla fragrance that lasts all day. I\u2019m happy with anything that makes my blow dry last longer and if it smells nice, it\u2019s a bonus.\n\n\n\nBARGAIN BUY\n\n\n\nI love the affordable e.l.f. range of more than 1,000 products. Stand-outs are Eyelid Primer, \u00a31.95, which makes eye shadow last longer, and the California Baked Eyeshadow Palette, \u00a310. And lipstick goes on smoothly with Lip Exfoliator, \u00a33.95. eyeslipsface.co.uk\n\nFACE TIME\n\nOne of the most effective exfoliators around is Dermalogica\u2019s Microfoliant, \u00a340.30 (lookfantastic.com). Now there\u2019s an alternative \u2014 Indeed Labs has launched Facial Powdered Exfoliator, \u00a319.99 (Boots). It\u2019s brilliant for sloughing off dead skin without causing any irritation.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "FOREVER,BEAUTIFUL,Best,beauty,freebies", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2652417/FOREVER-BEAUTIFUL-Best-beauty-freebies.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Are 'free with purchase' gifts value for money or just a marketing ply?
