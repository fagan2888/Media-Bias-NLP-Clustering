CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) â€” Carlsbad city officials are questioning why elevators at Carlsbad Caverns, continue to be out of service.

The Carlsbad Current-Argus reports that passenger elevators at New Mexico's only National Park, which have been broken since November, will remain that way indefinitely.

The Carlsbad City Council asked Park Superintendent Doug Neighbor at a meeting this week if there was a way to expedite the process of settling on a contractor to do the repair work.

Park officials say an elevator stopped working 650 feet underground during an inspection.

They decided to shut the other one down for safety reasons.

Park engineers say freight elevators may resume operations March 1 but the passenger elevators could take six months.

A 2012 National Park Service report estimated that tourists spend $22 million around Carlsbad.
