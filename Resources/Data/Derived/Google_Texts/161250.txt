Bill O’Reilly said tonight there’s a lot of “anger” amongst liberals who just can’t handle being told that President Obama‘s presidency has been a “failure.”

To O’Reilly, liberals are lashing out at conservatives with serious anger because they can’t handle coming to terms with that. And this apparently applies to Hillary Clinton too.

As far as O’Reilly’s concerned, liberals will “launch vicious attacks on whomever the Republican nominee will be” with increasing anger as more and more scandals start bubbling up around the Clintons.

He warned that if this continues, the 2016 election will end up being the “ugliest” in recent memory.
