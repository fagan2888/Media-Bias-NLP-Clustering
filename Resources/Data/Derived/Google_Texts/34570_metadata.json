The insurance companies that cover them don\u2019t know if these customers are newly insured or are just changing plans.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to sell health insurance in any case, but efforts to enroll New Mexicans began much later than insurance-exchange officials planned. Once started, some marketing efforts appeared to be ineffective.\n\nFunds available for marketing went unspent, partly because of the marketing effort\u2019s late start and partly because it wasn\u2019t clear what the best use of the funds would be.\n\nNew Mexico Health Insurance Exchange Board Chairman J.R. Damron said the board didn\u2019t have time before enrollment began to do the market research necessary to guide marketing efforts.\n\n\u201cWe had enough money, but we didn\u2019t have time to do the surveys and the proactive stuff that states like California and New York could,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working on this for three years. We had five months.\u201d\n\nThe New Mexico Primary Care Association had a contract with the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange to help enroll customers in insurance plans.\n\nFew signed up\n\nExecutive Director David Roddy said that by the end of March, a promotional event sponsored by KOAT Television turned up 11,000 people who asked for appointments to enroll in an insurance program. PCA was able to contact 7,700 of them. Fewer than 600 actually bought insurance.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 reason people didn\u2019t sign up was price,\u201d he said. \u201cThe No. 2 reason was bad media.\u201d\n\nThe news was full of problems with the federal exchange website, and it took months to launch media campaigns to counteract that news, Roddy said.\n\nInsurance is complicated and hard to explain, and people who have done well without it don\u2019t necessarily believe they need it. People are more likely to buy insurance when they\u2019re dealing with health problems.\n\n\u201cWhat you need to do is convince the people that, first, you have to have insurance,\u201d Roddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s required. No. 2, if you are low or middle income, you\u2019re likely to get some (financial) help with that. No. 3, it is critical to have insurance for physical health and financial health.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a culture of un-insurance out there,\u201d said Dick Mason, vice president of the League of Women Voters of New Mexico and the league\u2019s expert on health-insurance exchanges. \u201cPeople have gone generations without health insurance. The concept is just not there for them.\u201d\n\nThere is some disagreement about what marketing approach would work.\n\nAdvocates like Mason say the exchange needs to hire more people, known as guides or navigators, to personally call on targeted customers. People from the community know who needs insurance and understand what potential customers\u2019 concerns are, he said.\n\nRoddy said the Primary Care Association has been in the business of enrolling Medicaid members for 10 years and has found many outreach efforts don\u2019t work.\n\nOutreach failures\n\nAn insurance exchange-sponsored pizza party at the University of New Mexico aimed at students produced no enrollment, he said. Six health care guides spent hours at a computer lab during another UNM event, saw 10 people and got two to enroll.\n\n\u201cYou can go door to door, you can do community outreach, but this is not like voter registration,\u201d he said.\n\nYet, it was precisely that approach that Mason and other advocates say was responsible for some success in enrolling American Indian customers.\n\nRoxane Spruce Bly, director of health-care education and outreach at Native American Professional Parent Resources, said outreach efforts aimed at Native Americans reached 22,000 people, of whom 566 bought health insurance.\n\nThat\u2019s a small number until you consider they have very little incentive to buy insurance at all. Native Americans are exempt from ACA provisions that tax people who don\u2019t have coverage this year, and they are eligible for free care through the Indian Health Service.\n\nThe state exchange funded outreach efforts that were based in native communities. Pueblo governors and other officials in some communities went door to door to encourage enrollment. Marketing materials were custom designed for Native American customers.\n\n\u201cWe found people where they were at,\u201d Spruce Bly said. \u201cWe thought about where people work, play, shop, hang out. That\u2019s where we did the outreach.\u201d\n\nGuides rode city buses to meet urban American Indians. They recruited people in laundromats.\n\n\u201cWe learned early on people weren\u2019t going to go somewhere to get information,\u201d she said.\n\nFewer uninsured now\n\nDespite the marketing challenges, the Affordable Care Act did put a meaningful dent in the state\u2019s uninsured population. One provision of the law allows states to extend Medicaid benefits to any able-bodied adult younger than 65 years who earns no more than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $15,856 a year for a single-person household. New Mexico\u2019s Medicaid program before the expansion covered almost exclusively low-income children, people older than 65 and disabled people.\n\nAn estimated 220,000 New Mexicans are eligible for expanded Medicaid benefits, and 121,000 of them signed up for the newly available coverage. Many of them found their way to Medicaid by visiting the insurance exchanges online, by talking with guides, or at enrollment events designed to encourage use of the exchange.\n\nUncle Sam will pay the entire tab for these newly insured through 2016, then taper payments down until the federal government pays 90 percent of the cost after 2020.\n\n\u201cIf the goal was to get people insured, we did that,\u201d said Mario Molina, president of Long Beach, Calif.-based Molina Healthcare, which offers Medicaid managed-care products and insurance on the exchange in New Mexico.\n\nThe wonder is that the New Mexico exchange worked at all. The state Legislature voted to start the exchange in 2011, but Gov. Susana Martinez, who unlike many Republican governors agreed to Medicaid expansion, vetoed that bill. Martinez said the legislation was premature because the state had until 2013 to prepare; federal rules governing exchanges weren\u2019t completed; and there wasn\u2019t enough consideration of the costs.\n\nThe law establishing the exchange finally went into effect in early 2013. The board didn\u2019t have its first meeting until May of last year, giving it five months to bring an online insurance marketplace into existence by the federal Oct. 1 deadline.\n\nA very late start\n\nThe board realized early on that it could not get both an individual exchange and an exchange where small businesses could buy coverage for employees running at the same time. The New Mexico exchange focused on the business piece, called a SHOP exchange, and plans to launch a state-run exchange for individuals this fall.\n\nThat left individual New Mexicans to buy insurance on the notoriously flawed federal exchange, which was barely functional in December, two months after the first ACA open-enrollment period began.\n\n\u201cGiven that the board had less than a year to implement this, I think they\u2019ve done an amazing job,\u201d Mason said.\n\nDamron said the exchange board originally expected to enroll 80,000 people in the first year of operation.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t get started in marketing and public relations until mid- to late December,\u201d in part because it didn\u2019t seem wise to push enrollment on a federal website that didn\u2019t work, he said. \u201cNobody wants to talk about health insurance that time of year, so we downgraded our expectations to 40,000.\u201d\n\nRoddy said 90,000 New Mexicans who were eligible to use the exchange went online and registered, a step the federal exchange required before allowing a customer to buy insurance. Of those, 26,000 did not purchase insurance and about 30,000 were found to be eligible for Medicaid.\n\nHow the plans did\n\nPresbyterian Health Plan ended up enrolling about 6,600 individuals through the insurance exchange. New Mexico Health Connections enrolled about 10,000 members, about 8,000 of whom used the exchange to enroll.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico enrolled about 15,000 through the exchange. Molina Healthcare declined to disclose how many members it enrolled on the exchange.\n\nThe plans don\u2019t know much about their new enrollees yet.\n\nPresbyterian Health Plan President Lisa Lujan said early numbers suggest members enrolled as a result of the ACA seem to need more care than other members. They have more primary- care visits and more hospitalizations for medical conditions.\n\n\u201cWe are also seeing higher emergency department use in the members enrolling under ACA plans, which is consistent with national trends,\u201d she said. Presbyterian is seeing \u201cearlier-than-anticipated utilization\u201d of behavioral health and maternity coverage, \u201cincluding a significant number of births in the first quarter.\u201d\n\nOther ACA members seem to be demanding \u201cseveral high-cost medical services\u201d related to chronic conditions.\n\n\u201cThese early trends are not surprising,\u201d Lujan said. \u201cBased on past experience, we expected to see some pent-up demand in this population.\u201d\n\nEmergency department use is fairly typical among newly insured, Mario Molina said.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s not that patients don\u2019t have a doctor. A lot of them just don\u2019t know how to use their coverage. They go to the emergency department because they don\u2019t know what else to do,\u201d he said.\n\nOlder, sicker signees\n\nPeople who enrolled in Presbyterian\u2019s ACA plans tended to be a little older, and they were a little more likely to be female than male. About 53 percent of enrollees qualified for federal subsidies designed to make health insurance more affordable.\n\nAbout 26 percent of Molina Healthcare enrollees on the exchange were younger than 34; 38 percent were 35 to 54 years old; and 36 percent were 55 to 65.\n\nMost of Molina\u2019s New Mexico members, 78 percent of them, bought the more-expensive plans, which charge higher premiums but which require less out-of-pocket spending, Mario Molina said.\n\nOn the other hand, 40 percent of New Mexico Health Connections customers chose plans offering the lowest premiums and the highest out-of-pocket spending. About 75 percent of the customers qualified for a federal subsidy.\n\nJust based on the phone calls customer-service personnel are receiving, Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico believes \u201cmany consumers were able to obtain health insurance for the first time through the exchange,\u201d said Janice Torrez, vice president of external affairs.\n\n\u201cThe length of calls alone tells us they are new to insurance,\u201d said Becky Kenny, Blue Cross Blue Shield spokeswoman. \u201cWe\u2019re spending 30 to 40 minutes on calls that used to take 10 at the most.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 Despite favorable demographics, many New Mexicans sidestep exchange signups", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Winthrop Quigley | Journal Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/409371/taking-the-pulse-of-health-plans.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/mb06_jd_02jun_2exchange-1000x688.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Despite favorable demographics, many New Mexicans sidestep exchange signups", "title": "Updated: Taking the pulse of health plans"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda789\"", "article_summary": "We had five months.\u201dThe New Mexico Primary Care Association had a contract with the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange to help enroll customers in insurance plans.\nOn the other hand, 40 percent of New Mexico Health Connections customers chose plans offering the lowest premiums and the highest out-of-pocket spending.\nIt\u2019s hard to sell health insurance in any case, but efforts to enroll New Mexicans began much later than insurance-exchange officials planned.\nSix health care guides spent hours at a computer lab during another UNM event, saw 10 people and got two to enroll.\nHow the plans didPresbyterian Health Plan ended up enrolling about 6,600 individuals through the insurance exchange."}
