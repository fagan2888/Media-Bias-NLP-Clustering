Every 67 seconds, someone in the U.S. develops Alzheimer's disease according to the Alzheimer's Association, and local groups are working to help people in this area stay healthy.

The Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority put on an interdenominational outreach church training event at the St. Patrick Catholic Church center Saturday. The director of the Mississippi chapter of the Alzheimer's association shared tips for brain-healthy eating habits with Alzheimer's patients and caregivers.

"It's a new aspect, not just about Alzheimer's disease, but also to live a brain-healthy lifestyle, so you can be functional for a longer period of time in your life," Alpha Kappa Alpha member Adrian T. Mosley says.

"God gave us the gift of our mind, and this is taking care of it," Father Frank Cosgrove says. "I have to say I enjoyed the brain-healthy food, too. I just had lunch."

This training program is in conjunction with the city of Meridian's Dr. Martin Luther King events.
