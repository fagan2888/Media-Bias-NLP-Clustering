Andrew Cuomo vetoed on Friday legislation that would have swapped references to schools that are \u201cfailing\u201d with \u201cstruggling\u201d in the Education Transformation Act of 2015, a broad education reform bill that included an overhaul of the teacher evaluation system and protocol for state receivership that was passed in the budget deal last March.\n\nNot only was the term \u201cfailing schools\u201d part of Cuomo\u2019s sharp rhetoric as he pushed major education overhauls last year, it was included in the appropriation for schools designated as persistently failing in the budget. In vetoing the legislation, Cuomo wrote in his veto message that changing the terminology in only some places would leave inconsistencies.\n\n\u201cFurther, all provisions (the Education Transformation Act of 2015) regarding the takeover and restructuring of failing schools were negotiated as a whole, and I do not believe in making isolated changes outside of a larger conversation about our State\u2019s commitment to maximizing student achievement at these schools,\u201d the governor wrote. \u201cI am therefore constrained to veto this bill.\u201d\n\nEducation advocates and some lawmakers took issue with the \u201cfailing\u201d moniker late last session.\n\n\u201cOne of the schools on the list (of failing schools) is from the City of Schenectady: Hamilton School,\u201d Assemblyman Angelo Santabarbara, D-Rotterdam, said at the time. \u201cI went to that school. I\u2019m a graduate of that school. I\u2019ve gone back there several times to visit them. \u2026 We have some of the best teachers in the state right there in the City of Schenectady and some of the brightest students. \u2026 That terminology is just not fair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe stigma of being labeled as a failing or persistently failing school only further perpetuates the issues and difficulties these schools face,\u201d the bill\u2019s memo states. \u201cBy changing the designation status from failing and persistently failing to struggling and persistently struggling, this indicates that this is a temporary situation for these schools and that additional management powers and funding will be associated with such schools in order to improve their overall academic performance in order to be removed from these more negative accountability statuses.\u201d\n\nIn New York\u2019s current education climate, a simple name or terminology swap might help to a certain degree, though, at least in the case of Common Core, experts say the issue is just too deep for a cosmetic fix.\n\nFriday\u2019s veto messages are below. The veto message for this bill is No. 283.\n\nVetoes #274-304 of 2015", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Capitol Confidential", "description": "Call them what you want, underperforming schools will continue to be referred to as \u201cfailing\u201d in state statute.
