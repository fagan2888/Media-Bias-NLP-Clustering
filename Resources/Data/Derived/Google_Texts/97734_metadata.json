It\u2019s particularly easy to believe this if you live in the right-wing media bubble, where all of the reports about Obamacare focus on the law\u2019s shortcomings and failures\u2014insurance premiums going up, people losing coverage, part-time workers losing hours, and so on.\n\nBut if the right really believed this, it should be happy to let Obamacare come into existence, then collapse. The last thing Republicans should want is to let Democrats snatch victory from the jaws of defeat by provoking confrontations over the budget and the debt ceiling before the American people get to experience the nightmare of expanded insurance coverage.\n\nIn fact, politically the right is acting as if it fears that Obamacare will, in reality, be highly popular \u2014 that once the exchanges and the Medicare Medicaid expansion go into effect, people will decide that they like the new system, and strongly oppose efforts to reverse course. (This is almost surely the more realistic view.) So the law must be stopped at any cost before it goes into effect, and people learn first-hand that the anti-Obamacare propaganda was false.\n\nSo which is it? Are Republicans sure that disaster looms, or are they terrified because they suspect that things will be OK? My guess is, both: clear thinking is not exactly a hallmark of the modern GOP, and may indeed be a positive disqualification for career success.\n\nUnfortunately, fear of Obamacare success is in the driving seat right now, and may well lead to government shutdown, debt default, or both.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20130913144520, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 13, 2013", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Obamacare Doublethink ( 20130913 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Is the danger that it will fail, or that it will succeed?", "title": "Obamacare Doublethink", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/obamacare-doublethink/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002442398, "description": "Is the danger that it will fail, or that it will succeed?", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 13, 2013", "article": {"published_time": 1379097920, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2013-09-13T23:13:00-04:00"}, "utime": 20130913231300, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20130913, "pdate": 20130913, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Is the danger that it will fail, or that it will succeed?", "title": "Obamacare Doublethink", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/obamacare-doublethink/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/obamacare-doublethink/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Obamacare Doublethink", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1358\"", "article_summary": "But if the right really believed this, it should be happy to let Obamacare come into existence, then collapse.\nAre Republicans sure that disaster looms, or are they terrified because they suspect that things will be OK?\nUnfortunately, fear of Obamacare success is in the driving seat right now, and may well lead to government shutdown, debt default, or both.\nIt\u2019s particularly easy to believe this if you live in the right-wing media bubble, where all of the reports about Obamacare focus on the law\u2019s shortcomings and failures\u2014insurance premiums going up, people losing coverage, part-time workers losing hours, and so on.\nMy guess is, both: clear thinking is not exactly a hallmark of the modern GOP, and may indeed be a positive disqualification for career success."}
