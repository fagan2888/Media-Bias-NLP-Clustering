"It has never been more crucial for providers to prepare their finance departments to address the demands that new care delivery models, such as accountable care organizations and alternative payment arrangements, will present as the industry moves away from fee-for-service reimbursement mechanisms," said Joe Kuehn, advisory partner at KPMG's healthcare & life sciences practice, in a statement. “Finance departments will need to prepare to manage these challenges and have better systems to measure performance against established targets including the cost and quality of care for example, so they can manage in this new environment."
