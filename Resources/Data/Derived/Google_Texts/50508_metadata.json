Having the systems in place that support clinical staff to provide this care is critical in being effective.\u201d\n\nSalud was recognized in three categories: improving clinical quality, resulting in a grant of $22,598; having the highest performance compared to peers, accompanied by $32,598; and being one of the highest performers compared to national standards, for a grant of $37,598.\n\nSalud serves nearly 26,000 people annually, providing medical, dental, vision, and behavioral health services to all patients regardless of ability to pay. Evening hours are available, with the East Beach Clinic, 204 E. Beach St., and Clinica Del Valle Del Pajaro, 45 Nielson St. open until 7:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. The East Beach Clinic is also open Saturday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nSalud\u2019s clinics are among the \u201csafety net clinics\u201d in Santa Cruz County that offer quality affordable care with sliding scale fees for those without insurance.\n\nTwo other safety net clinics in the county were awarded federal funds for improving clinical quality. Santa Cruz Women\u2019s Health Center at 250 Locust St., Santa Cruz, was awarded $12,613. Santa Cruz County, which operates clinics at 1080 Emeline Ave., Santa Cruz, and 9 Crestview Ave., Watsonville, was awarded $13,187.\n\nAll of the county\u2019s safety clinics, including Planned Parenthood, offer same-day appointments for medical services.\n\nIn California, a total of 118 quality awards were made totaling $5 million but only 27 awards were for reporting \u201con the full universe of patients using electronic health records.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Affordable Care Act provided incentives to switch from paper records to electronic health records but that technology has proven challenging.\n\nThe Petaluma Health Center was the only location in California to win recognition in all four categories, including the electronic health record.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Jondi Gumzjgumz@santacruzsentinel.com @jondigumz on TwitterWATSONVILLE >> Salud Para La Gente is one of only 10 health centers in California to receive recognition as a national quality leader from the U.S. Department of Health", "title": "Salud Para La Gente wins national recognition", "og": {"url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20141222/NEWS/141229943", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NE/20141222/NEWS/141229943/AR/0/AR-141229943.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1000px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Salud Para La Gente wins national recognition"}, "twitter": {"domain": "santacruzsentinel.com", "description": "By Jondi Gumzjgumz@santacruzsentinel.com @jondigumz on TwitterWATSONVILLE >> Salud Para La Gente is one of only 10 health centers in California to receive recognition as a national quality leader from the U.S. Department of Health", "title": "Salud Para La Gente wins national recognition", "url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20141222/NEWS/141229943", "image": {"src": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NE/20141222/NEWS/141229943/AR/0/AR-141229943.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@scsentinel", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563358177?mt=8", "iphone": "id499677382?mt=8", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.santacruzsentinel"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "keywords": "business,cityeditor,hcare,jondigumz,localnews,santacruz,watsonville, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "business,cityeditor,hcare,jondigumz,localnews,santacruz,watsonville, Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda8d8\"", "article_summary": "Watsonville Salud Para La Gente, 204 E.
