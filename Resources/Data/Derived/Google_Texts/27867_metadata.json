They can avoid waiting on hold to speak to staff or schedule appointments,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cPatients can communicate on their own time.\u201d\n\nOther health care organizations using FollowMyHealth include State of Franklin Healthcare Associates and Mountain States Medical Group, he said.\n\nA similar program is already in place through the Mountain States Health Alliance hospitals. It launched a year ago, according to Paul Merrywell, MSHA vice president of information systems. That information is logged into a system called OWL \u2014 online wellness link \u2014 and provides patient access to hospitalizations.\n\nLike ETSU Physicians, MSHA clinics will go online with FollowMyHealth next week as well. Health care systems have been providing information to patients over the past several months in preparation for the program going live.\n\nMerrywell said one of the challenges with OWL has been getting patients to go online and access the system.\n\n\u201cWe were fairly successful,\u201d Merrywell said. \u201dIt\u2019s been pretty well received by our patients. We have met the regulatory requirements of 5 percent of our patients discharged to log into the portal and actually use the portal,\u201d he said.\n\nJernigan said the idea is to get patients to think more in terms of having a health care team as opposed to just having a doctor. That health care team \u2014 whether it\u2019s an appointment scheduler or the doctor \u2014 can communicate with patients who utilize the portal.\n\nSecurity of the website has been a key issue, but Monaco Briggs, administrator for ETSU Physicians, said that is a top priority for the organization.\n\n\u201cWhen the patient logs on, it goes through a secure SSL. We\u2019re at the highest security level\u201d in order to protect patients privacy, Briggs said.\n\nSSL, short for secure socket layer, is a technology term used for high-level encryption to provide secure access to private information.\n\n\u201cFollowMyHealth monitors the security to make sure there are no breaches. We\u2019re taking security in our office very seriously,\u201d Briggs said.\n\nETSU Physicians\u2019 patient portal will go live Monday while State of Franklin Healthcare Associates, MSHA clinics and other local medical groups will be activated Wednesday.\n\nFor more information, visit the FollowMyHealth website at www.followmyhealth.com.\n\nFollow Becky Campbell on Twitter @CampbellinCourt.
