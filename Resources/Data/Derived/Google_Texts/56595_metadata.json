The institute is called the Bridge to Wellbeing and is housed in the foundation arm of the Kochs\u2019 political group, Americans for Prosperity. There are seminars being offered with such names as Couponing, Budgeting, Dinner on a Dime, and Grow Your Garden, among others.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch. If you read the course descriptions carefully, you will see that they also cover such topics as \u201chow government and policies impact our lives\u201d and \u201cthe importance of a free society.\u201d In the Couponing course, for example, the website says that you will learn not only how to \u201ckeep the pantry full\u201d by clipping coupons, but also how \u201cgovernment policies are causing food and grocery prices to rise.\u201d And a page called \u201cpolicies impacting you\u201d says that food is expensive because of environmental regulations espoused by Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama.\n\nAnother seminar, Flip the Switch, says it will help you conserve energy in your home. How? \u201cOnce you understand why energy costs have gotten so high,\u201d the description reads, \u201cyou will stop \u201cthrowing money out the window to utility companies.\u201d The policy section cites renewable energy subsidies and Obama\u2019s \u201caggressive pursuit of a green agenda\u201d as the main culprits of high energy prices. A seminar called Passion for Profit promises to teach you how to make a fortune as an e-commerce entrepreneur, but will also leave you with an \u201cawareness of harmful internet regulations.\u201d\n\nSee how this works? The Kochs have invented a whole new type of philanthropy, whereby a poor person can achieve \u201cwellbeing\u201d simply by learning how liberal policies have caused his or her plight. Better still, that person might become a foot soldier in the Kochs\u2019 army. One of the courses is titled Inspiring the Dream and promises to \u201chighlight policies that hinder businesses and individuals from succeeding.\u201d Another is called Speak up and Speak Out and explains how to call your legislator. Who knew that wellbeing could be achieved simply by lobbying for Americans for Prosperity?\n\nMeanwhile, the instructors and administrators are top-notch academics, judging by their bios. They include:\n\nJustine Fink, who works for the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and \u201cis passionate about helping people improve their lives and strengthening America\u2019s culture of freedom.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you like your life skills advice with a side helping of conservative politics, Bridge to Wellbeing is for you", "title": "Who better than the Kochs to dish up some handy tips for lifting people out of poverty", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "If you like your life skills advice with a side helping of conservative politics, Bridge to Wellbeing is for you", "title": "Who better than the Kochs to dish up some handy tips for lifting people out of poverty", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/18/who_better_than_the_kochs_to_dish_up_some_handy_tips_for_lifting_people_out_of_poverty/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/david_koch_clapping.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you like your life skills advice with a side helping of conservative politics, Bridge to Wellbeing is for you", "title": "Who better than the Kochs to dish up some handy tips for lifting people out of poverty", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/david_koch_clapping.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eric Stern", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Americans for Prosperity, bridge to wellbeing, Koch Brothers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc86f\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Americans for Prosperity, bridge to wellbeing, Koch Brothers, Politics NewsWho says the Koch brothers don\u2019t care about the needy?\nThe institute is called the Bridge to Wellbeing and is housed in the foundation arm of the Kochs\u2019 political group, Americans for Prosperity.\nBetter still, that person might become a foot soldier in the Kochs\u2019 army.\nThere are seminars being offered with such names as Couponing, Budgeting, Dinner on a Dime, and Grow Your Garden, among others.\nThe Kochs have invented a whole new type of philanthropy, whereby a poor person can achieve \u201cwellbeing\u201d simply by learning how liberal policies have caused his or her plight."}
