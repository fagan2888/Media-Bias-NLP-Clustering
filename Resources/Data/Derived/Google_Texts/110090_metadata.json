Photo: Getty Images\n\nAustralian Grand Prix boss Ron Walker is confident pressure from race organisers all over the world will force formula one authorities to accelerate efforts to make this year\u2019s new-generation cars sound better.\n\nWalker, who has led the push by F1 race promoters for noisier engines, believes almost unanimous support will result in the latest turbocharged V6 motors producing an improved exhaust note as early as next month. The muted sound of the more fuel-efficient turbo motors has been widely criticised by F1 fans, leading to race chiefs expressing fears that attendance at their events will suffer if urgent action isn\u2019t taken to restore the sport\u2019s traditional aural appeal.\n\n\"We can\u2019t wait until next year,\" Walker told Fairfax Media. \"Something has to be done soon.\"\n\nAs well as heading the board of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation that stages the Melbourne GP at Albert Park, Walker is also the chairman of the Formula One Promoters Association, which met during last weekend\u2019s Spanish GP in Barcelona.\n\nThe gathering was attended by senior representatives of 18 of the 19 events in this year\u2019s F1 world championship, along with F1 commercial chief Bernie Ecclestone.\n\nAccording to Walker, the promoter group formally called on motor sport\u2019s world governing body, the Paris-based International Automobile Federation (FIA), which administers the F1 technical regulations, to press F1\u2019s three engine suppliers \u2013 Mercedes-Benz, Renault and Ferrari \u2013 to retune their motors to sound racier.\n\n\"We\u2019re all concerned about the noise level,\" he said. \"It\u2019s being handled by Mercedes and others to restore the excitement to the sound of the cars.\n\n\"Everybody agreed. We\u2019re all in the entertainment business. The people in the stands don\u2019t understand the new regulations. They want aggression, they want a gladiatorial contest.\n\n\"My customers don\u2019t care about only using 100 kilograms of fuel in a race. Ticket sales are hard to get these days because the sports market is so competitive.\"\n\nThe Mercedes team trialled a megaphone-style addition to the exhaust pipe of its pacesetting racer on the final day of the post-Spanish GP F1 test, with the noise output recorded by the FIA\u2019s acoustic experts.\n\nThe results and recommendations are due to be released on Tuesday by the FIA, which is expected to detail the measures the F1 engine makers will have to take to produce an initial \"quick fix\" to boost the quality and volume of the noise made by motors.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Motorsport", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Australian Grand Prix boss Ron Walker is confident pressure from race organisers all over the world will force formula one authorities to accelerate efforts to make this year&amp;#8217;s new-generation cars sound better.", "title": "Ron Walker says F1 must get noisier, sooner", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/motorsport/ron-walker-says-f1-must-get-noisier-sooner-20140517-zrfyz.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/8/g/x/9/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.zrfyz.png/1400319592687.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/8/g/x/9/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.zrfyz.png/1400319592687.jpg"}, "title": "Ron Walker says F1 must get noisier, sooner", "description": "Australian Grand Prix boss Ron Walker is confident pressure from race organisers all over the world will force formula one authorities to accelerate efforts to make this year&#8217;s new-generation cars sound better.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Australian Grand Prix boss Ron Walker is confident pressure from race organisers all over the world will force formula one authorities to accelerate efforts to ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1224\"", "article_summary": "The gathering was attended by senior representatives of 18 of the 19 events in this year\u2019s F1 world championship, along with F1 commercial chief Bernie Ecclestone.\nAustralian Grand Prix boss Ron Walker.\nWalker, who has led the push by F1 race promoters for noisier engines, believes almost unanimous support will result in the latest turbocharged V6 motors producing an improved exhaust note as early as next month.\nPhoto: Getty ImagesAustralian Grand Prix boss Ron Walker is confident pressure from race organisers all over the world will force formula one authorities to accelerate efforts to make this year\u2019s new-generation cars sound better.\nThe Mercedes team trialled a megaphone-style addition to the exhaust pipe of its pacesetting racer on the final day of the post-Spanish GP F1 test, with the noise output recorded by the FIA\u2019s acoustic experts."}
