A shooting early Sunday morning has sent one person to the hospital. It happened around 12:30am. Authorities are currently looking for the shooter.

“A lady picked up asking, ‘What was the emergency?’ I told her there was multiple gunshots,” Jamal Horn says.

Jamal Horn is describing what he told a 911 operator after shots were fired near Oakland Heights School. Police responded and found Jamal’s brother shot in the leg. Horn says he had just pulled up to his home when a red car pulled up. His brother went to go see who it was.

“About three seconds later he just got to firing,” Horn says.

Horn says there were at least ten shots, two of which hit is brother in the leg.

“Me and my homeboy took off. We didn’t know where the bullets were coming from, so we drove off in the car,” Horn says.

At that time, Horn didn’t know his brother had been hit. He says he has witnessed many shootings, but without being that close to a person getting shot. He says there is a lot of senseless shootings going on.

“It has to do with the gangs. People are out here beefing about crazy stuff,” Horn says.

If you have any information on this shooting, you are asked to call police.
