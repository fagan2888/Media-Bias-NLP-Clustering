For example, perhaps Clinton\u2019s poverty claims and outrageous speaking fees are turning the American people off and prompting them to choose the \u201cStar Wars\u201d villain over her.\n\n\u201cPeople are just so fed up with the gridlock and dysfunction in Washington,\u201d Clinton expanded. \u201cThe Congress is just, you know, so, unfortunately, unable to even agree on the most obvious kinds of matters, that I think, you know, Darth Vader looks pretty good to a lot of people.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Clinton also assured Zakaria that Obama is not golfing too often instead of dealing with issues at home and abroad, despite critics \u2014 like The Washington Post\u2019s Charles Krauthammer \u2014 who have knocked the president for spending too much time on his own hobbies.\n\n\u201cI know from my own experience with the president, where we worked so closely together, and as I write in the book, you know, went from being adversaries to partners to friends, that he is constantly working and thinking,\u201d answered the former secretary of State. \u201cBut he also wants to do what will make a difference, not just perform. He wants to be sure that we know what the consequences, both intended and unintended, are.\u201d\n\nThe president recently took over five hours out of his weekend to play golf while simultaneously refusing to visit the southern border of Texas to address the immigration crisis. Obama will also spend a good part of August golfing when he travels to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Mass. for his longest summer vacation since he took office.\n\nPerhaps some of that Washington gridlock \u2014 and hence Darth Vader\u2019s sudden popularity \u2014 is a direct effect of Obama\u2019s decision to golf instead of address the crises in our country.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Hillary Clinton in an interview on CNN\u2019s \"Fareed Zakaria GPS\" Sunday addressed the recent poll that shows Darth Vader polling higher than all potential 2016 presidential candidates, including Clinton herself.", "title": "Hillary Clinton: Darth Vader 'looks pretty good' when compared to...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/05/Hillary-Clinton1-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/07/27/hillary-clinton-darth-vader-looks-pretty-good-compared-congress/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "hillary-clinton-running-for-president", "published_time": "2014-07-27T14:19:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-27T14:19:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1f9\"", "article_summary": "Zakaria asked Clinton to delve into the \u201cdeeper meaning\u201d of the poll, and Clinton proceeded to blame Washington gridlock for the American people\u2019s preference of Darth Vader.\n\u201cPeople are just so fed up with the gridlock and dysfunction in Washington,\u201d Clinton expanded.\nHillary Clinton in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cFareed Zakaria GPS\u201d Sunday addressed the recent poll that shows Darth Vader polling higher than all potential 2016 presidential candidates, including Clinton herself.\nPerhaps some of that Washington gridlock \u2014 and hence Darth Vader\u2019s sudden popularity \u2014 is a direct effect of Obama\u2019s decision to golf instead of address the crises in our country.\n\u201cPeople love fantasies and sometimes when we\u2019re so frustrated with the gridlock in Washington, we would like some deus ex machina figure,\u201d Clinton explained."}
