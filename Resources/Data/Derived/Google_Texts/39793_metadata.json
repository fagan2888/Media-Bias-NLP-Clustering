Sarah Palin, right, endorses Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during a rally at the Iowa State University, Tuesday, Jan. 19, 2016, in Ames, Iowa. (Photo: AP)\n\nIt\u2019s increasingly feeling as if Iowa is the subject of some grand social experiment that\u2019s being secretly recorded, to find out how much absurdity people will take before we realize we\u2019re being pranked.\n\nBy last Tuesday, I was almost sure of it. That was when Donald Trump received the endorsement of Sarah Palin on the campus of Iowa State University. In a rambling 21-minute diatribe, she greeted Iowa mothers with reference to a horror film \u2014 \u201cYou with the hands that rock the cradle!\u201d\u2014 and seemed to sometimes forget on whose behalf she was there. She lavished praise on Trump\u2019s opponent, Rand Paul, \u201cbecause he knows you only go to war if you\u2019re determined to win the war,\u201d and declared more than once that she, Palin, was in it to win it \u2014\"because we believe in America, and we love our freedom, and if you love your freedom, thank a vet.\u201d\n\nWhen she did focus on Trump, she gushed, \u201che builds things, he builds big things, things that touch the sky.\"\n\nPalin jumped so often between topics without completing a sentence that if you weren\u2019t questioning her sobriety, you had to be questioning your own.\n\nThis being a democracy, anyone who gets enough money and signatures can run for office, and even wild cards with high profiles but little to no political experience can win. Remember the governors \u2014 wrestler Jesse Ventura and body builder/action star Arnold Schwarzenegger? And because reporters are obligated not to pass judgment in covering campaigns, they can inadvertently end up shielding politicians from their own bizarre words.\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump received a key endorsement Tuesday from conservative heavyweight Sarah Palin, giving the billionaire businessman a potential boost with some voters less than two weeks before the Iowa caucuses. (Jan. AP\n\nThe press struggled to string together a couple of coherent phrases out of a litany of Palin non-sequiturs. Because to quote her straight would mean reporting something like:\n\nThe former Alaska governor had harsh words for the president.\u201cAnd he, who would negotiate deals, kind of with the skills of a community organizer maybe organizing a neighborhood tea,\" she said, 'well, he deciding that, \u2018No, America would apologize as part of the deal,\u2019 as the enemy sends a message to the rest of the world that they capture and we kowtow, and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, \u2018Thank you, enemy.\u2019 \u201d\n\nUSA Today chose to paraphrase. Donald Trump picked up the endorsement of one of the biggest names in the Republican Party on Tuesday, as Sarah Palin announced she was backing the billionaire real estate developer in the GOP presidential race. 'Are you ready to make America great again?' Palin exhorted a crowd at an Iowa rally, invoking Trump's campaign slogan. Palin cited Trump's readiness to be commander in chief and blasted President Obama.\n\nIt didn't quote her saying, \u201cAre you ready for a commander-in-chief who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?\"\n\nOne Republican who heard the speech, Meghan McCain, told a reporter, \"This is not my style of politics, using sort of vulgar language.'\" The daughter of Sen. John McCain had other reasons to be turned off by Palin's endorsement of Trump. This is the man who, referring to Sen. McCain\u2019s 5 1/2 years as a Vietnam prisoner of war, said he was no war hero because he was captured. \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured,\u201d Trump declared.\n\nIronically, picking Palin as his running mate is likely what cost John McCain the 2008 election. He either did a poor job of vetting her, or was knowingly prepared to leave Americans a heartbeat away from a leader for whom foreign policy experience meant being able to see Russian land from Alaska. She since has become a tea party darling who now accuses the Republican Party establishment of providing a blank check for Obamacare, Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration. \u201cThey\u2019ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of like a suicide vest,\u201d she said of \"establishment\" candidates.\n\nThe party of Charles Grassley politically correct?\n\nSo what does it mean for Trump to get a Sarah Palin endorsement? In introducing her, he called her \"a person who I\u2019ve known for a long time, who I\u2019ve respected for so long. An incredible husband, an incredible family and somebody that when I heard she was going to endorse me, I was so honored. You have no idea how honored. ... Special, special person.\u201d\n\nBut even as Trump was lauding Palin's incredible family, Palin's son was facing charges of domestic violence \u2014 for which she has managed to blame President Obama. Track Palin is a vet who returned hardened, she said; the president doesn't respect veterans.\n\nSpecial in what ways, incredible for what, Trump never said. But then he never really says. He talks tough against certain groups, attacks even his friends, and promises things he couldn't deliver, like getting Mexico to build a wall with the U.S. And that resonates with people who think minorities are taking over the country, and America needs to show who's who by kicking some ass abroad.\n\nThe irony for those on the left who loathe Trump's bluster is that he probably wouldn't govern as far to the right as many of the Republicans running. He doesn\u2019t seem wedded to any particular set of beliefs, other than those that can give him what he wants.\n\nSo here we are, kicking off the next presidential selection with a couple of reality-TV stars using choppy sentences and mangled metaphors: Hands that rock the cradle. Political correctness like a suicide vest. Obamacare-loving Republicans.\n\nTruth really is stranger than fiction sometimes.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1VgGQRf", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "It feels like Iowa is the subject of  a social experiment on how much absurdity people will absorb as truth.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "It feels like Iowa is the subject of  a social experiment on how much absurdity people will absorb as truth.", "title": "Basu: Palin takes Trump campaign to a new level of absurdity", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/rekha-basu/caucus/2016/01/23/column-palin-takes-trump-campaign-new-level-absurdity/79170608/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It feels like Iowa is the subject of  a social experiment on how much absurdity people will absorb as truth.", "title": "Basu: Palin takes Trump campaign to a new level of absurdity", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f235f464524aaa81a4a38ee0d07a86a23de5c0cc/c=663-0-3317-2654&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/19/IAGroup/DesMoines/635888403587631144-APTOPIX-GOP-2016-Trump-lehrler-dmreg.com-4.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/rekha.basu1106"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Track Palin", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Track Palin", "title": "Basu: Palin takes Trump campaign to a new level of absurdity", "author": "Rekha Basu", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists/rekha-basu/caucus", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf93998f22c5a8f4717fadef548081669df04d69/c=1600-0-3591-2654/local/-/media/2016/01/19/IAGroup/DesMoines/635888403587631144-APTOPIX-GOP-2016-Trump-lehrler-dmreg.com-4.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/100f21ca59516051a10f7f655dac12d0cdade384/c=663-0-3317-2654/local/-/media/2016/01/19/IAGroup/DesMoines/635888403587631144-APTOPIX-GOP-2016-Trump-lehrler-dmreg.com-4.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d8b743cecf4bfc1a87ea3897de9e0d5e3dba0477/c=225-0-3755-2654/local/-/media/2016/01/19/IAGroup/DesMoines/635888403587631144-APTOPIX-GOP-2016-Trump-lehrler-dmreg.com-4.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f02dc090b7596ecae87e968f091347b2202397b6/c=0-203-3980-2452&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/01/19/IAGroup/DesMoines/635888403587631144-APTOPIX-GOP-2016-Trump-lehrler-dmreg.com-4.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-01-23T13:38:54.560000-06:00", "shorthed": "Basu: Was Palin part of a prank?", "articleid": 79170608, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/90dda7f83141ee73012f89407bf1bdfb43ab7cfe/c=0-203-3980-2452/local/-/media/2016/01/19/IAGroup/DesMoines/635888403587631144-APTOPIX-GOP-2016-Trump-lehrler-dmreg.com-4.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/94df1523dc6db6e25d2dbf109602a65caba5d3dc/c=1247-0-2733-2654/local/-/media/2016/01/19/IAGroup/DesMoines/635888403587631144-APTOPIX-GOP-2016-Trump-lehrler-dmreg.com-4.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "That was when Donald Trump received the endorsement of Sarah Palin on the campus of Iowa State University.\nSo what does it mean for Trump to get a Sarah Palin endorsement?\nSarah Palin, right, endorses Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during a rally at the Iowa State University, Tuesday, Jan. 19, 2016, in Ames, Iowa.\nThe daughter of Sen.
