He\u2019s fought with school choice activists, student debt activists, gun activists, for-profit colleges, black colleges, traditional colleges, private lenders, loan collectors, the Tea Party, the Republican Party, and the teachers unions at the heart of the Democratic Party, among other interest groups. He\u2019s in a multi-front war to fix America\u2019s schools, and I recently sat down to delve into some of the wonkier details with Ted Mitchell, a former college president and education venture fund CEO who is now Duncan\u2019s undersecretary. Mitchell spent a half hour patiently explaining to me the philosophy behind the Education Department\u2019s fights\u2014basically, making sure that all kids get a chance to succeed; that schools are accessible, accountable, and effective; and that adults who don\u2019t do their part face consequences\u2014until someone knocked on his door to say our time was up.\n\nThen he started crying.\n\nWe had never met before, but Mitchell clearly had something personal he wanted to share, and my dull policy questions hadn\u2019t given him much of an opening. His voice quivered as it finally spilled out: \u201cI can\u2019t let you leave without telling you what a privilege it has been to work with Arne.\u201d He started to add something about fighting for students, but choked up mid-sentence. His press aide started crying, too. It sounds hokey, but I\u2019ve never had an interview take such an abruptly emotional turn.\n\nEducation policy clearly inspires a lot of passion. It\u2019s not just about cleverly named initiatives like Race to the Top and No Child Left Behind, or arcane regulations defining \u201cgainful employment\u201d and \u201cadequate yearly progress.\u201d It\u2019s about kids and their futures. You can see the intensity in the comments on Duncan\u2019s Facebook page, spewing rage over the Common Core math and reading standards or the national epidemic of standardized testing. Duncan\u2019s loyalists are just as intense, inevitably gushing about Duncan\u2019s constant mantra in policy meetings: What\u2019s the right thing for kids? \u201cEveryone says that,\u201d said Justin Hamilton, a former communications aide to Duncan. \u201cArne f---ing means it!\u201d\n\nIn a cynical town of posturing and spin, Duncan has earned a reputation for saying what he means and doing what he says. At the same time, he has faced growing dissatisfaction with what he has said and what he has done. Duncan has driven far more change than any previous education secretary, but as he heads into the home stretch of the Obama administration, much of that legacy is at risk.\n\nDuncan has used his perch at the smallest Cabinet agency\u2014and his tight relationship with President Barack Obama, his pickup basketball pal from Chicago\u2014to put an unprecedented national stamp on a policy area with a long and strong tradition of local control. He\u2019s helped make major inroads on K-12 reforms that unions despise, like using student test scores to evaluate teachers. He\u2019s helped push big changes in higher education as well: a government takeover of student loans, a harsh crackdown on for-profit schools, a huge expansion of student aid. A department with only 4,200 employees, traditionally considered a kind of Washington backwater, has transformed the policy landscape for 100,000 schools and 5,000 colleges.\n\nBut Duncan has also helped unleash a huge backlash\u2014against the Common Core standards, against over testing, against federal overreach in general. This fall, Congress plans to rewrite the main law overseeing public education, and activists on the left and the right have joined forces to try to roll back Washington\u2019s power; the House and the Senate have both passed versions that would defang Duncan\u2019s department, and the Senate vote was broadly bipartisan. Republican presidential candidates like Marco Rubio and Rand Paul have vowed to eliminate the department entirely, while Bobby Jindal and Chris Christie, governors who supported Common Core standards before they began seeking the White House, have joined the conservative retreat from \u201cObamacore\u201d now that it\u2019s associated with the administration. And the Democrats in the race, including Hillary Clinton, have shown no indication that they intend to continue Obama\u2019s pursuit of reforms opposed by powerful unions.\n\nWhat's for lunch?

But those critics are multiplying, and getting more critical.\n\n\u201cIf we had a national school board, Arne would be a great chairman,\u201d said Lamar Alexander, the Republican chairman of the Senate education committee and a former education secretary under the first President Bush. \u201cBut Americans don\u2019t want a national school board. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand that.\u201d\n\nDuncan is the president\u2019s closest friend in the Cabinet, dating back to his days running the Chicago Public Schools while Obama was a state senator, and they have similar no-drama temperaments, never getting too high or low. They also share a vision of education as an engine of opportunity, especially for the kind of at-risk kids on Chicago\u2019s South Side that Duncan tutored at his mother\u2019s after-school program, and Obama fought for as a community organizer. He\u2019s the ultimate Obama loyalist, determined to keep plugging until the end of the president\u2019s second term even though his family just moved back to Chicago for the school year, and the education reforms he has pushed have been among the president\u2019s most disruptive policies.\n\nWhile Duncan is undeniably Obama\u2019s Guy, he has occupied a unique niche in the polarized climate of Obama\u2019s Washington. He\u2019s been unusually outspoken on behalf of progressive causes like gun control, immigration and criminal justice reform; he marched in Al Sharpton\u2019s Black Lives Matter protest. Yet he\u2019s forged unusually close relationships with Republicans, including Alexander as well as national GOP leaders like Jeb Bush and Mitch Daniels. And he\u2019s so revered by the centrist elites of the Beltway establishment that Thomas Friedman once proposed in his New York Times column that he should be Secretary of State.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because education is an issue where Obama really does split the difference between left and right, supporting charter schools that innovate within the public system but not vouchers for private schools, battling teachers unions while defending their collective bargaining rights. But now his school reforms are under attack from the left and right. And unlike his health reforms, which produced a rapid decline in the uninsured rate, or his energy reforms, which generated dramatic increases in solar and wind power, their impact remains unclear as his presidency enters the home stretch.\n\nU.S. graduation rates are at an all-time high, with the biggest improvements for minorities and the poor. Dropout rates are at an all-time low. Test scores are slightly up, with some of the biggest gains in states that embraced the administration\u2019s approach to reform. Sketchy diploma mills are vacuuming up fewer federal dollars. But even Duncan acknowledges that the hopeful signs are not yet proof that reform is working.\n\n\u201cThis is the ultimate long-term play,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the results won\u2019t be seen for 10 or 15 years. This kind of work, it\u2019s not about tomorrow\u2019s headline.\u201d\n\nEducation reform has become a rare bipartisan cause in policy circles, thanks in part to lavish funding by billionaires like Bill Gates, the Walton family and Mark Zuckerberg. But it is not just disruptive in the Silicon Valley sense, shaking up hidebound monopolies and entrenched interests. It can disrupt classrooms and lives. Without solid evidence that it\u2019s achieving its goals, skeptics say, Duncan\u2019s battles are like the faith-based crusades that caused such damage in the Dark Ages. He has cracked a lot of eggs without a finished omelet to show for them, and now his twin pillars of reform, setting higher standards and using tests to make sure kids are meeting them, are increasingly toxic in Washington and beyond. There\u2019s no guarantee the changes Duncan has ushered in can\u2019t be ushered out.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who doesn\u2019t think Arne is decent and honest,\u201d says National Education Association president Lily Eskelsen Garcia, whose union has called for Duncan to resign. \u201cBut his reforms are so ridiculous, he\u2019s uniting teachers, PTA\u2019s, principals, everyone. We\u2019re writing each other\u2019s talking points!\u201d\n\nShortly after I left Mitchell\u2019s office, I watched Garcia and Randi Weingarten, her counterpart at the American Federation of Teachers, hold a news conference outside the Education Department\u2019s front door, featuring two hunger strikers who were protesting the closure of a troubled Chicago high school. One theme was that reformers are betraying the kids, especially vulnerable minority kids, whom their decisions affect every day. Duncan pursued a career in education to address the plight of vulnerable minority kids in Chicago, but the frustration outside the department\u2019s Lyndon B. Johnson building was heartfelt. \u201cI\u2019m hungry, but not for food. I\u2019m hungry for justice,\u201d said a striker named April Strogner.\n\nThen she started crying, too.\n\nDUNCAN DOES NOT have the natural personality of a provocateur, but in his just-saying, matter-of-fact way, he blurts out a lot of provocative things. He has attributed outrage over Common Core to \u201cwhite suburban moms\u201d who find out \u201ctheir child isn\u2019t as brilliant as they thought.\u201d He has described Hurricane Katrina as \u201cthe best thing that happened to the education system in New Orleans.\u201d He called for a name change for the Washington Redskins, and endorsed gay marriage before the president did. He continued to drop verbal bombs in my presence, suggesting that for-profit schools \u201cgot a lot of taxpayer money and bought off a lot of folks in Congress,\u201d that \u201cit\u2019s mind-boggling we\u2019ve accomplished nothing in the gun space\u201d since Newtown, that House Republicans are \u201cparalyzed by politics and ideology.\u201d And when people don\u2019t like what he says, well, he doesn\u2019t lose a lot of sleep about that.\n\nA basketball star: Duncan playing basketball with President Barack Obama and other White House aides (top); Duncan during his basketball days at Harvard (left); A signed basketball from Duncan's visit to Carnegie Mellon as part of his back-to-school bus tour. | Pete Souza, Harvard Athletics, U.S. Department of Education\n\n\u201cWater off a duck\u2019s back,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere are a lot of pressures to maintain the status quo, and if you\u2019re not challenging that, why are you here?\u201d\n\nIf you want to understand Duncan, his friends say, you\u2019ve got to start with basketball. He haunted Chicago\u2019s playgrounds as a boy, often running the court with gang members in the city\u2019s roughest neighborhoods. After growing to 6-foot-5, he played college ball at Harvard, then professionally in Australia, where he was known as the Cobra. He\u2019s won national 3-on-3 tournaments, and so thoroughly dominated the 2014 NBA Celebrity All-Star game that actor Kevin Hart, voted MVP by the fans, handed the award to Duncan instead. His circus pass to the WNBA\u2019s Skylar Diggins was a hit on YouTube.\n\nThe descriptions I heard of Arne Duncan on the court reminded me of Ted Mitchell\u2019s effusive description of him off the court. In a forthcoming book on Obama and basketball titled The Audacity of Hoop, Alexander Wolff calls Duncan \u201cthe beau ideal of a pickup teammate.\u201d He\u2019s unselfish, passing and rebounding more than he shoots. He has amazing vision. He\u2019s a natural leader, calm under pressure. He hustles. But his best friend, the Chicago financier (and former Princeton captain) John Rogers, says those stock descriptions miss his essence.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what people don\u2019t get about Arne: I\u2019ve never met anyone as physically and mentally tough,\u201d Rogers told me. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him play with a broken hand. I\u2019ve seen him play with blood pouring down his face. People get the wrong impression of him, because he\u2019s so patient and calm and civil.\u201d\n\nRogers thinks Duncan got that from his mother, Sue, whose inner-city tutoring program was firebombed by a street gang when he was six. Duncan grew up middle class\u2014his father, Starkey, was a University of Chicago professor\u2014but he crossed racial and economic barriers every time he headed to \u201cSue\u2019s Center.\u201d He later took a year off from Harvard, where he would write a thesis on the aspirations of the urban underclass, to work for his mother full-time. A gang member once threatened to kill the Duncans if they returned to the center the next day.\n\n\u201cWe had an interesting conversation that night at dinner,\u201d he testified at his confirmation hearing. \u201cWe\u2026decided that you can\u2019t run. Once you start running, you\u2019ll be chasing your shadow eventually. So we showed up the next day, and luckily he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt was at Sue\u2019s that Duncan grew disgusted with dropout factories that warehoused low-income students and perpetuated cycles of poverty. One summer, he tutored a basketball star who needed to pass a standardized test to play in college. He had made the honor roll at his high school, so Duncan was surprised to learn he was functionally illiterate. \u201cI did what I could, but I couldn\u2019t make up ten years of neglect in a summer,\u201d Duncan told me. \u201cThat kid had played by the rules. He had no clue he was so far behind. That happens all over the country, and it\u2019s criminal.\u201d\n\nEducation runs in the family: Duncan's mom ran a tutoring program in Chicago (top); Duncan's father, Starkey, a University of Chicago professor, reading to his son as a toddler (left); Duncan reading with his sister Sarah (right) | Courtesy of Arne Duncan | Courtesy of Arne Duncan\n\nAfter his stint overseas, Duncan returned to Chicago to run a mentoring program that Rogers funded for underprivileged kids, a program they later transformed into a charter school. Duncan then went to work for the Chicago Public Schools, and in 2001, when he was only 36, Mayor Richard Daley made him superintendent. He soon earned a national reputation as a reformer, shutting down some failing schools while pouring resources into others, pushing for new charter schools as well as merit pay for teachers. And though unions tend to oppose charters and performance-based pay, Duncan maintained decent relations with the Chicago local.\n\nHe also got to know a Democratic state senator named Barack Obama, who shared his not-so-Democratic vision of reform as well as his love of hoops. Duncan recalls a visit they made to a once-failing elementary school on the city\u2019s west side, where a teacher told them the biggest obstacle to improvement was \u201cThese Kids Syndrome\u201d\u2014adults making excuses for why \u201cthese kids,\u201d as opposed to \u201cour kids,\u201d could never learn. Obama riffed about the experience in The Audacity of Hope, chiding his fellow Democrats for \u201cdefending an indefensible status quo, insisting that spending alone will improve educational outcomes.\u201d He empathized with the challenges faced by underfunded schools in poor communities, but he bristled when teachers and administrators blamed their bad results on child poverty, as if there was nothing that could happen in school to help kids with tough situations at home.\n\n\u201cThe president doesn\u2019t just get this stuff intellectually,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cHe gets it in his heart. It\u2019s personal for him. It\u2019s visceral.\u201d\n\nThe AFT endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary; Obama was booed for defending merit pay in a speech to the NEA. But in the general election the unions strongly backed him over Republican John McCain. (On the wall outside Garcia\u2019s office, I saw a copy of the NEA\u2019s endorsement, which Obama had signed: \u201cTo Team NEA: Thanks for all your help on my campaign.\u201d) After Obama\u2019s victory, no one knew which side he would take in the education wars. A pro-reform group was circulating a petition calling for stricter accountability for schools and teachers, while a pro-union group had a dueling petition pushing more spending on services for needy kids.\n\nDuncan was the only prominent figure to sign both. He was a hero to reformers, but at a moment when the abrasive Washington, D.C., superintendent Michelle Rhee was on the cover of Time, wielding a broom to highlight her confrontational approach, Duncan was relatively palatable to union leaders. Obama was considering Denver superintendent Michael Bennet, who is now a Democratic senator, but he chose Duncan after a mind-meld interview at his transition offices in their shared hometown.\n\n\u201cHe walked by my desk and said: I can\u2019t not choose the best guy just because he\u2019s a good friend of mine,\u201d recalled Obama\u2019s top political adviser, David Axelrod. \u201cArne had such a missionary zeal for this stuff. And the president has a real sense of urgency about education.\u201d\n\nDUNCAN ARRIVED IN Washington at an extraordinary moment for the nation in general and education policy in particular.\n\nThe economy was crashing, and the new administration was preparing an $800 billion stimulus program to try to save it, including an unprecedented $100 billion rescue package for schools. The vast majority of the money went directly to revenue-starved states, averting more than 300,000 teacher layoffs that would have accelerated the recessionary spiral. But with Duncan pushing behind the scenes, congressional Democrats approved $10 billion that would be tied to reform, including $4.35 billion for a state competition called Race to the Top. That one-time infusion amounted to less than 1 percent of annual expenditures on U.S. public schools\u2014the top Democratic appropriator in the House dismissed it as \u201cArne Duncan\u2019s walking-around money\u201d\u2014but it would have an outsized impact.\n\nThat\u2019s because Duncan wrote the rules of the grant competition with carrots and sticks that encouraged states to adopt reforms before the competition even started. For example, he declared that states with union-friendly \u201cfirewalls\u201d barring links between test scores and teacher evaluations would be ineligible for the Race, so every state with a firewall ditched it. Duncan also made it clear states could earn extra points by expanding testing regimes, elevating standards, removing caps on charter schools, and making it easier to fire or reward teachers. Within a year, 40 states had already changed laws to improve their prospects in the Race, and 45 states had embraced college- and career-ready standards like Common Core.\n\nUnion leaders were furious. They saw the Race as a conservative program, treating teachers like automatons, as if the art of helping kids with unique dreams and challenges could be assessed through a bloodless algorithm. But it was hard for them to kick up too much of a fuss about a voluntary competition when a new Democratic president had just saved so many teaching jobs. They lobbied furiously in Washington\u2014and Duncan did tweak the rules of the Race to encourage union cooperation\u2014but they couldn\u2019t stop the state-by-state tidal wave of change. Even though only a dozen states won major grants, most of the country reoriented its approach.\n\nThe Duncans go to Washington: Duncan's son, Ryan, reads a book during his father's confirmation hearing to be Secretary of Education.

It\u2019s funny how adults act like kids. It\u2019s a race! We want to win!\u201d\n\nRace to the Top and another $4.5 billion program for overhauling chronically underperforming schools represented a bold new effort to leverage scarce federal dollars to make sure students really learn. Duncan liked the accountability impulse behind President Bush\u2019s widely reviled No Child Left Behind law, which was poised to impose sanctions on schools unless 100 percent of their students showed \u201cproficiency\u201d by 2015, but he didn\u2019t like the way many administrators had simply redefined \u201cproficiency\u201d\u2014or as Duncan put it, dumbed down their standards and lied to their kids. It reminded him of that illiterate athlete on the honor roll. He was thrilled when Tennessee, which had reported 91 percent proficiency in math before Obama, reported just 34 percent a year after receiving a Race to the Top grant. As far as Duncan was concerned, it showed the state was serious about telling the truth.\n\nThe Race had more losers than winners, so there were plenty of complainers\u2014and Duncan himself was dismayed when the independent judges of the competition passed over several reform-friendly states. The media coverage of the Race focused on conflict, like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s allegation that the Obama administration had improperly denied his state a grant. (After a Duncan aide leaked a videotape of the state\u2019s presentation that contradicted his charges, Christie fired his education commissioner.) But Duncan says the joy of the job was dealing with leaders like Republican Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, who sat in his office and told him that politicians always talk about education, but never do much about it. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Haslam asked. Duncan does not think it\u2019s a coincidence that Tennessee has enjoyed the nation\u2019s largest increase in test scores.\n\n\u201cIt was so genuine, so vulnerable,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cSo many politicians want to kiss babies and visit schools. Here was a guy who had the courage to challenge his party and the status quo because it was unacceptable for kids.\u201d\n\nDuncan says he\u2019s seen less of that courage in Congress, which he routinely describes as dysfunctional. But he exploited one example of that dysfunction \u2014 Capitol Hill\u2019s repeated failures to revise the unrealistic deadlines of No Child Left Behind\u2014to accelerate the administration\u2019s reform agenda. Duncan let states know they could receive waivers from the law\u2019s punitive sanctions if they embraced higher standards, additional help for students in need, and stronger teacher evaluations. The waivers would be even more controversial than the Race.\n\nAgain, states were not forced to apply for waivers, and the states that did apply got to design their own compliance plans. Duncan told his team to be \u201ctight on goals, loose on means,\u201d and all but eight states have gotten waivers. But Duncan was pretty prescriptive. For instance, the requirement for stronger teacher evaluations clearly meant linking them to tests. And teachers unions hate test-based evaluations as much as Republicans hate prescriptive federal agencies telling them/states what to do. Dennis Van Roekel, who led the NEA in Obama\u2019s first term, used to meet Duncan for breakfast every month, and says they actually agreed on almost every issue\u2014except testing.\n\n\u201cI constantly told him testing was a disaster,\u201d Van Roekel said. \u201cI warned him if he didn\u2019t bring sanity to the testing craze, everything he was doing would collapse under its own weight. I wish he had listened to me about that.\u201d\n\nAt the NEA\u2019s convention in 2011, the union formally declared that it was \u201cappalled\u201d with Duncan\u2019s work. But at the same convention, the NEA endorsed the president\u2019s reelection, as if the education secretary whose family hung out with the Obamas at Camp David was some kind of rogue operative. I heard from several sources that Duncan actually helped negotiate the language of his own condemnation; he\u2019s no politician, but you can\u2019t run the Chicago schools without some sense of politics. \u201cArne understood the political realities,\u201d a former aide said. \u201cThe union needed a target for its anger, and he was happy to take a bullet for the president.\u201d Back then, resentment was starting to build over excessive \u201chigh-stakes\u201d testing, and horror stories were starting to circulate about math tests being used to judge art teachers, but the dissension had not yet erupted into a movement.\n\n\u201cArne saw it early,\u201d said former Obama communications director Dan Pfeiffer. \u201cHe sounded the alarm at the White House. The fear was the Republicans would join forces with unions to try to kill reform. Arne kept telling us: It\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nTHE THING IS, education policy is not just about kids. It\u2019s also about jobs and budgets and politics. Education is a huge industry with a lot of government money sloshing around. And it isn\u2019t exempt from Washington\u2019s partisan shenanigans. Duncan told me that after Obama pitched universal pre-K in the 2013 State of the Union address, a \u201cprominent Republican senator\u201d approached him on the floor and said: \u201cI love what you\u2019re doing on this. I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t help you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knew in his heart he was wrong. We\u2019re 25th in the world in early childhood education; it\u2019s like the opposite of a profile in courage,\u201d Duncan scoffs. \u201cI don\u2019t get people who come here for a fancy title. I came here to do big things.\u201d\n\nIn fact, at least 30 states have pushed new early childhood initiatives since Duncan and Obama began clamoring about pre-K, including deep-red states like Texas, Alabama and Mississippi. He likes to contrast that kind of bipartisan policy success around the country with the petty gridlock of Washington. In reality, though, the Obama legacy on education is stuffed with big things achieved in the capital. The Race and the waivers are obvious examples, but there are others in higher ed, even though Duncan was new to that world.\n\nThe administration\u2019s first big post-secondary victory was keeping Obama\u2019s campaign promise to oust private lenders like Sallie Mae from the student loan business. They did no real underwriting, and the government set their rates; they were basically overpaid middlemen, siphoning billions of dollars from the program. But they were influential middlemen. They had juice not only with Republicans who opposed government mission creep in general but with several key Democrats, and an Education Department proposal to take over all loan origination stalled. White House officials didn\u2019t fight for the plan, telling Duncan\u2019s staff they couldn\u2019t afford to alienate Democrats whose votes they needed to pass health care reform.\n\n\u201cWe were told it was dead, forget it, the lenders killed it,\u201d one former Duncan aide recalled. \u201cAnd then, whoa! It just happened!\u201d\n\nIt turned out that after losing Ted Kennedy\u2019s Senate seat in early 2010, the Democrats urgently needed some savings for a budget maneuver they could deploy to pass Obamacare without 60 votes. The student loan overhaul was a money-saver, so they tacked it onto the health bill, suddenly transforming the Education Department into one of America\u2019s ten largest banks. The move also allowed them to plow $40 billion in savings into Pell tuition grants for low-income students. It got virtually no attention in the hubbub over Obamacare, but it has helped expand Pell by 50 percent, serving 3 million more needy families. Critics grumble that by pumping more federal aid into the college-industrial complex, Duncan is just helping schools jack up their tuitions.\n\nDuncan also used his regulatory powers to address the trillion-dollar student loan crisis, dramatically expanding relief to struggling borrowers. The new rules enable all borrowers to limit their monthly payments to 10 percent of their income and get their loans forgiven after 20 years. That was an expensive move to make without congressional approval. Jason Delisle of the New America think tank says the changes are already costing taxpayers about $11 billion a year, a figure that could soar as more borrowers apply for relief.\n\nBut there is mounting evidence that a college degree provides a major boost to future earnings, and Duncan thinks that between the Pell expansion and the loan relief, a degree is now within reach for just about anyone. That\u2019s a big deal at a time when the cost of a degree has soared and state spending on higher education has plunged.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a perception that college is just for rich folks, and that\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cA high school diploma simply doesn\u2019t cut it anymore.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s top higher education priority is expanding access, and Duncan has been a loyal soldier in that fight. Most recently, he\u2019s been a vocal advocate of the president\u2019s plan to make two years of community college free for all, and he truly loves the idea of converting government-financed K-12 into pre-K-14. But honestly, it\u2019s the president\u2019s plan. As Duncan has learned more about higher ed, he\u2019s begun to worry less about access than outcomes, less about cost than completion. For all the real concern over students graduating with daunting debts, most college graduates pay back their loans. It\u2019s the students who don\u2019t graduate who are far more likely to default; the most expensive degree, he says, is the one you don\u2019t get.\n\nDuncan has gotten especially fired up about diploma mills that leave students unprepared for the job market even if they do graduate. That concern has driven his toughest battle, his regulatory crackdown on for-profit schools and career-training programs.\n\nFor-profits enjoyed spectacular growth during the Great Recession, and even Steve Gunderson, a former Wisconsin Republican congressman who is now the industry\u2019s top lobbyist, admits they enrolled too many unqualified applicants who ended up defaulting on federal loans. \u201cWe\u2019re the first ones to say we should\u2019ve been more careful,\u201d Gunderson told me. \u201cWe were thinking with our hearts, not our heads.\u201d\n\nThe department suspected they were thinking with their wallets, which were stuffed with largesse from Uncle Sam; they could bank up to 90 percent of their revenues from federal grants and loans. Duncan insists he has nothing against effective for-profits, but the more he heard of exploitative cosmetology programs and culinary schools that roped in students with bogus promises and failed to move them into decent jobs, the more outraged he got. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy!\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re paying for vulnerable people to end up with serious debts and a useless piece of paper.\u201d\n\nThe department began developing rules to deny federal aid to bad actors, and the industry desperately fought back on Capitol Hill. For-profit programs had given generous campaign donations not only to Republicans, who were already sympathetic on ideological and anti-Obama grounds, but to Democratic leaders like then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was close to the University of Phoenix\u2019s owners and had several for-profit campuses in her district. The industry hired Lanny Davis, a ubiquitous Washington fixer who has worked the capital for clients like the brutal dictator of Equatorial Guinea, to persuade his fellow Democrats that Duncan\u2019s rules would deny low-income minorities access to the American Dream. Davis says the department showed no interest in compromise, even though the Congressional Black Caucus and other Obama supporters were siding with the industry.\n\n\u201cThat whole mess showed me that Duncan didn\u2019t understand Washington,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThis town is about the art of the deal, and he was on a jihad to root out the profit motive. It made no sense. He was demonizing Obama\u2019s base.\u201d\n\nAfter much debate within the White House, which was getting blowback from Democrats on the Hill, Duncan announced the for-profit rules in 2011. He then had to withdraw them after the industry sued and a judge ruled that some of the standards unfairly singled out for-profits. But he made it clear he had just begun to fight. He informed Ted Mitchell that revising and reissuing the rules should be at the top of his to-do list as undersecretary. And while Duncan is known for his open-door policy, Gunderson said that door was slammed shut to his industry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it in 22 years around government,\u201d Gunderson complained. \u201cWe serve the most vulnerable students; we ought to be the department\u2019s most important constituency. He wouldn\u2019t even meet with us.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Duncan issued even harsher rules that could shut down hundreds of programs whose students have excessive debt-to-income ratios, and so far those rules have survived legal challenges. He has also helped shut down Corinthian Colleges, one of the more notorious for-profits. Gunderson says the administration is unfairly singling out his industry, favoring community colleges (like the one where Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s wife is a professor) despite comparably low overall graduation rates and high default rates. (Community colleges are much cheaper, so their students accumulate much less debt, but Gunderson attributes that disparity to government subsidies.) The industry argues that Duncan is fighting an unnecessary war, since its enrollment has already dropped from a peak of 4.5 million in the recession to just over 3 million, while its default rates and tuition prices have declined as well. As their windfall profits have vanished, for-profit education stocks have cratered since 2010.\n\nDuncan says that\u2019s proof that his war is working, not that it\u2019s moot. \u201cThat\u2019s music to my ears, and it doesn\u2019t happen if we don\u2019t challenge the status quo,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the right fight.\u201d\n\nThe fight is not over. Congressional Republicans want to block several of Duncan\u2019s most onerous higher ed regulations, including the for-profit restrictions, and their objections to federal micromanagement are echoed by much of the higher education lobby. Alexander says Duncan is \u201ca good man with a big heart and the right goals,\u201d but is wildly exceeding his powers to achieve them.\n\n\u201cHe wants to dictate everything from Washington,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cPeople are fed up.\u201d\n\nDuncan has already had setbacks in a few of his Washington wars. His department tried to rein in a high-interest and arguably predatory federal loan program for parents of undergraduates, but mostly relented after a ferocious outcry from historically black colleges that relied on the program\u2019s cash. The department also tried to create a new college ratings system to fulfill an Obama promise, but recently backed off under pressure from the higher education lobby, releasing a watered-down \u201cscorecard\u201d that provides data without government ratings.\n\nNow Duncan is trying to secure the ground he\u2019s gained in the defining war of his career, the fight over K-12 reform. And he\u2019s taking heavy fire.\n\nAFTER OBAMA WAS reelected, Duncan met with the leaders of the teachers unions in his conference room. Their message was simple: Tests are out of control. They should be tools for instruction, not hammers to sanction. They don\u2019t really reflect what happens inside classrooms. They shouldn\u2019t dominate school. And using the scores of students to judge the performance of teachers who might never have met them was causing chaos in many states.\n\n\u201cWe warned Arne that this fixation on testing was a disaster,\u201d recalled Randi Weingarten of the American Federation of Teachers. \u201cWe said it was making kids and parents anxious. It was making teachers angry. I told Arne: If you don\u2019t fix this, all you\u2019re going to hear about for the next few years is testing, testing, testing.\u201d\n\nIn the three years since then, hundreds of thousands of parents have joined the \u201copt-out movement,\u201d pulling their kids out of standardized tests. Celebrities like Louis C.K. and Matt Damon have trashed the testing craze, while HBO\u2019s John Oliver dedicated one of his trademark rants to the phenomenon. The NEA has called for Duncan\u2019s ouster, while the AFT put him on an \u201cimprovement plan\u201d reminiscent of the plans reformers have pushed for inadequate teachers. Weingarten says she worries that congressional Republicans will exploit the broad-based anger at the federal government to dismantle its role ensuring a decent education for all kids in all states. But she also says Duncan has no one to blame but himself.\n\n\u201cThis is not a temporary backlash\u2014it\u2019s Democrats, Republicans, rural, suburban, urban, everyone,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cI believe Arne is very much dedicated to children, but he\u2019s created a terrible mess.\u201d\n\nDuncan agrees that many states and districts have gone overboard with tests; he points out that when he ran Chicago\u2019s schools, he ditched a standardized test he considered redundant. \u201cWhere it\u2019s too much, let\u2019s cut back,\u201d he says. But he believes some annual assessments are still needed to gauge the progress of students, their teachers and their schools. He told me 30 percent of the graduates of Massachusetts public schools, among the best in the nation, still require remedial classes when they get to a four-year college. In San Antonio, he said, the figure is more than twice as high. \u201cAnd those are the kids who don\u2019t drop out!\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019re so far from where we need to be as a country. We can\u2019t just walk away from accountability.\u201d\n\nDuncan in a quiet moment during a listening tour in Ferguson, Mo., in the aftermath of the Michael Brown case. | U.S. Department of Education | December 2014 Arne Duncan and Assistant Secretary Jim Shelton traveled to Ferguson, MO, to listen to the stories of students, educators, and community leaders in the aftermath of the Michael Brown case. | U.S. Department of Education\n\nDuncan once hoped to spend a full decade turning around Chicago\u2019s schools, and his friends say he\u2019s been saddened by the instability there since he left for Washington three years early: five different superintendents, vicious labor disputes, the hunger strike by the angry parents who ended up at his department\u2019s door. This time, Duncan wants to finish the job. He\u2019s one of only three remaining members of Obama\u2019s original Cabinet\u2014along with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and budget director Shaun Donovan, the former housing secretary\u2014and none of his top aides at the department have been with him from the beginning. Even his family has left Washington; his son and daughter are attending his old private school in Chicago, which has generated more sniping from advocates. But Duncan plans to stay to the end.\n\nHis immediate task is to persuade congressional Republicans not to take away the federal hammer in their rewrite of No Child Left Behind. It\u2019s clear that the final legislation will weaken the Education Department, giving states much more power to set standards and determine what to do if kids don\u2019t meet them, but Duncan is lobbying to make sure it does not leave states entirely to their own devices. At the same time, Duncan is pushing states not to backslide on reform. It doesn\u2019t bother him when Republican governors in states like Iowa and Arizona ditch the name \u201cCommon Core\u201d but keep the same standards, or even when states adopt new standards to distance themselves from Obama\u2014as long as the standards are tough.\n\nOf course, that will be a lot tougher to monitor once Obama leaves office. That\u2019s why Duncan is starting to think a lot about the 2016 election. Politics is not his passion; former aides told me he got uncharacteristically snippy after getting roped into a fundraiser for the bombastic (and not very reform-friendly) Florida Rep. Alan Grayson. But he is now trying to figure how to thrust education into the campaign spotlight; he recently met with CNN\u2019s editorial board about doing a candidate forum on the topic. It\u2019s one of those issues that voters always say they care about, but never seem to base their decisions on.\n\nDuncan wouldn\u2019t discuss the 2016 candidates with me. In the past, he\u2019s bashed the general \u201creverse Robin Hood\u201d anti-spending agenda of the Republican Party, but he\u2019s praised GOP hopefuls (and Common Core supporters) Jeb Bush and John Kasich. He\u2019s appeared at education reform events with Bush, who once emailed him intelligence about Florida Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s thinking about Common Core. \u201cIt would just be the kiss of death if I said something nice,\u201d Duncan told me. He wouldn\u2019t talk about the Democrats either, although he did dismiss debt-free college, a key plank of the Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley education plans, as laudable but ultimately tangential to preparing Americans for good jobs. \u201cIf you just support the current system and make it free, that would be failure,\u201d Duncan said.\n\nSo far, Hillary Clinton\u2019s platform has also focused on affordability, although she has pledged even tougher rules on for-profit schools. She has been vague about K-12 reform, but it\u2019s telling that her first major endorsement came from Weingarten and the AFT. \u201cWe knew back in 2008 that there was a big difference between Hillary and Obama,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cShe\u2019s always been about support-and-improve. And now there\u2019s ample evidence that test-and-punish doesn\u2019t work. We just wish the president and Arne had recognized that and changed his course.\u201d\n\nThe president and Arne. They really are close\u2014Duncan helped organize the president\u2019s Saturday basketball games before Obama began turning to golf\u2014and there really isn\u2019t much daylight between them on education policies. Liberals who don\u2019t like some of those policies, as well as conservatives who do, have focused their ire or grudging respect on Duncan. But he\u2019s executing the president\u2019s agenda. For example, black colleges feel badly neglected by the administration, which has often seemed less concerned about their precarious financial health and painful legacy of discrimination than the completion rates and debt burdens of their students. Johnny Taylor Jr., president of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, says he often has to remind leaders of the schools he represents that their bitter disappointment with Duncan is not consistent with their reflexive defenses of Obama. Taylor says they just don\u2019t want to hear that the first black president is not that into them.\n\n\u201cI keep saying: Stop shooting the messenger!\u201d Taylor said. \u201cDon\u2019t get pissed at Arne Duncan; he\u2019s a good soldier. If you\u2019re screaming bloody murder at Arne, and he\u2019s still not helping you, that\u2019s because the president doesn\u2019t want to help you.\u201d\n\nAxelrod told me he expects Obama to stay involved in education issues in his post-presidency, as \u201ca voice for reform and innovation.\u201d Duncan\u2019s crusades, he said, have been Obama\u2019s crusades. \u201cIf Arne was just tinkering at the margins, he wouldn\u2019t be fulfilling the president\u2019s mandate. He was put in that job to be a catalyst, to shake up the system, and there\u2019s nothing he did without the president\u2019s blessing,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cPolitically, it would\u2019ve been nice not to have all these fights with the base, but I don\u2019t think the president would\u2019ve been able to look himself in the mirror.\u201d\n\nThe next president is quite likely to feel differently. But as hard as it has been to start turning around America\u2019s educational battleship, it might be just as hard to start turning it back. The rules have changed, not just in Washington but in most of the states. Duncan hopes that as the results of the reform experiment roll in, the backlash will subside, and Americans won\u2019t stand for a return to the old status quo where illiterate kids were deemed \u201cproficient,\u201d where incompetent teachers enjoyed lifetime tenure, where students took out government loans they would never repay to attend sham institutions that wouldn\u2019t prepare them for a career. Ultimately, he says his push for accountability\u2014for teachers, principals, for-profit colleges, and the rest of the education establishment\u2014needs a new target.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard a politician say he\u2019s anti-education, but they don\u2019t always get beyond the soundbites and photo ops,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cYou know, I blame us as voters. We\u2019ve got to start holding politicians accountable, too.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Agenda", "description": "How did the most likable man in Washington become public enemy No. 1?
