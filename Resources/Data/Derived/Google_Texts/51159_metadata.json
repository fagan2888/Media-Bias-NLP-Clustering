But there\u2019s been almost no attention paid to the practical effect of this trend: It\u2019s the equivalent of a modest tax cut for millions of women whose insurers used to require co-payments. It\u2019s putting money in ordinary people\u2019s pockets.\n\nThese days, the big economic story is about inequality, about a recovery that\u2019s benefited the rich more than the poor, about middle-class wages that haven\u2019t increased in fifteen years. It\u2019s an important story. But the storytellers often overlook a variety of public policies that have helped offset the structural trends widening the gap between the rich and the rest. \u201cInstead of promoting equality,\u201d Tom Edsall wrote in a recent New York Times jeremiad, \u201cpublic policy has\u2026bestow[ed] the benefits of growth on the very few.\u201d In fact, the government has put money into ordinary people\u2019s pockets in all kinds of ways.\n\n\n\nThe most obvious way has been tax cuts. President Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus bill\u2014a topic I\u2019ve discussed at some length\u2014included $300 billion in tax cuts, mostly for the non-rich. The centerpiece was called Making Work Pay, which provided up to $800 a year for the bottom 95% of working families, and was later converted into a payroll tax credit worth up to $2,136 a year before it expired in 2012. Most stimulus tax cuts were \u201crefundable,\u201d which meant low-income workers who don\u2019t pay income taxes\u2014the \u201c47 percent\u201d that Mitt Romney was caught denigrating on video\u2014would be eligible to benefit. When Obama famously told former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor \u201celections have consequences, Eric, and I won,\u201d he was talking about refundable tax cuts for the poor, which House Republicans opposed but could not block.\n\nThis extra money for the poor and middle class doesn\u2019t show up in charts illustrating how the rich are vacuuming up all the recovery\u2019s income and wealth. Those charts and the pundits who love them also tend to ignore the impact of Obama\u2019s tax hikes on the rich, especially his repeal of the Bush tax cuts on income over $400,000. In his Times essay, titled \u201cAmerica Out of Whack,\u201d Edsall speculates at length about the impossibility of redistributive taxation in modern Washington, somehow failing to mention that it just happened in a big way last year. As Zachary Goldfarb calculated for a Washington Post piece on inequality in July, repeal cost the average member of the top 0.1% income bracket nearly half a million dollars.\n\nObamacare is also financed by hefty new taxes on the rich, including a 3.8% hike on investment income and a 0.9% hike on earned income above $250,000. But its main push against inequality will be its health benefits for the uninsured and underinsured. Free birth control is just one example. There\u2019s also free primary care and other preventive services. Families up to 138% of the poverty line are now eligible for Medicaid benefits in participating states. The law also eliminated the \u201cdonut hole,\u201d reducing drug costs for seniors. None of this will show up in the inequality data, but it all helps make ordinary Americans less financially insecure. And so far, Obamacare insurance premiums have been significantly lower than expected, which means more money in ratepayer pockets. Jason Furman, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, says the combination of Obamacare plus progressive tax changes has offset a decade\u2019s worth of rising inequality.\n\nThere are many less memorable ways that public policy has tried to narrow the gap. For example, the stimulus, if you\u2019ll pardon my obsession, also sent $250 checks to retirees and disabled veterans, increased Pell Grants for low-income students by more than $600, and expanded unemployment benefits by $25 a week. Oh, and the stimulus\u2014along with the much-maligned Wall Street bailouts and the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive monetary policies\u2014helped prevent a depression, a very good thing for the poor and middle class as well as the wealthy and the Dow. The 10 million new jobs created in this recovery didn\u2019t all go to rich people.\n\nThe stimulus also financed energy-efficiency retrofits of more than 1 million low-income homes, which will save families money and power for decades to come. And beyond the stimulus, the Department of Energy estimates that the Obama administration\u2019s new energy-efficiency mandates for refrigerators, air conditioners and dozens of other appliances will save consumers $450 billion on their electric bills through 2030. The administration\u2019s strict fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks are expected save drivers another $500 billion. That\u2019s real money.\n\nEven the federal response to the foreclosure crisis, widely perceived as an abysmal failure, has provided financial help to millions of Americans in need. The most important move, widely perceived as a gift to undeserving corporations, was the $400 billion government bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which kept mortgage credit flowing at a time when no one else would provide it, averted a dramatic increase in mortgage rates, and helped 26 million homeowners reduce their monthly payments by refinancing their mortgages by 2014. Federal programs like HARP (which helped 3 million of those homeowners refinance) and HAMP (which helped modify another 1.3 million loans) were slow and often inefficient, but low mortgage rates\u2014maintained by the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive purchases of mortgage-backed securities as well as the government backstop for Fannie and Freddie\u2014meant money in the bank for anyone with an adjustable-rate mortgage.\n\nReasonable people can disagree about whether government should be in the business of redistribution\u2014what Obama called \u201cspreading the wealth\u201d in his 2008 chat with Joe the Plumber\u2014but we should recognize that it is. The inequality trends, as severe as they are, would be far more severe without government intervention. Yes, the average CEO earns almost as much in a day as the average worker earns in a year, but government\u2014through progressive taxation, the safety net, public education and other public services, and the policies of the last five years\u2014has been pushing back.\n\nIs it pushing back hard enough? Well, reasonable people can disagree about that, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The percentage of women who get free birth control has skyrocketed since Obamacare went into effect, providing new ammunition for the political wars over Obamacare as well as the cultural wars over birth control.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The percentage of women who get free birth control has skyrocketed since Obamacare went into effect, providing new ammunition for the political wars over Obamacare\u2026", "title": "Sometimes the Government Puts Money in Our Pockets", "url": "http://time.com/3433301/sometimes-the-government-puts-money-in-our-pockets/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/cash-money-dollars.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/cash-money-dollars.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The percentage of women who get free birth control has skyrocketed since Obamacare went into effect, providing new ammunition for the political wars over Obamacare\u2026", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sometimes the Government Puts Money in Our Pockets"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "inequality, obama, wages, middle class, government", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "barack obama, inequality, middle class, rich and poor, taxes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc085\"", "article_summary": "And so far, Obamacare insurance premiums have been significantly lower than expected, which means more money in ratepayer pockets.\nPresident Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus bill\u2014a topic I\u2019ve discussed at some length\u2014included $300 billion in tax cuts, mostly for the non-rich.\nThe most obvious way has been tax cuts.\nIt\u2019s putting money in ordinary people\u2019s pockets.\nMost stimulus tax cuts were \u201crefundable,\u201d which meant low-income workers who don\u2019t pay income taxes\u2014the \u201c47 percent\u201d that Mitt Romney was caught denigrating on video\u2014would be eligible to benefit."}
