Clarke Jr.\n\n\u201cThe role of the prosecutor\u2019s office is to prosecute, not to investigate a crime,\u201d said Clarke, who labeled Chisholm\u2019s move to expand his gun-carrying investigative team \u201cmission creep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy does he need all these investigators?\u201d\n\nChisholm has more than doubled the size of his office\u2019s armed investigative team, from six to 14, since he was first elected in 2006. His budget calls for another four investigators in 2015, tripling its size in less than a decade.\n\nThe DA\u2019s critics say Chisholm, a Democrat, has used the state\u2019s John Doe law to target conservative activists\u2014including those he targeted in last year\u2019s raids\u2014in advance of the Nov. 4 gubernatorial election pitting Republican Gov. Scott Walker against Democrat Mary Burke.\n\nTwo more investigators were added in 2012 to the witness-protection unit under County Executive Chris Abele\u2019s budget, and two more were brought in this year to assist the Child Support Services Department.\n\nCritics of Chisholm\u2019s expanded armed police squad worry about the abuses possible in weaponizing a DA\u2019s office with a history of targeting conservative groups.\n\nLaw enforcement officials, with warrants issued by Chisholm and crew, shattered the silence of usually tranquil neighborhoods and lit up the darkness on the early morning of Oct. 3, 2013, with a blaze of floodlights and noisy demands. Police threatened to knock down the front door with a battering ram at one of the homes.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The budget calls for another four investigators in 2015, tripling its size in less than a decade.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The budget calls for another four investigators in 2015, tripling its size in less than a decade.", "title": "DA Who Targeted Scott Walker Wants to Add Investigators", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141019_JohnChisholm_Watchdog.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-18T23:03:54+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1FjPFU7"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The budget calls for another four investigators in 2015, tripling its size in less than a decade.", "title": "DA Who Targeted Scott Walker Wants to Add Investigators", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141019_JohnChisholm_Watchdog.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "elections", "published_time": "2014-10-19T03:01:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-18T23:03:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Milwaukee, DA, investigators, budget, scott walker, mary burke, wisconsin"}, "article_summary": "His budget calls for another four investigators in 2015, tripling its size in less than a decade.\nMADISON, Wis.\u2014A Milwaukee County prosecutor who authorized pre-dawn, paramilitary-style raids on the homes of conservative activists last year has significantly expanded his department\u2019s armed investigative force in recent years, an investigation shows.\nCritics of Chisholm\u2019s expanded armed police squad worry about the abuses possible in weaponizing a DA\u2019s office with a history of targeting conservative groups.\nPolice threatened to knock down the front door with a battering ram at one of the homes.\nScott Walker against Democrat Mary Burke."}
