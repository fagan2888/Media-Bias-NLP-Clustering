Again and again plays the endless loop of video in which the man she married is accused of raping \u2014 another woman. Oh, such scorn!\n\nAnd imagine the festering injustice she must feel when she surveys all of her troubles around her now about secret email servers and shady dealings and plummeting poll numbers and then remembers how shamelessly rotten HE was \u2014 and yet got away with it all!\n\nMost galling of all must be when she peers across the aisle into the Republican field and sees the dazzling and invigorating campaign that is Donald Trump.\n\nThe Donald is having so much FUN.\n\nThe Hillary, meanwhile, is so miserable that Reuters news service brought in a body language expert to diagnose her obvious distress. \u201cSadness. Anxiety.\u201d\n\nBrutal.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Trump and his campaign are everything that Mrs. Clinton and hers are not. She is suffering a terrible case of Trump envy.\n\nTalk about low energy. Hillary Clinton makes Jeb Bush look like the Energizer Bunny!\n\nHillary seems so old and played out. Yet she is two years younger than Mr. Trump! And still on her first husband.\n\nBecause of his mastery in the field, Donald Trump had been in the media\u2019s glare since well before the Clintons arrived in Washington with all their Arkansas baggage. Yet it is Hillary Clinton that everybody is so tired of. Hillary fatigue is the one thing unifying Democrats and Republicans today.\n\nThe poor woman is even getting beaten around by Socialist Bernie Sanders \u2014 and he is the oldest of them all! And, on top of that, the old codger has been in Congress for a quarter-century! If he ain\u2019t to blame for this mess than nobody is!\n\nMr. Trump is constantly ridiculed by all the experts who despise him (and his legion of supporters) for his celebrity status. But they cannot deny that he has seamlessly converted that into a Golden Campaign.\n\nBut wait! That was supposed to be Hillary\u2019s trick!\n\nAll she has ever been is a celebrity, having married the right person who was insanely gifted at politics. She successfully converted that celebrity into a Senate seat from a state she was not from. And she thought she could could ride that celebrity all the way to the White House.\n\nTurns out that old shabby donkey broke down in Foggy Bottom and refused to budge one inch more up the hill to the White House.\n\nInstead political hosannas, all Hillary Clinton seems to get for her celebrity status these days is more and more hellish wrath from voters on both sides of the aisle.\n\nGets even worse when she opens her mouth.\n\nDonald Trump talks and the most outrageous things pop out about rapists and blood and fat people. Voters jump up and cheer and applaud him for his honesty.\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton opens her mouth, the most tired and meaningless pablum dribbles out. And everyone just shakes their head and thinks she is lying.\n\n\u201cWhat, with, like a cloth or something?\u201d she said when asked if her secret server had been wiped clean.\n\nAnd how about her wealth? She and her husband are worth some $170 million off of book deals and speaking fees and various other grifting that lies at the intersection of politics and money.\n\n$170 million. That is not even half of what Donald Trump says he makes in a single year. His net worth is at least some 20 times that of the Clintons\u2019. Could be more like 50 times their wealth.\n\nYet, it is Hillary Clinton who is daily eviscerated for her wealth and ridiculed for claiming to have been penniless when she left the White House. Oh, the injustice!\n\nWhat makes it all so grueling and oppressive is not that it is something she has never encountered before but rather that she has endured it for so, so long.\n\nRemember 2008? When the long, bitter fight was all over, the Democratic Party told her it was time for a black man. Next time, they assured her, it would be HER turn. It would be time for the woman.\n\nYeah, her turn to get beaten again. This time by an older white guy with an orange comb-over.\n\n\u2022 Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com and on Twitter via @charleshurt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump and his campaign are everything that Hillary Clinton and hers are not.
