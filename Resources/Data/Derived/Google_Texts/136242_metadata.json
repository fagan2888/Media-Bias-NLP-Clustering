I look up and they are just loading up weapons from the counter and then they run off and my instincts kicked in.\"\n\nTapley, 24, followed the three suspects described only as white males ages 16 or 17, after they stole several rifles and an undisclosed amount of cash. Once outside, Tapley pulled out his own weapon.\n\n\"I told him drop the gun man, mine is loaded , just drop the gun. We made eye contact for a second or two and he dropped two guns and ran,\" said Tapley.\n\nPolice officers arrested the teens along with an unidentified woman in the area of Southwest 6th and Fairlawn. The teenage boys were booked into the Juvenile Center on assault, burglary and robbery charges. The female was booked on conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery.\n\nTapley who carries his gun without a concealed carry permit says his heroics wouldn't have been possible without Governor Brownback's approval of the law that took effect just under 2 weeks ago on July 1.\n\n\"That's why Kansas made the law. So citizens can carry and protect themselves and others. I guess my instincts just took over,\" said Tapley.\n\nAll the cash and rifles stolen were recovered by the Topeka police. Kansas is just one of five states to allow it's residents to carry concealed firearms without a permit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Joey Tapley was a key witness in Friday's armed robbery for weapons inside the Academy Sports and Outdoors store in Topeka.", "language": "english", "author": "WIBW", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Kansas-man-says-new-gun-law-allowed-him-to-delay-armed-robber-314482911.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/600*794/topeka+robbery.png", "type": "article", "description": "Joey Tapley was a key witness in Friday's armed robbery for weapons inside the Academy Sports and Outdoors store in Topeka.", "title": "Kansas man says new gun law allowed him to delay armed robber"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Joey Tapley was a key witness in Friday's armed robbery for weapons inside the Academy Sports and Outdoors store in Topeka.", "title": "Kansas man says new gun law allowed him to delay armed robber", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Kansas-man-says-new-gun-law-allowed-him-to-delay-armed-robber-314482911.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/topeka+robbery+thumb.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Kansas man says new gun law allowed him to delay armed robber", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Kansas man says new gun, law allowed him to delay"}, "article_summary": "Joey Tapley was a key witness in Friday's armed robbery for weapons inside the Academy Sports and Outdoors store in Topeka.\n\"I told him drop the gun man, mine is loaded , just drop the gun.\nKansas is just one of five states to allow it's residents to carry concealed firearms without a permit.\n\"That's why Kansas made the law.\nI look up and they are just loading up weapons from the counter and then they run off and my instincts kicked in.\""}
