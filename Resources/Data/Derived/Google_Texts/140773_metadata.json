It authorizes the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to set policies regarding federal information security and directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to help implement those policies.\n\nNotably, it will also clarify oversight of the .gov websites.\n\n\u201cThis bill will modernize our outdated federal network security laws, provide the tools and authorities needed to improve security at our federal agencies and increase transparency and accountability for data breaches at federal agencies,\u201d said Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Carper Tom CarperFinancial industry spars with retailers over data breach bill Week ahead: Cyber Command in the spotlight Lawsuit exposes M cybertheft through banking software MORE (D-Del.), who sponsored the Senate bill.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing Wednesday, Phyllis Schneck, DHS deputy under secretary for cybersecurity, said FISMA would \u201chelp us to achieve\u201d the rapid cyber threat analysis and notification it desires.\n\nThe FISMA that ultimately passed contains elements of two bills that passed the House earlier this year.\n\nHouse Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) had his own federal information security update bill. That measure focused less on the DHS and more on the OMB. Although Issa indicated on Tuesday he did not support the Senate\u2019s version of his bill, he ultimately didn\u2019t oppose its passage.\n\nHouse Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) also had a bill that defined the DHS\u2019s cybersecurity role.\n\nA pared-down Senate version of McCaul\u2019s bill passed the upper chamber on Wednesday afternoon. It has yet to move in the House. But some elements left out of the Senate's bill made it into FISMA, pleasing McCaul.\n\n\u201cThe bill Congress sent to the president today will improve the DHS\u2019s cybersecurity capabilities by clarifying the department\u2019s authority and mission to secure federal networks,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, it\u2019s just a fraction of what industry \u2014 and many lawmakers \u2014 were hoping to achieve this Congress.\n\nIndustry had pushed for a legal safe harbor for businesses exchanging cyber threat information with the National Security Agency. The private sector also advocated for standardized federal data breach notification requirements for companies.\n\nSen.
