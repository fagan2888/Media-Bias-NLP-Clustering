Ryan and the other young prominent figures of the right; and Quin Hillyer, 49, a conservative journalist whose detailed policy analyses and list of endorsements testify to decades in the premier circles of the conservative movement.\n\nEveryone expects a runoff, and the runoff could include any of these. The only candidate assumed to be a lock is Mr. Byrne, the best financed and most widely known.\n\nMr. Byrne, whose political career and support from the business community have marked him as the establishment candidate, is known statewide for a bruising race for governor in 2010. That Republican primary became a pitched battle between Mr. Byrne, who had the broad backing of Republican leaders, and Tim James, a staunch conservative and son of a former governor. Their fighting, and a nasty scrap Mr. Byrne got into with the teachers\u2019 union, left voters cold and opened the way for another Republican, Robert J. Bentley, a mild-mannered dermatologist who now sits in the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nThis recent lesson about the wisdom of letting others do the attacking perhaps explains how well-mannered this primary has been so far.\n\nBut negativity lingers from the ad wars in 2010, including perceptions that Mr. Byrne, a Democrat until 1997, is insufficiently conservative. He, like the others, supports getting rid of the president\u2019s health care law and has even proposed abolishing the Internal Revenue Service. But he talks repeatedly of spending on infrastructure and working with Congressional Democrats where possible. And, citing a huge investment by the aircraft maker Airbus that may transform Mobile, Mr. Byrne is surprisingly upbeat for a conservative running in these times.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think people are concerned,\u201d he said in an interview at a campaign gathering for young professionals, many of them young men with good haircuts and pressed khakis. \u201cBut people don\u2019t want to be angry. They want to be hopeful.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThis may be an accurate read of the district. But in what is expected to be an election with very low turnout, it remains to be seen whether it is a good read of those at the polls. If not, the beneficiary may be Mr. Young.\n\nMr. Young, who made a serious run at Mr. Bonner in 2012 and has financed much of his own campaign this year, says he would vote against raising the debt ceiling, sees those who would compromise in Congress as \u201cspineless\u201d and boasts of support from Chief Justice Roy Moore of the Alabama Supreme Court, a hero among the hard-right evangelicals who form Mr. Young\u2019s base.\n\nSupporters of the other candidates speak with a respectful and perhaps wary bewilderment about this base. Its electoral behavior often eludes pollsters and competitors, as Chief Justice Moore\u2019s recent career illustrates.\n\nFamed for installing a Ten Commandments monument in the state judicial building in 2003, Chief Justice Moore ran for governor in 2010 and, to the surprise of many, received less than a fifth of the votes in the primary. Two years later he ran for chief justice and, to the surprise of many, won the primary without a runoff.\n\n\u201cIf we get a 10 percent turnout, who knows what is going to happen,\u201d said Lou Campomenosi, a political science professor at Tulane University who is involved in Alabama\u2019s Tea Party movement. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think Dean becomes the real wild card candidate, because he\u2019s got this really fervent group behind him.\u201d\n\nAn hour northeast of Mobile, Mr. Fincher was greeting voters at a fair in Atmore. In a condensed campaign, Mr. Fincher\u2019s name recognition is a considerable advantage, and many believe that he is likely to meet Mr. Byrne in a runoff.\n\nAt the fair, Mr. Fincher talked of concerns about an out-of-control federal government and a loss of Christian values, a message that resonated with people sitting nearby and picking at barbecued ribs.\n\nBut concern just might not be a strong enough word.\n\n\u201cI think Barack Obama is the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to this country,\u201d said Stoney Daw, 72, a former federal law enforcement officer and now a small town police chief. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can survive three more years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20130921105411, "twitter": {"description": "The outcome in the
