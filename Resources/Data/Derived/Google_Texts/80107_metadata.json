But that doesn\u2019t mean the companies or consumers are cooperating.\n\nA groundswell of support for the companies is growing, pressuring officials in Virginia to allow them to compete with traditional taxicab companies.\n\nEven though taxicab companies have the institutional connections in Richmond, Uber and Lyft have social media and consumer support\u2014from people like Arlington resident Chris Wilson.\n\nHe\u2019s just one of the many in Virginia who say they are happy with how Uber is meeting consumer demand in a way cab companies just aren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a better alternative that existing cab companies just don\u2019t really want to get on board with,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nUber was founded in 2009 as a venture-funded transportation company, allowing riders and drivers to connect on their mobile devices and see other people\u2019s reviews about each other before agreeing to a ride. It\u2019s ruffled the feathers of taxicab companies that dominated the industry for the past 80 years, said Marc Scribner, a transportation policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n\nAnd in a market where consumers now have a choice, they\u2019re speaking with their bucks and their business.\n\n\u201cUber, to their infinite credit, coming up with the two-sided rating system for drivers and passengers, creates a very interesting, self-regulating system,\u201d Scribner said. \u201cEvery car I\u2019ve taken, whether it\u2019s Uber, Lyft Sidecar, the drivers are incredibly courteous, on average, far more courteous than your average cab driver. People are seeing that.\u201d\n\nBut taxicab companies say they just want companies like Uber and Lyft to play by the rules. And Spencer Kimball, president and one of the owners of Alexandria Yellow Cab, isn\u2019t sitting idly by while technology outpaces his company.\n\n\u201cWe at Alexandria Yellow Cab have been watching this trend for quite a while,\u201d Kimball said.\n\nSure, there\u2019s already some technology out there like Taxi Magic, an app that allows you to order taxis from your cell phone. But Kimball looked all over the world\u2014literally\u2014to find someone to develop a mobile app for taxis better than Uber\u2019s.\n\nKimball and his general manager traveled to the United Kingdom to meet with a company. It took some footwork, but Alexandria Yellow Cab now has a preliminary agreement to be the first company in America to roll out this kind of app service, he said.\n\n\u201cBy late July, early August, you will see an entirely different interface for a Alexandria Yellow Cab,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cIt will do everything that Uber and Lyft do that customers like, and then some.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with Uber and Lyft and the regulations, and frankly I don\u2019t want to be standing around waiting to find out,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cOur job is to provide the best service we could possibly provide to the customer, no matter who is out there. So that\u2019s what we intend to do.\u201d\n\nSocial media presence, however, has been the strength of companies like Uber.\n\nThe day after the Virginia DMV sent cease-and-desist letters to Uber and Lyft at the beginning of June, Uber sent an email to its subscribers in Virginia with the subject line, \u201cYou have the right to ride,\u201d telling Virginians they are committed to staying in the state and explained how the company exceeds the state\u2019s background check and insurance requirements, and encouraging riders to tweet with the hashtag, #VAneedsUber.\n\nRead more on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles ordered rideshare companies Uber and Lyft to stop operating.
