And for anyone masochistic enough to enjoy further delving into the repercussions of such things in politics, you\u2019ve by now heard the clear analysis of said resignation:\n\nThe Republican Party is in the midst of a civil war.\n\nBoehner\u2019s resignation at the end of October is yet another casualty in the battle between the old Republican party of Eisenhower, Nixon and Reagan, and the newer, hardline conservative movement.\n\nThis strife has been thoroughly detailed in places like Politico\u2019s Sept. 25 article, \u201cThe GOP civil war infects 2016.\u201d The article details that \u201cMovement leaders and activists see the downfall of the House speaker as a coup that\u2019s been years in the making \u2014 and one whose momentum they hope will now yield not only more rigidly conservative leadership in Congress but also a Republican presidential nominee who is one of their own. The GOP civil war, in other words, is raging as much on the 2016 stage as it is in Washington.\u201d\n\nThis new extremely conservative push in the Republican Party is less willing than leaders like Boehner, or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to compromise with Democrats like President Barack Obama to pass legislature.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, a presidential candidate, is one of the staunchest social conservatives in the public eye right now, and he is well known (and that\u2019s not a good thing) for his instrumental role in bringing about the damaging 2013 government shutdown trying to strip money from Obamacare, as detailed in Bloomberg Politics on Sept. 8.\n\nHardline conservatives like him are at it again, threatening another looming shutdown over federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe Kansas City Star published an article Sept. 28, \u201cHard-line conservatives to GOP field: Defy us at your own peril,\u201d that dives into the growing unrest in the Grand Old Party. \u201cThe Republican Party\u2019s conservative wing,\u201d the article says, \u201cpumped up by House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s stepping down, is warning the 2016 presidential candidates that defying its wishes will come at their peril.\u201d\n\nThe Star piece also revealed thinking of \u201cembrace our uncompromising stance against abortion rights and gay marriage, among other priorities, even if doing so risks a federal government shutdown,\u201d and that Boehner\u2019s decision \u201crevealed a deep divide within the GOP that raises questions about the party\u2019s ability to unite behind one candidate next spring.\u201d\n\nSo how does this fracturing GOP hurt public discourse and public policy?\n\nWell, catering to these energetic and staunch conservatives means that much of the GOP presidential field has had to dive headfirst into lunacy.\n\nThe fact that Donald Trump has led in the polls for so long is evidence point A through Z, but even besides that, Republican voters should be very worried.\n\nBen Carson, who is making a huge surge in the polls (now even competitive with Mr. Trump), once said of evolution: \u201cI personally believe that this theory that Darwin came up with was something that was encouraged by the adversary.\u201d And by adversary, he was referring to the devil. Carson, a creationist, called the Big Bang a \u201cfairy tale,\u201d encouraged by \u201chigh-faluting\u201d scientists.\n\nCarson, a neurosurgeon mind you, has also run into some trouble on the subject of vaccinations. He\u2019s not alone in this, as detailed by Politico\u2019s article \u201cVaccine phobia infects GOP race,\u201d which shows Carson, Rand Paul, Chris Christie and Trump all on the wrong, and quite frankly, shocking side of the vaccination \u201cdebate.\u201d\n\nCarson, quoted in Roger Simon\u2019s article \u201cCan Carson stir pot of bigotry without getting burned?\u201d has said that Obamacare is \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d and that he does not want a Muslim in the White House because Muslims cannot be trusted by not fitting \u201cwithin the realm of America.\u201d\n\nSimon needles out a point damning the state of the Republican Party at the moment: \u201c(Carson\u2019s) assertions were bigoted and ignorant, but bigoted and ignorant have been playing well in the Republican Party this year.\u201d\n\nJeb Bush said that the U.S. \u201cshould not have a multicultural society,\u201d Trump said illegal Mexican immigrants are bringing drugs, crime and rape past our border, and Rush Limbaugh even said, \u201cDon\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take, but this news that there is flowing water on Mars is somehow going to find its way into a technique to advance the leftist agenda.\u201d OK, so Limbaugh isn\u2019t so important, I just wanted to point out that he said that for fun.\n\nThis formerly respectable party preaching fiscal responsibility and family values is, before our very eyes, being corrupted and disfigured into an anti-science, anti-women, anti-seemingly everything party of fear and extremism. And voters of the GOP should be sick. National elections still run toward the moderate voter \u2013 honestly, you cannot win with one of these insane people.\n\nThe Republican Party is broken. And it\u2019s going to take a hell of a lot of political therapy and citizen participation for the voters to fix it. Because the politicians aren\u2019t.\n\nJonathan Greig is a senior in anthropology.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Jonathan Greig", "og": {"site_name": "The Collegian", "description": "Why the Grand Old Party is in desperate need of serious reform.", "title": "OPINION: Republican Party is both severely fractured and broken", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://photos.collegianmedia.com/photos/i-h2B42jr/0/S/i-h2B42jr-S.png", "updated_time": "2015-10-04T23:31:06+00:00", "url": "http://www.kstatecollegian.com/2015/10/04/opinion-republican-party-is-both-severely-fractured-and-broken/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kstatecollegian", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#7f54a3", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/kstatecollegian", "section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2015-10-04T23:31:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-04T23:31:06+00:00"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "The Republican Party is broken.\nBoehner\u2019s resignation at the end of October is yet another casualty in the battle between the old Republican party of Eisenhower, Nixon and Reagan, and the newer, hardline conservative movement.\nAnd for anyone masochistic enough to enjoy further delving into the repercussions of such things in politics, you\u2019ve by now heard the clear analysis of said resignation:The Republican Party is in the midst of a civil war.\nWell, catering to these energetic and staunch conservatives means that much of the GOP presidential field has had to dive headfirst into lunacy.\nFor anyone patient enough to consistently follow national politics, you\u2019ve by now heard of Speaker of the House John Boehner\u2019s resignation."}
