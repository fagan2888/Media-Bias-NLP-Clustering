Ten times between April and September, the undercover officer purchased the firearms \u2014 five of which had been reported stolen \u2014 for a total of $7,500, or about $153 per weapon.\n\nThe bust was the most recent by the local investigators in the city\u2019s effort to combat the flow of illegal guns into the city.\n\nMr. McPhaul pleaded not guilty. Attorney information was not available for him Wednesday.\n\nThe suspect \u2014 who used three cell phones to conduct his illegal business \u2014 would mostly communicate through text messages, offering code language to set up sales, officials said.\n\n\u201cHave a lot of toys for kids,\u201d Mr. McPhaul allegedly sent in one text message to the undercover officer, to whom Mr. McPhaul then offered to sell $2,500 worth of guns and ammunition.\n\nMr. McPhaul would travel often from Brooklyn to Fayetteville, N.C., where some of his family resides, to retrieve more weapons to sell, officials said. He was arrested Oct. 4 after returning from his latest trip when he was seen driving his vehicle, which had North Carolina license plates, in East New York.\n\nMr. McPhaul, who had a previous gun arrest in 2006 in East Flatbush, has an extensive criminal history over the past two decades, Mr. Kelly said. He was most recently arrested in Hoke County, N.C., in January for possession of a stolen firearm, according to police.\n\nMr. Kelly, whose department made its largest ever gun bust more than a year ago when 250 guns trafficked from North and South Carolina were seized, said those two states are the second largest source of illegal guns in New York City after Virginia.\n\n\u201cThe statistics are not surprising to the New York City Police Department, because 90 percent of the guns that we confiscate here on our streets come from out of state,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cAnd they surface in the neighborhoods that can least afford to have them on their streets; the neighborhood that are most at risk.\u201d\n\nCurrently remanded to Rikers Island without bail, Mr. McPhaul faces up to 50 years in prison if convicted on the top charge of first-degree criminal sale of a firearm.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A Brooklyn man accused of trafficking and selling 49 guns from North Carolina to an undercover New York City police detective has been indicted for more than 100 felonies, law-enforcement officials said Wednesday.", "title": "Brooklyn Man Accused in Sale of 49 Guns From North Carolina", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/10/16/brooklyn-man-accused-in-sale-of-49-guns-from-north-carolina/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AA320_nyhyne_G_20131016135129.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Brooklyn Man Accused in Sale of 49 Guns From North Carolina", "description": "A Brooklyn man accused of trafficking and selling 49 guns from North Carolina to an undercover New York City police detective has been indicted for more than 100 felonies, law-enforcement officials said Wednesday.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Carrie Melago", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "A Brooklyn man accused of trafficking and selling 49 guns from North Carolina to an undercover New York City police detective has been indicted for more than 100 felonies, law-enforcement officials said Wednesday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2013-10-16T18:24:50-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/10/16/brooklyn-man-accused-in-sale-of-49-guns-from-north-carolina/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-18793", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A Brooklyn man accused of trafficking and selling 49 guns from North Carolina to an undercover New York City police detective has been indicted for more than 100 felonies, law-enforcement officials said Wednesday.", "title": "Brooklyn Man Accused in Sale of 49 Guns From North Carolina", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/10/16/brooklyn-man-accused-in-sale-of-49-guns-from-north-carolina/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AA320_nyhyne_G_20131016135129.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-18793", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-16T18:25:09-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeec8\"", "article_summary": "By Sarah ArmaghanA Brooklyn man accused of trafficking and selling 49 guns from North Carolina to an undercover New York City police detective has been indicted for more than 100 felonies, law-enforcement officials said Wednesday.\nMr. McPhaul, who had a previous gun arrest in 2006 in East Flatbush, has an extensive criminal history over the past two decades, Mr. Kelly said.\nThe bust was the most recent by the local investigators in the city\u2019s effort to combat the flow of illegal guns into the city.\nMr. McPhaul, who went by the nickname \u201cCountry,\u201d operated a \u201cconvenient delivery service\u201d for guns in the Bushwick area where he resides, Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes said.\nMr. McPhaul would travel often from Brooklyn to Fayetteville, N.C., where some of his family resides, to retrieve more weapons to sell, officials said."}
