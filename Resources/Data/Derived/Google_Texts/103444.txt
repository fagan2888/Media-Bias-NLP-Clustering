Finding the best way to prevent concussions is on the minds of every NFL player, but most look for possible treatments that are backed up by factual evidence. Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson took a different approach. In a Rolling Stone article, Wilson claims his speedy recovery from a head injury last year was the result of drinking Reliant Recovery Water. #Nanobubbles.

"I banged my head during the Packers game in the playoffs, and the next day I was fine,” Wilson told Rolling Stone. "It was the water."

I will give it to Wilson. Following a brutal collision with Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews, the Super Bowl winning quarterback did make a seemingly miraculous recovery. Although Wilson did not go through the league’s concussion protocols, he did return to the next series to lead his team to a win in that NFC Championship Game.

Despite Wilson’s blessing, I have a hard time believing a $3 bottle of water that has “no added ingredients other than minerals for enhanced electrolytes” prevented his concussion — mainly due to science, but also because Wilson is an investor in Recovery Water.

Wilson doubled down on his outlandish claim with the above tweet and then tripled down with another tweet linking to an article from December 2014, showing that the company responsible for “nanobubbles” is still in its early research stages.

So what do you think? Is this just a not-so-subtle marketing ploy or is Wilson officially off the reservation?
