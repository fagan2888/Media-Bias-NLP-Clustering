Brutus uses a clumsy high-stepping gait to maneuver over concrete curbs and sidewalks. Inside the house, the going is a little smoother for the 75-pound pooch, but he still steps gingerly around carpets and pillows.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s learning how to thrive with his new feet,\u201d Duerr said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to take a while.\u201d\n\nAs a puppy, Brutus was left outside, and his paws suffered frostbite, prompting a backyard surgery by the breeder, who then pawned off the dog in a shopping center parking lot.\n\nNo one has heard from the breeder since. Brutus, meanwhile, fell into the hands of a rescue group that raised $12,500 for the dog\u2019s surgery, two sets of prosthetics from Denver-based OrthoPets and physical therapy at Colorado State.\n\nBrutus came under the foster care of Laura Aquilina and her husband, Rick Jaruzel, in June. Other members of their Loveland family include cat Durchilita and a patient 10-year-old Great Dane named Charlie.\n\nBrutus enjoys the pleasures of any dog, crowding out Aquilina and Charlie for a spot on a living room couch and bouncing up to a stranger for a pat.\n\n\u201cI know Brutus is a purebred, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s well-bred,\u201d said Aquilina, who has applied to adopt Brutus.\n\n\u201cHe goofs around like any 2-year-old dog,\u201d said Aquilina. \u201cHe sleeps on his back and snores with his little nubs-for-feet sticking straight in the air.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut with all that he\u2019s been through, I guess he should get the good life,\u201d she adds.\n\nBrutus lived with his first foster family for about a year but he couldn\u2019t walk on the hardwood floors and stairs.\n\nHe has an easier time in Aquilina\u2019s home, and he doesn\u2019t wear his prosthetics inside the house. But outside, gravel and rocks cause him pain without his new legs.\n\nShortly after Aquilina took in Brutus, he had surgery on three of his four paws to remove bone fragments and the two remaining toes to fit the prosthetics. He was fitted with the rear prosthetics in September, and the front legs came in November.\n\nEach limb weighs about a pound.\n\nOrthoPets veterinarians also learned that both of Brutus\u2019 wrist joints had collapsed. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to a human rolling his ankle completely to the side, left grossly unstable,\u201d said Martin Kaufmann, founder of OrthoPets.\n\nThe dog also has a painful callus that makes movement difficult, Kaufmann said. They hope Brutus\u2019 prosthetics will protect and make his limbs more comfortable, support his front collapsed legs and realign each leg to an equal length.\n\nIn 2013, OrthoPets helped put four legs on Nakio, who was left as a puppy at a foreclosed house in Nebraska in the winter and was stuck in a frozen puddle in the basement. He was later adopted by a veterinary assistant in Colorado Springs.\n\nHis life and trials spawned a support network for disabled canines, and the work done on him set the stage for the recovery of Brutus.\n\n\u201cWe learned a lot from Nakio\u2019s story, and we were able to apply that knowledge to Brutus\u2019 case,\u201d Kaufmann said.\n\nThis month, Brutus will begin a new round of physical therapy at CSU. That will involve underwater treadmill therapy, balance activities, exercise balls and other neuro re-education therapies to help Brutus adapt to his new limbs, said Sasha Foster, CSU\u2019s certified canine rehabilitation therapist.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s learning how to move with them on,\u201d Foster said. \u201cOnce he\u2019s mastered that, we will help him achieve higher-level-functioning activities, like hiking and playing with other dogs.\u201d\n\nOnly his new, fragile legs are keeping Brutus from doing those things now, Aquilina said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a goofball. He\u2019s happy-go-lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just wants to play.\u201d\n\nMonte Whaley: 720-929-0907, mwhaley@denverpost.com or twitter.com/montewhaley", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Brutus the Rottweiler learns to adapt to new prosthetic legs", "title": "Brutus the Rottweiler learns to adapt to new prosthetic legs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/04/brutus-the-rottweiler-learns-to-adapt-to-new-prosthetic-legs/", "image": {"width": 435, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150404__20150405_B1_CDXXBRUTUS2p1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150404__20150405_B1_CDXXBRUTUS2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-04T17:14:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T04:30:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "They hope Brutus\u2019 prosthetics will protect and make his limbs more comfortable, support his front collapsed legs and realign each leg to an equal length.\n\u201cI know Brutus is a purebred, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s well-bred,\u201d said Aquilina, who has applied to adopt Brutus.\nLOVELAND \u2014 Brutus survived mind-numbing cruelty to become a tail-wagging pioneer in meshing flesh and bone with new-age prosthetics.\nBrutus came under the foster care of Laura Aquilina and her husband, Rick Jaruzel, in June.\nBrutus lived with his first foster family for about a year but he couldn\u2019t walk on the hardwood floors and stairs."}
