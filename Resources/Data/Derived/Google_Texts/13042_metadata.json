The Denver Zoo spent years developing such a system to recycle its animal waste into energy, but it recently called off that effort, in part because of cost concerns.\n\n\u201cEmbracing an ethic of regeneration is one of the guiding principles in the NWC Master Plan that challenges us to create an efficient campus that will become an international leader in \u2018net zero\u2019 efforts,\u201d Kelly Leid, who leads the North Denver Cornerstone Collaborative, said in the recent news release.\n\nHe has said public- private partnerships could be key to developing and financing the utility systems for the site.\n\nA spokeswoman for the city office said NREL, a lab that\u2019s part of the U.S. Department of Energy, would contribute its staff time, expertise and resources without any payment from the city.\n\nCity officials, the stock show, CSU and other partners have locked down most of the funding for the first phases of what\u2019s expected to be a 10-year build-out. They still are searching for other sources to fill a gap exceeding $200 million.\n\nInitial buildings will include a large new equestrian center with an equine sports medicine clinic, a livestock center, new stockyards that double as a festival park, and CSU innovation and research buildings. Later, still-unfunded phases call for a large exhibition hall, a new arena and the renovation of the historic Stadium Arena.\n\nDenver voters in November agreed to extend lodging and car rental taxes. State leaders have authorized borrowing to pay for CSU\u2019s facilities.\n\nSeparately, the state Economic Development Commission in early December awarded Regional Tourism Act sales-tax funding. The Stock Show Association also plans to raise money from donors.\n\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or @JonMurray", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Golden\u2019s NREL signs on to help develop National Western energy plan", "title": "Golden\u2019s NREL signs on to help develop National Western energy plan", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/24/goldens-nrel-signs-on-to-help-develop-national-western-energy-plan/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151125__NRELp1.jpg", "height": 443}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151125__NRELp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-24T13:20:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:30:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Experts at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will help planners of the National Western Center project come up with ways to avoid turning the large north Denver area into an energy hog.\nBut officials with Golden-based NREL and the city say they also will focus on designing energy systems that waste as little energy as possible at the expanded home of the National Western Stock Show and Rodeo.\nIt also recommended ways to make the campus\u2019 water and waste systems more efficient, including using nonpotable water for landscaping, maximizing recycling and composting, and exploring waste-to-energy systems.\nThe Denver Zoo spent years developing such a system to recycle its animal waste into energy, but it recently called off that effort, in part because of cost concerns.\nLater, still-unfunded phases call for a large exhibition hall, a new arena and the renovation of the historic Stadium Arena."}
