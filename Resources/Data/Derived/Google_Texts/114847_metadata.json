Alcee Hastings Says Old Texas Dildo Law Shows The State Is 'Crazy'", "article_keywords": ["crazy", "told", "old", "texans", "rep", "restricting", "alcee", "dildo", "states", "state", "hastings", "cnn", "law", "texas", "shows"], "article_url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/05/alcee-hastings-dildo-laws_n_6627174.html", "article_text": "A Florida congressman is not backing off his assertion that Texas is a \"crazy state,\" and he's now citing an old law restricting dildos to make his case.\n\n\"One of their cities has a law that says that women can only have six dildos, and the certain size of things,\" Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.) told CNN. \"And if that ain't crazy I don't know what is.\"\n\nHastings may have been referring to a law that was struck down in 2008 restricting the sale of sex toys. As Lone Star Q points out, Texas' Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who was the state's attorney general at the time, actually went to court in an attempt to uphold the dildo ban.\n\nThe law in question includes, \"A person who possesses six or more obscene devices or identical or similar obscene articles is presumed to possess them with intent to promote the same.\"\n\nHastings called Texas a \"crazy state\" during a committee hearing on the Affordable Care Act on Monday, causing Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas), to demand an apology. It also led to a memorable segment on \"The Daily Show\" pitting their two states against one another.\n\nBut to many Texans, the insult is no laughing matter. Hastings told CNN of one Texas family that canceled a trip to Walt Disney World in Orlando because of what he said about their state.\n\n\"I love Texans, but I do not like their policy makers who are in the majority,\" Hastings said. \"The simple fact of the matter is, evidently, I touched a nerve deep in the heart of Texas. And I would ask them to tie a yellow rose around it and do like 'Frozen' and 'Let It Go.'\"\n\nBut Hastings didn't just mess with Texas. He also took a shot at his own state.\n\n\"Consider the fact that I am a native Floridian and that I dislike it,\" he told CNN. \"I have cautioned about living in Florida and when I retire I'm not so sure I'm going to stay there.\"\n\n(h/t Mediaite)\n\nOutdated American Laws Outdated American Laws\n\n1 of 11 In Oregon one may not test their physical endurance while driving a car on a highway.
