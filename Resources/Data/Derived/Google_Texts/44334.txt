Many government scientists, politicians, and environmental groups claim increased atmospheric carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is causing global warming (climate change) to take place. If global warming is taking place, we would see shortened winters and earlier springs. These are observations citizens can perform and determine if spring is occurring earlier in their particular location.

Living in Atlanta, Georgia, I have to pay attention to the arrival of spring because I open an outdoor heated swimming pool as early as possible for swimming exercise. This can’t be done until the pollen from our numerous blooming trees and petals from Dogwood trees have fallen. For many years I have been able to get the pool operational by April 15. This year is the third year in a row I will not be able to open the pool because the heavy pollen season is not over and Dogwood petals just started blooming April 8.

Atlanta has an outdoor Dogwood Festival in Piedmont Park over a three-day weekend in mid-April. Usually Dogwoods have long lost their blooms by time of the festival. This year’s Dogwood blooms were at their peak at the start of the Festival April 10, 2015. Unfortunately, a severe rain storm the night of April 10 knocked most of the blooms off the trees.

Let readers of this post leave comments below about their observations of the arrival of spring to ascertain whether global warming is occurring in their hometowns. My estimate is spring has been delayed 10 days in Atlanta the past three years. This contradicts the occurrence of global warming.
