Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is convincing his working class supporters Mexicans and Muslims are the reason for their anger not low wages and income inequality.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nSanders said, \u201cLook, many of Trump\u2019s supporters are working-class people, and they\u2019re angry. And they\u2019re angry because they\u2019re working longer hours for lower wages. They\u2019re angry because their jobs have left this country and gone to China or other low-wage countries. And their angry because they can\u2019t afford to send their kids to college or retire with dignity. And I think what Trump has done successfully, I would say, is take that anger, take that anxiety about terrorism and say to a lot of people in this country is \u2018look the reason for our problems is because of Mexicans.\u2019 And he says they are all criminals and rapists. We have to hate Mexicans. Or he says Muslims are all terrorist, keep them out of this country. That\u2019s what we have to deal with to make America great. Meanwhile interestingly enough, this is guy does not want to raise the minimum wage. In fact he said that he thinks wages in America are too high. But he does want to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top three-tenths of one percent. So I think for his working-class and middle class supporters, I think we can make the case that if we really want to address the issues that people are concerned about. Why the middle class is disappearing, massive income and wealth inequality in this country. That we need policies that bring us together. That take on the greed of Wall Street the greed of corporate America and create a middle class that works for all of us, rather than an economy that works for just a few.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sanders: Trump's Working Class Supporters Should Back Me, I Want Higher Wages", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Sanders: Trump's Working Class Supporters Should Back Me, I Want Higher Wages", "title": "Sanders: Trump's Working Class Supporters Should Back Me - I Want Higher Wages - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/sanders.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/12/27/sanders-trumps-working-class-supporters-should-back-me-i-want-higher-wages/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sanders: Trump's Working Class Supporters Should Back Me, I Want Higher Wages", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/sanders.jpg", "title": "Sanders: Trump's Working Class Supporters Should Back Me - I Want Higher Wages - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Sanders", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Donald Trump", "published_time": "2015-12-27T13:22:30-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbfbd\"", "article_summary": "And they\u2019re angry because they\u2019re working longer hours for lower wages.\nSo I think for his working-class and middle class supporters, I think we can make the case that if we really want to address the issues that people are concerned about.\nThey\u2019re angry because their jobs have left this country and gone to China or other low-wage countries.\nWhy the middle class is disappearing, massive income and wealth inequality in this country.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
