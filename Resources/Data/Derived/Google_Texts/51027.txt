Incoming University of Montana graduate student Leanne Falcon was recently awarded a $5,000 Native Science Fellowship, which she will use for her research project during spring semester 2016.

Falcon, a member of the Blackfeet Tribe, graduated from UM with a bachelor’s degree in biology. After earning her undergraduate degree she worked as a project coordinator for the Glacier-Two Medicine Alliance, where she contributed to the conservation of the Badger-Two Medicine Area—a sacred area to the Blackfeet people.

At UM, Falcon will work with environmental studies Assistant Professor Rosalyn LaPier, who will serve as her thesis adviser, to research the intersection between environmental science and traditional ecological knowledge.

As part of her fellowship, she is invited to participate in the spring Native Science Fellows meeting March 3-5 at Montana State University in Bozeman.

The Native Science Fellowship is funded by the National Science Foundation. It has four primary goals: To increase the number of Native American students engaged in community-based geosciences education and careers; to provide role models and work experience for Native American high school and college students interested in the geosciences; to develop a career ladder network of Native students who are interested in pursuing geosciences careers; and to build a network of community-based science professionals who are committed to the success of Native students and provide ongoing support for personal, academic and professional success.
