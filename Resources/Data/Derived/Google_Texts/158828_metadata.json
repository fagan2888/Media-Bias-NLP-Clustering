(AP Photo/Jossy Ola)\n\nABUJA, Nigeria (AP) \u2014 Strapped with a booby-trapped vest and sent by the extremist Boko Haram group to kill as many people as possible, the young teenage girl tore off the explosives and fled as soon as she was out of sight of her handlers.\n\nHer two companions, however, completed their grisly mission and walked into a crowd of hundreds at Dikwa refugee camp in northeast Nigeria and blew themselves up, killing 58 people.\n\nLater found by local self-defense forces, the girl\u2019s tearful account is one of the first indications that at least some of the child bombers used by Boko Haram are aware that they are about to die and kill others.\n\n\u201cShe said she was scared because she knew she would kill people. But she was also frightened of going against the instructions of the men who brought her to the camp,\u201d said Modu Awami, a self-defense fighter who helped question the girl.\n\nHer story was corroborated when she led soldiers to the unexploded vest, Awami said Thursday, speaking by phone from the refugee camp, which holds 50,000 people who have fled Boko Haram\u2019s Islamic uprising.\n\nThe girl is in custody and has given officials information about other planned bombings that has helped them increase security at the camp, said Satomi Ahmed, chairman of the Borno State Emergency Management Agency.\n\nThe United States on Thursday strongly condemned the bombings. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the U.S. remains committed to assisting those afflicted by the conflict and supports efforts to provide greater protection for civilians and the regional fight against terrorism.\n\nBoko Haram\u2019s 6-year-old Islamic insurgency has killed 20,000 people, made 2.5 million homeless and spread across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\nAwami said he had no information about how the girl came to be with Boko Haram. The extremists have kidnapped thousands of people and there are fears they are turning some captives into weapons. An army bomb disposal expert has told AP that some suicide bombs are detonated remotely, so the carriers may not have control over when the bomb goes off.\n\nEven two days later, it\u2019s difficult to say exactly how many people died at Dikwa because there were corpses and body parts everywhere, including in the cooking pots, Awami said.\n\n\u201cWomen, children, men and aged persons all died,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot say the exact number as some cannot be counted because the bodies were all mangled.\u201d\n\nThe latest atrocity blamed on Boko Haram extremists was committed against people who had been driven from the homes by the insurgents and had spent a year across the border in Cameroon.\n\nThey had only returned to Nigeria in January when soldiers declared the area safe. The scene of the killings is 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the border with Cameroon and 85 kilometers (53 miles) northeast of Maiduguri, the biggest city in the northeast and birthplace of Boko Haram.\n\nSuch attacks make it difficult for the government to persuade people to return home. The extremists have also razed homes and businesses, destroyed wells and boreholes and stolen livestock and seed grains that farmers need to start their life again.\n\nWritten by Haruna Umar\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/02/11/nigerian-girl-tears-off-suicide-vest-strapped-on-by-boko-haram/", "article_author_name": "Associated Press", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Nigeria-Attack_Bunk.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "abductions, africa, atrocities, boko haram, genocide, Islamic State, Muslim extremists, Nigeria, slavery, suicide vest, terrorism, terrorists, War crimes"}, "description": "Strapped with a booby-trapped vest and sent by the extremist Boko Haram group to kill as many people as possible, the young teenage girl tore off the explosives", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Nigeria-Attack_Bunk.jpg"}, "keywords": "nigeria,suicide vest,boko haram,abductions,africa,atrocities,genocide,islamic state,muslim extremists,slavery,terrorism,terrorists,war crimes", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Nigerian girl tears off suicide vest strapped on by Boko HaramPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/02/11/nigerian-girl-tears-off-suicide-vest-strapped-on-by-boko-haram/Rescue workers transport a victim of a suicide bomb attack at a refugee camp in Nigeria Wednesday.\nAwami said he had no information about how the girl came to be with Boko Haram.\nHer two companions, however, completed their grisly mission and walked into a crowd of hundreds at Dikwa refugee camp in northeast Nigeria and blew themselves up, killing 58 people.\nThe scene of the killings is 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the border with Cameroon and 85 kilometers (53 miles) northeast of Maiduguri, the biggest city in the northeast and birthplace of Boko Haram.\nHer story was corroborated when she led soldiers to the unexploded vest, Awami said Thursday, speaking by phone from the refugee camp, which holds 50,000 people who have fled Boko Haram\u2019s Islamic uprising."}
