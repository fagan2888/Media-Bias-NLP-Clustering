Eid celebrations break the fast, and begin the 10th month on the Islamic lunar calendar at the sight of the new moon.\n\nAmerican Muslims, along with Muslims in several other countries, will recognize this holiday Friday because of astronomical estimates from the Fiqh Council of North America that predict when the new moon will be visible.\n\nOn Eid, or the Feast of Breaking the Fast, Muslims pray early in the morning, exchange gifts and celebrate and eat with family throughout the day. The joyous celebration lasts three days.\n\nPresident Obama brings attention to Ramadan each year with an annual Iftar dinner \u2014 the evening meal after sunset that concludes fasting for each day \u2014 at the White House. In June, Obama invited members of the White House staff, elected officials and young leaders and women in the Muslim community to celebrate.\n\nObama, in a statement on Friday (July 17), sent \u201cwarmest wishes to Muslims in the United States and around the world\u201d for the holiday, which he said, \u201cmarks a new beginning for each individual \u2014 a reason to celebrate and express gratitude.\u201d\n\nFor some American Muslims, the joyous day may be hard to celebrate. Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told USA TODAY anti-Muslim hate crimes across the U.S. make it difficult to relax and enjoy the holiday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with this almost on a daily basis,\u201d Hooper said. \u201cWe hope that the larger society supports the ending of these crimes.\u201d\n\nHooper cited an incident in New York on Tuesday, where the New York Police Department said a man punched a woman and yelled anti-Muslim sentiments at her. The 19-year-old woman suffered a fractured jaw from the incident.\n\n\u201cThese are the kinds of things that will be at the back of your mind,\u201d Hooper said.\n\nKamal Nawash, founder of the Free Muslims Coalition, an organization that aims to denounce misconceptions and stereotypes about the Muslim community, said he believes anti-Muslim hate crimes happen predominately to Muslims who wear certain apparel that reflects their culture \u2014 especially on religious occasions.\n\n\u201cSome people who feel that it is necessary to dress in a way to reflect the culture that they came from may get certain looks that make them feel uncomfortable,\u201d Nawash said.\n\nBecause of his apparel choices, he said he does not feel discriminated against while celebrating religious holidays \u2014 in fact, he said many Americans embrace Muslims and aspire to learn more about Muslim religious traditions.\n\nHe said he often wears a suit, and his wife chooses not wear hijab or a head scarf.\n\n\u201cThe last thing that comes to our mind is any bias towards Muslims,\u201d Nawash said. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t cross our minds.\u201d\n\nNawash and his family will celebrate Eid tomorrow with presents and a trip to a park in Williamsburg, Virginia.\n\nHe compared the celebration to how Christians celebrate Christmas: with many presents, and a host of family time.\n\n\u201cWe want the kids to feel that this is their holiday, because you don\u2019t necessarily see lights or anything out there like you do on Christmas,\u201d Nawash said.\n\nLM END CALFAS", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Culture, Eid al-Fitr, islam, Ramadan", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "Eid celebrations break the Ramadan fast, and begin the 10th month on the Islamic lunar calendar at the sight of the new moon.", "title": "Muslims wrap up Ramadan fast with Eid al-Fitr feasting", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/07/17/muslims-wrap-up-ramadan-fast-with-eid-al-fitr-feasting-friday/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/thumbRNSEIDSCHOOLS021813.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/07/17/muslims-wrap-up-ramadan-fast-with-eid-al-fitr-feasting-friday/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/07/17/muslims-wrap-up-ramadan-fast-with-eid-al-fitr-feasting-friday/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Eid celebrations break the Ramadan fast, and begin the 10th month on the Islamic lunar calendar at the sight of the new moon."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe last thing that comes to our mind is any bias towards Muslims,\u201d Nawash said.\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t cross our minds.\u201dNawash and his family will celebrate Eid tomorrow with presents and a trip to a park in Williamsburg, Virginia.\nOn Eid, or the Feast of Breaking the Fast, Muslims pray early in the morning, exchange gifts and celebrate and eat with family throughout the day.\nEid celebrations break the fast, and begin the 10th month on the Islamic lunar calendar at the sight of the new moon.\nSince June 17, Muslims marking Ramadan observed the holy month of fasting in the Islamic calendar."}
