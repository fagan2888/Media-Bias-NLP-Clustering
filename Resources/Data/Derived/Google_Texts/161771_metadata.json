The fund spells out the reality in technocratic detail in its latest World Economic Outlook.\n\nRelated: IMF Cuts Global Growth Forecast, Warns of Stagnation Risk\n\nProductivity growth is slower, populations are aging, China has transition challenges, oil producers are hurting, and Britain and Greece are creating problems in Europe. All of these weigh on global economic growth. Add to the list ISIS and the growing threat of global terrorism, and you have, well, a situation.\n\nThese are symptoms, but the disease is different. Growth is sluggish almost everywhere because consumers aren\u2019t spending and businesses, logically enough, aren\u2019t investing in new capacity. It\u2019s all (or mostly) about demand.\n\nWhile following the proceedings at the I.M.F. last week, I asked a friend who trades on eBay how business was. \u201cYou can\u2019t sell anything unless you let it go for less than it\u2019s worth,\u201d he replied. \u201cNobody\u2019s buying. Nobody knows what\u2019s next. It\u2019s something in the economy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the anatomy of what ails the American economy and most of the world\u2019s, too. And to suggest the sluggish growth rates we now have will prevail in the near future is almost as grim as the danger of another recession.\n\nRelated: Time for Fiscal Help as Global Economy Loses Momentum\n\nPost-recession stress disorder is complicated in the U.S. by other factors that are evident in this year\u2019s presidential contests. The young people supporting socialist Bernie Sanders know what it\u2019s like to graduate from college with huge college loans to pay off and often-limited job prospects. That\u2019s a generation of 78 million millennials \u2013 many of whom have the high savings rates.\n\nOn the other end of the demographic curve are the 80 million baby boomers, who are facing retirement with not nearly enough money saved to sustain them during that period. Add the millions of \u2018angry men\u2019 who no longer have manufacturing jobs and the millions of low-income minority families and you have less consumer spending.\n\nThe uncertainty factor is less easily measured but just as consequential. Blanchard calls it \u201chysteresis,\u201d which works coming and going. Recessions leave anxiety in their wake, he argues, and the prospect of another one compounds it. Blanchard\u2019s worrying thought is that slow growth is the predictable outcome of recessions.\n\n\u201cWhen companies realize that sales prospects are worse than they thought, they cut down on investment,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd consumers, realizing that their income prospects have worsened, cut on consumption.\u201d\n\nRelated: U.S. Treasury's Lew Says No One-Size-Fits-All Approach to Growth\n\nPolicy makers are now facing this reality\u2014that\u2019s the good news. They\u2019re at an impasse, and their conundrum\u2014what do we do to spur growth?\u2014bears out the argument that weak demand is the core problem.\n\nInterest rates have been at historic lows for years; a quarter of the global economy now operates with negative interest rates. Borrowing simply can\u2019t get any cheaper because depositors pay banks to hold their savings.\n\nThe conclusion is plain. If you can\u2019t get consumers to spend and businesses to expand when you\u2019re more or less giving money away, interest rates aren\u2019t hitting the demand problem squarely.\n\n\u201cIt remains imperative,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said at the I.M.F. gathering, \u201cthat countries around the world deploy a full toolkit of economic policy measures\u2014monetary, fiscal, and structural\u2014to address weak demand, boost employment, and raise standards of living, as monetary policy alone cannot achieve balanced growth.\u201d\n\nExactly. Now, what\u2019s in the toolkit?\n\nRelated: Not Even Hillary, Bernie or Donald Can Bring Back These Jobs\n\nOne way or another we\u2019re talking about stimulus, and there are two ways at it. You can lower taxes or you can increase public-sector spending. Both can be effective, but the choice depends on prevailing circumstances.\n\nThe case is now very strong to de-emphasize tax cutting and stress public-works spending. Four reasons:\n\n\u2022 Policy-directed spending can be targeted and is swifter in its effects.\n\n\u2022 Income inequality is part of the problem; risking more of it is unwise.\n\n\u2022 Public-works spending answers needs. Lower taxes aren\u2019t going to push money at the two roads out of three that are in bad repair across the U.S.\n\n\u2022 Governments can borrow as cheaply as businesses at the moment, and borrowing for the right reason\u2014investing in America\u2019s infrastructure\u2014is win-win for taxpayers, job seekers, and investors.\n\nBusiness has things to do, too. Stagnant wages and \u201cflexible employment\u201d plainly yield short-term advantages, but it\u2019s time to restore the spending power and security employees need to be consumers, too.\n\nThe I.M.F. appears to support this case when it calls for a combination of reduced austerity, low rates and policies to increase employment and productivity. The only argument against this strategy is ideological, and the time for these is over.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The big question at the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual gabfest last week was why", "title": "The Biggest Cause of the Next Recession?
