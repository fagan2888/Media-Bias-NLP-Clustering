But it\u2019s bad news for modest- to moderate-income customers buying coverage in some Ambetter markets like Miami, Atlanta and Jackson, Miss., which will face the highest after-subsidy premiums in the country in 2016.\n\nMany Bronze Premiums Spike\n\nThe cheapest bronze plan available in 2016 in those three cities will cost about $2,220, or $185 a month, for 27-year-olds earning about $30,000, just over 250% of the poverty level. That\u2019s 21% more than the average $152-per-month cost of the cheapest bronze plan found by IBD in a review of the largest market in each of the 37 states using HealthCare.gov.\n\nPaying the individual mandate penalty of $695 \u2014 less than one-third of the cost of the cheapest, $6,800-deductible bronze plan in those Centene-Ambetter markets \u2014 may look like the best option.\n\nAlthough ObamaCare is already struggling to attract relatively young and healthy customers, and Centene\u2019s pricing strategy will make it even harder to do so, HHS said it has no plans to add new restrictions to the type of policies an insurer can offer.\n\nWhile the Obama administration plans to create a standard silver plan that will have a $3,500 deductible, and it will aim to highlight that option for customers, that won\u2019t do anything to address the real threat: smaller subsidies.\n\nSilver Deductibles Deduct From Subsidies\n\nThat\u2019s because the size of exchange subsidies depends on the price of the second-cheapest silver plan in each market. Largely because two Ambetter plans are priced so low in its markets \u2014 with a $6,500 deductible for the cheapest silver plan and a $5,500 deductible for the second-lowest-cost plan \u2014 the subsidy available to 27-year-olds earning about $30,000 in Jackson will fall from $757 in 2015 to $439 in 2016.\n\nThe pricing shift in Jackson has been especially dramatic. In 2015, the second-lowest-cost silver plan cost 35% more than the cheapest bronze, but the gap has narrowed to just 13% in 2016.\n\nOne key reason is that Ambetter\u2019s cheapest silver plans cover only about 68% of eligible expenses of the insured group, not too far above the typical 60% covered by bronze plans. The standardized silver-plan option HHS envisions would cover 71% of group costs.\n\nCentene also may be pricing in somewhat smaller bills among customers attracted by its lower-premium, high-deductible plans. Customers who choose Ambetter\u2019s $6,500 deductible plan in Indianapolis will get limited benefits before the deductible is met, such as primary-care visits at a cost of $30, specialist visits for $60 and generic drugs for $15, along with free preventative care such as vaccines. But big-ticket items like diagnostic testing, MRIs, specialty drugs, emergency-room visits and surgical procedures aren\u2019t covered until after a patient racks up $6,500 in in-network bills.\n\nSilver plans are the most common exchange selection because customers with incomes up to 250% of the poverty level are eligible for extra subsidies that lower out-of-pocket costs.\n\nEven with these extra cost-sharing subsidies, people earning from 201% to 250% of the poverty level would face a $4,500 deductible under the cheapest Ambetter silver plan.\n\nAfter its $6.8 billion merger with HealthNet (HNT), Centene will have about 500,000 individual market customers in 14 markets.\n\nMedicaid Insurers Expand In Exchanges\n\nAlong with Centene, Molina HealthCare (MOH), CareSource and other Medicaid managed care specialists have been among the most aggressive exchange competitors in terms of pricing. This group \u2014 not the start-up ObamaCare co-ops that are dropping like flies \u2014 looks likes the real threat to a profitable ObamaCare exchange presence for the biggest insurers, including UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM).\n\nLast week, UnitedHealth shook up the entire sector with its warning that it may abandon the exchanges in 2017 if it keeps bleeding red ink in the coming year.\n\nIf it wanted to, the Obama administration could modify regulations to require silver plans to cover at least 70% of group costs, though it may be leery of taking steps that will lead to bigger premium hikes (before subsidies) in 2017, particularly since those will become evident by the time voters go to the polls in 2016.\n\nHHS also detailed key ObamaCare parameters for 2017 on Friday, including a maximum $7,150 bronze-plan deductible.\n\nFollow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Department of Health and Human Services on Friday gave a green light to an aggressive new ObamaCare exchange pricing strategy that relies on huge silver", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services on Friday gave a green light to an aggressive new ObamaCare exchange pricing strategy that relies on huge silver-plan deductibles and results in smaller \u2026", "title": "HHS OKs 2017 Silver-Plan Deductibles of $6,500-Plus", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/policy-analysis/hhs-oks-huge-silver-obamacare-deductibles/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2015-11-23 10:06:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-23T10:06:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Department of Health and Human Services on Friday gave a green light to an aggressive new ObamaCare exchange pricing strategy that relies on huge silver-plan deductibles and results in smaller government subsidies.\nSilver Deductibles Deduct From SubsidiesThat\u2019s because the size of exchange subsidies depends on the price of the second-cheapest silver plan in each market.\nThat\u2019s 21% more than the average $152-per-month cost of the cheapest bronze plan found by IBD in a review of the largest market in each of the 37 states using HealthCare.gov.\nIn 2015, the second-lowest-cost silver plan cost 35% more than the cheapest bronze, but the gap has narrowed to just 13% in 2016.\nMany Bronze Premiums SpikeThe cheapest bronze plan available in 2016 in those three cities will cost about $2,220, or $185 a month, for 27-year-olds earning about $30,000, just over 250% of the poverty level."}
