The committee includes BancorpSouth CEO Dan Rollins, Renasant CEO Robin McGraw and Dr. Dick White of the North Mississippi Medical Center, each of whom helped contribute $100,000 from their respective organizations. Former mayor Jack Reed Jr. also announced the city of Tupelo had pledged $500,000, taking the Army\u2019s total to more than $1,754,000.\n\n\u201cThis is why we\u2019re a community,\u201d White said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to give hope for the future to one person at a time. That\u2019s what we\u2019re called to do.\u201d\n\nThe expansion to the lodge will afford five family rooms, of which there currently are none, and raise the capacity for women up to 17 from seven, and the men to 23 from 10. Daniel said the need for lodge space only increased over the summer, and he expects it to intensify as the days get colder.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been housing an additional 10 to 15 in the gym, and with our current space, we turn away three to four families a week and about 10 to 15 individuals,\u201d Daniel said.\n\nThe effort will also go toward the revitalization of the Army\u2019s current space, including a playground for children.\n\n\u201cThis will be the booster shot the community needs to take it where it needs to be,\u201d Reed said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put something other than a Band-Aid on this facility from 1982. We\u2019re lucky to be able to give to the Salvation Army and increase their capacity to do their work.\u201d\n\nDaniel said the lodge expansion is one of several steps to solidify a bridge to independence for the area\u2019s needy. When Daniel and his wife came to the major post last summer, one of their first projects was initiating a budgeting class for lodge members. Earlier this month, the CREATE Foundation awarded the Army with a $50,000 grant to go toward transitional housing. A cluster of apartments on Green Tee Road will serve as a sort of halfway house as lodge residents work, save money and learn basic budgeting and life skills.\n\n\u201cThe image people have of homelessness most of the time isn\u2019t usually how it looks here. Lots of our clients sleep in their car, or bounce around between friends and relatives, staying a day or two here, a day or two there,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cSome of them have problems, like illiteracy, but usually they just don\u2019t have the ordinary skills to be successful. This is a big step to eliminating some of those road blocks to that success.\u201d\n\nriley.manning@journalinc.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Riley Manning Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 It\u2019s a good day for The Salvation Army.
