Dr. Lance Liotta Laboratory, Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn four decades, the long-term survival rate of pancreatic cancer has not improved.\n\nWith the highest mortality rate of all major cancers, 94 percent of pancreatic cancer patients die within five years of diagnosis. Additionally, 74 percent of patients die within the first year, according to Hirshberg Foundation For Pancreatic Cancer Research. These numbers are only a fraction lower than the statistics in the early 1970s.\n\nCancer Research UK is taking strides toward improving research, with a plan to more than double its $8 million annual research spending on pancreas cancer within five years. One of the largest setbacks of the cancer is that most cases go undetected until it\u2019s too late for surgery. There are no detection tools to diagnose the disease in its early stages when surgical removal of the tumor is still possible. Once detected, treatment options for pancreatic cancer are limited. Surgical removal of the tumor is possible in less than 20 percent of patients diagnosed.\n\nProfessor Andrew Biankin is a scientist contributing to pancreatic cancer research at Cancer Research UK\u2019s Beatson Institute. In a press release, he said:\n\n(...) We\u2019ve been waiting too long for new drugs to treat the disease and there are very few options available for people with advanced forms of the disease. It\u2019s a situation that simply has to change and we can only do that by funding more high quality research and trials, to get treatments out of the lab and into patients as soon as possible.\n\nProfessor Biankin is leading a team of researchers studying the pattern of faults in tumor samples of 400 pancreatic cancer patients. They\u2019re also trying to identify molecules that could be used as early warning signs. Signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer often don\u2019t occur until the disease is advanced. Some of these symptoms may include jaundice, loss of appetite, weight loss, depression, and blood clots.\n\nHarpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK\u2019s chief executive, said:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pancreatic cancer, pancreatic cancer mortality rates", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After four decades of research, the survival rates of patients with pancreatic cancer are at a standstill.", "title": "Pancreatic Cancer Is Just As Deadly As It Was 40 Years Ago", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pancreatic-cancer-still-deadliest-74-patients-dying-within-first-year-diagnosis-297030", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/07/pancreatic-cancer-cells.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After four decades of research, the survival rates of patients with pancreatic cancer are at a standstill.", "title": "Pancreatic Cancer Is Just As Deadly As It Was 40 Years Ago", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pancreatic-cancer-still-deadliest-74-patients-dying-within-first-year-diagnosis-297030", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/07/pancreatic-cancer-cells.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/07/pancreatic-cancer-cells.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-07T12:09:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-07T15:11:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "After four decades of research, the survival rates of patients with pancreatic cancer are at a standstill."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc964a\"", "article_summary": "Professor Andrew Biankin is a scientist contributing to pancreatic cancer research at Cancer Research UK\u2019s Beatson Institute.\nWith the highest mortality rate of all major cancers, 94 percent of pancreatic cancer patients die within five years of diagnosis.\nAdditionally, 74 percent of patients die within the first year, according to Hirshberg Foundation For Pancreatic Cancer Research.\nDr. Lance Liotta Laboratory, Wikimedia CommonsIn four decades, the long-term survival rate of pancreatic cancer has not improved.\nProfessor Biankin is leading a team of researchers studying the pattern of faults in tumor samples of 400 pancreatic cancer patients."}
