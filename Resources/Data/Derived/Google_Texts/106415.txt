After parking his 2003 Chevrolet Cavalier for the day on Portland’s Exchange Street, Adam Sousa, 28, of Portland returned on Sunday afternoon to find the car destroyed by massive blocks of ice.

The video and pictures were taken by Sousa’s friend, Angela Drinkwater of South Portland:



The ice fell from the rooftop of a building owned by notorious Portland landlord Joe Soley. The building sits at the corner of Exchange and Fore Streets, and houses a convenience store, a psychic reader, apartments, and Bull Feeney’s, which is a popular Irish-style tavern.

“Those icebergs went through my windshield,” said Sousa, “they could easily have killed someone, including me if I had been sitting in the car.”

By Sunday night Portland police had the sidewalk in front of the building roped off.

Portland police Lt. Gary Hutcheson said that the incident was “an act of nature,” and that Soley will not be cited.

“Things have been warming up and ice is falling,” Hutcheson said, “it’s a public safety issue, but there is nothing we can do about it.”
