They also make the use of third-party software contractors cumbersome, Porth said\n\n\"In Silicon Valley, companies can make use of cloud computing to gain access to outside know-how,\" he said.\n\n\"The consequence is that we do not set up many of these activities in Germany, but in India or the United States. This is the only possibility to take advantage of these opportunities.\"\n\nDaimler has around 3,000 research and development and information technology staff working in Bangalore, India, and around 200 staff in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nBangalore is now its main digital engineering hub, where staff work on projects including digital design, crash test simulation and other calculations.\n\nFor such jobs to come to Germany as the company looks to expand its software and technology capabilities, union and legal rules need to become more flexible, Porth said.\n\n\"We do not want to cut back worker protection, but we need to leave people the freedom to decide what hours they work,\" he said, adding office jobs - as opposed to those on the production line - require more flexible and mobile working conditions.\n\n\"Extremely strenuous physical labor, which requires rigid rules - we don't have that to the same extent as we used to.\"\n\n(Reporting by Edward Taylor and Ilona Wissenbach; Editing by Mark Potter)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German labor rules may force Daimler, the 130-year-old inventor", "title": "Daimler says German labor rules may push new tech jobs abroad", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/15/Daimler-says-German-labor-rules-may-push-new-tech-jobs-abroad", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/daimler-outlook_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/15/Daimler-says-German-labor-rules-may-push-new-tech-jobs-abroad", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/daimler-outlook_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German labor rules may force Daimler, the 130-year-old inventor", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Under German labor rules, Daimler is forced to limit the number of daily working hours to 10 and provide an 11 hour break before an employee starts the next shift.\nDaimler has around 3,000 research and development and information technology staff working in Bangalore, India, and around 200 staff in Sunnyvale, California.\n\"We are reaching a situation where the mix between trade union and legal rules make flexible working more difficult.\"\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - German labor rules may force Daimler, the 130-year-old inventor of the motor car, to create more software and technology jobs abroad as it strives to develop a new generation of driverless vehicles, a senior official told Reuters.\n\"Extremely strenuous physical labor, which requires rigid rules - we don't have that to the same extent as we used to.\""}
