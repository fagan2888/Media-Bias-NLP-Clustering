The 5-4 decision was in favor of Hobby Lobby, a company run on Christian principles, and determined that requiring the owners to pay for something contrary to their religious beliefs violated their religious freedom.\n\nSteven Sullivan, co-founder and owner of Berkeley-based bakery Acme Bread Company, said the decision will likely not affect his business but raised concerns about the concept of corporate personhood, under which a corporation has the same legal status as an individual.\n\n\u201cWhile I don\u2019t think this decision will have a major impact in California, I believe that corporations should be separate from the people who run them,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nKenneth Bamberger, a professor at UC Berkeley School of Law, said the ruling set a dangerous precedent under which corporations might find loopholes to bypass regulations by claiming to have religious beliefs that deny the fundamental rights of employees.\n\n\u201cThe decision goes to suggest that a corporation could claim they don\u2019t believe in medical intervention and deny medical care to employees,\u201d Bamberger said. \u201cCorporations might say they aren\u2019t going to follow the health care and equality laws that oppose their religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nBut Claire Chiara, president of the Berkeley College Republicans and former staff writer for The Daily Californian, said the Supreme Court has strict guidelines for the types of businesses to which the ruling applies.\n\nAfter the ruling, women\u2019s rights activists also condemned the decision as a severe violation of women\u2019s freedom. Adopting the slogan #jointhedissent, Mon-Shane Chou, president of Cal Berkeley Democrats, supported Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s inflammatory disapproval, which she expressed in a 35-page response that she wrote reacting to the decision.\n\n\u201cThis is another chip away at women\u2019s \u2026 and individual rights, our own health and the relationship between our own bodies and our religion,\u201d Chou said.\n\nAlthough the Hobby Lobby case only focused on contraception, it sets a precedent for future cases that may involve other medical treatment, including vaccinations and blood transfusions, Chou said.\n\nChiara argued that no one is losing access to birth control, a major point of controversy regarding the decision.\n\n\u201cThe ruling is in no way infringing on anyone\u2019s reproductive right,\u201d Chiara said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t outlaw the types of birth control in question, it simply removed the actual requirement for businesses to pay for any type of birth control.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, Chiara said, many companies with religious beliefs were required to cover birth control methods, such as Plan B, or the \u201cmorning-after\u201d pill, and intrauterine devices, that they might view as akin to abortion.\n\nBamberger said it\u2019s too early to determine the impact of the ruling or how it will affect business regulation, and he speculated that companies may exploit the vague boundaries set by the decision.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court decision set a precedent going forward that is very hard to assure in language,\u201d Bamberger said. \u201cIt is too blurry whether a business should be treated as a corporation or an extension of the family.\u201d\n\nContact Sarah Rockwood at [email protected] and follow her on Twitter @srockwood44.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Californian", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling Monday allowing family-owned corporations to opt out of a health coverage requirement on religious grounds generated a range of perspectives in the Berkeley community.Read More\u2026", "title": "Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby ruling elicits range of Berkeley reactions | The Daily Californian", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.dailycal.org/assets/uploads/2014/04/fbimage1410x738.png", "updated_time": "2014-07-02T20:21:18-07:00", "url": "http://www.dailycal.org/2014/07/02/supreme-court-sets-new-precedent-hobby-lobby-case/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailycal", "section": "Campus", "tag": "women's rights", "published_time": "2014-07-02T01:03:06-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-02T20:21:18-07:00"}, "fb": {"admins": 877855486}, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling Monday allowing family-owned corporations to opt out of a health coverage requirement on religious grounds generated a range of perspectives in the Berkeley community.Read More\u2026", "title": "Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby ruling elicits range of Berkeley reactions | The Daily Californian", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.dailycal.org/assets/uploads/2014/04/fbimage1410x738.png", "creator": "@dailycal", "site": "@dailycal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0020\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe Supreme Court decision set a precedent going forward that is very hard to assure in language,\u201d Bamberger said.\nA U.S. Supreme Court ruling Monday allowing family-owned corporations to opt out of a health care coverage requirement on religious grounds generated a range of perspectives in the Berkeley community.\nAfter the ruling, women\u2019s rights activists also condemned the decision as a severe violation of women\u2019s freedom.\nChiara argued that no one is losing access to birth control, a major point of controversy regarding the decision.\nThe 5-4 decision was in favor of Hobby Lobby, a company run on Christian principles, and determined that requiring the owners to pay for something contrary to their religious beliefs violated their religious freedom."}
