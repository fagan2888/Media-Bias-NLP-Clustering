And if Salt Lake City signs up the highest percentage of your neighbors who aren't covered this year, I'll come visit to tell the whole country about all of your success.\n\nSo maybe you're a local official, a pastor or a sports hero who can spread the word. Maybe you've got a cousin or an uncle who's been uninsured for far too long. Or maybe you're between jobs and don't think that affordable coverage is an option for you. No matter who you are, everybody can get covered or help their neighbors do so.\n\nYou can start by telling folks about how affordable this coverage can be. In Utah, nearly 8 in 10 people can get covered for $75 or less a month. For a lot of folks, that's less than their cell phone or cable bill. And last year, consumers in Utah saved an average of $209 a month thanks to tax credits for Marketplace coverage.\n\nYou can tell folks how easy it is to sign up. Getting covered used to mean filling out endless pages of forms \u2013 and sometimes even a medical exam. But today, HealthCare.gov makes the process fast and simple \u2013 you can shop around, compare plans, and choose the one that works for you and your family.\n\nYou can tell folks that insurance companies can no longer deny coverage because of a preexisting condition \u2013 and that preventive care like checkups and mammograms are now covered for free.\n\nAnd most importantly, you should tell folks to go to HealthCare.gov or CuidadoDeSalud.gov to sign up. Or they can call 1-800-318-2596 for confidential assistance 24/7 \u2014 help is available in more than 200 languages. And in many cities, local events or assistance are available to help guide you and your neighbors through the process.\n\nOpen enrollment is already underway, and if you sign up by Dec. 15, you'll have coverage on New Year's Day. But no matter what, you should sign up by Jan. 31 to get coverage next year.\n\nSo I hope everyone in Salt Lake City will get their families and their neighbors involved. That's what the Healthy Communities Challenge is all about \u2014 working together, block by block, community by community, to help each other and this country get ahead. So good luck \u2013 maybe I'll see you in Salt Lake City next year.\n\nBarack Obama is president of the United States.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today, more Americans have health insurance than ever before \u2014 under the Affordable Care Act, more than 17.6 million people have gained coverage, uninsured rates have plummeted, and millions more families have the security of ...", "copyright": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "author": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "title": "Op-ed: Now's the time for more Utahns to get health care coverage", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.sltrib.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=UU4VjkXpR27cKH5DC3ek_c$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtAlK3aUWJRo$88Ua_jDhDkWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "url": "http://www.sltrib.com/opinion/3146708-155/op-ed-nows-the-time-for-more", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "tag": "Barack,Care,Communities,Coverage,Covered,Folks,Health,Lake,Maybe,Salt,Barack Obama"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Today, more Americans have health insurance than ever before \u2014 under the Affordable Care Act, more than 17.6 million people have gained coverage, uninsured rates have plummeted, and millions more families have the security of ...", "title": "Op-ed: Now's the time for more Utahns to get health care coverage", "url": "http://www.sltrib.com/opinion/3146708-155/op-ed-nows-the-time-for-more", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "SL Tribune", "iphone": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "googleplay": "The Salt Lake Tribune"}, "id": {"ipad": "id434734447", "iphone": "id396990949", "googleplay": "com.sltrib.news"}}, "site": "@sltrib", "image": "http://www.sltrib.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=UU4VjkXpR27cKH5DC3ek_c$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtAlK3aUWJRo$88Ua_jDhDkWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow", "GOOGLEBOT": "index,follow", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/saltlaketribune"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Barack,Care,Communities,Coverage,Covered,Folks,Health,Lake,Maybe,Salt,Barack Obama"}, "article_summary": "So I have a challenge for you, Salt Lake City.\nAnd most importantly, you should tell folks to go to HealthCare.gov or CuidadoDeSalud.gov to sign up.\nSo good luck \u2013 maybe I'll see you in Salt Lake City next year.\nSo I hope everyone in Salt Lake City will get their families and their neighbors involved.\nYou can tell folks that insurance companies can no longer deny coverage because of a preexisting condition \u2013 and that preventive care like checkups and mammograms are now covered for free."}
