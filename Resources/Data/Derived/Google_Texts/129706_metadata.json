(Photo: FILE)Buy Photo Story Highlights Police on Friday conducted a surprise K-9 sweep of Ridge High School.\n\nOne student was arrested on drug charges.\n\nAn 18-year-old Ridge High School student was arrested on drug charges Friday morning after a surprise K-9 sweep of lockers and student cars.\n\nPolice said they found under 50 grams of marijuana and prescription pills in the car belonging to the student, who police did not name. Police said they found the drugs after obtaining a search warrant for the car.\n\nThe small amount of marijuana was enough only to warrant a minor disorderly persons charge, but the pills could be treated as an indictable offense.\n\nNo other drugs were uncovered.\n\nThe sweep was the first of its kind in the township, where several years ago a high-school student and her brother were charged with dealing drugs out of their home. Investigators reportedly identified about 100 customers from the region.\n\n\u201cI think that we have no more and no less the amount of drugs that any other similar school of similar demographics has,\u201d Bernards Police Chief Brian Bobowicz said Friday afternoon.\n\nThe unannounced sweep was done by request of the school district, which did not return a call for comment Friday.\n\nThe search used four K-9 dogs belonging to the Somerset County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the Morris County Sherriff\u2019s Office, the Warren Township Police Department and the State Police.\n\nAfter school administrators placed the building into a \u201cshelter in place\u201d mode, the K-9 teams sniffed through hallway lockers, a large study hall and the student parking lot.\n\nThe sweep did not include cars belonging to teachers or school employees.\n\n\u201cThe focus was on student use and that was what was approved by the Prosecutor\u2019s Office,\u201d Bobowicz said.\n\nIn a joint statement with police, school officials said Friday that the sweep was \u201ca measure to ensure that the safety and well-being of our students are preserved.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe objective of this operation was to deter students from bringing controlled dangerous substances to the school and to impress the message of law enforcement and the Board of Education\u2019s stance on zero-tolerance on illegal drugs and drug abuse.\n\n\u201cThe Bernards Township Board of Education will continue to cooperate with local law enforcement and utilize every resource to ensure that Bernards Township remains a drug-free school and deters future contraband.\u201d\n\nSchool officials said representatives from the police department and the Prosecutor\u2019s Office will attend the board\u2019s Feb. 23 public meeting at the William Annin Middle School in order to answer parents\u2019 questions.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1E8UddV", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Ridge High surprise drug sweep leads to student arrest", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Ridge High surprise drug sweep leads to student arrest", "title": "Ridge High surprise drug sweep leads to student arrest", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2015/02/13/ridge-high-surprise-drug-sweep-leads-student-arrest/23373399/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ridge High surprise drug sweep leads to student arrest", "title": "Ridge High surprise drug sweep leads to student arrest", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1aea59928a3849efaf5a68dd978d862aa05f2c21/c=416-0-2083-1667&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Bridgewater/2015/02/13/B9316245877Z.1_20150213165658_000_GH49UVOSA.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/sergio.bichao"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Ridge High School, Ridge High lockdown, K-9 drug sweep"}, "article_summary": "An 18-year-old Ridge High School student was arrested on drug charges Friday morning after a surprise K-9 sweep of lockers and student cars.\n(Photo: FILE)Buy Photo Story Highlights Police on Friday conducted a surprise K-9 sweep of Ridge High School.\nBuy Photo Drug-sniffing dogs went through Ridge High School lockers and the student parking lot.\nThe unannounced sweep was done by request of the school district, which did not return a call for comment Friday.\n\u201cThe focus was on student use and that was what was approved by the Prosecutor\u2019s Office,\u201d Bobowicz said."}
