There are big ones, little ones and even rezzes that border-wise, look a bit like checkerboards. But this is just geography. What else signifies that we as Native people, or anyone for that matter \u2013 is actually on reservation land?\n\nWe are going to be putting out our feelers on this one because we at ICTMN KNOW our readers will have some good ones as far as just ways to tell \u2026 You Know You Are Probably On the Rez When.\n\nSUBMIT YOUR OWN: Have a great way to tell \u2026 You Know You Are Probably On the Rez When?\n\nTweet to correspondent Vincent Schilling at www.twitter.com/VinceSchilling and use the hashtag #OnTheRezWhen. You can also email him at vincentschilling@gmail.com.\n\nWhen you want to date your girlfriend and have to deal with her grandmother, not her dad\n\nYep \u2013 good one Dee Landeis \u2013 you called it right. We also noticed you said girlfriend, which probably means you have been dating your girlfriend for a while and you STILL have to check with her Grannie. And chances are good Grannie may not speak English, so you\u2019d better brush up on your Native language dating questions!\n\nEvery Block has its own Rez Dogs on guard\n\nYes, we all know these areas, filled with unleashed dogs guarding their turf. Just watch out for that ONE rez dog. Cujo is afraid of that Rez Dog. You know which one we\u2019re talking about \u2013 the one that chases and eats bears.\n\nThere are horses in every other yard\n\nOk Robin, good one. And you can also tell the yards that have horses in them \u2013 or goats for that matter. They are the ones that don\u2019t need their grass cut.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indian country itself is a land of rezzes, but how does one tell when they are on the rez?
