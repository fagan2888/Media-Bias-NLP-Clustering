Other schools who recruited Stringari were: Florida, USC, UCLA, North Carolina and Nebraska, among many others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It hasn't hit me yet, I don't think,\" Till said after signing her letter and taking pictures with her friends and family who gathered at CCHS to watch the moment Nov. 12. \"I still don't feel like a senior.\"\n\nTill finished her prep cross country career last month when she took 10th at the Class 4A state meet at Norris Penrose Event Center in Colorado Springs. It was the latest chapter in a distinguished career for the Tigers that saw her take fourth as a freshman, eighth as a sophomore and 52nd as a junior.\n\nThrough it all, she stayed firm in her faith and often said during interviews that whatever God's plan was for her was what she wanted. It was her foundation in God that was a big reason she chose ACU.\n\n\"That was definitely a big factor in this,\" Till said. \"... It's going to be an environment where I'm not going to be in such a liberal place, where it's going to be hard to keep my faith and take a stand in what I believe in.\"\n\nAfter much success at the Division II level, ACU is now on the Division I stage. The school joined the ranks in 2013, according to their website, when they joined the Southland Conference.\n\nBrandon Hopper: 719-276-7644, hopperb@canoncity dailyrecord.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_27207467/no-5-sports-story-2014-prepsters-sign-d1", "modificationDate": "2014-12-28T09:01:43-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1225/20141225__26drTOP10-5w~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Brandon Hopper \n \n  The Daily Record", "description": "The year saw two prep athletes do something so uncommon, that no one's even sure the last time it happened.\n\nOn Nov. 6, Trenton Stringari committed to run track at the University of Colorado, and then Nov. 12, Aubrey Till signed her national letter of intent to run cross country at Abilene Christian University.\n\nHaving two prepsters sign Division I letters of intent is the Daily Record's No. 5-ranked sports story of 2014.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:27207467:view"}, "startDate": "2014-12-25T19:11:47-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_27207467/no-5-sports-story-2014-prepsters-sign-d1", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1225/20141225__26drTOP10-5w~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The year saw two prep athletes do something so uncommon, that no one's even sure the last time it happened.\n\nOn Nov. 6, Trenton Stringari committed to run track at the University of Colorado, and then Nov. 12, Aubrey Till signed her national letter of intent to run cross country at Abilene Christian University.\n\nHaving two prepsters sign Division I letters of intent is the Daily Record's No. 5-ranked sports story of 2014.", "title": "No. 5 sports story of 2014: Prepsters sign with D1 schools"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "The year saw two prep athletes do something so uncommon, that no one's even sure the last time it happened.\n\nOn Nov. 6, Trenton Stringari committed to run track at the University of Colorado, and then Nov. 12, Aubrey Till signed her national letter of intent to run cross country at Abilene Christian University.\n\nHaving two prepsters sign Division I letters of intent is the Daily Record's No. 5-ranked sports story of 2014.", "title": "No. 5 sports story of 2014: Prepsters sign with D1 schools", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_27207467/no-5-sports-story-2014-prepsters-sign-d1", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1225/20141225__26drTOP10-5w~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-25T19:11:47-0700", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2024-12-25T19:08:32-0700", "sailthru.title": "No. 5 sports story of 2014: Prepsters sign with D1 schools", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Brandon HopperThe", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1225/20141225__26drTOP10-5w~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-12-25T19:14:17-0700", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb289\"", "article_summary": "5: Stringari, Till ink D1 scholarships No.\nHaving two prepsters sign Division I letters of intent is the Daily Record's No.\nStringari had narrowed his options to three schools: CU, University of Iowa, and University of Mississippi.\nOther schools who recruited Stringari were: Florida, USC, UCLA, North Carolina and Nebraska, among many others.\nStringari to University of Colorado; Till to Abilene ChristianCanon City High School senior Trenton Stringari signed his official letter of intent to attend University of Colorado and run track and field for the Buffaloes."}
