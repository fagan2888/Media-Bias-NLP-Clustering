Broncos top receiver Demaryius Thomas will be absent from the early days of training camp so he can attend to the funeral services of the grandmother who helped raise him in Georgia.

Thomas attended the Broncosâ€™ camp-opening team meeting Wednesday evening. Former Broncos running back great Terrell Davis was the guest speaker at the meeting.

Broncos coach John Fox excused Thomas, who is expected to miss the first four days of camp. He is coming off back-to-back terrific seasons in which he combined for 186 catches, 2,864 yards and 24 touchdowns. He also set a Super Bowl record last year with 13 receptions.
