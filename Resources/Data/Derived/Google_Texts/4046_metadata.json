Patients can use Joy's human-powered concierge service to find physicians or answer questions about health care benefits.\n\nThe company also offers telemedicine services for minor conditions like an ear infection or mild flu, where patients might need medical attention or medication but don\u2019t necessarily require a trip to the emergency room.\n\nThe company works with brokers, including Chicago-based online health insurance marketplace GoHealth, to sell the product a la carte or bundled with a health care plan. Costs begin at $20 a month, Holland said. The company said it has about 22,000 active users.\n\n\u201cFor the last two years, we\u2019ve been focusing on people with individual plans, people who have purchased health coverage through the marketplace, or Obamacare,\u201d Holland said.\n\nThose individual plans can be confusing for consumers, he said. Going forward, the company will continue focusing on that channel as well as selling to employers and directly to consumers.\n\nHolland said HealthJoy, which now has 65 employees, partnered with GoHealth early on. GoHealth led the funding for the seed round, which HealthJoy announced last week.\n\n\u201cThe health care marketplace in the U.S. is shifting \u2026 to a market where being an informed consumer of your health care is important,\u201d GoHealth co-founder and president Brandon Cruz \u21d2 said. \u201cYou can no longer blindly go to the doctor and not worry what it\u2019s going to cost.\u201d\n\nHe gave the example of a consumer who has a sore throat and finds their usual doctor is booked for three months.\n\n\u201cWith HealthJoy, you pick up your phone, you talk to Joy, (and find) there\u2019s actually a small clinic a block away from you,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the perfect time in the market right now for this kind of service. Health care is one of the main topics of conversation in the country as far as elections go. Our health care system needs to get better, and this is one of the best tools out there to make it better.\u201d\n\nmgraham@tribpub.com\n\nTwitter @megancgraham", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Virtual health care guide HealthJoy raises $3 million in seed funding", "date": "2016-04-06", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Blue Sky", "author": "Blue Sky", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Health-tech startup HealthJoy, whose artificial intelligence platform\u00a0helps consumers navigate health care-related decisions, has raised $3 million in seed funding from GoHealth and angel investors.", "title": "Virtual health care guide HealthJoy raises $3 million in seed funding", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/ct-healthjoy-startup-funding-gohealth-20160406-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-570567a2/turbine/ct-healthjoy-startup-funding-gohealth-20160406", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/86464923", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "HealthJoy, GoHealth, Brandon Cruz", "news_keywords": "HealthJoy, GoHealth, Brandon Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Healthtech startup HealthJoy, which builds an AI platform to help consumers navigate healthcare-related decisions, has raised $3 million in seed funding from GoHealth and angel investors."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe health care marketplace in the U.S. is shifting \u2026 to a market where being an informed consumer of your health care is important,\u201d GoHealth co-founder and president Brandon Cruz \u21d2 said.\nHealth-tech startup HealthJoy, whose artificial intelligence platform helps consumers navigate health care-related decisions, has raised $3 million in seed funding from GoHealth and angel investors.\nHealth care is one of the main topics of conversation in the country as far as elections go.\nPatients can use Joy's human-powered concierge service to find physicians or answer questions about health care benefits.\nOur health care system needs to get better, and this is one of the best tools out there to make it better.\u201dmgraham@tribpub.comTwitter @megancgraham"}
