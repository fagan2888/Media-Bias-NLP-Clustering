On Tuesday, Rush Limbaugh rambled about the death of Robin Williams (the comments can be heard here). During his broadcast Rush discussed the politics of the media coverage of Williams’ suicide. He also read from a local Fox News story, which speculated why Williams committed suicide.

After he finished reading the Fox News story, in which an anonymous source discussed financial difficulty and “survivors guilt,” Rush made an odd connection between the story and the liberal worldview. “It fits a certain picture, or a certain image that the left has,” Limbaugh stated. “Low expectations and general unhappiness and so forth.”

Rush is now clarifying, if you will, the convoluted statements from Tuesday. Stating that he was “misquoted, purposely taken out of context.” He stated that he does not know why William committed suicide, and didn’t mean to suggest otherwise. (Yet he read from a supposed news source postulating why Williams committed suicide.)
