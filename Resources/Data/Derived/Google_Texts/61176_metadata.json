The state provides for inmates\u2019 basic needs.\u201d\n\nInmates are barred from receiving food, snacks, televisions and similar items from their families. Instead, they must purchase these items through the commissary inside each prison.\n\nSome families have complained about recent price hikes, but Fisher said most prices have declined. \u201cThe prices of the majority of the 300-plus items currently sold are down substantially from previous prices.\u201d\n\nIn addition to complaints from families, there are complaints from competing vendors, he said. \u201cSo all in all, nobody is happy, and MDOC gets the brunt of complaints.\u201d\n\nThe idea of taking away the commissary is drawing criticism on MDOC\u2019s Facebook page, some calling it \u201cinhumane\u201d and others suggesting the commissary lets inmates have critical items, such as stationery to write letters to their loved ones.\n\nCindy Kelly, whose friend is an inmate inside Walnut Grove Correctional Facility, pointed out that daily food trays are also used as currency.\n\n\u201cTaking away commissary, one of very few things inmates have to look forward to, is only going to bring about more unrest in the prison system,\u201d she said.\n\nLisa Moore said her son, Tyler, serving 50 years for burglary inside East Mississippi Correctional Facility, told her if commissary were to be taken away, \u201call hell would break loose\u201d behind bars.\n\n\u201cA lot of gangs are already stealing food trays,\u201d she said.\n\nYears ago, the Mississippi Department of Corrections handled its own commissary, rather than paying a private company to do so.\n\nThe department now lacks the staff to do that \u201cbecause of the large rate of attrition currently experienced by MDOC due to low pay,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cWe have a 47 percent turnover rate with corrections officers alone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "JACKSON (AP) \u2013 The head of the Mississippi prison system might halt the commissary program inside Mississippi prisons, saying it causes more problems than it solves.
