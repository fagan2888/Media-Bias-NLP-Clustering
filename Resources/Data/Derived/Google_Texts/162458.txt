The Morgan County Sheriff's Office is investigating the death of a prisoner in the Morgan County Jail Thursday afternoon.

Upon doing a routine "pod check," deputy Bobby Baquera discovered Dale R. Mercer, 64, unresponsive on the floor of his cell at 3:36 p.m. Mercer had suffered apparent trauma to his head and was not breathing. Lifesaving measures by deputies and jail medical staff were undertaken and emergency medical services summoned.

Surveillance cameras are in all cells in the booking area to more closely monitor prisoners who may pose a threat to the security of the facility or themselves.

Review of the camera in Mercer's cell, which is one of 50-plus interior and exterior cameras monitored by jail deputies at the county jail and the court facilities within the Morgan County Justice Center, showed Mercer climb on top of the toilet/lavatory unit and dive head first onto the concrete floor.

A review of the video indicated about 20 minutes elapsed from the time Mercer jumped until Baquera found him, and Mercer was not seen to moving at all until he was found.

Despite resuscitation efforts by deputies, jail medical staff, Morgan County Ambulance EMTs and paramedics, and Fort Morgan firefighters, Mercer was pronounced dead about 24 minutes later.

Mercer was booked into jail on May 13 after being arrested by Morgan County deputies. He was being held on $100,000 bond after being formally charged with Sexual Assault, Sexual Assault on a Child, Sexual Assault 3rd Degree, Sexual Assault with an Object and Enticement of a Child. Mercer was kept in a one-person cell in the jail's booking area due to behaviors while in custody.

An autopsy was performed Friday, and the Morgan County Coroner's Office will determine the exact cause and manner of death, but at this point this appears to be an intentional act on Mercer's part.
