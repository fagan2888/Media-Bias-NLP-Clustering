In the 2012 election, Mitt Romney unwillingly called attention to it with his comments about the \u201c47 percent\u201d of Americans who, he said, are \u201cdependent on government.\u201d President Obama, in a late 2013 speech, called inequality \u201cthe defining challenge of our time.\u201d\n\nRelated: Chris Christie Brings the Pain\n\nOn its face, it\u2019s difficult for many to stomach the fact that an enormous share of income in the United States goes to a very small portion of the population, while the majority of the population is left to share, by some measures, less than half of the nation\u2019s wealth.\n\nBut new research from Scott Winship, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, asks readers to set aside concerns about the inequality of wealth distribution in the U.S., and ask whether the promise of outsized rewards to highly successful people might actually benefit everyone \u2013 even those near the bottom of the income distribution.\n\n\u201cAcross the developed world, countries with more inequality tend to have, if anything, higher living standards,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe exception is that countries with higher income concentration tend to have poorer low-income populations.\n\n\u201cHowever, when changes in income concentration and living standards are considered across countries\u2026larger increases in inequality correspond with sharper rises in living standards for the middle class and the poor alike.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Have Policymakers Abandoned the Working Class?\n\nThis gets to Winship\u2019s main point, which is that concentrating on the perception of injustice in the distribution of income may distract from the possibility that the potential to earn vast sums of money might motivate some people to create new products or businesses or to innovate in existing fields in a way that ultimately benefits everyone by improving the economy and raising living standards.\n\n\n\nSource: AEI\n\n\u201cIn developed nations, greater inequality tends to accompany stronger economic growth,\u201d he writes. \u201cThis stronger growth may explain how it is that when the top gets a bigger share of the economic pie, the amount of pie received by the middle class and the poor is nevertheless greater than it otherwise would have been. Greater inequality can increase the size of the pie.\u201d\n\nHe illustrates his point with a reference to the Gini Coefficient, a measure economists use to denote the distribution of income across a society. With a 100 point scale, a 0 on the Gini Coefficient denoted perfect equality and 100 complete inequality (all income goes to one individual.)\n\nManhattan, he points out, with its vast wealth in some neighborhoods and pockets of poverty in others, has a Gini coefficient roughly equal to that of South Africa.\n\nRelated: Whay\u2019s the Best Way to Overcome Rising Income Inequality\n\n\u201cThat Manhattan and South Africa possess similar Gini coefficients does not imply that one ought to be indifferent between living in the two places,\u201d he writes. \u201cNor does it imply that reducing Manhattan\u2019s Gini would improve the living standards of its poor and middle-class residents. It is entirely possible, in fact, that lowering South Africa\u2019s Gini would benefit most South Africans while lowering Manhattan\u2019s would have the opposite effect on Manhattanites.\u201d\n\nWinship\u2019s analysis is open to attack on a couple of fronts. First, as he points out himself, if an individual values equality for its own sake \u2013 even above maximizing overall societal wellbeing, then an argument that goes something like, \u201cLook on the bright side. You could live in Uganda\u201d won\u2019t carry much weight.\n\nAnd his concluding point is likely to raise the hackles of anybody with a large amount of sympathy for the movement to reduce inequality in the U.S.\n\n\u201cRather than being the defining challenge of our time, as many observers believe, income inequality may be a distraction from the goal of raising living standards among the poor and the middle class, Winship writes. \u201cThe analyses in this paper suggest that efforts to reduce inequality are more likely to damage living standards than to improve them.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In the years following the Great Recession, with the Occupy movement highlighting the gulf between the top 1 percent and the 99 percent, and President Obama declaring inequality the \u201cdefining challenge of our time,\u201d it has become widely accepted that inequality is, by itself, a bad thing.
