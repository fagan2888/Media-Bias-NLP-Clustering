ORLANDO, Fla. — Klondike, the 18-year-old polar bear who, with his sister, Snow, was born at the Denver Zoo in 1994, has died at SeaWorld Orlando, the Orlando Sentinel has reported.

Klondike and Snow, were the darlings of Denver in 1995, before being shipped to Florida in November of that year. The two were abandoned by their mom, Ulu, and the staff at the Denver Zoo raised the cubs after their birth on Nov. 6, 1994.

The siblings were separated in February 2012 because of allergies. Snow was moved to Tucson’s Reid Park Zoo because she had skin allergies, which zoo officials believed would be alleviated by a drier climate.

Snow died seven months later. The Arizona Daily Star reported that a necropsy showed Snow had an enlarged and scarred heart. Snow was the only polar bear at the Tucson zoo.

Most polar bears live 20 to 25 years, zoo officials said.
