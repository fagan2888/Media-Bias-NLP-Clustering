On a night where the Democratic Presidential candidates take the national stage, Senator Ted Cruz takes the stage in Burlington, Iowa. Signs and stickers covered the room full of supporters.

"If you think things are going great in Washington, that we need to keep going in the same direction and just keep fiddling around the edges, then I`m not your guy," Sen. Ted Cruz said.

That's exactly what Burlington supporters say they want to hear.

"It`s pretty easy to be a populous candidate, to say certain things that resonate. It`s a different thing to be in the belly of the beast and to have the track record for years and years to fight for those very beliefs that the people should hear. I think that`s powerful," supporter John Ostrander said.

Cruz emphasized his conservative values, sharing his stance against policies and programs like the Affordable Care Act and Common Core.

"I believe that is the fundamental DNA for what it means to be an American, to value freedom and opportunity above all else, and that is why I`m so optimistic today," Sen. Cruz said.

"Well, it`s intriguing, his conservative views. I think people really support what he believes in, and I think there`s a lot of conservative people in Iowa," supporter Abby Miller said.

With months to go before selecting a Republican nominee, Cruz hopes these stops can help him move further up in the polls.

The latest polls out of CBS and FOX have Cruz trailing only Donald Trump and Ben Carson, but there is a wide separation that still exists.

The stop in Burlington is one in a week-long tour of Iowa. He continues on Wednesday with stops in Kalona and Oskaloosa.
