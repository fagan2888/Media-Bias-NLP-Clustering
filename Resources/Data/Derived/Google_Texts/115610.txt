A top-ranking Denver sheriff’s deputy is under investigation after a complaint was filed by another officer.

The complaint against Division Chief Frank Gale was filed by Capt. Jodi Blair , said Daelene Mix , a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Public Safety, which oversees the sheriff’s department.

The complaint filed this week involves the detention of a third sheriff’s captain, Sonya Gillespie, who was arrested earlier this week for assault, Mix said.

Mix cited an internal investigation as why she was not able to offer any more details about the complaint.

Gillespie was charged Sunday night with assault and disturbing the peace, according to court records. The case type was listed as domestic violence but details of the charge were not available late Friday.

Gillespie is the ex-wife of Sheriff Gary Wilson , who has recused himself from any issues associated with her arrest, sources told The Denver Post.

Gale has long been the face of the department, serving as its spokesman. He is in charge of the sheriff’s department’s downtown division, which includes the downtown jail, court services and the civil process unit, according to the sheriff’ s website.

He is one of two division chiefs who report to Sheriff Gary Wilson.

Gale did not return phone calls Friday afternoon.

The complaint is the latest in a string of investigations coming out of the Denver jail.

A federal judge has asked federal authorities to investigate the jail’s and the police department’s patterns and practices as part of a civil lawsuit filed by a former inmate, who has accused sheriff’s deputies of assaulting him while he was in jail.

In April, a former Denver Sheriff’s Department administrator, Michael Than was indicted in Jefferson County on accusations of stealing TurboTax software from Target and submitting false tax returns.
