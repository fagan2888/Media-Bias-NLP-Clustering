I thought of him in those days as a man of brilliant skepticism, as someone who could always be counted upon to have the exact right word for the situation of the left in the Clinton years.\n\nReed has a great and important essay in the current issue of Harper\u2019s Magazine in which he assesses the situation under President Obama\u2014and manages to throw bucket after bucket of cold water over a Democratic Party that is still exulting after its big win in 2012.\n\nI got him on the phone last week to talk it over, and the conversation wandered all over the political map\n\nIn a lot of areas, the left appears to be enjoying a moment of triumph, Yet, the title of your article in the current issue of Harper\u2019s is \u201cNothing Left: the Long, Slow Surrender of American Liberals.\u201d This is going pretty massively against the grain isn\u2019t it?\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know. Not in the circles I move in, it\u2019s not. Not in the labor movement either. I guess everything hinges on how you define the Left and what you mean by it. That\u2019s part of what\u2019s at stake. As I argue in the essay, by \u201cLeft\u201d I mean an old-school understanding that\u2019s rooted in evaluation and critique of current circumstances from the standpoint of an ideal of equality and justice that\u2019s rooted in political economy.\n\nThat\u2019s key: political economy. And you use the word \u201cegalitarian.\u201d That\u2019s sort of what\u2019s completely missing today. All of these victories on these other fronts, largely matters of identity politics, and where is the egalitarian left?\n\nRight, and my friend Walter Michaels has made this point very eloquently over and over again . . . that the problem with a notion of equality or social justice that\u2019s rooted in the perspectives of multiculturalism and diversity is that from those perspectives you can have a society that\u2019s perfectly just if less than 1 percent of the population controls 95 percent of the stuff, so long as that one percent is half women and 12 percent black, and 12 percent Latino and whatever the appropriate numbers are gay. Now that\u2019s a problem.\n\nDo you remember those wealth-management ads in the 1990s that said \u201cMoney: it\u2019s just not what it used to be,\u201dand it would have a black-and-white photograph of rich white people, rich white men, from a long time ago. And then they would have a photograph of what the rich look like now and it\u2019s what you just described.\n\nNo. I didn\u2019t see that. But, yeah, it\u2019s perfect. I wish I had. It would be a nice book jacket. Yeah, I think where we are now is, from one perspective, the result of either 30 or 60-plus years, depending on how you want to count it, of a left that has been able to take only what the other side would make available . . . would permit them to take. And what that\u2019s meant is that our political strategies\u2026I\u2019m not saying this to fault activists; you can only do what you can do, but the political strategies and understandings that have constituted the Left have come increasingly to accommodate with neoliberalism. And the only place that that\u2019s a conspicuous problem is in the labor movement because that\u2019s the one interest group that basically can\u2019t be accommodated to neoliberal economic policy.\n\nInteresting. So the other movements that make up the historical Left have prospered\u2026\n\nRight. Well that\u2019s true by some standard. Like in black politics, for instance, the subtle shift from a notion of equality that\u2019s anchored in the political economy to a notion of equality that tends to a norm of parity has been a really important shift. And when we look around now at academics and others who plead the case for racial justice\u2013Merlin Chowkwanyun and I did an article on this in the 2012 Socialist Register, a challenge to the racial disparity discourse. The language through which briefs for racial justice are crafted at this point are much more likely\u2014I mean, vastly more likely\u2014to point to the problem as a racial disparity instead of inequality. And that might sound\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t get the difference\u2026\n\nI was going to say, it might sound like a pedantic distinction. But the notion of disparity as the metric of racial justice means that blacks should be represented roughly in their percentage of the population in the distribution of goods and bads in the society. So you can have 15 percent unemployment, but if blacks are only 12 percent of the 15 percent that are unemployed basically\u2026\n\nThen it\u2019s OK?\n\nYeah. And while no one actually says that would be okay, the way in which the problem is posed leaves that implication and deflects discussion away from the underlying structural problems in the political economy that put anyone in the exploited or oppressed position. I just saw an article in Labor Notes a month or so ago about how Kellogg\u2019s is jerking workers around in a plant in Memphis. And the slant of the Labor Notes article is that the moves that the company is making disproportionately hurt black workers. The logic of that argument, that type of argument is, in effect, that we can understand the costs of economic restructuring or whatever, but they need to be borne on an equitable basis. Because it was Labor Notes, I know that\u2019s not the intent or the perspective of the magazine or presumably the author, but that just makes the trope stand out even more.\n\nYeah, you hear that all the time.\n\nRight, and my argument is: well, let\u2019s back up.\n\nMaybe the whole project of economic restructuring should be called into question.\n\nAnd the funny thing about it when you think about it, Tom, is that if you\u2019re concerned with the conditions of black Americans, most black people are working people. One might say even disproportionately. And what improves the condition of the working class is going to improve the condition of more black people than the disparity focus would. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s either/or. But the fact is we\u2019ve largely dropped the one in favor of the other. You can see the same thing in the women\u2019s movement. I made this point in the article. It wasn\u2019t that long ago when the political agenda of the women\u2019s movement included stuff like comparable worth and universal child and elder care. And right now, attention to that stuff is shriveled. The defense of reproductive rights is a constant, of course. But the political-economic program that gets touted by the women\u2019s movement is directed toward the glass ceiling and the first woman president. Stuff like that.\n\nI was thinking of Sheryl Sandberg.\n\nRight. She is the Alexandra Kollontai of our moment.\n\nWho?\n\nOr the Clara Zetkin. The radical Bolshevik theorist who was also a feminist. I guess I should say that Sandberg is the Alexandra Kollontai of the bourgeoisie at this point.\n\nWow. That is a tough metaphor.\n\nSorry (laughs).\n\nYou use this word \u201celectoralitis\u201dto describe what\u2019s happened to the left.\n\nWell, it\u2019s a bizarre one, man. I wrote a progressive column on this 20 years ago or close to it. And it just seemed somewhere in the mid-\u201990s almost like I didn\u2019t set my alarm one night and woke up and the rules of being on the left had changed. Everyone was focused on electoral politics. That\u2019s a phenomenon that\u2019s like cause and symptom. It\u2019s certainly a symptom of not having any other kind of traction in the social-movement world as a left. And once again, I acknowledge there are all kinds of people out there doing all kinds of good stuff. Who are trying to make people\u2019s lives better. And to the limited ways it\u2019s possible to succeed, succeeding. But there is not a left social movement that\u2019s got any capacity to do anything. That has any institutional capacity. And most of all, that has any capacity to alter the terms of political debate at the national level, or for that matter even the local level.\n\nSo in the absence of that, what can you do? Well, voting has come to seem more important as a form of political practice. We\u2019ve lost the capacity to do anything else. And when you think about it now we\u2019ve got at least a generation of people who never had any experience with any other kind of politics.\n\nYou\u2019re talking to one of those people. What other kinds of politics is there than voting? There\u2019s protesting, I suppose\u2026\n\nWell, actually I think protesting is overrated. In fact, I think protesting was always kind of overrated in the sense that it\u2019s not so much the protest that produced the change; it\u2019s the movement that produces the capacity for the protest to be effective. That\u2019s the source of the change.\n\nSo it goes back to the movement?\n\nYeah. Yeah. But I would say\u2014and a bunch of us have been saying for a while\u2014that I think it\u2019s much more useful . . . to look at elections as vehicles for consolidating and expressing power that\u2019s been created on the field of social-movement organizing around issues. Ultimately, mass mobilization around issues that connect with concerns that are broadly shared among the mass of people that live in the country\u2014those of us who are expected to get up and go to work every day. And that\u2019s how the nature of the debate changes.\n\nHere\u2019s a factoid: a Roper poll a month before the 1944 presidential election found that 68 percent of respondents said that they would not favor a political and economic system no matter what it was called that didn\u2019t pivot off of a fundamental right to a job, that didn\u2019t rest on the fundamental premise that everyone in a society who is willing and able to work should have a right to a job.\n\nSixty-four percent?\n\nSixty-eight percent. That\u2019s a month before the 1944 presidential election.\n\nWhat ever happened to that view?\n\nWell, the other side won. There\u2019s an interesting literature on the streams of the defeat. The public opinion industry was mobilized in the support of selling the gospel of free enterprise, which itself was only invented in the late 1930s. The term wasn\u2019t even around before then. But there is a steady mobilization of bias, as political scientist E. E. Schattschneider used to call it, against left ideas.\n\nI wonder if you did a poll today what would happen?\n\nYeah, I wonder. The numbers might be higher than one might think. What full employment meant then in terms of the full-employment bill that passed the Senate and was defeated in the House\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re not talking about Humphrey\u2013Hawkins are you?\n\nNo, no. I\u2019m talking about the full employment bill of 1945 that went down, despite passing the Senate \u2013 so it wasn\u2019t a gimmick bill \u2014 that would have mandated that the federal government take action, both in public spending and public works job creation when unemployment crossed the 3 percent threshold with the goal of moving the full employment threshold over a decade to 2 percent. By the Kennedy Administration the full-employment bill became four percent with fingers crossed. Now, I understand it\u2019s 6 percent.\n\nBy that metric we\u2019re almost there!\n\n(laughs)\n\nThe problem is we\u2019ve given up on movement building for elections. But not just elections, elections between the two parties. This was driven home for me most emphatically after the 2000 election, when lots of people voted for Ralph Nader, and here Al Gore loses. Theoretically, the people who voted for Nader, if they had played by the rules of the two-party system, Al Gore would have won. This frightened a lot of people.\n\nWell, there\u2019s a lot of crap going on there, too. And I\u2019ll come clean. I voted for Nader in 2000 partly because I lived in Connecticut and it wasn\u2019t a big choice because I knew the Democrat was going to take the state anyway. But partly also because I had lived in Connecticut in the \u201980s and I had a track record to maintain of not ever voting for Joe Lieberman for anything.\n\nBut I was struck, too by the incredible vitriol that the Dems directed at Nader and anyone who supported Nader after that defeat. And it was a defeat that Gore wouldn\u2019t even fight against either, which they tend to forget. My response to them was, the vitriol was a signal that they were looking for a scapegoat because their flawed candidate couldn\u2019t even carry his home state. I mean, if he could have carried his home state he would have won the presidency. But I always said to them the best explanation of the defeat in 2000 came from a 1970s R&B singer named Ann Peebles with a song called \u201cI Didn\u2019t Take Your Man, You Gave Him To Me.\u201d\n\nThe Nader thing. The vitriol of the reaction was striking to me because it communicated that the Democrats felt entitled to every left-of-center vote, but that they didn\u2019t have to do anything to get it. They didn\u2019t have to appeal at all. And distaste for Lieberman notwithstanding, I would have voted for Gore if he wouldn\u2019t have run such a right wing campaign. That\u2019s part of it. And this goes back to Clinton\u2019s first campaign too. I worked in the short-lived [Tom] Harkin campaign and the word we were getting in that campaign from people in the South in particular was that Clinton\u2019s people were coming through and saying, \u201cOur guy\u2019s going to win the election so you better get on board if you want any consideration. And don\u2019t ask for anything because if you ask for anything we probably aren\u2019t going to give you any access.\u201dAnd that\u2019s pretty ugly. And that\u2019s the way they can be. And I think that Clintonism basically polished off the purge of the left wing of the Democratic party.\n\nSo it was a success in that regard.\n\nYes it was. It was an utter success in that regard. But it\u2019s the cycle though, right? So there\u2019s nothing to do at election time except vote for the Democrat because the Republican is almost invariably going to be worse and despite the Third Party votes I\u2019ve cast in my life, that\u2019s no response to anything. And that speaks to another problem that\u2019s an element of the electoralitis within the left and that\u2019s that the same thing happens every four years. Around this time you begin to look around and see how the Democratic presidential field is shaping up. Then one strain of lefties will say, \u201cGod, Hillary Clinton? This looks terrible. We need to find a progressive candidate.\u201d So now there\u2019s talk about an Elizabeth Warren of the Democrats that\u2019s supposed to an alternative to the corporatist Clinton wing, and there\u2019s even talk of Bernie Sanders running. Well, at that point, it\u2019s too late. You can\u2019t build a base for a candidacy in a year or two years or even four years. The only way to get candidates worth having is to build the social force that will create candidates worth having.\n\nSo it comes back to movements again.\n\nYeah. It comes back to movements all the time really.\n\nThe two-party system is so frustrating for someone like me. I often wonder why the Republicans don\u2019t ever make a play for disaffected Democrats. They certainly could have in 2012 and they had almost no interest in that.\n\nWell, no. There are a couple things going on. One of them is\u2026I think the capture by the Tea Party tale is overstated. It\u2019s true that that element has some\u2014a disproportionate\u2014impact in the primaries, and I may be wrong about this, but I\u2019m still hard pressed to think that there is anything truly organic in the Tea Party movement that wasn\u2019t already the sort of Birchite nut cases on the right flank. And now they\u2019ve been fueled by the most cynical kind of right-wing money.\n\nBut Republicans, why don\u2019t they play those guys the way Clinton and company played the Left?\n\nWell, they did with Romney and McCain. They get their candidates. I remember back in 1996 when Pat Buchanan won in New Hampshire and he came out of there with a big bounce and was moving down to South Carolina next which is where his real base was. His main bank roller was a mill operator down there named Milliken. So I was afraid enough to begin to wonder what I was going to do if he won the presidency. Either head north or head south, across the border. But what\u2019s fascinating was that the Moral Majority pulled the rug out from under him in South Carolina. The holy rollers backed [Bob] Dole. And that\u2019s where the field capacity was in South Carolina, among the holy rollers. And you\u2019d wonder, well, why would they do that, right? Partly, it\u2019s because they made the rational calculation that the interests that the elites in the right wing with populist tendencies are fundamentally connected with right wing corporate and financial sector interests.\n\nAnd they want the presidency. They\u2019re not fooling around.\n\nExactly. And they figured that in strategic terms they\u2019d be better served by getting behind Dole and helping to deliver him the nomination than by going down in flames with their version of Henry Wallace, I guess. It\u2019s interesting in that regard too that year when they had the big jamboree they had down in Dallas. I think it was Jerry Falwell. I often get him and Pat Robertson confused. But he said that the two things God was most interested in that year were cutting capital gains taxes and I think the other may have been the estate tax.\n\n(Laughs) That\u2019s what God wants them to do\u2026\n\nMake it plain, why don\u2019t you. So in effect, and I think this gets to the point I was making in the article, that the choice is between two neoliberal parties, one of which distinguishes itself by being actively in favor of multiculturalism and diversity and the other of which distinguishes itself as being actively opposed to multiculturalism and diversity. But on 80 percent of the issues on which 80 percent of the population is concerned 80 percent of the time there is no real difference between them.\n\nWhen people say things like that they often run into trouble. Because, you look at something like Fox News, and they talk about Obama as if he were a socialist or a communist or a dictator. And as you point out in your article, Obama\u2019s entire career has been triangulation, conciliation, and compromise \u2014 and yet they look at him and see red.\n\nWell, yeah, kind of. This gets into another issue. In a way, I think their hysteria about Obama being a communist or a socialist is in a funny way a backhanded acknowledgment of the success of the Civil Rights movement. Because they can\u2019t say he\u2019s a n\u2014\u2013 in the White House. Right? And I don\u2019t even necessarily think that people are being consciously disingenuous about it. I think they sell\u2026\n\nSo instead they say, there\u2019s a communist in the White House. Someone actually had a song that they would sing at these Tea Party rallies, \u201cThere\u2019s a Communist in the White House.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s that Birchite psychosis. This is the social base of fascism, really, is what they are.\n\nThey don\u2019t have the street gangs.\n\nNo, thank God. Not yet anyway. And I guess that\u2019s partly because a lot of them are pensioners.\n\nThey\u2019ll get you with their golf carts.\n\nBut I still think there\u2019s a lot of astro-turf there. I go back to the founding moment of the Tea Party. And I\u2019ve watched this clip a number of time since then. That day that Rick Santelli\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve written about that at great length.\n\nOh good, I need to read that because when I watched it after the founding moment it seemed pretty clear to me\u2014I mean, you can tell me if I\u2019m wrong\u2014that the co-host knew what was coming. That this was not a spontaneous rant.\n\nIt might have been planned, I dunno. You know what got me about it, is that it was on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade. And you think about Populist movements, like my favorite one from the 1890s, where the Chicago Board of Trade was the pit of evil. And here\u2019s a guy launching his populist movement from that same spot. Remember, he\u2019s not yelling at the traders, he\u2019s not chastising the traders, he\u2019s speaking on their behalf. What kind of populist movement is that? It\u2019s like they were trying to reverse the fundamental symbolism (of populism). Because that\u2019s what the Tea Party movement is: it takes all of the classic populist symbolism and reverses it.\n\nRight. That\u2019s exactly right. That\u2019s exactly right. Yeah.\n\nHere we are in hard times, second only to the Great Depression itself and what are the demanding? An end to the welfare state. Destroy our unions.\n\nRight. That\u2019s exactly right. And it says something about the extent to which content has been drained out of our politics too.\n\nThe symbolism is quite persuasive to some people.\n\nSure. Well yeah because there\u2019s nothing else. The Democrats don\u2019t have an alternative to offer. Right? I mean, that\u2019s the problem. My son said in \u201904 that either, in the industrial Midwest in particular, either Kerry would talk about NAFTA and trade or Bush would talk about gay marriage. And that\u2019s what happened. And I recall\u2026\n\nNow the shoe\u2019s on the other foot.\n\nIt sure is. Which is kind of funny. And frankly, it also says something about how successful an egalitarian\u2014a reasonable egalitarian program\u2014can be if it doesn\u2019t cost anybody anything. If it doesn\u2019t raise the backs of upper-class economic interests.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to explain that a little more.\n\nWell, in not much more than a decade, gayness has gone from being if not completely stigmatized, certainly not normalized. . . .", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is the left enjoying a moment of triumph -- or has a president with no bearings left the Tea Party in charge?", "author": "Thomas Frank", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Is the left enjoying a moment of triumph -- or has a president with no bearings left the Tea Party in charge?", "title": "We are all right-wingers now: How Fox News, ineffective liberals, corporate Dems and GOP money captured everything", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/09/we_are_all_right_wingers_now_how_fox_news_ineffective_liberals_corporate_dems_and_gop_money_captured_everything/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/clinton_obama_warren_sanders.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Is the left enjoying a moment of triumph -- or has a president with no bearings left the Tea Party in charge?", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/clinton_obama_warren_sanders.jpg", "title": "We are all right-wingers now: How Fox News, ineffective liberals, corporate Dems and GOP money captured everything", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "We are all right-wingers now: How Fox News, ineffective liberals, corporate Dems and GOP money captured everything", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Adolph Reed, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Christopher Hitchens, Editor's Picks, Harper's, Sheryl Sandberg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd74b\"", "article_summary": "But there is not a left social movement that\u2019s got any capacity to do anything.\nBut I still think there\u2019s a lot of astro-turf there.\nAnd that might sound\u2026I don\u2019t get the difference\u2026I was going to say, it might sound like a pedantic distinction.\nI think they sell\u2026So instead they say, there\u2019s a communist in the White House.\nBecause that\u2019s what the Tea Party movement is: it takes all of the classic populist symbolism and reverses it."}
