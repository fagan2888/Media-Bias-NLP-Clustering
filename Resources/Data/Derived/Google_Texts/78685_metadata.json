Arvada St. in Colorado Springs on Jan. 23, 2004.\n\nThe bar remained opened after 2 a.m. because it had hosted an after-hours party, according to a Colorado Springs Gazette article.\n\nExhausted, King told family and friends he was going to go outside and sleep in the car until the party was over. That was at 2:40 a.m.\n\nThe car was parked in the parking lot of a nearby apartment complex that had been known as a base for prostitution and drug dealing.\n\nHis friend went out 10 minutes later to check on Dequincy and he was doing fine.\n\nAt 3:20 a.m., he checked on him again and he was okay, according to a Colorado Springs police report.\n\nBut a half hour later, the friend saw blood on his face.\n\nShe rushed him to Memorial Hospital and left him bleeding at the emergency entrance of the hospital at about 4 a.m.\n\nDoctors pronounced Dequincy dead at 6:15 p.m.\n\nDequincy had moved to Colorado Springs a week earlier to find a job to support his wife and stepchildren.\n\nNo arrests have been made in his case.\n\nAnyone with information that could help solve this murder is asked to call the Colorado Springs Police Department at 719-444-7613 or send an email to CSPDColdCase@springsgov.com.\n\nDenver Post staff writer Kirk Mitchell can be reached at 303-954-1206 or twitter.com/kmitchelldp.
