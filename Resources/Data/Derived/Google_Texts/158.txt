Firefighters have contained a house fire near Mustang, Oklahoma, Monday afternoon.

According to authorities, crews from the Oklahoma City and Mustang fire departments responded to this fire in the 5500 block of S. Sara Road.

Bob Mills SkyNews 9 HD flew over the scene. Heavy flames and smoke could be seen coming out of the structure.

Pilot Jim Gardner reported that there wasn't any fire hydrants near the home. Crews had to bring in tanker trucks to the scene.

Crews were able to contain the fire. Officials said it started as a small fire behind the couch. The residents tried to put it out but were unsuccessful. So they got out of the house and called 911. However, officials said the residents left the front door open, which helped fuel the fire.

If possible, officials said always try to leave doors and windows closed when a building is on fire.
