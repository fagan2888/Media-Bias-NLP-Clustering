What really, really annoys him, based on the lawsuit he filed against Goldman, is that he only got $8.25 million the next year.\n\nAfter putting up with a string of such unfair bonuses (while still pocketing what Bloomberg News calculates to be some $35 million in compensation) Salem eventually decamped from Goldman Sachs. Clearly, however, he was in no mood to let bygones be bygones. His first attempt to recoup what he believed he was owed \u2013 a total of $21.15 million in bonuses, deferred compensation and other monies \u2013 was via a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration panel. Not only did he lose, but one of the members of that panel described the case as \u201cbullshit.\u201d\n\nThat seems to have prompted Salem\u2019s latest attempt to demand justice: a lawsuit seeking $16.5 million from Goldman Sachs, filed in New York Supreme Court.\n\nSadly, many of the documents from the FINRA hearing that once accompanied that court filing have now been sealed, but thanks to the Bloomberg report, we can get a glimpse into just how much the spirit of \u201907 \u2014 that would be 2007, before all those subprime chickens came home to roost \u2014 lingers on.\n\nRelated: Wolf of Wall Street Says He\u2019ll Make $100M This Year\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be very clear: I was one of the most sought-after investment professionals in the mortgage industry,\u201d Salem bragged to the FINRA panel during the February hearing. He had opportunities to leave \u201calmost every month that I was at Goldman.\u201d The implication was that he didn\u2019t take them because he had been promised lavish rewards for staying. Of course, Lesson No. 1 for anyone negotiating a salary or bonus, on Wall Street as anywhere else, is to get that promise in writing. Salem didn\u2019t. Whoops.\n\nAlso, one wonders whether he would have been such a star without the backing of Goldman Sachs and a team of equally strong traders? Or Goldman\u2019s capital and network and reputation? A single trader is quite capable of bringing down an investment bank; rarely do we hear of one solely responsible for its health and wellbeing in the manner that Salem implies.\n\nNor do Masters of the Universe betray quite the same level of level of political foolishness that Salem did at his FINRA hearing. Back in the spring of 2007, CEO Lloyd Blankfein materialized at Goldman\u2019s mortgage desk: The traders there were instructed to rein their short positions against mortgage-backed securities, a strategy that Salem saw as being \u201cdo-able and brilliant,\u201d as he explained in his own self-evaluation for the year.\n\nThat self-evaluation \u2014 which contained far too explicit a description of how Goldman marketed the securities while limiting the disclosure of the risks, and far too gleeful a tone about the ways in which the firm would profit at the expense of others \u2014 later leaked. After it became fodder for Congressional criticism of Goldman, execs told Salem he had caused the firm \u201creputational harm,\u201d and would be reflected in his bonus check.\n\nAll of this clearly still gets on Salem\u2019s nerves \u2013 a lot. Regarding that 2007 trading order from Blankfein, Salem says, \u201cBlankfein showed his lack of understanding of what was actually happening\u201d in the mortgage market.\u201d Gulp.\n\nHobbes was right: The life of a trader on Wall Street today is nasty, brutish and short. Ask anyone on Wall Street the rationale for the outsize compensation packages and, if they\u2019re being honest with you, they\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s why they get paid what they do. Quality of life or work/life balance? Puhleez. You are as good as your last month\u2019s P&L statement, and if you\u2019re in it for some sense that you\u2019re contributing to society, well, that won\u2019t keep you going for long. It\u2019s a game for young men, too: You want to have leveraged your trading skills into something else; something more civilized, by the time you\u2019re in your 40s. In that context, the quest to maximize your earnings is utterly logical.\n\nThe way that Salem is going about it, however, is not. By any standards, he was very well compensated for doing a very good job for his firm. He pursued an arbitration claim, and lost. Chasing after Goldman Sachs in a court of law may be something he can afford to do in financial terms, but in reputational terms? Quite aside from the ridicule to which his lawsuit is already being subjected to in the press (\u201ccrybaby\u201d is one word popping up in some commentary), there\u2019s the little matter of good professional judgment.\n\nSalem may have excellent judgment when it comes to knowing what trade to put on and when to close it out at a profit; his judgment in that respect may be far, far better than that of his erstwhile bosses at Goldman Sachs. But filing this kind of lawsuit shows that he doesn\u2019t have a similar ability to judge people and situations.\n\nYou don\u2019t call the CEO of Goldman Sachs a dimwit in your arbitration panel. Even if you\u2019re convinced that you\u2019re Superman, you don\u2019t let on. (Remember how well that worked out for \u201cthe fabulous Fab\u201d Tourre, also late of Goldman Sachs?) And in an industry full of traders, all of whom have also been promised (nudge, nudge) lavish bonus payments that never materialized, you don\u2019t bring a case in New York Supreme Court based on some five-year-old conversations at a cocktail party.\n\nIt\u2019s time for a reality check.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There\u2019s at least one former Wall Street trader who hasn\u2019t received the memo that the g", "title": "$8 Million Isn\u2019t Enough: Former Goldman Trader Sues Over Bonus", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/06/23/8-Million-Isn-t-Enough-Former-Goldman-Trader-Sues-Over-Bonus", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03112012_Goldman_sachs_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/06/23/8-Million-Isn-t-Enough-Former-Goldman-Trader-Sues-Over-Bonus", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03112012_Goldman_sachs_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "There\u2019s at least one former Wall Street trader who hasn\u2019t received the memo that the g", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf942\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s at least one former Wall Street trader who hasn\u2019t received the memo that the glory days are over.\n1 for anyone negotiating a salary or bonus, on Wall Street as anywhere else, is to get that promise in writing.\n(Remember how well that worked out for \u201cthe fabulous Fab\u201d Tourre, also late of Goldman Sachs?)\nHobbes was right: The life of a trader on Wall Street today is nasty, brutish and short.\nAlso, one wonders whether he would have been such a star without the backing of Goldman Sachs and a team of equally strong traders?"}
