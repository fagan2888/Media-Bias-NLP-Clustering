The new Sephora in the Pier Park J.C. Penny hold its grand opening Friday.

The first 100 people in line received a gift card to the store and the first 500 took home a gift bag.

Store managers said they were pleasantly surprised by the turnout, especially being in the off season. The three girls who were first in line said they got to the store at 6:30 that morning. While the line wasn't let into the store until 10, they said it was worth the wait.

"We're cosmetology students," Alex Nolan, Ali Rushlow and Brooke Miller said together. "Yeah, we've been waiting for this. We planned it."

"It's so far away and it's expensive so we don't mind getting the free stuff," Rushlow said.

They said that while they were supposed to be in school, they gave their teacher a fair heads up.

Up until now, the closest Sephora store was in Destin.
