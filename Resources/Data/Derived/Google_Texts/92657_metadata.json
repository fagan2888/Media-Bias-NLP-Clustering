The proposed state plan is called Share and it includes provision for work training, Co-pays and Health Assessments. Laramie Democrat Chris Rothfuss is a supporter of expanding Medicaid. He says he's okay with the requirement that some people pay a small amount into the plan.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not to say that these people will find it easily affordable, but at the end of the day in terms of affordability and in terms of care, this is easily a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nBut Senate Health and Labor Committee Chair Charles Scott immediately rejected the plan. While he likes components, Scott says the plan provides coverage above and beyond most people's needs. He says his committee will not consider the Share plan as a bill and will instead consider what\u2019s called the Healthy Indiana plan that sets Medicaid qualifiers up with a health savings account that can be used to buy insurance and other health related needs.\n\n\u201cBut I think you\u2019ve got to have a proposal that goes beyond the classic Obamacare and we want to cover everybody and we don\u2019t care about what it costs and what it does to them. You\u2019ve gotta have one that says we want to replace that attitude with someone that it might work. And that\u2019s what Healthy Indiana does.\u201d\n\nScott said they may add some of the Share plan as amendments. The committee meets next month.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "After months of negotiations with the federal government, the Wyoming Department of Health unveiled a plan today/Wednesday for using federal dollars to", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wyomingpublicmedia.org/post/state-unveils-medicaid-plan-and-chairman-rejects-it", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wpr/files/styles/medium/public/201411/Charles_Scott.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "After months of negotiations with the federal government, the Wyoming Department of Health unveiled a plan today/Wednesday for using federal dollars to", "title": "State Unveils Medicaid Plan And Chairman Rejects It"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@WYPublicRadio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WYPublicRadio"}, "author": "Bob Beck", "wordCount": 288, "dc": {"title": "State Unveils Medicaid Plan And Chairman Rejects It"}, "nid": 67371, "datePublished": "2014-11-26", "keywords": "Medicaid expansion, Charles Scott, wyoming legislature", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc22\"", "article_summary": "And that\u2019s what Healthy Indiana does.\u201dScott said they may add some of the Share plan as amendments.\nThe proposed state plan is called Share and it includes provision for work training, Co-pays and Health Assessments.\nAfter months of negotiations with the federal government, the Wyoming Department of Health unveiled a plan today/Wednesday for using federal dollars to expand Medicaid in the state.\nWhile he likes components, Scott says the plan provides coverage above and beyond most people's needs.\nHe says he's okay with the requirement that some people pay a small amount into the plan."}
