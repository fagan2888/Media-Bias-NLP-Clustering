Ted Cruz dropping out of the race. All that work Cruz did to steal delegates from Trump isn\u2019t going to make a bit of difference because Trump is now set to win on the first ballot.\n\nHowever, on the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton, who was the presumptive nominee from the start, lost another state to Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was supposed to be defeated back in February, then March and then April. It\u2019s May and Sanders still has a path to victory.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton gets indicted, as she would have been a long time ago if she were anyone else, the Democrats are going to be stuck with a radical socialist as their nominee.\n\nSanders appears to be in it until June 7, when the last states, including California, vote. So Trump, who the pundits predicted would fall from the top of the polls last summer, and then would never survive the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, then would lose on Super Tuesday and so forth and so on, is going to have a month to campaign against Hillary Clinton and Sanders while they are still campaigning against each other.\n\nThe political pundits \u2013 who seem to be about as accurate as your average weatherman or economist and had predicted Hillary Clinton would wrap it up early and there would be no Republican nominee until after a contested Republican convention \u2013 were dead wrong.\n\nThe pundits who said that Trump would lose because he didn\u2019t have an organization to go to the county and state conventions and line up delegates were also wrong. Trump always planned to win this race at the ballot box and has consistently done so.\n\nCruz out-organized Trump and now has a bunch of delegates who would vote for him on the second ballot, which is great but there\u2019s not going to be a second ballot.\n\nAny pundit who now says that there is no way that Trump can beat Hillary Clinton or Sanders should be ignored. Trump has consistently whupped the best the Republican Party had to throw at him and he can certainly defeat whomever the Democratic Party chooses to offer up as an opponent.\n\nHillary Clinton, because of her long history of negatives and lack of any notable accomplishments, has to be worried.\n\nTrump, unlike the candidates Hillary Clinton has already faced, will have no trouble talking about all the Clinton scandals. You can expect him to demand an explanation on why she insisted on using a personal email server for State Department business and allowed top secret information on that server, which had none of the security protection that is required.\n\nIt would be shocking if Trump didn\u2019t already have his own investigators looking into the connection between donations to the Clinton Foundation and special favors handed out by Secretary of State Clinton. If Hillary Clinton is not indicted you can bet that information will be leaked by the FBI to the Trump campaign.\n\nAnyone who doesn\u2019t think that Trump is the odds-on favorite to be the next president of the United States is blowing smoke. They are not actually trying to predict what will happen but trying to affect the outcome they want by predicting it.\n\nThe political elite have been consistently wrong about Trump for a number of reasons. One is that he isn\u2019t one of them. But more importantly it\u2019s because the politicians in Washington and the political pundits who write about them have lost touch with the American people.\n\nThe folks in Washington and New York all have good paying jobs, all their friends have good paying jobs, and they don\u2019t understand that the average American is still hurting from the economic disaster of 2008. A great many Americans went through a period of unemployment, then got a job that doesn\u2019t pay as well as the job they had before 2008, plus many used up the money they set aside for retirement and are now trying to get by on less income and don\u2019t see how that nest egg is going to be replaced.\n\nThis country has always been a country of immigrants, and traditionally those immigrants have had to take the jobs that nobody else wanted to do. But Trump, unlike the other candidates, understands what the mainstream American understands but the political elite don\u2019t. In the past those immigrants have been legal immigrants. Today they are illegal immigrants. In the past the government had control over who came into the country. Today the government has no control. Whoever crosses over the border is here whether they are good or evil.\n\nWhat Trump keeps pointing out, and is always misrepresented by the mainstream media, is that because the government has no control over immigration, murderers and rapists are coming into this country and we are welcoming them with open arms. It doesn\u2019t mean that all illegal immigrants are criminals, but with no control we have no method of keeping the criminals out and letting the good people in.\n\nIt makes sense to mainstream Americans to build a wall and for America to control who comes into this country. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to the political elite because it isn\u2019t their problem.\n\n*****\n\nPolitics is a team sport. It\u2019s not the best individual players who win but the best team. It\u2019s why the list of heavyweight elected officials endorsing Trump is growing and after his win on Tuesday will grow by leaps and bounds.\n\nThese politicians are hoping that Trump will ignore the fact that they didn\u2019t endorse him until his victory was all but certain and they\u2019ll get credit for their support. And there is a good reason for Trump to ignore the tardiness of their support, which is that the real race is just starting. He has proven he can beat anything the Republicans throw at him, but now he has to defeat a Democrat.\n\n*****\n\nInstead of lambasting the presumptive Republican nominee at every turn, the higher-ups in the Republican Party need to start building Trump up in public and in private, trying to figure out what went so terribly wrong with all their well-laid plans.\n\nTrump, whether you love him or hate him, has proven to be immensely popular with Republican primary voters. Trump is correct when he says that people who have never voted or haven\u2019t voted in years have turned out in primaries across the country for the singular purpose of casting their votes for Donald Trump.\n\nI have never been to a Trump rally, but I have watched more than I care to admit by video, and I do attend a good number of Republican Party events. The folks at those Republican events, even at the county level, are not the same folks as those at the Trump rallies. Which is simply another way of stating the fact that Trump has brought out people who have not been involved in politics.\n\nBut for the Republican Party to win it has to have the support of the rank-and-file Republicans.\n\nTake Mitt Romney, for instance. He never connected with the rank-and-file Republicans. He was too rich and looked too much like an aging model. If he had ever appeared in public with a single hair out of place it might have helped. If he had given one speech in his race against President Barack Hussein Obama with half as much fire as the speech he gave against Trump, it would have made a huge difference.\n\nTrump is far richer than Romney, but he has connected with the working class. The Republican Party leadership might want to consider the fact that Trump actually listened to the working class voters and then said what they wanted to hear. The Republican Party leadership evidently only listens to each other.\n\nIt might be a good idea for a couple of them to follow Trump around and not hang around back stage with the big-wigs at his rallies but get out there on the floor with the people and listen to what they \u2013 the people they purport to represent \u2013 are saying.\n\nTrump is nothing if not a smart operator. When he first stared campaigning he never wore a baseball cap. But after attending a bunch of rallies and looking out and seeing that half the men in the crowd had on baseball caps, he started wearing one.\n\nTo the Republican elites and the political pundits this was a huge mistake. Candidates don\u2019t wear hats. He may have looked and felt foolish, but the crowds loved it and, as Trump knows, it\u2019s the crowds that decide who the nominee is going to be, not the Republican elites or the political pundits.\n\nHe has done everything that the consultants and the political pundits have said not to do and he keeps winning. What is amazing is that the consultants and political pundits are blaming everyone else. They can\u2019t admit they were dead wrong about the Republican presidential primary, from start to finish.\n\nWhat Trump proves is that the Republican leadership has completely lost touch with the party. It is no wonder that a Republican presidential candidate has won the most votes in only one out of the last six elections.\n\nOne problem in the past is that none of the candidates being offered up by the Republican leadership ignited enough enthusiasm from the rank-and-file Republicans to get them out to vote. They didn\u2019t like any of the candidates so they stayed home. The problem that for some reason the Republican leadership doesn\u2019t see as a problem is that far too many of them stayed home for the general election also.\n\n*****\n\nHere\u2019s a scenario that could make all the difference in the presidential election. The insurance companies involved in Obamacare are looking to raise rates by double digits in the fall just before the November election. They are being forced to raise rates because one of the things Obamacare opponents said would happen is happening.\n\nOpponents said that Obamacare wouldn\u2019t sign up as many people as Obama said it would, and those who did sign up would be the people who need health insurance more: people who are older and those who need more medical care while the younger healthier people wouldn\u2019t bother to sign up. Since everyone is assured of having insurance they only sign up if they need it.\n\nSo the numbers aren\u2019t working and the insurance companies are losing money hand over fist on the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nA big rate hike for Obamacare insurance could turn a lot of voters off to the Democrats and Hillary Clinton.\n\n*****\n\nFormer House Speaker John Boehner is out of politics, which means he no longer has to worry about what people think about what he says, and that means he can be honest \u2013 something that most politicians try to avoid.\n\nSo what is Boehner\u2019s honest, nonpolitically correct view of former presidential candidate Cruz? This is what he told an audience at Stanford University: \u201cLucifer in the flesh. I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.\u201d\n\nIt hardly matters since Cruz is now simply joining the long list of Republicans defeated by Donald Trump. The biggest difference between Cruz and the other 16 presidential candidates is that it took Cruz a lot longer to admit that he had lost. You can understand why it\u2019s taken Cruz longer if you listen to his father and his number one supporter Glenn Beck, who kept saying that Cruz was the candidate chosen by God. Just as you shouldn\u2019t believe your own press releases, you shouldn\u2019t believe what your supporters say about you.\n\nCruz no doubt was shocked on Tuesday, but I doubt that God was.\n\n*****\n\nThe scenario that former Boehner mentioned seems more and more likely. Boehner said don\u2019t be surprised if Vice President Joe Biden is parachuted in as the last minute Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nAll that it would take is for Obama to allow the Justice Department to indict Clinton for her many abuses while secretary of state. The mishandling of classified emails is the easy one. But the FBI has a bunch of emails that Hillary Clinton tried to throw away. If just a few of those indicate a quid pro quo where countries that paid enormous speaking fees to former president Bill Clinton, the only elected president to ever be impeached, in return for favorable treatment by the State Department, that\u2019s far more serious than mishandling classified documents.\n\nThe Clintons have always believed they are above the law, from Whitewater and Cattlegate to renting out the Lincoln Bedroom and stealing the furniture when they left the White House, the Clintons have been reckless in their disregard for the law. Hillary Clinton has also always been money hungry. As secretary of state she had the power to make millions of dollars for the Clinton Foundation, which is no more than a slush fund for the Clintons and their friends. Less than 10 percent of the Clinton Foundation money has gone to charitable causes. The rest they spend on themselves and their friends.\n\nYou have a lot of power if you can offer people jobs where they are paid a couple hundred thousand dollars a year for going to some meetings and conferences at luxury hotels.\n\nEven if she is not indicted, if Trump is elected president I hope he will end Hillary Clinton\u2019s Secret Service protection. Wouldn\u2019t it be sweet if the Clinton\u2019s lost their foundation, Hillary Clinton lost her Secret Service protection and she had to drive herself around like most Americans? But that is probably too much to hope for.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://rhinotimes.com/Images/Settings/827.jpg"}, "description": "This presidential election year gets curiouser and curiouser.\u00a0 \nThe Republican race is over with Donald Trump winning Indiana and Sen.
