The drugstore chain has added more nontraditional features to its stores and also is adding more contemporary looks. (Photo: MCT file photo)\n\nNot long ago, you always knew where to find a Walgreens \u2014 at the corner of happy and homely.\n\nWalgreens\u2019 banal, cookie-cutter buildings made one part of America indistinguishable from another. Inside were narrow, harshly-lit aisles piled high with merchandise. Squawking intercoms summoned you to the pharmacy.\n\nThese days, the Deerfield, Ill.-based drugstore giant \u2014 with a corporate name of Walgreen Co. \u2014 is writing a more sophisticated design prescription: Its latest crop of stores has a crisp contemporary look that\u2019s airy, roomy, even occasionally playful. The fresh approach extends to exteriors, which are no longer drab and interchangeable.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call it \u201cdrugstore chic,\u201d but let\u2019s give credit where it\u2019s due: When it comes to design, the company is finally entering the 21st century, where the quality of store experience matters as much as selection, price and location. The new look is an integral part of Walgreens\u2019 folksy effort to brand itself as the drugstore \u201cat the corner of happy and healthy.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople used to define convenience as \u2026 really close and really small,\u201d said Ken Nisch, chairman of JGA, a Detroit-based retail brand and experience strategist. \u201cNow they define convenience as a store with everything I want, even if it\u2019s an edited version. I can get sushi, nail polish and People magazine all in the same place, and I can do it in a way that\u2019s trendy and very contemporary and efficient.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve really turned the whole idea (of a drugstore) upside down.\u201d\n\nWalgreen has eight drugstores in the Lansing area \u2014 two in Lansing, two in Delta Township and one each in Grand Ledge, Okemos and St. Johns. They don\u2019t stock sushi but they do have nail polish. Some, stores, including the newest in Okemos that opened in 2011, has some of the more contemporary design features.\n\nThe change is evident in more than 640 Walgreens stores that were remodeled or built new, and is most apparent in 14 opulent flagship stores that stretch from New York\u2019s Empire State Building to Chicago\u2019s Wrigley Building to the Hollywood corner of Sunset and Vine.\n\nOpen since June and roughly twice the size of a typical Walgreens, the Wrigley Building outlet has pumped new life into the base of the skyscraper. Despite a confusing layout and some cartoonish design moves, like a color-splashed mural of the Chicago skyline, the two-level flagship is a drugstore palace.\n\nFrom the flagships, which the company considers laboratories to try out new ideas, changes are filtering down to smaller stores \u2014 a shift evident, to varying degrees, in wider aisles, higher ceilings, improved artificial and natural light and color-coded \u201cneighborhoods\u201d organized around cosmetics, health care and other product lines.\n\nThese are no little design shifts, given the company\u2019s vast reach. As ranked by the number of stores, it is the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy chain, with 8,000-plus outlets serving an estimated 8 million people a day. That\u2019s more U.S. stores than Burger King. So it is not for nothing that the design world has been showering Walgreen with praise that once would have been unthinkable.\n\nIn its September issue, the trade journal VMSD (an abbreviation of \u201cVisual Merchandising and Store Design\u201d) heralds Walgreen as the 2014 retailer of the year. Last year, a Chicago-based historic preservation advocacy group, Landmarks Illinois, gave Walgreen an award for another of its flagship stores, a 1920s neo-classical bank building. Its ceiling, which has six-sided coffers, has been beautifully restored. In the basement, the old bank vault is now the \u201cvitamin vault.\u201d\n\nWalgreen declines to break out sales numbers for outlets using the new format. Called \u201cWell Experience\u201d stores, they feature the new designs as well as expanded product lines in cosmetics, fresh foods and consumer health care, a field in which the company and other drugstores are looking to boost as the Affordable Care Act takes effect.\n\nHowever, in an interview, Tim Welsh, Walgreen\u2019s senior director for store design, planning and development, said the new formats have helped to improve year-to-year store sales. \u201cThey absolutely make a difference,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur older stores were stacked high with merchandise up to the ceiling,\u201d he added. \u201cAs competition rose, once the recession hit and shopper behavior started to change, we had to make our stores more customer-focused.\u201d\n\nSince the company rolled out the \u201cWell Experience\u201d model five years ago, it has opened 642 of the stores, including remodeled and new outlets. The company expects several hundred more to follow next year.\n\nTo be sure, the company\u2019s new format has encountered bumps. In March, a consumer advocacy group alleged that the format, which encourages pharmacists to sit at desks instead of staying behind the counter, had led to patient privacy violations, such as medical histories that could be seen on desks. In May, however, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found the new format provided the needed safeguards to protect patient information.\n\nOn the whole, the change has been a big plus, starting to eliminate the generic \u201cprototype\u201d look that has blighted so many American towns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really taken away the word \u2018prototype\u2019 from our vocabulary,\u201d Welsh said.\n\nWhich is wonderful, but the company still has to revamp or replace thousands of stores before it truly can be said to have left behind the corner of happy and homely.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1xGM9y2", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Not long ago, you always knew where to find a Walgreens \u2014 at the corner of happy and homely.", "og": {"site_name": "Lansing State Journal", "description": "Not long ago, you always knew where to find a Walgreens \u2014 at the corner of happy and homely.", "title": "Walgreens\u2019 designs prove an upgrade for shoppers", "url": "http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/money/business/2014/10/12/walgreens-designs-prove-upgrade-shoppers/17130059/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/lansingstatejournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Not long ago, you always knew where to find a Walgreens \u2014 at the corner of happy and homely.", "title": "Walgreens\u2019 designs prove an upgrade for shoppers", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4e06aaba79b63bec3711fedb22a4879f9b3998a2/c=500-0-2500-2000&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Lansing/2014/10/11/bizupscale-drugstores3la.jpg", "creator": "@LSJnews", "site": "@LSJnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=902480950", "fb": {"app_id": 155580771156105}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba0a\"", "article_summary": "Customers choose from a variety of sushi at a Walgreens drugstore in Hollywood, Calif.\nHowever, in an interview, Tim Welsh, Walgreen\u2019s senior director for store design, planning and development, said the new formats have helped to improve year-to-year store sales.\nIn its September issue, the trade journal VMSD (an abbreviation of \u201cVisual Merchandising and Store Design\u201d) heralds Walgreen as the 2014 retailer of the year.\n(Photo: MCT file photo)Not long ago, you always knew where to find a Walgreens \u2014 at the corner of happy and homely.\nThe drugstore chain has added more nontraditional features to its stores and also is adding more contemporary looks."}
