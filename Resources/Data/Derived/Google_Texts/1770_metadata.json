Subtract wages, salaries, benefits and such (the payroll was $53.1 million) and other operating expenses, and the bottom line that year was a loss of $2.47 million.\n\nIn that year, as reported on IRS Form 990, Randolph Hospital:\n\n* Served 6,722 inpatients.\n\n* Had 30,076 emergency room visits.\n\n* 105,570 other outpatient visits.\n\n* 43,903 home care visits.\n\n* 28.7 percent of emergency patients were uninsured.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to take care of people\u2019s health care needs regardless of their ability to pay,\u201d said Steve Eblin, Randolph Hospital\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nBased on ability to pay, the hospital\u2019s fee schedule slides to zero for some patients.\n\n\u201cWe provide a large amount of charity care,\u201d he said. \u201cThat does not mean we don\u2019t need to make money. We have to generate income. The money that we make goes back into the organization so that we can remain state of the art.\u201d\n\nThe members of the hospital\u2019s board of directors are Sam Cranford, Robert Shaffner, Mac Pugh, Mary Cooper, Elbert Lassiter, Diane Frost, Reynolds Lisk, Cranford Knott, Michael Miller, Sam Rankin Jr., Cris Richardson and Robert S. Shackleford.\n\nBuilt to serve\n\nRandolph Hospital, which opened its doors on July 9, 1932, turned 82 last week.\n\nThe N.C. General Assembly enacted a bill authorizing its incorporation. The bill detailed \u201cthe objects for which this corporation is formed.\u201d\n\nAmong them: \u201cTo maintain and operate an institution for the treatment of sick people under the direction and supervision of skilled physicians and surgeons.\u201d\n\nAlso: \u201cThe corporation is to have and issue no capital stock and is to be operated and maintained at actual cost and entirely without profit, making only such charges to its inmates and patients for rooms, beds, attention and services as will be adequate to defray its actual cost and no more.\u201d\n\nAn invitation from the members of the hospital building committee appeared in the July 7, 1932, edition of The Courier: \u201cEverybody is invited to come to Asheboro Saturday, July 9th to celebrate the opening of the Randolph Hospital Inc. Special invitation are not necessary. The hospital belongs to the Randolph people and the general public is invited to attend the formal opening. The formal opening program will be held in the Asheboro school auditorium at 10:45 a.m. and an inspection reception at the hospital at 2:00 p.m.\u201d\n\nThe hospital was built with a matching grant from the Duke Endowment. Original plans called for a donation of $50,000 from the endowment and construction of a 40-bed hospital at a cost of $100,000. When the community raised $65,000 \u2014 at the outset of the Great Depression \u2014 the Duke Endowment raised its donation to $65,000.\n\nThe extra money allowed for construction of a nurses\u2019 home, beautification of the hospital grounds, and completely equipping the hospital with the latest modern appliances and conveniences. The hospital was debt-free when it opened.\n\nOutcomes, not profit\n\nEblin estimated that 90 percent of the hospitals in the nation \u2014 and most hospitals in North Carolina \u2014 operate as nonprofits.\n\n\u201cLast year,\u201d he said, \u201ctwo-thirds of the hospitals in North Carolina lost money.\u201d\n\nRandolph Hospital has lost money for two years in a row due to a combination of factors, including the economy, Eblin explained. He said cuts to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements contributed to the shortfall. Another factor was ongoing changes in the healthcare industry accelerated by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIn the past, we were paid for how much we did for a patient,\u201d Eblin said.\n\nNow, reimbursements are tied to patient outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe goal \u2014 and this is a good goal for the patient \u2014 is to keep people healthier and not in hospital beds,\u201d he said. \u201cThe medical community here and all around has become much more effective at doing that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "ASHEBORO \u2014 Randolph Hospital is the largest nonprofit corporation in Randolph County.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Chip Womick cwomick@courier-tribune.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Tribune", "description": "ASHEBORO \u2014 Randolph Hospital is the largest nonprofit corporation in Randolph County.", "title": "Randolph\u2019s largest 501(c)(3)", "url": "http://courier-tribune.com/news/randolph-s-largest-501c3", "image": "http://courier-tribune.com/sites/courier-tribune.com/files/field/media/web1_RANDOLPH-HOSPITAL-3347.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://courier-tribune.com/news/randolph-s-largest-501c3", "image": {"src": "http://courier-tribune.com/sites/courier-tribune.com/files/field/media/web1_RANDOLPH-HOSPITAL-3347.jpg, http://courier-tribune.com/sites/courier-tribune.com/files/field/media/web1_RANDOLPH-HOSPITAL-file-photo-1.jpg"}, "creator": "@Courier_Tribune", "card": "summary", "title": "Randolph\u2019s largest 501(c)(3)"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "courier-tribune://?eid=293821", "app_name": "courier-tribune", "package": "com.stephensmedia.couriertribune"}, "ios": {"url": "courier-tribune://?eid=293821", "app_store_id": 964469617, "app_name": "courier-tribune"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964469617", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.couriertribune", "keywords": "News,Local,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-12T17:11:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d1c\"", "article_summary": "ASHEBORO \u2014 Randolph Hospital is the largest nonprofit corporation in Randolph County.\nIn that year, as reported on IRS Form 990, Randolph Hospital:* Served 6,722 inpatients.\n* 43,903 home care visits.\nThe Asheboro hospital generated revenues of $122.8 million in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 2012, up about $5 million from a year earlier.\n\u201cOur mission is to take care of people\u2019s health care needs regardless of their ability to pay,\u201d said Steve Eblin, Randolph Hospital\u2019s chief executive officer."}
