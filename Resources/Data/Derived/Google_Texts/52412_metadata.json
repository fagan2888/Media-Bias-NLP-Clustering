The 152.58 level means that home values in May were, on average, 52.58 percent higher than in January 2000, the benchmark month.\n\n\u201cIf you live here and own a house, it\u2019s great news,\u201d said Metro Denver Economic Development Corp. CEO Tom Clark. \u201cIf you are trying to come in from the Midwest or Texas, it\u2019s a challenge. For many folks it can be sticker shock.\u201d\n\nEmployees of\n\nSisters of Charity of Leavenworth health care system, when the headquarters moved from Leavenworth, Kan., in 2012, and Ardent Mills workers in Omaha, planning to move to new jobs in Denver this summer were among those shocked by housing prices in Colorado, Clark said.\n\nDenver considers Dallas, metro Kansas City, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Seattle its regional competitors, Clark said.\n\nAccording to data provided by Zillow, which tracks sales, home prices averaged $253,000 in metro Denver in May, compared with $144,600 in Dallas, $141,100 in Kansas City, $195,100 in Phoenix, $234,500 in Salt Lake City and $332,000 in Seattle. This month, home prices in Denver averaged $256,800.\n\nWorkers moving to Denver from San Francisco might feel like they\u2019ve \u201cdied and gone to heaven,\u201d Clark said. But if the cost of living is as much as 30 percent more than what a person is used to, relocation can be complicated.\n\n\u201cIt is a deterrent, not for the company so much, because they can be assured they can get talent here, but for key employees who they want to move,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sometimes can be enough of a sticker shock that they have to adjust their salaries upward or they have to find other employees.\u201d\n\nClark said there is big piece of the housing market missing in Colorado: for-sale condominiums.\n\n\u201cOnly 2 percent of our construction market is condominiums. In California, it is 20 percent. In most cities nationally, it is 22 percent. Condominiums would give you a price in between that single-family home and renting,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd renting is getting to a point that if you could get a $200,000- $185,000 condo, you would be paying less than you would be paying for rent.\u201d\n\nClark said state lawmakers need to reform the state\u2019s construction-defect rules \u2014 which have left condo developers vulnerable to lawsuits by community associations and boosted insurance premiums for builders.\n\nBroomfield economist Gary Horvath said the rising prices are a two-edged sword \u2014 and how they play depends on which side you\u2019re on.\n\nFor homeowners, rising values increase personal wealth and makes them more confident and optimistic about the economy. As a result, they are likely to spend on other items, giving the local economy a boost.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t own, or were forced out of a home because of foreclosure, metro rents are steep.\n\nMetro Denver \u2014 defined by Case-Shiller as Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Clear Creek, Denver, Douglas, Elbert, Gilpin, Jefferson and Park counties \u2014\n\nstarted hitting new peaks in May 2013, when the price-index level was 140.98, the highest since August 2006, when it was 140.28.\n\nHoward Pankratz: 303-954-1939, hpankratz @denverpost.com or twitter.com/howardpankratz", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Zooming metro Denver home prices give relocating workers sticker shock", "title": "Zooming metro Denver home prices give relocating workers sticker shock", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/29/zooming-metro-denver-home-prices-give-relocating-workers-sticker-shock/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140610__BZ01HOMESALESp1-3.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140610__BZ01HOMESALESp1-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-29T08:39:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:40:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd90b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf you live here and own a house, it\u2019s great news,\u201d said Metro Denver Economic Development Corp.
