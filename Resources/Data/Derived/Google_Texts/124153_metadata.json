I\u2019m looking at you, 4chan.\n\nSo what do we make of the news this month? Four young Palestinian boys killed by Israeli shell fire while they played on a beach. Photos of their tiny, broken bodies splashed across the front pages of international newspapers. The victims of the downed Malaysian Airlines Flight 17, intimately and closely photographed as they lay strewn across a Ukrainian field. Photos posted immediately on Twitter, followed by major publications.\n\nI\u2019m not going to include the pictures here, because they are easy to find if you are looking. But let\u2019s assume you\u2019ve seen these pictures. Maybe you reacted in the same way as the person who wrote to me and said the following: \u201cI would never admit this publicly because A.) it\u2019s embarrassing and B.) I don\u2019t want to co-opt a tragedy totally unrelated to me, but I spent HOURS staring at MH17 crash photos. Jesus Christ, they were all so voyeuristic and disrespectful, and so nightmarishly graphic that I was drained and crabby for days afterward. But I still couldn\u2019t look away\u2026\u201d\n\nGo ahead, admit it publicly. It is natural for these images to be both horrifying and compelling. Even for those accustomed to clicking on \u201cGRAPHIC PHOTOS\u201d or \u201cNSFW\u201d links, the state of the bodies was a master class in psychological terror. I can\u2019t make the images, and the wars that caused them, any less horrifying. But as a mortician interested in the history of Western death culture, I hope I can put your reactions to the pictures in context.\n\nThe history of death culture is complex, but simply put, for the vast majority of humanity\u2019s history, dying went something like this:\n\n1) Humans saw other humans die all the time. Corpses, corpses, everywhere.\n\n2) Humans died quickly. Infectious diseases (influenza, smallpox, typhoid, you name it) and violence were the swift, effective killers of men.\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, everything about dying had changed. These days, dying in the first world goes like this:\n\n1) Humans hardly ever see a death, nor do they see dead bodies. We have an efficient, bureaucratic system that takes them away.\n\n2) Humans die slowly. Cancer. Heart disease. Our marches out of living take months or sometimes even years.\n\nIn this way, the photos of the four boys and the almost 300 people on the Malaysian airlines plane are a direct violation of everything we know about dying in the 21st century. We\u2019re not supposed to see dead bodies. We\u2019re not supposed to die quickly and violently.\n\nBut in a few key ways, this is also a uniquely modern situation.One particularly disturbing photo from the MH17 plane crash was of a young boy, still strapped to his plane seat. The deaths themselves were the special kind of violence that comes with modernity, where men (and yes, they are usually men) can dispassionately click a button and cause death at a great distance, never having to stare face to face with the person \u2014 with the children \u2014 they have killed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Don't let the photos make you afraid of dying.
