Morning star Venus is away, so the moon and Jupiter will play. It all happens in the west about an hour and a half after sunset, according to Earthsky.org. In fact they are the brightest two objects in the sky this month.\n\nMercury, on the other hand, must be looked for just after sunset. The rounded curve of the crescent moon \u201cpoints\u201d to this closest planet to the sun, Earthsky.org notes. And it is aimed more or less at the closest planet to the sun.\n\nAlso on June 1, Mars\u2019s yellow-orange hue will be visible in the south, according to Sky & Telescope.\n\nAnd the show doesn\u2019t end on June 1. If you miss it on Sunday night, the three planets will form a similar triangle again on Monday June 2, Earthsky.org says. The moon\u2019s crescent will be a tiny bit chubbier, but that will merely make for an even brighter sight. Jupiter\u2019s luminosity will be just as obvious as the night before.\n\n\u201cLook westward after sunset on June 1, 2014 to see the waxing crescent moon and brilliant planet Jupiter lighting up the evening twilight,\u201d explains Earthsky.org. \u201cIf it\u2019s at all clear, it\u2019ll be hard to miss them, because the moon and Jupiter are so bright! They are the brightest and second-brightest celestial bodies in the June 2014 evening sky.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A week ago the moon was cavorting with Venus before sunrise, but now Earth\u2019s satellite has changed alliances and turned its attention to the evening.The moon and Jupiter dance with Mercury on June 1 and 2.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/01/crescent-moon-dances-jupiter-mercury-hovers-nearby-155103", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/planet_fantasy-thinkstock_image93809997.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Crescent Moon Dances With Jupiter, Mercury Hovers Nearby"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Crescent Moon Dances With Jupiter, Mercury Hovers Nearby"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/01/crescent-moon-dances-jupiter-mercury-hovers-nearby-155103", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-01T12:00-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "sun, moon, space, astronomy, jupiter, planets, solar system, mercury,", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Crescent Moon Dances With Jupiter, Mercury Hovers Nearby"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfdd7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cLook westward after sunset on June 1, 2014 to see the waxing crescent moon and brilliant planet Jupiter lighting up the evening twilight,\u201d explains Earthsky.org.\nThe rounded curve of the crescent moon \u201cpoints\u201d to this closest planet to the sun, Earthsky.org notes.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s at all clear, it\u2019ll be hard to miss them, because the moon and Jupiter are so bright!\nMorning star Venus is away, so the moon and Jupiter will play.\nThe moon\u2019s crescent will be a tiny bit chubbier, but that will merely make for an even brighter sight."}
