Although official attendance statistics haven't been released yet, fair organizers say they've seen an increase in numbers from last year.\n\n\n\nMostly sunny and hot conditions have brought thousands of people to the fairgrounds, which has led to several vendors running out of food. Even though this means businesses may have to put up \"Sold Out\" signs, they're pleased with the shortages.\n\n\n\n\"It's a wonderful problem to have,\" Food Vendor Marilyn Konda said.\n\nThat's what concession owner Marilyn Konda says about running out of food at the Sioux Empire Fair - twice. Konda says in the first four days of the fair, her stand sold about 600 Spudsters, which are deep fried mashed potatoes. After re-stocking her supply on Thursday, Front Porch Concessions ran out again yesterday.\n\n\"This year we've really noticed an increase,\" Konda said. \"Every night has just been phenomenal. Usually by 10:00 you start winding down, but it's been pretty much midnight every night this week.\"\n\nDaVida Jaqua brought her three grandchildren to the fair and she says she's noticed an increase in attendance this year.\n\n\"Hadn't really considered the aspect of running out of food, but yeah, I was surprised to hear that some of the vendors had been running out of food,\" Jaqua said. \"I hope they don't run out of what I want.\"\n\nMarketing Director Brittany Will says food hasn't been the only thing in short supply at the fair this year.\n\n\"One night we actually had to call beer companies and have them bring in some more beer and stock everything up, so it's been great,\" Will said.\n\nThis year, the Sioux Empire Fair featured 55 food vendors, and about 65 commercial vendors in the Expo building.\n\nWill says she hopes high attendance numbers will bring these merchants, and more, to the fair next year.\n\n\"If the attendance is low at a place, you're not going to want to go,\" Will said. \"So it'll help a lot, and when they see a high attendance number, which we're hoping, we'll have to wait to get all that back, but then I'm sure it'll bring up the commercial vendors, the food vendors and everything.\"\n\nA goal that the fair seems to be achieving. Konda says Front Porch Concessions plans on returning to the Sioux Empire Fair next year, with an ample supply of Spudsters.\n\n\"We are coming with nothing less than about 25 cases,\" Konda said.\n\nOfficial attendance numbers for the fair will be released in the coming weeks.\n\nNews\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
