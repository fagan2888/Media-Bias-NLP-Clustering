A national NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Republican popularity at its lowest ebb and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has twice as many people thinking negatively about him as liking him.

While polls are a snap-shot in time, there is little good news in the poll for the Republican Party, which 53 percent of the public blames for the government shutdown.

Meanwhile, poll numbers for President Obama and the Democratic Party, while not winning any accolades, have remained stable. The Democratic Party favorability rating declined from 42 percent to 39 percent. Obama’s approval ratings actually went up two points to 47 percent.

In addition, half of Americans are opposed to defunding Obamacare.

If that’s not enough bad news for Republicans, the favorable/unfavorable rankings are dismal. For the tea party, it’s 21 percent/47 percent, the Republican Party is 24 percent/53 percent and Ted Cruz is 14 percent/28 percent.

But what does this mean for Texas politics? Certainly governor candidate Greg Abbott is closely aligned with Cruz. The senator’s former boss has tweeted his support of Cruz’ campaign to dismantle Obamacare.

And Texas’ strong conservative roots show little sign of weakness. At least that’s what all the Republican statewide candidates are banking on. They have so far been unified in their opposition to in-state college tuition for noncitizens, anti-gay rights, anti-abortion and anti-Obamacare. The scramble has been on who can get the furthest right on those issues.

But the question becomes will the national antipathy to the government shutdown do any political harm to Texas congressional or statewide candidates? Or maybe the tourism ads are right, Texas is a whole other country.
