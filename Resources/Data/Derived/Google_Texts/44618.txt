The wild incident occurred after a sergeant and two police officers observed the shooter, Naim Owens, 22, adjusting his waistband while patrolling the area near Marcus Garvey Boulevard and Monroe Street in plain clothes in an unmarked vehicle just before 2:30 a.m. Sunday, the NYPD said.

John Hirschberger, 28, was hit in the left thigh while Owens was struck in the upper back by officers returning fire, the NYPD said.
