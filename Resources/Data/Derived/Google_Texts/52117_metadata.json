John Kasich, who is weighing a 2016 run for president on the Republican side, hinted that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s early moves ahead of his own possible White House run aren\u2019t what he thought they would be.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I was going to be back up here again because frankly, I thought Jeb was just going to suck all the air out of the room, and it just hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d Mr. Kasich told a group of business leaders in New Hampshire Thursday.\n\n\u201cNo hit on Jeb. No hit on you, Jeb!\u201d Mr. Kasich quickly clarified, according to NH1, though he also said that he was \u201cnot going to have Bush money; Wells Fargo doesn\u2019t have Bush money.\u201d\n\nMr. Kasich, who is also a former congressman, said that if he runs for president, he\u2019s \u201cnot doing this to write a book or get a television show or anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cEither you win or you don\u2019t do it. And I\u2019m optimistic it\u2019s moving in the right direction, but we still have a ways to go,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
