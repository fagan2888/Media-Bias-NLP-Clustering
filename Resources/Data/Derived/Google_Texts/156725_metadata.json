Some 64% of those participating in Littler\u2019s survey are concerned about the impact of that rule change.\n\nObamaCare remains a focus point for employers:\n\nBefore the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision late last month in King v. Burwell, 55% of those polled said they had engaged or planned to engage with employee benefits attorneys or consultants to help navigate healthcare regulations relating to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), more commonly referred to as \u201cObamaCare,\u201d which down slightly from 2014, when 58% gave that response.\n\n[FYI motor carriers have noted in previous surveys that health care costs are becoming a major burden on their bottom lines.]\n\nMeanwhile, 18 % of respondents said they were taking a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach in 2015 regarding the ACA, slightly higher than 14% recorded last year.\n\n\u201cThe rise in a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach was an indication that employers continued to be uncertain about the fate of the ACA prior to the Supreme Court decision in King v. Burwell,\u201d noted Ilyse Schuman, co-chair of the Workplace Policy Institute at Littler. \u201cOverall, the results show that employers are becoming accustomed to the ACA stipulations. However, employers need to stay abreast of any changes that could impact the ACA as to remain compliant with the law.\u201d\n\nIncreased attention on the rights of LGBT employees:\n\nLast month, the Supreme Court announced its decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, finding that same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional nationwide. Yet well prior to the ruling, many companies had already adjusted workplace policies, with 47% of respondents stating that their companies had put in place policies that directly address issues faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) workers. Only 11% said that changes in laws prompted new policies, with 13% noting that their companies intended to make changes to policies within the next year.\n\n\u201cEven before the ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, it was clear that many U.S. employers had been moving toward creating more inclusive workplaces for LGBT employees,\u201d stressed Mark Phillis, a Littler shareholder. \u201cNow that same sex marriage is legal nationwide, employers should revisit their benefits plans, leave policies, domestic partnership policies and non-discrimination policies to ensure they are treating all their employees equally.\u201d\n\nGreater liabilities due to possible change in joint employer definition:\n\nEmployers remain concerned with the potential change to the current joint employer standard as the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) reviews multiple cases that could ultimately modify the definition. The prospect of this change prompted:\n\n69% of respondents to Littler\u2019s poll register concern about exposure to greater legal liability.\n\n59% of employers expressed concern with the potential difficulty in monitoring the employment practices of separate entities.\n\n\u201cFor employers, the burden of having to monitor not only their own employees, but also the employees of subcontractors is especially daunting and has the potential to have a huge impact on industries throughout the country. It is certainly worth keeping a close eye on,\u201d noted Michael Lotito, co-chair of Littler\u2019s Workplace Policy Institute.\n\n\u201cAs the NLRB and other agencies continue their enforcement efforts, cost is a continued concern among employers [as] 34% percent of respondents were justifiably concerned that a change from the NLRB on this matter could result increased costs for their company,\u201d he said.\n\nAggressive government policies put new spin on whistleblowing:\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to encourage the increase of tips through hefty rewards to those who blow the whistle on their companies, noted Littler, and that\u2019s putting employers in a more precarious position as their compliance officers \u2013 nominally tasked to ensure their companies stay within the law and uphold company policies \u2013 can now actually profit from unlawful violations, even those that may wittingly contribute to violations.\n\nEdward Ellis, co-chair of the Whistleblowing and Corporate Ethics Practice Group at Littler, noted that this \u201cdichotomy\u201d of duties, while vexing, still only had 16% of respondents concerned that compliance officers will leverage their insider knowledge to secure bounties. And nearly double the number of respondents, some 30%, picked none of the available options in the survey as concerns. Furthermore:\n\nSome 22% of those polled by Littler expressed concern that compliance programs will generally be less effective because compliance officers will take lapses straight to the government rather than to executives.\n\nAnother 22% noted compliance programs would be less effective because individuals will report to government agencies rather than fulfilling job duties.\n\n\u201cThese results are surprising as employers should be concerned about each of the issues in the survey,\u201d Ellis emphasized. \u201cThere are a myriad of risks for employers should they ignore the fact that compliance officers can wield a big stick. The SEC has made a clear effort to elicit more whistleblowers with proprietary knowledge of their companies\u2019 compliance programs.\n\nAn \u201cactive\u201d EEOC and discrimination claims in the workplace:\n\nDespite the number of completed systemic investigations by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) falling to 260 in 2014, down from 300 in 2013, a \u201chealthy portion\u201d of Littler\u2019s survey respondents remain concerned about the EEOC\u2019s investigations and charges:\n\nSome 57% expect an increase in charges relating to hiring barriers, including the consideration of criminal or credit histories within the hiring process.\n\nAnother 37% of employers expect to see an increase in claims arising relating to accommodations for disabled workers.\n\nAnd another 34% expect more charges of regarding equal pay issues to be investigated.\n\nAlso, respondents were concerned about claims of retaliation (33%) and charges of age discrimination (32%), noted Barry Hartstein, co-chair of the EEO & Diversity Practice Group at Littler.\n\n\u201cThe survey results mirror concerns that the newly appointed EEOC Chair, Jenny Yang, and current General Counsel, David Lopez, recently approved for a new term, will focus on larger, systemic cases in the near term,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEmployers will continue to grapple with discrimination claims as the EEOC ramps up its enforcement efforts,\u201d Hartstein added. \u201cThe concerns expressed in the survey align with what is happening in the courts, such as the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in UPS v. Young and EEOC v. Abercrombie, or newly minted \u2018ban the box\u2019 legislation.\u201d\n\nIn short, he stressed that employers \u201chave many issues\u201d impacting their workforce related to discrimination and hiring practices.\n\nThat, my friends, is putting it very mildly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As we all know, trucks are one of the central assets for a wide range of businesses \u2013 freight hauling, construction, petroleum and natural gas extraction, so forth and so on.
