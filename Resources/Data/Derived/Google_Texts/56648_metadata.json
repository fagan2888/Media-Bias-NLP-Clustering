So colleges are only liable for the first $90,000 of costs.\n\nBut under New York\u2019s interpretation of the health law, colleges are forbidden from \u201ccoordinating benefits\u201d with groups like the NCAA, which means the college would be on the hook for the entire cost of a student\u2019s injury.\n\nIn response, Senate insurance committee chairman Jim Seward has introduced a bill that would allow colleges to keep writing the policies, which he said have worked well for years in insuring student-athletes.\n\n\u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Seward said, in an interview with Capital.\n\nThe bill picked up sponsorship in the Legislature\u2019s lower chamber from Assemblyman Al Stirpe, whose district includes Syracuse University, one of the colleges also hoping for a change in the law.\n\nAt least a dozen other colleges are pressing the state to rethink its position on the interpretation of the law, arguing the increased costs will be borne on the backs of students required to pay more for insurance. In a memo sent in support of the legislation, Cornell University said it had been providing accidental injury insurance for its athletes for decades.\n\n\u201cThere are approximately 250 athletes on Cornell University\u2019s student insurance plan and currently any injury they sustain is covered by the alternate plan for athletes provided by Cornell. If the injury is catastrophic the NCAA offers coverage that takes over at $90,000. Without this legislation the athletic injury exclusion is removed and these expenses would be borne by all students on the student insurance plan. There would be no way to take advantage of what would become duplicative catastrophic injury coverage from the NCAA because the NCAA plan would be secondary,\u201d the memo said.\n\nCornell officials said that if the state\u2019s interpretation of the law were to go forward, it could significantly raise insurance rates for students, who will pay $2,560 a year for insurance coverage, averaging out to roughly $215 a month, for the 2015-2016 school year.\n\n\u201cColleges are already paying for really good catastrophic injury coverage through the NCAA. It doesn\u2019t make sense if students can\u2019t access it in the unfortunate circumstance they need it. And, they shouldn\u2019t have to pay more in premiums for redundant coverage. This bill fixes that,\u201d said Zoe Margaret Nelson, associate director at Cornell\u2019s office of government relations.\n\nMatt Anderson, a spokesman for the Department of Financial Services, said the agency is \u201ccontinuing to review the legislation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/06/8569069/colleges-fight-state-rule-student-athlete-coverage", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20JimSeward.png", "type": "article", "title": "Colleges fight state rule on student-athlete coverage"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Would bar colleges from selling accident insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf31\"", "article_summary": "The federal health law mandates that all primary insurance policies include a handful of essential health benefits, including contraceptive and prenatal coverage.\n\u201cColleges are already paying for really good catastrophic injury coverage through the NCAA.\nBut New York is one of a handful of states that has decided the accidental insurance policies colleges previously offered to their athletes can\u2019t be offered anymore under federal law.\nIn a memo sent in support of the legislation, Cornell University said it had been providing accidental injury insurance for its athletes for decades.\nA majority of other states decided that the ACA didn\u2019t rule out the possibility that colleges could still offer secondary insurance policies to their students, such as dental, vision, or accident and injury coverage for student athletes."}
