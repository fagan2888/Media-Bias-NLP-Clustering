Veterans that meet certain eligibility requirements will be able to elect to receive care from eligible non-VA healthcare providers through this program.\n\nEligibility\n\nA veteran must be enrolled in VA healthcare before Aug. 1, 2014 or be eligible to enroll as a recently discharged combat veteran within five years of separation.\n\nAdditionally, a veteran must also meet at least one of the following criteria:\n\n\u2022 The veteran is told by their local VA medical facility that they will need to wait more than 30 days from their preferred date or the date medically determined date by their doctor for an appointment.\n\n\u2022 The veteran's current residence is more than 40 miles from the closest VA healthcare facility.\n\n\u2022 The Veteran resides in a location where he needs to travel by plane or boat to a VA Medical Facility ( there are some other rules on this one).\n\n\u2022 The veteran faces a geographic challenge, such as extensive distances around water or other geologic formations such as mountains, that presents a significant travel hardship.\n\nProgram is already activated\n\nThe VA has mailed some of the Choice program cards to veterans enrolled in VA healthcare already. The Choice card is being issued in three phases.\n\nThe first group of Choice cards along with a letter explaining eligibility was sent in November to veterans who may live more than 40 miles from a VA healthcare facility.\n\nThe next group of Choice cards were sent to those veterans who are currently waiting for an appointment longer than 30 days\n\nThe final mailing of the Choice cards will be sent by the end of this month to the remainder of veterans enrolled in VA healthcare.\n\nPlease hold on to this Choice card even if you are not eligible now and never discard your regular VA identification card.\n\n\n\nJoseph Hannagan Jr. is Salem County Veterans Affairs Officer. Veterans can contact Hannagan at his office by calling 856-339-8603, via cell phone at 609-774-7450 or via email at Joseph.Hannagan@salemcountynj.gov", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "South Jersey Times", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "salem-city, veterans, news", "title": "New rules help veterans get quicker access to healthcare: Salem County Veterans corner", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"New rules help veterans get quicker access to healthcare: Salem County Veterans corner\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/salem/index.ssf/2015/01/post_141.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/salem_impact/photo/hannaganjpg-4887d798b38d482c.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15040571\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-24T17:00:52Z\", \"author\": \"South Jersey Times\", \"tags\": [\"@cumberland-county\",\"@south\",\"salem-city\",\"veterans\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/salem_impact/photo/hannaganjpg-4887d798b38d482c.jpg", "description": "The Veterans Access Choice and Accountability Act is designed to help veterans get faster access to healthcare.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, January 24, 2015, 12:00 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/salem_impact/photo/hannaganjpg-4887d798b38d482c.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"sjmsjtimes\", \"author_nickname\": \"South Jersey Times\", \"author_id\": \"10468060\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Salem County\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/salem/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The Veterans Access Choice and Accountability Act is designed to help veterans get faster access to healthcare.", "title": "New rules help veterans get quicker access to healthcare: Salem County Veterans corner", "url": "http://www.nj.com/salem/index.ssf/2015/01/post_141.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/salem_impact/photo/hannaganjpg-4887d798b38d482c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, January 24, 2015, 11:47 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "The Veterans Access Choice and Accountability Act is designed to help veterans get faster access to healthcare."}, "article_summary": "Program is already activatedThe VA has mailed some of the Choice program cards to veterans enrolled in VA healthcare already.\nVeterans that meet certain eligibility requirements will be able to elect to receive care from eligible non-VA healthcare providers through this program.\n\u2022 The veteran's current residence is more than 40 miles from the closest VA healthcare facility.\nThere have been some recent, important changes in the Veterans Administration's healthcare system to assist our veterans in seeking the medical help that they require in a timely fashion.\nSection 101 of the VACAA will require the Veterans Administration to establish a program known as the Choice Program to improve veterans' access to healthcare, by allowing veterans to use eligible health care providers outside the VA system (non-VA care providers.)"}
