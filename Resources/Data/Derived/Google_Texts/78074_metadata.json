(Photo: Courtesy of Toyota )\n\nToyota will expand its southwestern Indiana assembly plant again, adding 300 jobs by 2016.\n\nThe Japanese automaker said the $100 million expansion of its Princeton plant will allow it to boost production of the Highlander midsize sport utility vehicle.\n\nSales of the SUV have taken off since Toyota began producing the Highlander in Indiana last year. From January through July 2014, Toyota sold about 90,000 Highlanders, an increase of 16 percent over the same period the previous year, the company said.\n\nThe latest expansion will bring Toyota Indiana\u2019s overall investment to $4 billion and increase employment at the plant to about 5,000 people.\n\n\u201cThe Highlander has been a great product for our plant,\u201d said Toyota Indiana President Norm Bafunno. SUVs from the plant not only supply U.S. markets but are exported to Australia, New Zealand and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Indiana Economic Development Corp. offered Toyota up to $350,000 in training grants based on the company\u2019s job creation plans. Gibson County also is expected to grant property tax abatement or other economic incentives.\n\n\u201cHoosier-built products like the Toyota Highlander are known around the world for their precision and quality,\u201d Gov. Mike Pence said in a statement. \u201cAnd with suppliers in all corners of the state, Toyota is helping to strengthen and grow Indiana\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nToyota opened the Princeton plant in 1996. It\u2019s one of four U.S. auto plants for the Japanese company, including one in Georgetown, Ky.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1tz96Sl", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Toyota will expand its southwestern Indiana assembly plant again, adding 300 jobs by 2016.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Toyota will expand its southwestern Indiana assembly plant again, adding 300 jobs by 2016.", "title": "Toyota will expand Indiana plant, add 300 jobs", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2014/08/24/toyota-will-expand-indiana-plant-add-jobs/14534599/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Toyota will expand its southwestern Indiana assembly plant again, adding 300 jobs by 2016.", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4e06aaba79b63bec3711fedb22a4879f9b3998a2/c=500-0-2500-2000&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/24/-builtind03.jpg20120831.jpg", "title": "Toyota will expand Indiana plant, add 300 jobs", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Michael Pence", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Michael Pence", "title": "Toyota will expand Indiana plant, add 300 jobs", "author": "Jeff Swiatek", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7693856023716441bc41369055bedd0168e81635/c=750-0-2250-2000/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/24/-builtind03.jpg20120831.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e47265371f176e1ca60045acf5227a963f0f1c0e/c=500-0-2500-2000/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/24/-builtind03.jpg20120831.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bbe2e70b2c309b93e709f274c1c5ea3dd9112584/c=166-0-2833-2000/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/24/-builtind03.jpg20120831.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cbc94ded4cd4bf3d281aa6ac7a3bc6555ff8c958/c=0-156-3000-1844&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/24/-builtind03.jpg20120831.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-08-24T16:27:59-04:00", "shorthed": "Toyota will expand Indiana plant", "articleid": 14534599, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2887f5d7d58a75a6437c45e987fd994202334aff/c=0-156-3000-1844/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/24/-builtind03.jpg20120831.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4116c3ed324a74438ec644f3fd7c164ae39936f3/c=938-0-2063-2000/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/24/-builtind03.jpg20120831.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde322\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Courtesy of Toyota )Toyota will expand its southwestern Indiana assembly plant again, adding 300 jobs by 2016.\n\u201cThe Highlander has been a great product for our plant,\u201d said Toyota Indiana President Norm Bafunno.\nThe Indiana Economic Development Corp. offered Toyota up to $350,000 in training grants based on the company\u2019s job creation plans.\n\u201cHoosier-built products like the Toyota Highlander are known around the world for their precision and quality,\u201d Gov.\n\u201cAnd with suppliers in all corners of the state, Toyota is helping to strengthen and grow Indiana\u2019s economy.\u201dToyota opened the Princeton plant in 1996."}
