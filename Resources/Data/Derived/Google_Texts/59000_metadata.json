They became final in June.\n\nRev. John Jenkins, Notre Dame's president, on Tuesday said in a statement that at its core the lawsuit was about the freedom of a religious organization to live its mission and went beyond a debate about contraceptive services.\n\nNotre Dame's employee health plan covers about 11,000 people including employees and dependents and a student health program covers about 2,700 people, it said.\n\nThe plans do not cover abortion-inducing drugs, contraceptives when they are used to prevent pregnancy, or sterilization. The plans do not appear to meet exceptions allowed for religious entities, Notre Dame said.\n\nThose services will continue to be freely available in the United State outside of Notre Dame, and the university was not seeking to impose its religious beliefs on others.\n\n(Reporting by David Bailey; editing by Jackie Frank)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "The University of Notre Dame filed a lawsuit on Tuesday challenging mandatory coverage of contraception under U.S. federal healthcare laws that it said run contrary to the Catholic university's religious beliefs.", "title": "Notre Dame challenges U.S. contraceptive mandate in lawsuit", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20131204&t=2&i=817206293&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBRE9B3016N00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
