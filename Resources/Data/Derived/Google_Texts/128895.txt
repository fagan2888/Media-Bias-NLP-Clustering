The El Paso County Sheriff's Office is looking for help in identifying suspects in a recent theft case.

Sometime between 7:30 p.m. Thursday and 7:30 a.m. Friday, a wallet, two Social Security cards, and a Ruger 10/22 long rifle were stolen from a home on the 4600 block of Mazana Drive.

Friday morning, the victimâ€™s debit card was used at a 7-Eleven in Monument, then used again later in the morning at the Falcon Walmart. The clerk at the 7-Eleven told Sheriff's deputies the suspects are frequent customers. Surveillance photos of the suspects and the suspect vehicle can be seen on the side of this page.

If you know the suspects, or have any information that can help in the investigation, you can contact the El Paso County Sheriff's Office Dispatch Center at 719-390-5555.
