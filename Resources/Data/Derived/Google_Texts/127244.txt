Patricia Arquette won an Oscar for her performance in “Boyhood,” and the actress made great use of her allotted acceptance speech time to issue a rousing call for equal pay for women. “It’s our time to have wage equality once and for all and equal rights for women in the united states of America,” Arquette stated to a roar of applause and a standing ovation from Meryl Streep.

The reaction on Twitter was equally as enthusiastic, with everyone from Lena Dunham to Planned Parenthood weighing in on the speech. Here were some of the best responses:
