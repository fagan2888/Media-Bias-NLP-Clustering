Valley Springs, SD

Valley Springs is another community hit hard by heavy rainfall, and the small town is seeing significant flooding.

Up to seven inches of rain hit the area last night, bringing results that are shocking Valley Springs residents.



"I mean it's come down from, springs are supposed to be out that way, somewhere, I don't know. But it comes, the water, I've never seen it like this, never seen it like this," Valley Springs Resident Perry Scott said.

The creek going through the area starts near Hardwick Minnesota, bringing that area's run-off to Valley Springs. This is one of the reasons this town has so much flooding.



It is rather difficult for drivers to make it into Valley Springs, since most of the major highways and country roads going into the area are covered with rushing water.



"You should never drive into stuff like that because you don't know what's under it. You really don't have a clue. And really that water going across them roads has a lot of force. I mean, it'll sweep your car sideways and put you in the ditch, and then you better know how to swim," Valley Springs Fire Chief Don Johnson said.

As for the homes in Valley Springs, Johnson says there are a lot of flooded basements, and even some basement walls that collapsed from the water.

"I've been around here a long time, and I've probably pumped half the basements out in this town so I've kind of learned through the years that you don't want a basement if you live out here," Johnson said.

Advice that's saved this fire chief from quite a bit of water damage over the years.

Johnson says the water has already started to recede, but it's still going to take a while for Valley Springs to return to normal.
