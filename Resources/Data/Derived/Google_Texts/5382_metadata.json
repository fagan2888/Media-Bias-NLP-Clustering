In the 40-plus years since the Supreme Court affirmed a woman\u2019s right to an abortion with its Roe v. Wade decision, conservatives and the religious right have crusaded to overturn it, sometimes peacefully, sometimes not.\n\nNEWS ANNOUNCER: Now in 1994, the violence reaches an all-time high.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Thanks to a sustained legal strategy in particular, which includes achieving a Supreme Court majority of five conservative Catholic men, all appointed by Republican presidents, they have been inching toward success. This session alone, the court limited health insurance coverage for contraception and made it easier for protesters to demonstrate outside abortion clinics.\n\nMeanwhile, several states have already passed regulations that effectively restrict access to safe, legal clinics. More than half the American women of reproductive age now live in states hostile to abortion access. Let me repeat that: more than half the women of reproductive age now live in states hostile to their constitutional right.\n\nIn Washington, Senate Democrats have introduced the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act to counter those state and local restrictions on reproductive freedom. At a hearing this week voices were heard both for and against the bill:\n\nNANCY NORTHRUP: This is the newest tactic in a four decade campaign to deprive women of the promise of Roe v. Wade. There have been, during those four decades, terrorizing physical attacks, clinics bombed, vandalized and torched, doctors and clinic workers murdered, and clinics blockaded. [\u2026] Today, women\u2019s access to abortion services is being blocked through an avalanche of pretextual laws that are designed to accomplish by the pen what could not be accomplished through brute force: the closure of facilities providing essential reproductive healthcare to women of this country. At an alarming rate, states are passing laws that single out reproductive health providers for excessively burdensome regulations designed to regulate them out of practice under the false pretense of health and safety.\n\nTED CRUZ: The legislation this committee is considering is extreme legislation. It is legislation designed to eliminate reasonable restrictions on abortion that states across this country have put in place. [\u2026] And it is also a very real manifestation of a war on women given the enormous health consequences that unlimited abortion has had damaging the health, and sometimes even the lives of women.\n\nBILL MOYERS: We\u2019ll talk about these and other developments now with Cecile Richards. Since she became president of the Planned Parenthood Federation in 2006, the number of its supporters has doubled to seven million. Before her current position, she organized low-wage workers in the hotel and health care fields in California, and founded the Texas Freedom Network to champion civil liberties and religious freedom in her native state. She also served as deputy chief of staff to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of the House. Cecile Richards, welcome.\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Thanks for having me.\n\nBILL MOYERS: An impartial observer looking on could reasonably conclude that you\u2019re losing the political battle over abortion.\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: I actually don\u2019t think that\u2019s correct. Now, I will say that in 2010 the elections where frankly the Tea Party swept into the US House of Representatives and took over state legislatures and they have had a very clear agenda which is to roll back women\u2019s access. But whenever these issues are actually on the ballot, whether in a candidate, or even, I\u2019ll just give you an example.\n\nThe state of Mississippi where, you know, the far right tried to push the legislature, pushed a bill that would\u2019ve outlawed abortion in that state. The voters of Mississippi, not a progressive state I don\u2019t think we\u2019d say, they overwhelmingly, rejected that.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Yet 14 years ago a third of women of reproductive age lived in states considered hostile to abortion access. Now more than half do. Why is that not losing?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the states, I think it\u2019s the state legislatures. I do think the state legislatures have moved dramatically to the right, and not just on women\u2019s issues, on a whole, on voting rights issues, on a whole host of issues.\n\nUnfortunately, a wing of the Republican Party, the most extreme wing that believes abortion should not be legal, that believes birth control should not be available are really in charge of the primary process.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Is it conceivable to you that your opponents have won the moral argument, that is they\u2019ve convinced enough people in conservative circles that abortion is morally wrong, leaving politicians that you talk about no choice but to go where the voters lead?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: I fundamentally disagree with that. People, look, and we at Planned Parenthood talk to voters a lot, talk to the public a lot. People in this country believe that abortion is a very personal and often complex issue. They overwhelmingly believe, though, again that these are personal, private decisions that women have to be able to make with their doctors, with their family, with their loved ones.\n\nAnd that the last thing they want is politicians making the most personal decisions for a family, that is, again, that crosses party line, that crosses gender, age. And young people in this country can\u2019t imagine going back to a time where abortion was illegal and not available.\n\nBILL MOYERS: You put your finger on the paradox. Surveys show the majority of Americans believe a woman and her doctor, not politicians, should be making these decisions. 68 percent of young Americans believe abortion services should be available where they live. Why doesn\u2019t that translate into political success?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: I think it does. And I\u2019ll give you a couple of examples, but we have a long way to go. I give you that. I, the last presidential election to me was quite interesting. I mean, that was by all, you know, was going to be a very close election by all accounts. But we had two candidates, you know, Mitt Romney who said he wanted to overturn Roe, that he wanted to get rid of Planned Parenthood, President Obama who strongly supported women\u2019s rights.\n\nWe had the biggest gender gap ever in polling in a presidential election. And we just saw this in the Virginia governor\u2019s race. Fascinating. You know, a race that I think folks thought was going to be very, very tough. Where you had two candidates. Terry McAuliffe, who supported women\u2019s access to birth control, Planned Parenthood.\n\nKen Cuccinelli, the sitting attorney general, who opposed basically all of women\u2019s rights. That, I would say that election was decided by women, you know? There was a nine point gender gap for Terry McAuliffe. He won that race by about two and a half points. So it\u2019s when women know what\u2019s at stake and they go out to vote, they can determine pretty much any election in the country.\n\nBILL MOYERS: So given that, how do you explain that in our home state. Governor Rick Perry said that he intends to make abortion, \u201ca thing of the past.\u201d He\u2019s succeeding there.\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Well, actually I disagree. He\u2019s not making abortion a thing of the past. He\u2019s making safe and legal abortion a thing of the past. And I think this is what\u2019s very distressing and is that what, of course, the impact of these regulations are disproportionately felt on low income women, on women who are, live in rural areas of the state.\n\nWe\u2019re having women now go across the border to Mexico because they can\u2019t access legal abortion in the state of Texas. So again, you know, our goal at Planned Parenthood is to make abortion safe and legal and to help women get preventive care that they need to reduce unintended pregnancy in the first place. Unfortunately Governor Perry is doing away with all of that.\n\nWhen the governor and the legislature started going after women\u2019s health care in the state, ending the women\u2019s health program, dozens of health centers that didn\u2019t provide abortion services had to shut down because they served low income women and they didn\u2019t have the funds to continue.\n\nBILL MOYERS: There was a story out of Houston the other day that there\u2019s now an underground railroad for women seeking abortion services.\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Absolutely, I think what we\u2019re seeing is pre-Roe activities now of women trying to figure out how to get around the country because there are increasingly states where you may have a legal right to an abortion, but effectively you have no access. In Texas it\u2019s really in some ways the test case for all of these restrictions. We\u2019re going to, I think, this fall by September when all of these regulations come into effect, we\u2019ll see in a state as large as, that\u2019s as large as the country of France there\u2019ll be seven, probably seven health centers left in the state of Texas where women can access a safe and legal abortion.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Down from what?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Oh dozens. But I think the thing that\u2019s important, Bill, is that it\u2019s far beyond that. Because the impact is certainly on the ability to access abortion services, but it also has been devastating on women\u2019s ability to even access family planning and basic preventive care.\n\nBILL MOYERS: I hear you saying and you and others that the constitutional right expressed in Roe v. Wade has hit the hard rock of political reality. Is Roe being rendered null and void by politics?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Well, we\u2019re seeing some states, yes, where I believe the state legislatures are hollowing out the rights under Roe in every conceivable way. I think this court as well is, has been more sympathetic to those efforts to undermine women\u2019s access. Again, not only to safe and legal abortion, but certainly to birth control as well. And that\u2019s very worrisome.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Do you really think that Women\u2019s Health Protection Act that was debated this week could undo some of the damage being caused by this onslaught of regulations?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Absolutely. And I think it\u2019s so important. Essentially what the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act does is says you have to treat women\u2019s reproductive health care and abortion access like you do all other medical procedures, really to try to stem the tide of these extreme bills that are being passed that are created enormous barriers for women to just access basic legal rights.\n\nBILL MOYERS: You heard Senator Cruz call it extreme legislation. He says the state restrictions on abortions are, and I\u2019m quoting him, \u201creasonable,\u201d and are intended to protect the health and safety of women. He also says it\u2019s people like you and your allies who are waging this war on women by supporting unlimited abortion that has sometimes cost women their lives.\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Well, I just, I don\u2019t even know where to start. It is ironic that he comes from the state of Texas where the restrictions upon women\u2019s ability to access again preventive care, family planning, safe and legal abortion have never been worse.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing in Texas is as radical as any state in the country in terms of eliminating women\u2019s ability to plan their families. And, you know, I would also say to Senator Cruz it\u2019s really important to recognize this is not a partisan issue for women.\n\nWomen, 99 percent of women in this country use family planning, okay. So that\u2019s a news flash, I think something he ought to look at.\n\n98 percent of Catholic women have used family planning at some point. So for women, birth control is not a moral issue. It\u2019s not a social issue. It is a basic healthcare issue. It\u2019s an economic issue.\n\nAnd women, men, the majority of this country supports Roe, they support women being able to make their own decisions about their pregnancies. And they, I can absolutely guarantee what they don\u2019t want is politicians making the most personal, private decisions that women and their families make.\n\nBILL MOYERS: What is your response to what some of your opponents say that abortion is vastly different from other procedures and therefore needs higher medical standards? Is there any merit in that argument?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Absolutely none. I mean, again, abortion is one of the safest medical procedures in the country. And so it is, this is, and I think it, look, it\u2019s something I think we have to talk about is that it is, this is something that has, one of the most incredible things that I think that has happened since the Roe decision, and I talk to doctors who were around pre-Roe who said, you know, routinely young healthy women were dying in emergency rooms across this country simply because they had no access to terminate a pregnancy in a medical setting.\n\nSo, look, we\u2019ve have had politicians admit it. You know, they say that they\u2019re for women\u2019s health and safety, but they\u2019re not. They simply want to close down access to abortion services and as Governor Perry said, make abortion in his words, \u201ca thing of the past.\u201d\n\nBILL MOYERS: If the services continue to be closed down as is happening in Texas, why can\u2019t hospitals start taking up the slack? Couldn\u2019t they offer patients considerably more privacy, for example, than these health centers where there are protestors outside confronting the women?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Well, I mean, look, I\u2019m very grateful to hospitals that do provide abortion services. And I would hope more of them would be. I mean, as you know, many of the hospitals in this country now are owned by the Catholic Church or have Catholic affiliation. They not only will not provide abortion services, they will not provide a whole host of reproductive healthcare.\n\nAnd so there has to be in this country a public health care system that will ensure that women can get access to the care that they need regardless of religion. And that is becoming increasingly a problem. And not only, it\u2019s a problem in Texas, it\u2019s a problem across the country.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Let me ask you this, this Hobby Lobby decision gives the owner of a business on religious grounds, the power to deny coverage of birth control to\u2013\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Right.\n\nBILL MOYERS: \u2013his employees. Saying in effect, that the religious beliefs of the owner triumph over the preventive health needs for women workers. Capital has religious rights, labor doesn\u2019t. Where\u2019s this going to take us?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: I don\u2019t know. I mean, look, this is, this decision, which I know some people have described has narrow, is very troublesome. I mean, I think certainly Justice Ginsberg dissent is correct. This is full of minefields. I was actually there for the Hobby Lobby argument, and it was stunning to see the lack of regard for women.\n\nBut from that decision, and other decisions that have, that, you know, certainly had the buffer zone decision, you know, it\u2019s better to be a corporation today than to be a woman in front of the Supreme Court. And I think that the Hobby Lobby decision is just the beginning of giving corporations free license to obey those rules and laws that they agree with and not ones that they don\u2019t agree with.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Giving the owners\u2013\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Absolutely.\n\nBILL MOYERS: \u2013or the managers and share\u2013\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: The CEOs, that\u2019s right.\n\nBILL MOYERS: It\u2019s the CEOs.\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: That\u2019s correct\u2013\n\nBILL MOYERS: They will be calling the shots more often?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: That\u2019s exactly right. How could the rights of one CEO, you know, or the beliefs, the religious beliefs of one CEO and his family trump the right of thousands of women to make their own decision? Nothing about the Affordable Care Act requires women to use birth control.\n\nBut as we\u2019re already seeing, millions of women are already benefiting from being able to make that decision themselves. To make their own choice about what kind of birth control they\u2019d like to use, if they want to use it, and to get it paid for and to help plan their families.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Aren\u2019t those owners saying, well, we can\u2019t provide it because of our religious objections. But they can get it from the government.\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Well, I mean, you look at this decision as if somehow that we\u2019re going to just throw everything back to this Congress to fix? I just think it is, I mean, it\u2019s not even laughable because, of course, the future and the healthcare of millions of women are at stake.\n\nBut I\u2013 that\u2019s where I feel like the Supreme Court completely overstepped their bounds, which is this is a law. This is a law that was passed by Congress, that is, that has now been in effect. Millions of women are accessing birth control.\n\nThis is really opening the door to saying to employers, if you, or CEOs, you know, if you have a religious objection to this or anything else, I mean, with you, it\u2019s a slippery slope here, that you can actually, you know, we\u2019ll let the government try to figure out what to do about it.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Have we opened another stage in the old debate in this country over religious liberties?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: I absolutely think so, I mean, we believe in religious liberties, but not the right of, to use your religion and enforce your religion, your religious beliefs on someone else.\n\nBILL MOYERS: So why do you think Hobby Lobby erupted in the public awareness? What was it about that decision that caught the public imagination?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Some folks aren\u2019t necessarily following the day to day like you and I do perhaps on all these issues. And when they heard that the Supreme Court had said that there were women who couldn\u2019t get birth control from their employer, I think people were just in shock. Really, disbelief, that somehow it\u2019s 2014 and we are still arguing about women being able to access birth control? It just doesn\u2019t make sense. Again, you have every woman in the country virtually using it. They don\u2019t see this as a controversial issue.\n\nBILL MOYERS: What do you think will come from the court\u2019s junking of the 35-foot buffer zone?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Well, we\u2019re already seeing in Massachusetts that absolutely, immediately after that decision eliminating the buffer zone we had record numbers of protesters outside of the following women all the way up to the door of our health center in Massachusetts. These are not all kindly, elderly ladies simply whispering in the ears.\n\nAnd even if they were, it is the right of women in this country to be able to access healthcare that they need without harassment and without the advice of dozens of people outside their health center. I mean, can you imagine if, you know, if men in this country, before going into their doctor had to walk through a gauntlet of protesters telling them, you know, whether it\u2019s not to get a colonoscopy or just go down the list. It\u2019s incredible.\n\nI think now we\u2019ll see challenges to buffer zones across the country. And look, I, it\u2019s hard not to escape the irony of the enormous buffer zone that the Supreme Court enjoys in front of their court. And why we can\u2019t afford that same right to women who are simply trying to access healthcare, I just don\u2019t understand.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Did you ever see that HBO documentary the \u201cSoldiers in the Army of God\u201d? Here\u2019s some scenes from it.\n\nPAUL HILL in Soldiers in the Army of God: Abortionists are murderers! Murderers should be executed!\n\nI definitely felt that the Lord wanted me to shoot the abortionists.\n\nBOB LOKEY in Soldiers in the Army of God: We need a civil war that will kill a whole lot of people.\n\nNEWS REPORTER in Soldiers in the Army of God: Investigators say evidence places Rudolph at the bombing. They aren\u2019t sure whether others may be involved.\n\nREGINA DINWIDDIE in Soldiers in the Army of God: I hate to quote Chairman Mao, but he was right: kill one, scare a thousand.\n\nNEWS REPORTER in Soldiers in the Army of God: Dr. John Britton and clinic volunteer Jim Barrett lay dead. Police arrested Paul Hill a half block away.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Most people who oppose abortion wouldn\u2019t advocate that kind of violence. But how do you explain the passion that enters into this debate?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Well look, I think this is always going to be a topic where people have strong personal feelings. But I do believe the rhetoric that is now, that is sort of tolerated, and frankly that we hear from elected officials oftentimes does encourage people to sort of put women in a certain place, certainly doctors in a certain place.\n\nAnd, you know, it\u2019s very tough to watch this footage. But I think it\u2019s important because, of course, this is why the Massachusetts buffer zone was passed in the first place. This was not simply an intellectual idea, it was because women and doctors and clinicians were under enormous personal safety risks. And\u2013\n\nBILL MOYERS: The two people were murdered there.\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: That\u2019s correct. And listen, in my eight years at Planned Parenthood, the toughest day was on a Sunday morning when I got a call that George Tiller in Kansas had been shot in his church. And amazingly courageous man who had cared for women in a, the most selfless and, again, always at risk for his own safety. We can\u2019t go back to those days. And that\u2019s where when you ask me where is this country, that\u2019s not where this country wants to go. And we\u2019re not going to.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Have you received any death threats?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: I try not to read everything that comes in over the transom. And the folks I really, I think when I get up in the morning, I don\u2019t fear for myself. But I take very seriously the safety of our doctors and our clinicians and our patients. And that\u2019s foremost in my mind all the time.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Is there a war on women? Or has that become a convenient metaphor?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: It\u2019s not a term I use. But in some ways, if the shoe fits, you know, I feel like I don\u2019t like to think there\u2019s a war on women. But the evidence is that there is certainly within some, certainly some elements of the Republican party, and unfortunately a lot of the leadership, and a lot of politicians in this country, folks who are uncomfortable, I believe, with women being equal in America.\n\nAnd, I mean, it\u2019s why we can\u2019t seem to pass, you know, we can\u2019t pass an equal pay bill, we can\u2019t, we don\u2019t want to have women access to reproductive healthcare. And I just don\u2019t think young people in this country are going to let them get away with it. And that\u2019s what, you know, that\u2019s my hope, is that it\u2019s our kids and their generation that aren\u2019t going to go back to a day when women were second-class citizens in America.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Cecile Richards, thank you very much for being with me.\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: It\u2019s so good to see you, Bill. Thanks for having me.\n\nBILL MOYERS: At our website, BillMoyers.com, there\u2019s some essential reading on what we\u2019ve just talked about, and a look at how the states and this year\u2019s candidates are handling the issue of reproductive freedom.\n\nWatch the discussion, as posted online on Friday, below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Planned-Parenthood-head-Cecile-Richards-Moyers-and-Company-e1437515814890-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Planned Parenthood head: Supreme Court says it\u2019s better to be a corporation than a woman"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc97b0\"", "article_summary": "Planned Parenthood head Cecile Richards [Moyers and Company]The following interview was aired on Friday on Moyers & CompanyBILL MOYERS: Welcome.\nIn Washington, Senate Democrats have introduced the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act to counter those state and local restrictions on reproductive freedom.\nI think this court as well is, has been more sympathetic to those efforts to undermine women\u2019s access.\nBut from that decision, and other decisions that have, that, you know, certainly had the buffer zone decision, you know, it\u2019s better to be a corporation today than to be a woman in front of the Supreme Court.\nBILL MOYERS: Yet 14 years ago a third of women of reproductive age lived in states considered hostile to abortion access."}
