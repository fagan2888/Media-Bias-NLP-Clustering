Redmond, meanwhile, came highly recommended from the team\u2019s scouts.\n\nThe biggest fish swam east, though.\n\nWashington signed former Pittsburgh defensemen Matt Niskanen and Brooks Orpik to big contracts while former New York Ranger Anton Strahlman went to Tampa Bay, former Shark Dan Boyle to the New York Rangers and Buffalo\u2019s Christian Ehrhoff to the Penguins.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not disappointed it didn\u2019t happen. Yes, we did have good conversations, to be honest with you, with all of them,\u201d Sakic said, noting that Orpik and Strahlman wanted to stay out East for family reasons. \u201cWe decided to go in the direction of acquiring Brad Stuart to help our back end, and with his leadership \u2026 (and) Zach Redmond, our pro guys feel he could be what Nick Holden was for us last year.\u201d\n\nHolden, 27, signed a three-year extension with the Avs on Tuesday and is one of four players under contract for the next four seasons, joining captain/left wing Gabe Landeskog, center Matt Duchene and goalie Semyon Varlamov.\n\nSakic said no other moves to improve the blue line are planned, other than extending the contracts of restricted free agents Tyson Barrie and Stefan Elliott. Those players will join a roster that includes defensemen Erik Johnson, Jan Hejda, Ryan Wilson and Nate Guenin, plus Stuart, Holden and Redmond. Journeyman defenseman Bruno Gervais also signed as an unrestricted free agent Tuesday but is expected to begin the season in the Avs\u2019 minor-league system.\n\nOverall, Sakic said the Avs did what they set out to do. They compensated for the loss of center Paul Stastny by signing 560-goal scorer Jarome Iginla to a three-year contract, and they added another rugged winger in Jesse Winchester. Iginla, a future Hall of Famer who served as captain in Calgary for nine years, will play on a scoring line and Winchester will play more of a defensive role.\n\nStastny got a raise from St. Louis, which will pay him $7 million for four years. He was at $6.6 million per year with the Avs.\n\nSakic has been recruiting Iginla since June 25, knowing he might lose Stastny.\n\n\u201cI wish Paul all the best in St. Louis, just not against us,\u201d Sakic said.\n\nColorado also added another former NHL captain, Daniel Briere, on Monday, in exchange for fellow forward P.A. Parenteau, now with Montreal. Sakic said moving Parenteau was mostly based on the fact he is not suited for a third-line role. Briere is more of a two-way player than Parenteau, and the trade frees up $4 million for 2015-16.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely happy with what we\u2019ve done up front with Iginla and Dan Briere before that,\u201d Sakic said. \u201cWe added size, we added toughness, experience \u2014 everything we wanted to do we feel we accomplished.\u201d\n\nThe Avs are about $10 million under the $69 million salary cap, with restricted free agent forward Ryan O\u2019Reilly expected to eat up at least $5.4 million of cap space. Colorado currently has the 13th highest NHL payroll.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers @denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers\n\nOnes that got away\n\nThe Avalanche failed to lure one of the top unrestricted free-agent defensemen when the open market opened Tuesday.
