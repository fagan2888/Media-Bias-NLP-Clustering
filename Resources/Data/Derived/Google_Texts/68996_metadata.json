They first ought to consider their use of medical services, whether they have a chronic condition, and that the lowest-level, \u201cbronze\u201d plans don\u2019t trigger all of the available subsidies, he said.\n\n\u201cGetting people to understand that and to be able to walk through that complicated system is a challenge,\u201d said McCoy, who is chief medical officer at Dallas-based Blue Cross, the dominant player in the state\u2019s marketplace with 570,000 of the 1.2 million enrollees last year.\n\nPremiums have increased in Dallas-Fort Worth by just 3.9 percent, using the second-lowest-cost \u201csilver\u201d plan as a benchmark, according to federal officials. That compares with a 5.1 percent increase in all of Texas and 7.5 percent overall for the 37 states with federally run marketplaces.\n\nLocally, competition for people\u2019s \u2014 and the government\u2019s \u2014 dollars remains vigorous.\n\nMore plans this year\n\nThis year, Dallas County residents shopping on HealthCare.gov can choose from seven insurers offering 68 plans, 10 more than were offered by just six insurers last year.\n\nBut consumers will see fewer plans that let them use doctors and hospitals that are out of network. Last year, the federally run marketplace offered Dallas County consumers 20 \u201cpreferred provider organization,\u201d or PPO, plans and five \u201cpoint of service\u201d plans, which can provide at least some reimbursement for out-of-network care.\n\nThis year, there are just nine PPO plans and no point of service offerings. Blue Cross is offering only health maintenance organization plans this time. But McCoy noted that the carrier has added a few more-expensive Blue Advantage Plus HMO plans that offer \u201csome limited out of network benefits.\u201d And the number of \u201cexclusive provider organization\u201d plans, which allow an out-of-network visit only in an emergency, has more than tripled, to 32, in Dallas County.\n\nIn the state as a whole, the picture is a bit murkier.\n\nThe Texas marketplace has 17 insurers offering plans this time, up from 14 last year. But the average number of plans per county declined to 50, from 60. The number of counties with just one or two insurers participating \u2014 most of them rural \u2014 shot up to 198, from 158 last year, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported earlier this month.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, though, proclaimed during several recent stops in Texas that the state exchange is working well. She said too few state residents are familiar with it.\n\nIn May, a national poll showed 59 percent of the uninsured did not know of or didn\u2019t understand the premium-offsetting tax credits offered in the marketplace. A family of four with income between $24,250 and $97,000 can receive the credits. The lower the income, the higher the credit. In Texas this year, the average credit is $244 a month.\n\nForty-seven percent of uninsured Americans have never even looked at the HealthCare.gov website, according to the poll, which PerryUndem Research did for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. It surveyed 1,270 working-age adults. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.\n\n\u201cThe biggest obstacle is understanding that you can get coverage and [that] there are funds that could make it affordable to you,\u201d said Stacey Pogue, a health policy expert at the center-left think tank the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which supports Obamacare.\n\nThe \u2018bronze trap\u2019\n\nAnother common pitfall is the \u201cbronze trap.\u201d Under the federal law, a four-person household making between $24,250 and $60,625 can receive a second category of financial help, known as \u201ccost-sharing reductions.\u201d\n\nBasically, the federal government buys down out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles and co-payments. But you have to pick a silver plan, not bronze, to trigger the additional help.\n\nDeciding whether a bronze plan\u2019s lower premiums should override the subsidized silver plan\u2019s richer coverage, albeit with somewhat higher premiums, can require the help of a savvy counselor, experts say.\n\nA steep learning curve and limited time leads to \u201ca deluge in the last two weeks\u201d of the marketplace enrollment period, which ends Jan. 31, said Martha Blaine of the Community Council of Greater Dallas.\n\nAcross Texas, federally funded community health clinics have hired about 400 \u201ccertified application counselors.\u201d Locally, there are also 18 more extensively trained \u201cnavigators.\u201d They are paid with federal grant money given to Blaine\u2019s nonprofit agency, which for many years has helped enroll the elderly in Medicare and youngsters in the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s human nature. Everybody waits until the very last minute to sign up for anything,\u201d Blaine said. Consumers have just a month left to buy if they want coverage to kick in Jan. 1, she noted. Otherwise, the start of coverage slips later into 2016.\n\nAnyone who is in the U.S. legally and not incarcerated can buy coverage on the marketplace. But the tax credits can go only to people who are uninsured or don\u2019t have access through work or other government programs to coverage they can afford.\n\nIn the Dallas-Fort Worth TV market, which spans more than 30 counties, there are about 446,000 marketplace-eligible uninsured people, according to figures released last week by the federal Department of Health and Human Services. In the country, that\u2019s second only to the Los Angeles TV market, which had 480,000. The Houston TV market ranked No. 4, with 392,000.\n\nA sharp increase in fines for lacking coverage may sway at least some fence-sitters. For 2016, the penalty easily could cost a family thousands of dollars.\n\nBlue Cross pricing\n\nBlue Cross\u2019 McCoy said that the company\u2019s July decision to discontinue PPO plans in the Obamacare exchange affected about 44,000 residents of Dallas, Tarrant, Collin and Denton counties and 112,000 more in the rest of the state.\n\nHealth insurance broker John Krantz at Dallas\u2019 McLaughlin Brunson Insurance Agency said Blue Cross used \u201cland grab\u201d tactics two years ago, deliberately underpricing its products to gain market share.\n\nMcCoy said pricing of the PPO plans, which lost the company $400 million last year, was \u201can honest mistake\u201d caused by the newness of the venture.\n\n\u201cNo data was really available to understand what that risk would be and how to calculate premiums,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cmost of our major competitors\u201d have also dropped PPO plans.\n\nFormer Clinton administration budget official Dan Mendelson said having 68 plans offered by seven carriers is good news for Dallas County consumers.\n\nThe local marketplace is \u201cstrong, competitive [and] a decently functioning environment,\u201d said Mendelson, founder and chief executive of Avalere Health, which advises companies about health insurance.\n\nKrantz, though, said the marketplace can\u2019t be sustained for long. Blue Cross\u2019 move caused turmoil, and the federal law\u2019s requirement of comprehensive benefits in each plan, along with free preventive care and screenings, is creating costs that eventually will cause a death spiral, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re actually building is a non-competitive market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe left-leaning think tank\u2019s Pogue, though, said it\u2019s a vast improvement over the individual health insurance market before 2014. In that market, insurers could send premiums through the roof for people with pre-existing conditions, she noted.\n\n\u201cThere was no ability to even understand what the prices were, and you were never comparing apples to apples,\u201d she said. \u201cHere, you can really shop.\u201d\n\nKey dates\n\nNov. 1: Start of open enrollment \u2014 the first day you can enroll in a 2016 insurance plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace.

The federal government offers the credits on a sliding scale to eligible individuals and families with incomes up to four times the federal poverty level. The credits are based on consumers\u2019 estimates of their income for the year ahead. If they claim too much in advance, they repay the government when they file a federal tax return for that year. Find out here if your income is in range to qualify.\n\nCost sharing reductions: A discount that lowers how much consumers have to pay out-of-pocket for deductibles, coinsurance and co-payments. Household income must not exceed 250 percent of the federal poverty level -- or $60,625 for a family of four. To receive the help, a consumer must buy a \u201csilver\u201d plan. Find out more and if you qualify here.\n\nExclusive provider organizations (EPO): An insurance plan where services are covered only if patients go to doctors, specialists or hospitals in the plan\u2019s network, except in an emergency. The insurer manages the care, through requiring prior authorization of drugs and certain services. Plan members, though, do not have to choose a primary care doctor who provides referrals to specialists \u2013 as they must in a health maintenance organization.\n\nHealth maintenance organizations (HMO): An insurance plan that usually limits coverage to care from doctors who work for or contract with the HMO. The plans often provide integrated care and focus on prevention and wellness. Except in emergency situations, patients need a referral from their designated primary care physician, or gatekeeper. The plans generally won't cover out-of-network care except in an emergency.\n\nPoint of service plans (POS): An \u201cadd on\u201d plan, typically tacked onto a health maintenance organization policy to allow some out-of-network coverage. As with an HMO plan, the patient must choose an in-network primary care physician who makes referrals to specialists. As is not true of an HMO plan, the specialists may be out of network, though the plan will pay less than it does for in-network care.\n\nPreferred provider organizations (PPO): A type of health plan that is generally more expensive because it contracts with a broader array of hospitals and doctors to form its provider network. It\u2019s the only type of plan that always has some coverage for out-of-network services, if at lower levels than for in-network care. Plan members don\u2019t need to select a primary care physician, and may go to any health care professionals they want without a referral.\n\nSOURCES: Commonwealth of Massachussetts Group Insurance Commission; Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan; ehealthinsurance.com; HealthCare.gov; healthinsurance.org; Kaiser Family Foundation; Texas Association of Health Plans; Texas Medical Association; Dallas Morning News research.\n\nWhere to find help\n\nGet Covered America: Find expert help in choosing a plan in the marketplace by entering your ZIP code to find appointments with local application assisters.\n\nLocalhelp.healthcare.gov: Find local organizations with trained navigators and certified application counselors online or by calling toll-free 1-800-318-2596.\n\nCommunity Council of Greater Dallas: Call to make an appointment with one of the agency\u2019s 18 trained navigators in Dallas-Fort Worth: 469-740-6071.\n\nFind an agent or broker: To find local licensed insurance agents and brokers, visit the National Association of Health Underwriters website.
