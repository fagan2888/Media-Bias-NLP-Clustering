WASHINGTON–Sylvia Burwell, the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary, will be in Dallas Tuesday to promote insurance enrollment, a visit that comes amid a raging fight over Planned Parenthood funding.

Last week, state officials moved to end Medicaid contracts with the women’s health provider. The state health agency’s inspector general cited undercover video from an anti-abortion group and whistleblower’s account indicate illegal billing practices. Planned Parenthood has until mid-November to appeal.

Texas Democrats have asked Burwell’s office to investigate the contract termination, calling it politically motivated.

The Planned Parenthood fight may overshadow the announced purpose of Burwell’s visit: to boost enrollment in Affordable Care Act health plans. The open enrollment period begins Nov. 1. She will meet with Dallas officials to discuss local enrollment efforts and tour Parkland Memorial Hospital.

Burwell has named Dallas one of the top five targets for enrollment, as Texas remains the state with the highest rate of uninsured people, despite a drop of 8 percentage points as of April.

At the last enrollment deadline in February, nearly a million Texans had signed up for health insurance plans under Obamacare.
