We don\u2019t know what he really is willing to fight for. We don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s really willing to fight for anything.\u201d Christie added: \u201cWe don\u2019t know who he really likes or dislikes. We don\u2019t know whether he really cares about his own party, or the other party, or about the country.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know what Obama stands for? Really? President Obama has made it perfectly clear what he stands for, and unlike Governor Christie, Obama actually stands for those things even when the heat is on.\n\nChris Christie was all about President Obama when he needed something for his state, but now that he is losing support for his hopeful bid for the GOP nomination, Chris Christie is all bluster and projection. It is Christie, of course, who is demonstrating someone who does not stand for their principles, when he stabs Obama in the back questioning the President\u2019s patriotism.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if Obama is willing to fight for anything? LOL. See Obamacare. That was a bit of a fight. It made a stir. It\u2019s still making a stir. So, count one for the rest of the country knows that Obama is willing to fight for affordable health insurance for everyone.\n\nWhat is Christie willing to fight for? His state? Yes, but now that he got what he wanted, he\u2019s all mean girl in the hallway \u2014 no spine, no backbone. No courage to stand for what he really believes in.\n\nWe don\u2019t know who Obama likes? Yes, it\u2019s true, the President isn\u2019t someone who makes decisions based on personal emotions. He doesn\u2019t run around bullying school teachers like Christie does. And in Christie\u2019s circles, this is a sign of strength \u2014 bullying a constituent. So it follows that because Obama doesn\u2019t make it a habit to bully people like a crude school yard child, Christie isn\u2019t sure who he \u201clikes\u201d. President Obama is a person of ideas, not personalities. He\u2019s a thinker. But he is also a man of decisive action, who made the call to get Bin Laden. We aren\u2019t sure who he likes? That\u2019s just weak tea politics.\n\nChris Christie is suffering from a string of high profile investigations and accusations, so naturally he is turning to Obama hate to save himself. If he just hates Obama enough, and accuses the President of not loving America, Republicans will love him.\n\nAnd what does that say about Republicans? They don\u2019t seem to care what a candidate stands for \u2014 so long as the candidate will act like a school yard bully tossing rocks at the President. The GOP seems to know no bottom for juvenile, childish behavior.
