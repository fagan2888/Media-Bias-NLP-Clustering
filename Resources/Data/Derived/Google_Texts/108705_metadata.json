After the fire bombing a few years ago, he kept publishing cartoons offensive to some. Speculation is it led to attacks that happened behind us.\n\nCARTOONIST: I cannot believe that. I had the chance to know some of them. These cartoonists are so crazy and independent. No one can have drag them anywhere.\n\nCNN REPORTER: Charb said a few years ago he would rather die than live like a rat. He was willing to be killed for these cartoons and this thought he wanted to express. Did the others \u2014 do the others who work in this magazine feel the same way?\n\nCARTOONIST: I think yes. I think they knew what they were doing, and they know what they\u2019re doing. They believe what they\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re going to change or, for example, Charb, changed their mind in any way. I can\u2019t believe that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cartoonist Defends Murdered Editor From Charlie Hebdo Founder's Criticisms", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Cartoonist Defends Murdered Editor From Charlie Hebdo Founder's Criticisms", "title": "Cartoonist Defends Murdered Editor From Charlie Hebdo Founder Criticism - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/char.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/01/16/cartoonist-defends-murdered-editor-from-charlie-hebdo-founder-criticism/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cartoonist Defends Murdered Editor From Charlie Hebdo Founder's Criticisms", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/char.jpg", "title": "Cartoonist Defends Murdered Editor From Charlie Hebdo Founder Criticism - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "charlie hebdo, freedom of speech, Paris Terror Attack,Breitbart TV, Jihad,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Paris Terror Attack", "published_time": "2015-01-16T14:27:37-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Jihad"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2619\"", "article_summary": "Partial transcript as follows:CNN REPORTER: He made a specific criticism of the editor, Charb, and said he pushed the message too far.\nCNN REPORTER: Charb said a few years ago he would rather die than live like a rat.\nI think they knew what they were doing, and they know what they\u2019re doing.\nThey believe what they\u2019re doing.\nFriday on CNN, a cartoonist from Iran, who came to Paris to flee persecution, defended murdered Charlie Hebdo editor St\u00e9phane Charbonnier (Charb), from one of the founding members of the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo, Henri Roussel\u2019s criticisms that Charb \u201cdragged the team into overdoing it,\u201d as reported by The Telegraph."}
