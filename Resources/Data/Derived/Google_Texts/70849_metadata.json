Healthcare Finance News takes a look at some of the options for doctors, which range from continuing on, to merging with other physicians or hospitals, to closing up shop, to retiring.\n\n\u201cWhen contemplating your future, the first thing to do is make sure you know what you want from your practice and what is important to you personally,\u201d said Kenneth Hertz, principal with the Medical Group Management Association\u2019s healthcare consulting group. \u201cHow important is autonomy? Is a steady income the main goal? Am I fed up with medicine and just want to get out? What am I not willing to compromise on and what am I comfortable letting go?\u201d\n\nFirst, put from your mind that selling your practice will result in a lot of money.\n\nThe main asset of the practice, the physician\u2019s rapport with the patients, is not transferable in a sale. Usually the doctor gets their accounts receivable as parting payment. The only other cash you are likely to get is for the current value of real estate and the office\u2019s furniture and equipment.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part of selling a practice is spending decades of your life building it up just to see it go away,\u201d said Susanne Madden, president and chief executive officer of the Verden Group in Nyack, N.Y. \u201cThis can be emotionally difficult for most doctors.\u201d\n\nTo maximize what you take away from your practice, stay involved. By planning ahead, say with a three to five year time frame, it is possible to bring in a younger doctor. After a couple years of working together, and building up trust with the older physician\u2019s patients, a buy out can be arranged.\n\nAlternatively, for those who still want to continue to practice but don\u2019t want to deal with the business side, selling to a hospital is an option, Madden noted. The hospital employs the physician, taking responsibility for billing, human resources and information technology. However, this leads to lost autonomy, as the physician becomes an employee.\n\nAnother option that is gaining acceptance is the \u201csuper group.\u201d Multiple groups come together to take advantage of economies of scale by consolidating back office functions and malpractice insurance and increasing their negotiating power with payers. They keep their individual names, partners and staff, while still enjoying the benefits of a bigger practice.\n\n\u201cThis is a very big decision and one that can be hard to reverse,\u201d Hertz cautioned doctors. \u201cTake your time to decide what you are looking for personally and professionally, know what you need to get from the transaction to meet those goals, and then look at the various models to see what fits best. But keep in mind the wisdom of Yogi Berra: \u2018You've got to be very careful if you don't know where you're going, because you might not get there.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/getting-out-options-doctors-seeking-leave-private-practice", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Various business factors and getting older have led some physicians to think about making major changes \u2013 like getting out of independent practice.
