To start off Fire Prevention Month, kids and adults took tips from the experts at Panama City's Fire Prevention Festival.

Just Before 8:30 Saturday morning, Sioux Falls Fire Rescue responded to a house fire at 2023 South Grange Ave.

Kids not only learned about fire safety, but also got an inside look from firefighters on the line of duty.

From demonstrations to watching the firemen in action, kids were able to learn the importance of fire safety.

And it wasn't just all area fire departments, even Smokey Bear came out to talk with kids.

"It's just to help the kids to get along with firemen and not be scared of them if there is, if they are in a situation of us coming into a burning building and just let them know that we're they're friends," said Lt. Benjamin Sheffield, of the Callaway Fire Department.

Fire Prevention Month fire officials say it's important to once again test your smoke alarms to make sure they're working and have a plan in case of an emergency.
