But Pat Roberts is in trouble for the same reasons incumbents usually are.\n\nIn December 1930, in the depths of the Great Depression, Kansas voters chose Democrat George McGill to complete the unexpired Senate term of Charles Curtis, who\u2019d been elected as Herbert Hoover\u2019s vice president. Two years later, Kansas helped oust Curtis\u2014and Hoover\u2014by voting for Franklin Roosevelt and re-electing McGill. Six years later, after one more dance with FDR, Kansans returned to their normal political axis. They threw out McGill\u2014and haven\u2019t looked back since. No state\u2014not Utah, not Wyoming, not Idaho\u2014has gone nearly that long sending only Republicans to the Senate. (In presidential elections since \u201936, the state has gone Democratic exactly once\u2014LBJ in his 1964 landslide.)\n\nThat\u2019s why the national press has been flocking to the Sunflower State in numbers suggesting the appearance of an alien spacecraft. The state that has gone more than three-quarters of a century without ever defeating an elected GOP senator is seriously threatening the tenure of three-term Senator Pat Roberts. In the just-released USA Today/Suffolk poll, Roberts trails his opponent by five points. (By contrast, Roberts won re-election in 2008 by 24 points). To add to the \u201cHoly Smokes!\u201d quality of this election year, Republican Governor Sam Brownback, who won office four years ago by 31 points, trails his opponent by four points.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked longtime Kansas City Star reporter David Helling what he would have told someone who\u2019d predicted this development eight months ago, he said simply: \u201cthat they\u2019re smoking something that\u2019s legal in Colorado, but not in Kansas....All the statewide offices are Republicans. All four congressmen are Republicans. The party has had by and large hegemony in Kansas for decades.\u201d Outsiders\u2014myself included\u2014have taken to grasping for the set of familiar Kansas references to paint a picture of what\u2019s happening.\n\nIt\u2019s another \u201cbleeding Kansas,\u201d reaching back to the murderous battles in the years before the Civil War between those who wanted Kansas as a free state and those who wanted a slave state. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Kansas?\u201d we ask, harkening back to a famous editorial by Emporia Gazette editor William Allen White, or the more recent bestseller by Tom Frank. Or maybe we just exclaim in wonder: \u201cI have a feeling we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore.\u201d\n\nSo permit a bit of perspective: What\u2019s happening here is not all that bizarre. Pat Roberts is in trouble for the same reasons that have afflicted many other senators. At 78, Roberts has been a part of Washington for more than half his life\u2014he began as a staff aide in 1967, and won a House seat in 1980. He long held the title of the funniest man in the Senate\u2014Al Franken may have taken that away\u2014but he still does a more than passable Jack Benny imitation, and is startlingly familiar with the work of legendary radio comedians Bob and Ray. You get a sense of how far back he goes when you ask him to describe himself. \u201cI would say probably an Eisenhower Republican,\u201d he told me, using a label that has likely not been heard for several decades. \u201cI know Bob Dole\u2014a dear friend\u2014so I\u2019m a Bob Dole Republican. But,\u201d he hastens to add, \u201cI\u2019m also the fourth-most conservative senator in the State. \u201c\n\n\n\nThat voting record is key: In a state that is often described as having both a \u201cmoderate\u201d and a \u201cconservative\u201d Republican Party, Roberts was target by the same Tea Party movement that took down Senate Republicans like Richard Lugar and Robert Bennett. While he narrowly survived a primary against a Tea Party foe, his rightward move alienated moderates like former Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum\u2014who refused to cut an ad for him.\n\nPerhaps more harmful was the charge that Roberts had \u201cgone Washington\u201d\u2014that he was too much a part of \u201cthe system,\u201d too far from his roots. It was an idea buttressed by a devastating New York Times piece last February revealing that Roberts had no home in Kansas\u2014that he rented a room in a condo on a golf course from supporters. He did not help his cause when he said on a radio show, \u201cEvery time I get an opponent\u2014I mean, a chance\u2014I come home to Kansas.\u201d\n\nA month or so ago it appeared that Roberts\u2019 best asset was the divided nature of his opposition; he faced both a Democrat and an independent, 45-year-old businessman and investor Greg Orman, with the wealth to fund his own campaign. Then Democrat Chad Taylor dropped out; and Orman took the chance to carefully separate himself from both major parties, whose approval ratings mirror that of Roger Goodell.\n\n\u201cI think both parties are really to blame for what\u2019s going on in Washington,\u201d Orman told me as he worked the Kansas State football crowd. \u201cBoth parties take extreme positions the way Harry Reid is running the Senate. He\u2019s running the Senate like a dictatorship. He\u2019s not allowing compromise, he\u2019s not allowing debate. We got the same problem in the House with the Republicans, so I think both parties are really to blame for the dysfunction that we have in Washington today. And if we don\u2019t do something different, if we don\u2019t fundamentally change Washington, we\u2019re not going to be able to solve problems, and that\u2019s going to be a real issue for the American people.\u201d\n\nWhat that \u201csomething different\u201d might be is not exactly clear. He is vague on what to do about the Keystone pipeline, what to do about Obamacare\u2014even what party he\u2019ll caucus with should he be the deciding vote on who controls the Senate. He treats it as a golden opportunity to flex Kansas\u2019 muscle.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he told me as I nabbed a couple minutes with him after a speech at a VFW, \u201cI think it's a wonderful opportunity for the voters of Kansas and what I've talked about is we will caucus with whichever party0will be willing to promote a pro-problem-solving, nonpartisan agenda.\u201d\n\nRoberts has staked his survival on branding Orman with the label most likely to unsettle undecided Kansans.\n\n\u201cHe is a liberal Democrat, and that's why you have Jeb Bush, John McCain, you have Rand Paul...I think about everybody in the party is coming\u2014conservative, I don\u2019t say moderate\u2014regular Republicans knowing how important this race is because they know Greg is a liberal Democrat. And we don\u2019t need any more of those.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "greenfield64"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201410030945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Yes, every Kansas senator since 1940 has been a Republican.
