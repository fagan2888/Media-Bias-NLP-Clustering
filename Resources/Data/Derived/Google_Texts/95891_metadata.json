This is also because plans have been \u2018narrowing their networks\u2019 while offering robust directories of providers to lure buyers to the plan.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "As a whole, 86% of network psychiatrists weren\u2019t approachable or failed to schedule a new outpatient mental health appointment.\nLatest findings have indicated that over 80% of psychiatrists within networks of a few of the biggest carriers in the Health Insurance Exchange Network in Washington, D.C. were either not approachable or don\u2019t schedule fresh visit, indicating that the access to psychiatric health care is restricted.\nIn a press release, Saul Levin, MD, MPA, CEO and medical director of the APA, said that the study has shown that a number of people have failed to access required care and people have been spending for mental health care they can\u2019t access.\nThey noted that the average wait time for a fresh outpatient appointment was roughly 21 days and just 7% psychiatrists managed to schedule a fresh outpatient appointment within 14 days.\nWhile responding to complaints stating that patients have been failing to find accessible psychiatrists in their network, the American Psychiatric Association partnered with the APA Foundation to carry out a study of the three biggest health insurance plans in the Washington, D.C.\u2019s health insurance exchange."}
