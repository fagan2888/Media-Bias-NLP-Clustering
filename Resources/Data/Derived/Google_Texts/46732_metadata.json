But when asked if she planned to enlist President Obama\u2019s help on the campaign trail, she had only two words: \u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\nMcCaskill\u2019s constituency is deeply opposed to Obamacare, and only 44 percent of Missourians voted for the Obama in 2012 \u2014 well before scandals and a disastrous healthcare rollout derailed his presidency. But the senator put on her rosy glasses to analyze if she and many congressional Democrats have \u201ca midterm problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s a challenge,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it reminds me of what everyone was saying in the early months of 2012, that Democrats couldn\u2019t hold on, that Democrats were going to lose the Senate. And we not only won in 2012, we picked up seats.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s problems on the Republican side,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey\u2019ve got some really nasty primaries out there. The dominant message in those primaries, I think, does not appeal to mainstream. And so I feel good about November.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm, she feels good about it,\u201d MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski mused skeptically. \u201cI dunno.\u201d\n\nMSNBC analyst Mark Halperin then asked if McCaskill if she \u201cwas running for election in Arkansas, Louisiana or South Carolina, would you invite the president and campaign side-by-side with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, probably not,\u201d she replied. \u201cI mean, this is \u2014 you know, I, don\u2019t \u2014 I try to be really candid and honest on this show. The president\u2019s numbers are not strong in my state or in Arkansas or Louisiana or North Carolina. He did not win those states when he ran for re-election in 2012.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t WIN,\u201d she hastened to add. \u201cThese candidates in those states are strong candidates. They have been an independent voice for their states. They know how to stay on offense and talk about the Republicans shutting down the government, and Republicans marginalizing hard-working people who come to this country wanting nothing more than to be part of the American Dream.\u201d\n\nShe finished, as all red-state Democrats must, with a subtle swipe at the Washington elite. \u201cI think this issue about whether or not you have Obama come to your state is something we like to focus on in Washington,\u201d she noted, \u201cbut probably is not that important when you get out to these states.\u201d\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
