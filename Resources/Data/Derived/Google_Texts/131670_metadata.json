Since then, Dominic has picked up composition and other instruments, and he has started teaching younger classmates.\n\nDominic plays bass, acoustic and electric guitars; an assortment of drums; clarinet; piano; vibraphone; and recorder, \u201cif that counts,\u201d he said. He also sings and has performed in musicals throughout his high school career.\n\nDominic said he writes music for the high school drum line, which he will perform with at lacrosse and basketball games.\n\nHe\u2019s in the middle of writing a musical that he said the school director promised would, if complete, be performed next year. And Dominic writes music \u2014 primarily indie rock and classical arias \u2014 for a nonet he formed with eight classmates.\n\nHe kept working when the Ellerbees were forced to separate and take shelter in the spare space at friends\u2019 and family\u2019s households.\n\nBefore Saturday\u2019s concert, Dominic said his mother found a job and that he and his sister will be moving back into an apartment with her in March. Despite the uncertainty that has defined the past year, Dominic found a life calling in composing music for his nonet and other small groups.\n\n\u201cI want to be able to do that to big, professional groups,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Homeless young instrumentalist, composer, singer finds optimism in music", "title": "Homeless young instrumentalist, composer, singer finds optimism in music", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/22/homeless-young-instrumentalist-composer-singer-finds-optimism-in-music/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140222__20140223_B2_CD23HOMELESSMUSICIANp1.jpg", "height": 468}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140222__20140223_B2_CD23HOMELESSMUSICIANp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-22T19:48:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T15:37:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And Dominic writes music \u2014 primarily indie rock and classical arias \u2014 for a nonet he formed with eight classmates.\nDominic said he writes music for the high school drum line, which he will perform with at lacrosse and basketball games.\nAt the Denver Public Schools\u2019 Citywide Honor Bands Concert on Saturday, bass guitarist and district-renowned music composer Dominic Ellerbee was grateful just to have a music stand.\n\u201cIt was hard sometimes, but it never really got to me because I had friends and music and stuff,\u201d Dominic said.\nHe also sings and has performed in musicals throughout his high school career."}
