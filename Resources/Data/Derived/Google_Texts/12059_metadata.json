Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. (Photo: Wade Payne / AP)\n\nU.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander is sponsoring bipartisan legislation in companion to a House bill to change a formula that is used in determining how much hospitals get in reimbursement from Medicare.\n\nThe bill establishes a 0.874 as the national floor for the average wage index, or AWI, which is used as a multiplier for determining what Medicare reimburses hospitals. The legislation, called the Fair Medicare Hospital Payments Act of 2016, is the Senate version of a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn.\n\nRaising the floor on the AWI would help rural and urban hospitals as they face planned reductions in Medicare payments in the coming years under tenets of the Affordable Care Act, which was designed to offset the decreased payments with expanded Medicaid payments.\n\n\u201cThis bill will protect Tennessee hospitals, and others around the country, from shrinking Medicare reimbursements that make it harder for them to recruit skilled doctors and nurses, make payroll, pay bills and care for patients,\" Alexander said in a statement.\n\nThe AWI takes into account market trends, such as labor and benefit costs. The highest AWI in the country for fiscal year 2016 is Santa Cruz, Calif., which has a $72.27 average hourly wage and 1.723 AWI.\n\nThe higher an AWI, the higher the Medicare payment.\n\nAlexander called the formula \"flawed.\"\n\nTennessee is divided into 10 districts, eight of which fall below the proposal. The Memphis core based statistical area, a federal geography, has the highest AWI in the state at 0.8923. Three districts \u2014 Bristol, Knoxville and Morristown \u2014 have the lowest at 0.7327.\n\nAcross Tennessee, the lowest average hourly wage is $28.86 in Johnson City, where the AWI is 0.7397; Chattanooga has the highest average hourly wage at $35.99, with a 0.8625 AWI.\n\nThe Tennessee Hospital Association backs the legislation to create a floor because it is of \"critical importance\" to state hospitals.\n\nThe legislation \"would bring about much-needed change to the AWI and would level the playing field for all states,\" said Craig Becker, president and CEO of the hospital association.\n\nSince 2000, nine of Tennessee's districts have seen reductions in AWI.\n\nReach Holly Fletcher at 615-259-8287 and on Twitter @hollyfletcher.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1SximmY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Raising the floor on the AWI would help rural and urban hospitals as they face planned reductions in Medicare payments.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Raising the floor on the AWI would help rural and urban hospitals as they face planned reductions in Medicare payments.", "title": "Lamar Alexander sponsors bill to boost Medicare payments", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/health-care/2016/04/21/lamar-alexander-sponsors-bill-boost-medicare-payments/83353498/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Raising the floor on the AWI would help rural and urban hospitals as they face planned reductions in Medicare payments.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d2a5d8aa66a41c04ed46dab4d02a6ef39458945b/c=578-0-3021-2443&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/02/Nashville/Nashville/635846777112672715-lamar.jpg", "title": "Lamar Alexander sponsors bill to boost Medicare payments", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Health care industry", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Health care industry", "title": "Lamar Alexander sponsors bill to boost Medicare payments", "author": "Holly Fletcher", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/industries/health-care", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/54043b3c40541ec0088334734c1a1cbbd82b04ed/c=884-0-2716-2443/local/-/media/2015/12/02/Nashville/Nashville/635846777112672715-lamar.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6c2f7d6ca8f8bd18cd78f13383c083d2f7db709e/c=578-0-3021-2443/local/-/media/2015/12/02/Nashville/Nashville/635846777112672715-lamar.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0359704bf5b48eae9c9d0d58439304167108aac9/c=175-0-3424-2443/local/-/media/2015/12/02/Nashville/Nashville/635846777112672715-lamar.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6509e98c8647b1be22b7aba3adff4fbfee4645ad/c=0-205-3600-2239&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/12/02/Nashville/Nashville/635846777112672715-lamar.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-21T19:47:49.843000-05:00", "shorthed": "Alexander sponsors bill to boost Medicare payments", "articleid": 83353498, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e32ee460097ef0ae7cba60aeea0177c417f70322/c=0-205-3600-2239/local/-/media/2015/12/02/Nashville/Nashville/635846777112672715-lamar.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/597ea46d857c62df112b44abe148a6a64f09c6b9/c=1361-0-2729-2443/local/-/media/2015/12/02/Nashville/Nashville/635846777112672715-lamar.jpg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/byhollyfletcher"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "medicare reimbursement, awi, awi in tennessee, lamar alexander Medicare, lamar alexander, Medicare hospital reimbursement,  Fair Medicare Hospital Payments Act of 2016, diane black"}, "article_summary": "Across Tennessee, the lowest average hourly wage is $28.86 in Johnson City, where the AWI is 0.7397; Chattanooga has the highest average hourly wage at $35.99, with a 0.8625 AWI.\nThe highest AWI in the country for fiscal year 2016 is Santa Cruz, Calif., which has a $72.27 average hourly wage and 1.723 AWI.\nThe bill establishes a 0.874 as the national floor for the average wage index, or AWI, which is used as a multiplier for determining what Medicare reimburses hospitals.\nSen.
