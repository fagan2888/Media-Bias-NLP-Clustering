A black man, 52 year old Andrew Coffee, Jr., was riding home from a convenience store in Indian River County, Florida, after purchasing cigarettes in the wee hours of the morning, when he was pulled over by Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Chris Lester.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy how it happened,\u201d said Roderick Scott, 35, the son\u2026 \u201cI don\u2019t understand how it happened, from you going to the store on a scooter. What was the point of stopping him?\u201d (snip) \u201cHe wants to do better for his kids and his grandkids,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s been rough, but he finds different jobs in landscaping on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nCue the righteous indignation! The excuse for pulling him over:\n\nLester pulled over Coffee because the scooter did not have a license tag, which is required.\n\nAhem. License tags are required. Not having one is indeed a good reason for a traffic stop. But what made it more interesting is what happened after the stop. Here is the dashcam video:\n\nAs Will Greenlee and Lamaur Stancil of TCPalm describe it:\n\nA dashboard camera video released by the Sheriff\u2019s Office showed Lester directing Coffee to place his hands on the hood of his patrol car. \u201cDon\u2019t reach for anything,\u201d Lester said. After Coffee walked to the front of the patrol car, he swung his fist and struck Lester in the face, the video shows. As Lester fell, Coffee pulled a gun from his waistband and began firing at the deputy, who fired back, sheriff\u2019s officials said. Lester was shot once in the leg but managed to chase Coffee about 100 yards. Coffee was struck twice in the abdomen, Scott said. Coffee\u2019s .357 magnum revolver held six cartridges, while Lester\u2019s Glock .45 handgun holds 13 in the magazine and one in the chamber, [County Sheriff Deryl] Loar said. \u201cWe know (Lester) exhausted that magazine,\u201d Loar said. \u201cHe shot 14 times and he was attempting to reload as he retreated.\u201d Flowers said investigators were trying Friday to determine how many times Coffee fired his weapon. Coffee hid from deputies, but was tracked down and found in a stack of crates at a fruit packing company, Loar said. Ten minutes later, Deputy Richard Henson and his K-9 partner Falko tracked Coffee to the hiding spot, Loar said.\n\nSome background on the man pulled over:\n\nAndrew Coffee Jr., 52, of the 4200 block of 26th Avenue in Vero Beach, was released last year from prison after serving two decades for attempted murder, according to the state Department of Corrections. In the time he was incarcerated, Coffee\u2019s four children had 21 grandchildren.\n\nLots of his descendants populating America.\n\nAnd he is well known to the Sheriff\u2019s Department:\n\nCoffee Jr. has been arrested about 20 times, almost always by the Sheriff\u2019s Office, according to Florida Department of Law Enforcement records. His first arrest was in October 1981 when he was 18, and his most recent was on Dec. 3 on drug-related charges. Coffee Jr.\u2019s other arrests were on charges including disorderly conduct, aggravated assault, battery, disorderly intoxication, sexual assault, cocaine possession and aggravated battery.\n\nFortunately, both men survived their gunshot wounds.\n\nSo go ahead, BLM: Make my day.\n\nHat tip: David Paulin", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/12/go_ahead_blacklivesmatter_make_my_day.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Go ahead #BlackLivesMatter: Make my day"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe shot 14 times and he was attempting to reload as he retreated.\u201d Flowers said investigators were trying Friday to determine how many times Coffee fired his weapon.\nAs Lester fell, Coffee pulled a gun from his waistband and began firing at the deputy, who fired back, sheriff\u2019s officials said.\nThe excuse for pulling him over:Lester pulled over Coffee because the scooter did not have a license tag, which is required.\nSurely this incident will attract protests from \u201cBlacklivesMatter.\nSo go ahead, BLM: Make my day."}
