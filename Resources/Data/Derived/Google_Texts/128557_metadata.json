Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and the Republican Congress who nearly shut down the government over Planned Parenthood are about as likely to do that as bark at the moon, but the idea is based on proven results.\n\nOn July 3, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced that, thanks to a public-private partnership on contraception access, the state\u2019s teen birth rate dropped by 40 percent and the teen abortion rate dropped by 35 percent in a four-year period. A private funder helped supply long-acting reversible contraceptives \u2013 IUDs and hormone implants \u2013 which were offered to low-income and uninsured women through state providers. Not only did the abortion and unintended pregnancy rate drop dramatically, Colorado saved an estimate $5.68 in Medicaid funds for every $1 spent on the program.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons on President Obama]\n\nSo here\u2019s my question to all the Republicans out there: If you\u2019re a fiscal conservative who wants fewer abortions and more self-sufficient citizens, why don\u2019t you support the government providing access to free birth control? This used to be a conservative position: George H.W. Bush gave a speech in Denver in 1968 advocating for government-backed family planning.\n\nThe Colorado results dovetail with another study done at Washington University in St. Louis in 2012, published in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. For three years, participants were provided free birth control, and most chose IUDs and implants. The result? \u201cChanges in contraceptive policy simulating the Contraceptive Choice Project would prevent as many as 41% to 71% of abortions performed annually in the United States,\u201d the study\u2019s authors wrote.\n\nAlso worth noting: \u201cNearly half of the more than 6 million pregnancies that occur each year are unintended, and about 43% of them end in abortion. Further, about 1 million births are unintended, costing U.S. taxpayers about $11 billion a year in associated expenses.\u201d\n\n[MORE: Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nThis is why the Affordable Care Act included birth control without a co-pay - it\u2019s not just good for women\u2019s health, it\u2019s good for America\u2019s taxpayers. And it's why the lawsuits to stop the birth control mandate are not just insulting to women but dumb, counterproductive public policy.\n\nBut the types of contraceptives used in the Colorado and St. Louis programs are the very ones that Hobby Lobby and the federal personhood bill sponsors \u2013 including Gardner \u2013 want to ban. IUDs and hormonal implants are more effective than the pill, especially among low-income, high-risk populations, because they work automatically once in place. Women don\u2019t have to remember to take a pill every day and get a refill every month. They\u2019re also the most expensive, from $500 to $1,000 for the device plus a doctor visit, so women who can\u2019t afford them are less likely to use them.\n\nSo why don\u2019t modern conservatives go back to their roots and get behind the government providing free or low-cost birth control?\n\nHere\u2019s why: because the core belief of modern conservatives doesn\u2019t reside in sound public policy. It\u2019s mostly concerned with telling women what to do and punishing them for having sex without permission or approval.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Everyone Wins When Birth Control Is Free, Even Conservatives", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Dear conservatives: Contraception means fewer abortions and lower costs to taxpayers.", "title": "Everyone Wins When Birth Control Is Free", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/laura-chapin/2014/07/28/everyone-wins-when-birth-control-is-free-even-conservatives", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/39/7e/6353cbac469d818d0641aae03bfc/140617-birthcontrol-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Dear conservatives: Contraception means fewer abortions and lower costs to taxpayers.", "card": "summary", "title": "Everyone Wins When Birth Control Is Free, Even Conservatives"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "July 28, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Laura Chapin,birth control,contraception,Republican Party,economy,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Dear conservatives: Contraception means fewer abortions and lower costs to taxpayers."}, "article_summary": "So why don\u2019t modern conservatives go back to their roots and get behind the government providing free or low-cost birth control?\nFor three years, participants were provided free birth control, and most chose IUDs and implants.\n[SEE: Cartoons on President Obama]So here\u2019s my question to all the Republicans out there: If you\u2019re a fiscal conservative who wants fewer abortions and more self-sufficient citizens, why don\u2019t you support the government providing access to free birth control?\nAnd it's why the lawsuits to stop the birth control mandate are not just insulting to women but dumb, counterproductive public policy.\nDENVER \u2013 About the only reasonable thing in Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s otherwise asinine majority opinion on Hobby Lobby was this: the suggestion that maybe the government should find ways to ensure women have cost-free access to birth control."}
