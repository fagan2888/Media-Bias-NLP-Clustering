NBC News' Chuck Todd painted a grim portrait of Democrats upset with the problems surrounding Obamacare, and blamed the president for part of the fallout from the rollout.

"Right now, you have Democrats on Capitol Hill in a full panic,” Todd told Matt Lauer on Thursday's "Today." "They’ve been nervous about this roll-out. They've been upset about the website, but now it's a full on panic."

When asked about proposed fixes to the legislation, Todd said that he spoke to one of the architects of Obamacare.

"If you start messing around with this and trying to grandfather in some of these folks, you undermine the whole premise of the law," Todd said, adding that having younger, healthier people pay more is crucial to covering the costs of insurance for people with pre-existing conditions.

“This goes to the problem that the president brought about himself," he said. “They didn’t make this clear. There are always winners and losers in any piece of legislation. There are a small number of losers in here if you want to count losing as in having to pay more for your health insurance.”
