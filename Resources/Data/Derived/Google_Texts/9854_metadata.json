Welcome to the club!\u201d AARP CEO A. Barry Rand wrote in a statement Friday.\n\n\u201cNot only is Mrs. Obama helping to change and reshape the way people look at aging in this country, but she\u2019s also showing folks how great 50 looks today. We\u2019re proud to be able to call her a member of the AARP family and know that she will continue to set a great example to all by showing that age sets no boundaries on what you can achieve in life,\u201d Rand wrote.\n\nAARP is promoting the First Lady as part of its 2014 \u201cYear of the Boomer\u201d celebrating the last of the Baby Boomers to hit 50 years of age. AARP is using the Twitter hashtag #boomers50 to push its campaign.\n\n\u201cExcited to join Barack in the 50+ club today\u2026 check out my @AARP card! \u2013mo,\u201d Michelle Obama tweeted Friday, proudly displaying her AARP card in a photograph that is now available upon request from AARP.\n\nAARP\u2019s heavy promotion of Obamacare, including creating the informational website HealthLawAnswers.org and holding informational events and health fairs, has alienated many seniors who hold membership in the organization.\n\nThe Daily Caller reported that AARP partners with the Herndon Alliance, the tiny but powerful left-wing messaging group that crafted President Obama\u2019s \u201cyou can keep your plan\u201d Obamacare lie.\n\nAARP, which is also a major health insurer that sells \u201cMedigap\u201d plans to Medicare beneficiaries to cover things that Medicare does not provide, has a financial incentive to push Obamacare.\n\nAARP saved $1.8 billion by successfully pushing to keep Medigap reform out of the final draft of Obamacare. AARP also benefits from cuts in Medicare Advantage, which will force more seniors to enroll in traditional Medicare and supplement it with Medigap plans.\n\nAARP coordinated closely with the Obama White House during the push to pass Obamacare, even helping to craft Obama\u2019s talking points and pledging its devotion to \u201cthe cause,\u201d according to previously published emails.\n\nAARP The Magazine is not the only publication wishing Michelle Obama a happy birthday. ABC News actually ran a piece Friday entitled \u201c50 Ways to Celebrate Michelle Obama\u2019s Birthday.\u201d\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "\"check out my @AARP card!\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The retired persons advocacy group AARP wished First Lady Michelle Obama a happy 50th birthday by welcoming her to \"the club\" and giving her an upcoming AARP The Magazine cover.
