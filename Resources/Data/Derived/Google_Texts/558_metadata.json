The school offers courses, grants and various mentorship programs. \u201cSome of this is letting students know it\u2019s OK to come up with ideas and try them out and fail.\u201d\n\nFor most schools, the predominate approach to teaching entrepreneurship has been project-based, says Angela Beeching, director of the Center for Music Entrepreneurship at the Manhattan School of Music, and author of \u201cBeyond Talent: Creating a Successful Career in Music.\u201d These projects are usually small, DIY-affairs\u2014examples run the gamut from a blog about jazz club bathrooms to a music festival in Silicon Valley to a superhero opera \u2014 and they are more likely to be funded by a Kickstarter campaign (or personal savings account) than a bank loan. \u201cThe lean start-up is closer to the way creative artists really operate,\u201d says Ms. Beeching.\n\nAnd the part that teachers sometimes forget to mention? \u201cAs a practicing musician, it\u2019s fun,\u201d says pianist Lara Downes, who started a concert series connecting artists and audiences. \u201cTo take the control and take the power to define your life and your future in your own hands, there\u2019s something really wonderful about that.\u201d\n\nHere are tips for musicians, classical and otherwise, looking to give their careers an entrepreneurial bent:\n\n1) When you run into strangers at the airport, know what you\u2019re going to say. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot about chance encounters,\u201d says pianist Kimball Gallagher, whose chance meeting in the Mumbai airport led to a concert tour in South Africa. Think about your elevator pitch, and convey the spark or excitement behind it. \u201cThe best partnerships and collaborations come from informally talking about your ideas,\u201d says Ms. Burton of Julliard.\n\n2) Build a personal board of directors. Identify mentors, friends and teachers who can help with everything from bouncing ideas around to developing specific skills, whether that\u2019s advice on how to make an Indiegogo video or how to approach ornamentation in a Mozart sonata. And some time-worn rules apply: Help others with their projects, and they\u2019ll help you with yours.\n\n3) Cultivate a brand-new audience. Don\u2019t just rely on traditional music audiences, but use personal connections to build your own. After a show, a performer should have the email address or Facebook information for every attendee in hand. \u201cKeep in touch with them,\u201d says Greg Sandow, a consultant and specialist focusing on the future of classical music, who also teaches at Juilliard. \u201cKeep them interested and build for the next thing.\u201d\n\n4) Fantasize, a lot. Ms. Beeching, of the Manhattan School, has a phrase from the business world that she likes to use with students: Big Hairy Audacious Goal. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely the way artists think!\u201d she says. Kimball Gallagher, the pianist, does an exercise in which he asks musicians crazy questions: a place they want to go before they die, something crazy they want to do onstage, and someone they\u2019d like to meet. Then he takes the resulting scenarios\u2014\u201cplaying violin while skydiving in Kenya with Nelson Mandela in the audience\u201d\u2014and brainstorms ways to make that happen. Create the fantasy, and then make a plan to get there.\n\n5) Don\u2019t mind the eye-rolls. Evaluate your core beliefs about the music world, and don\u2019t be afraid to challenge them, says Mr. Gallagher. For example, while some view house concerts as a waste of time, he disagrees: \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a lot of eye rolls: \u2018It\u2019s just a house [concert], not that big of a deal.\u2019\u201d But one thing leads to another; Mr. Gallagher\u2019s current spate of house concerts will end with a performance at Carnegie Hall next year.\n\n6) Artistic excellence is non-negotiable. All the Facebooking, tweeting, networking and Kickstartering in the world won\u2019t sell a performance of subpar quality. And view the pairing of artistic excellence and creativity as a way to keep classical music (and your career!) alive, relevant and exciting. \u201cI think [entrepreneurship] totally reconfigures classical music to the outside world, which is something that badly needs to happen to the entire field,\u201d says Mr. Sandow.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Six tips for musicians, classical and otherwise, looking to give their careers an entrepreneurial bent:", "title": "Six Ways to Make it As a Musician Without Entering the Concert Hall", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/19/six-ways-to-make-it-as-a-musician-without-entering-the-concert-hall/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YY943_nymusi_G_20130919095838.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Six Ways to Make it As a Musician Without Entering the Concert Hall", "description": "Six tips for musicians, classical and otherwise, looking to give their careers an entrepreneurial bent:", "article_section": "New York", "author": "WSJ Staff", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "Six tips for musicians, classical and otherwise, looking to give their careers an entrepreneurial bent:", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-19T14:29:33-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/19/six-ways-to-make-it-as-a-musician-without-entering-the-concert-hall/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-18534", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Six tips for musicians, classical and otherwise, looking to give their careers an entrepreneurial bent:", "title": "Six Ways to Make it As a Musician Without Entering the Concert Hall", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/19/six-ways-to-make-it-as-a-musician-without-entering-the-concert-hall/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YY943_nymusi_G_20130919095838.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-18534", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-19T14:29:49-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc93bf\"", "article_summary": "Evaluate your core beliefs about the music world, and don\u2019t be afraid to challenge them, says Mr. Gallagher.\n\u201cKeep in touch with them,\u201d says Greg Sandow, a consultant and specialist focusing on the future of classical music, who also teaches at Juilliard.\n\u201cAs a practicing musician, it\u2019s fun,\u201d says pianist Lara Downes, who started a concert series connecting artists and audiences.\nAnd view the pairing of artistic excellence and creativity as a way to keep classical music (and your career!)\n\u201cI think [entrepreneurship] totally reconfigures classical music to the outside world, which is something that badly needs to happen to the entire field,\u201d says Mr. Sandow."}
