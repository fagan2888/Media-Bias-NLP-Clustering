The general fund portion is $375.5 million for FY2016 and $383.1 million for FY2017.\n\nUnlike previous years when the city\u2019s general fund deficit was anywhere from $20 to $40 million, this year\u2019s projected shortfall was $2.1 million.\n\nThere is some budget good news. The city predicts income tax collections will increase by 3.7 percent. Employee health care costs are down, the consent decree agreement on the pension system has stabilized city finances, and the Affordable Care Act has increased revenues for the city\u2019s health department.\n\nBut there is also bad news. The city\u2019s fire department budget is increasing because federal grants to pay for new firefighters are expiring and all labor union contracts expire during the fiscal year and will have to be renegotiated.\n\nCity officials are proposing to keep the property tax millage rate the same for FY2016, but city residents could see a 5 percent increase on their water bills if Council ultimately approves the budget.\n\nFor the first time, this budget includes funding for streetcar operations. Black wrote \u201cthe administration will monitor this closely to ensure the operating revenue projections materialize and the system does not burden the general fund.\u201d\n\nBlack said the plan has five strategic priorities: safer streets; thriving and healthy neighborhoods; a growing economy; innovative government; and fiscal sustainability and strategic investment.\n\n1. Safer Streets\n\n\u2022 Increases funding for the police and fire departments\n\n\u2022 Police sworn strength is 1,024 officers\n\n\u2022 Fire sworn strength is 850 firefighters\n\n\u2022 Recruit classes of 30 police officers in FY2016 and FY2017\n\n\u2022 Civilianization of 10 police positions, meaning 10 officers on the street\n\n\u2022 $600,000 for police overtime to focus on crime hotspots\n\n\u2022 Additional money for the \u201cCincinnati Initiative to Reduce Violence\u201d\n\n\u2022 40 member fire recruit class in FY2016\n\n2. Thriving/Health Neighborhoods\n\n\u2022 $6,800 for neighborhood community councils\n\n\u2022 $4,530 for neighborhood business districts\n\n\u2022 New \u201cCommunity Engagement Challenge Grant Initiative\u201d\n\n\u2022 Increased funding for blight reduction\n\n3. A Growing Economy\n\n\u2022 Continued funding and investment for projects already underway:\n\nGE at The Banks; 4th and Race; Wasson Way Bike Trail\n\n\u2022 Funds for City\u2019s first department of Economic Inclusion\n\n\u2022 Reorganized Community and Econ Development Department\n\n\u2022 Stand-along Planning Department\n\n\u2022 Re-constituted Department of Buildings and Inspection\n\n4. Innovative Government\n\n\u2022 Creation of Office of Performance and Data Analytics\n\n\u2022 Use of Innovation Lab to find operating efficiencies\n\n\u2022 Performance management agreements with various department heads\n\n\n\n5. Fiscal Sustainability and Strategic Re-investment\n\n\u2022 Funding to comply with consent decree recommendations on pension system\n\n\u2022 Additional $91 million in six-year capital budget to improve city streets and bring the city\u2019s fleet of vehicles back into life cycle.\n\n\u2022 Additional funds for information technology and making city\u2019s website more of a source of two-way communication\n\nThe police officer number could bring complaints from the Fraternal Order of Police and some city council members.\n\nFOP President Kathy Harrell recently told a council committee the sworn strength should be 1,135 officers. At least two council members said publicly they support that number. Harrell also is opposed to hiring 10 civilians to replace officers who would be reassigned to the streets.\n\nMayor John Cranley has already forwarded the budget to city council.\n\nCouncil\u2019s Budget and Finance Committee will hold five public hearing on the budget before taking a final vote sometime in mid-June.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "description": "Cincinnati City Manager Harry Black presented his first budget Wednesday to Mayor John Cranley.
