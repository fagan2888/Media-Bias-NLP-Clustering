If the healthcare.gov website wasn’t under enough strain as it is, Inhumanity #1 just added a whole load of traffic.

I kinda reviewed the comic book earlier today, but there’s one important point I wanted to revisit.

As insurers head to the courts to argue whether of not Terrigen Mists can be classified as poisonous gases, some insurers are treating the newly Inhumaned, people who were genetically part of the Inhuman race, whose powers and new forms were generated by the explosion of Attilan and the gasses in question being distributed around the world, in a rather… inhuman fashion.

The argument over whether Inhumanity was a pre-existing condition or not, and that those affected should have disclosed their rich genetic history continues as healthcare plans have stopped covering the recently cocooned and those affected are turning to Obamacare as a last resort.

However, not only is the website not exactly up to scratch but for many of the Inhomo Supremis, their new forms aren’t exactly conducive to typing on a keyboard. Bear hands, slimy squid tentacles, being electro-magnetically hot, wiping out any computer you come into contact with, the list goes on. And it seems that, almost all of the Obamacare navigators turned out to be Inhuman as well, so they aren’t in a position to assist. Looks like not enough background checks were done there.

In Britain, however, the National Health Service has stepped up and promised full coverage of any British Inhuman needs. However, due to the winter rush, those affected have been asked to stay in their cocoons if at all possible for the next six months, while they work through the backlog.
