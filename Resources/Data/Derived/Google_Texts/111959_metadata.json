These include the Wyoming Liberty Group, Republic Free Choice, and the Pillar of Law Institute. Her staff had a role in the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision that allowed corporations, unions, and certain nonprofits to ramp up their political spending.\n\nEven so, many who oppose her activities seem somewhat in the dark about just who she is, where she came from, and what her ultimate goals are. WyoFile\u2019s review of published biographies, court cases, land records, and historical documents reveals some of the facets of her life.\n\nGore, a resident of Cheyenne, has lived in Wyoming for almost 20 years. Her Wyoming roots go back three generations in the southwest part of the state. She came to Wyoming in the mid-1990s after living for more than a decade in a transcendental meditation community in Fairfield, Iowa. Before that she lived in Delaware and Vermont.\n\nMore widely known is that Gore grew up in the family that founded the company most famous for inventing Gore-Tex fabric. Through the course of her life, the private family company grew from a small operation in a basement to a global chemical engineering behemoth that makes more than $3 billion in annual revenue and employs 10,000 people.\n\nGore\u2019s own assets have fluctuated. She was wealthy by the 1980s due to inheriting shares of a family trust, but nearly bankrupt by the late 1990s after falling ill and ending her support of the meditation movement. She later viewed her involvement in the movement as a mistake, according hertestimony before a Delaware court.\n\nHer mother then gave her enough shares of family stock to make her wealthy again in the 2000s. In 2003 she adopted her ex-husband in an unsuccessful attempt to boost her children\u2019s share of the family inheritance.\n\nThrough it all, Gore pursued her version of a better world. And in Wyoming, she seems to have found her niche as a promoter of conservative-libertarian ideas.\n\nTwo of her sons, Joel Otto and Nathan Otto, also play a role by serving on the boards of her groups.\n\nTogether, their efforts put pressure on Wyoming\u2019s small-money elections, where nearly every legislative race costs less than $20,000.\n\nDan Neal, a long-time legislative observer who formerly directed the Equality State Policy Center, has followed Gore\u2019s groups for years.\n\n\u201cI think they are getting more attention than they deserve,\u201d Neal said. \u201cThis woman moves in from out of state and hires a bunch of people to come here and tell us what to do. It seems a little odd.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s got a right to speak their mind,\u201d he said, \u201cbut people need to recognize she\u2019s got a lot of money, and she can make her voice a lot bigger and a lot louder than most people.\u201d\n\nSusan Gore\u2019s rise in Wyoming is two intertwined stories: the work of three conservative-libertarian groups with national ambitions to promote anonymous political spending, and the journey of their founder, whose experience as an heiress to a successful family business informed the political changes she proposes.\n\nWyoFile requested comment from Gore through her staff. She did not respond.\n\nInside Gore\u2019s groups\n\n\n\nSusan Gore\u2019s philosophies were evident during WyoFile\u2019s recent visit to the Cheyenne offices of the Wyoming Liberty Group. The headquarters is on the second floor of the Read Block building, just eight blocks from the Wyoming State Capitol.\n\nInside, The organization has a small library with books on politics and philosophy. Down a long hall policy workers and lobbyists work in individual offices.\n\nPolicy advisor Charlie Katebi, who grew up in Massachusetts, works on healthcare and free-market alternatives to the Affordable Care Act. In the next room attorney Boyd Wiggam works on private property rights. His family goes back generations in the farm country northeast of Cheyenne.\n\nAt the end of the hall, Maureen Bader, who previously worked for the libertarian Fraser Institute think tank in Vancouver, drafts briefs opposing state-funded economic development and proposing new ways to tax minerals.\n\nAcross the hall are the offices of Republic Free Choice, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit think tank that produces political-issue ads in Wyoming elections and shares several employees with the Wyoming Liberty Group. A third group called Pillar of Law Institute is an arm of the Wyoming Liberty Group, but pursues national campaign finance litigation from offices near Washington D.C.\n\nAcross the three related groups, employees have a large degree of autonomy to pursue their interests, with support from Gore.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that the groups have this libertarian structure. It mirrors the decentralized, entrepreneurial organization of W.L. Gore and Associates, the company Gore\u2019s parents founded in 1958.\n\nUnlike most companies with a hierarchical chain of command structure, W.L. Gore \u201cassociates\u201d work in small ad-hoc units and pursue their own projects with leaders of their own choosing. That structure allows for better innovation and the flourishing of individual potential, the company believes.\n\nSusan Gore\u2019s philosophy\n\n\n\nSusan Gore\u2019s experience with the non-hierarchical family business seems to underlie the societal changes she proposes for Wyoming.\n\nAccording to the Wyoming Liberty Group website, \u201c[Susan Gore\u2019s] aim is to ensure that the power of the people and individuals in Wyoming takes precedence over improper government presumptions of authority.\u201d\n\nWith less government, Gore believes people would be free to associate and solve problems using private enterprise on a community basis.\n\nIn a 2013 radio interview with Glenn Woods of Bold Republic Radio, Gore said she appreciated Wyoming\u2019s culture of neighbors helping one another.\n\n\u201cThe reason I started this was because I wanted to live in a place where I had better quality of life,\u201d Gore told Bold Republic Radio. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see us overwhelmed by too much government, too many regulations, a loss of our culture.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Gore seems to be bolstering the already conservative voter base in Wyoming politics. The Wyoming Liberty Group opposes federal involvement in healthcare and education. It champions a free-market philosophy of privatization, where government ideally would stay out of areas where it believes private business can do a better job.\n\nGore rarely publishes her own thoughts as an individual political commentator. She has written seven columns on the Wyoming Liberty Group webpage since 2010.\n\nKey players\n\n\n\nThe Wyoming Liberty Group was founded in 2008. It has a staff of about 11, plus board members Susan Gore, her son Joel Otto, Sen. Cale Case (R-Lander), and Charles Curley.\n\nCharles Curley, a computer programmer by trade, is the Republican Party Chairman for Hot Springs County and a member of the Wyoming GOP central committee. He\u2019s been active in Second Amendment issues and legalizing ownership of gold.\n\nIn 2014, Wyoming Liberty Group had seven registered lobbyists: Maureen Bader, former Rep. Amy Edmonds (R-Cheyenne), Jason Gay, Susan Gore, Steve Klein, former Rep. Lorraine Quarberg (R-Thermopolis), and Boyd Wiggam.\n\nMany of the staff work across several divisions of the organization. Charles Curley and Amy Edmonds also do work for Republic Free Choice. Gore is on the board of both groups.\n\nThe State Policy Network\n\n\n\nThe Wyoming Liberty Group is part of a nationwide organization called the State Policy Network, founded in 1991. The organization has think-tank chapters in all 50 states, and receives money from a sophisticated network of donors.\n\nSusan Gore told the Casper Star-Tribune in 2010 she founded the Wyoming Liberty Group after her brother David W. Gore formed a similar organization called the Cascade Policy Institute in Oregon, also a State Policy Network affiliate.\n\nThe Gore family company\n\n\n\nSusan Gore provides the majority of financial support to the organizations through her family wealth, which she has also used to pursue personal interests, while supporting her sons and their entrepreneurial projects.\n\nGore\u2019s parents Wilbert (\u201cBill\u201d) and Genevieve \u201cVieve\u201d (Walton) Gore were originally from Utah.\n\nSusan Gore\u2019s life\n\n\n\nSusan Gore was born in 1939. The family originally lived in Salt Lake City, but moved to Delawarein 1950. According to reporting by the Wilmington (Delaware) News Journal, she attended Newark High School in Delaware where she met her future husband Jan C. Otto. They both attended Middlebury College. Otto later earned a graduate degree in physics from Dartmouth and an M.B.A. from Harvard. She and Otto divorced in 1981, and he later moved to Boulder, Colorado.\n\nDuring the 1980s Susan Gore put part of her resources into supporting the transcendental meditation movement, advocating for prisons to use meditation as part of rehabilitating inmates. She gave to the effort in Vermont, a state where she had lived with Otto.\n\nGore and her sons later lived near the Fairfield, Iowa, headquarters of the transcendental meditation movement started by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, one-time spiritual advisor to the Beatles. The community included a university and dozens of start-up businesses founded by followers of the Maharishi, including Gore and her sons.\n\nDelaware Chancery Court documents cite Gore as testifying she became ill and was in \u201cvery, very bad shape\u201d by the end of her time in the meditation movement. According to Susan Gore\u2019s testimony as cited in a Delaware Supreme Court decision: \u201cAfter leaving the [meditation] movement in 1995, Susan spent three years convalescing in a series of monasteries. By the end of the 1990s, Susan was facing the possibility of personal bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nHer financial troubles came after years of selling her shares of family stock and putting money into the meditation movement and her sons\u2019 businesses, according to her siblings. At one point she invested $5 million into her son Joel Otto\u2019s airplane business, according to the Wilmington News Journal reporting.\n\nDuring Gore\u2019s marriage to Otto, she sold a portion of her 3,900 shares in the Gore company to support herself and her family, according to court documents. She also put 1,340 of her shares into trusts to benefit her children and out of her own reach.\n\nSusan Gore moved to Wyoming in about 1996. In an effort to resolve her financial situation Gore wrote a letter in 1999 to her mother asking for more Gore stock from the family\u2019s Pokeberry Trust. Vieve Gore eventually released 336 shares of stock to support Susan, according to court documents. The shares together were potentially worth tens of millions of dollars.\n\nSusan Gore\u2019s political contributions\n\n\n\nAfter coming back from the brink of bankruptcy, Gore showed interest in donating to political causes. She gave $5,000 in donations to the national Libertarian Party from 2003-2005. She\u2019s also given to Wyoming candidates such as Mark Gordon, Cynthia Lummis, and Liz Cheney, according to campaign filings.\n\nOverall, Susan Gore isn\u2019t an especially active donor to specific candidates. Campaign records show she prefers giving to political action committees, issue groups and nonprofits.\n\nGore\u2019s largest political gift of $500,000 went to the Red White and Blue Fund, a PAC that backed Rick Santorum in his 2012 campaign for the Republican primary for president. Jackson Hole resident Foster Friess gave $2.1 million to the group that same year.\n\nEven that amount pales in comparison to her political spending devoted to the groups she has founded.\n\nGore finances Wyoming Liberty Group\n\n\n\nDespite the Wyoming Liberty Group\u2019s appeal to grassroots conservatives, Susan Gore was the driving force behind the group\u2019s financial survival in its first few years.\n\nIRS documents from 2008-2012 show Gore \u2014 and one other unlisted donor \u2014 provided more than 75 percent of the group\u2019s $4.3 million in funding up to that time.\n\nPublic documents indicate the unlisted person holds a position of authority in the organization. The donor could be another board member, or a Gore family member, but the Wyoming Liberty Group declined to comment on this point.\n\nOverall, from 2008-2013, Susan Gore and the unlisted person contributed $3.2 million, while 109 individuals and eight foundations contributed a little more than $1 million. The IRS does not require nonprofits to list individual donors on 990 forms.\n\nThe foundations giving to Wyoming Liberty Group include the State Policy Network that gave $90,000 in 2009 and Donors Capital Fund that gave $485,000 between 2009-2011.\n\nDonors Capital Fund is an aggregator of conservative mega-donors that gave $59 million to different groups in 2010.\n\nDespite receiving large support from Gore, Bader said the Wyoming Liberty Group has \u201ca lot\u201d of public support, even among legislators.\n\nWyoming Liberty Group attorney Steve Klein agreed. \u201cSusan as our president is always out there trying to do her best to raise money,\u201d he said.\n\nSusan Gore\u2019s sons\n\n\n\nSusan Gore\u2019s sons Joel and Nathan Otto contribute to her efforts by serving on the boards of her nonprofits. A third son, Jan Peter Otto, is not involved with the groups.\n\nAdop\u200bting her ex-husband\n\n\n\nMuch of what is known about the adoption story as reported below comes from Delaware court rulings that are publicly available, and reporting by Wilmington News Journal reporter Cris Barrishbased on additional court documents located in Delaware.\n\nNathan Otto\u2019s interest in the family\u2019s Pokeberry Trust led Susan Gore to adopt her ex-husband Jan C. Otto as her son in 2003.\n\nSusan Gore had already disposed of many of her shares, and Nathan wanted to change the family stock distribution formula set up by his grandparents to boost the inheritance for him and his brothers, according to court rulings.\n\nAccording to reporting by Cris Barrish of the Wilmington News Journal that cited Nathan Otto\u2019s testimony, each share of Gore family stock was worth upwards of $66,000 in the 1990\u2019s, an amount that has likely climbed since then. For most of the Gore grandchildren, their loss of dozens shares under Nathan\u2019s proposed formula was worth millions, while the gain for Susan Gore\u2019s branch was tens of millions of dollars.\n\nWhile Vieve Gore refused to change the trust formula, and her four siblings and their children likewise disagreed, the Susan Gore branch contemplated her adopting another child. Doing so would automatically make all the distributions equal \u2014 350 shares per grandchild.\n\nSusan initially felt adoption was not the best way to change the trust. Yet by spring 2003 Susan settled on adopting one of her son\u2019s children. Then her ex-husband Jan C. Otto jokingly suggested that she adopt him, according emails cited in court rulings.\n\nSusan and her sons at first dismissed the idea, but within a few weeks Nathan emailed his father to say Susan wanted to move forward with the adoption, court papers say.\n\nGore adopted her ex-husband Jan C. Otto in Cheyenne in July 2003. As the Wilmington News Journal noted, he was 65 years old, she was 64. They did not inform Vieve Gore, the other grandchildren, or her siblings of the adoption, according to court rulings.\n\nInitially, Jan C. Otto said he didn\u2019t want the inheritance for himself, but he later decided to try to lay claim to the money, according to court documents.\n\nCourt battle\n\n\n\nSusan Gore considered un-adopting her ex-husband, but before that could happen Vieve Gore died in January 2005. That brought the adoption out in public, and launched a multi-year court battle between the Gore grandchildren and the Susan Gore/Otto branch over whether Susan\u2019s adopted son \u2014 her ex-husband \u2014 was entitled to benefit from the trust.\n\nWyoming Liberty Group positions and Benjamin Barr\n\n\n\nAttorney Benjamin Barr is perhaps Gore\u2019s most influential advisor in shaping the organizations\u2019 policy positions. Much of Barr\u2019s work centers on election issues, with a focus on removing limits to campaign finance law.\n\nA 1997 University of Wyoming graduate in German and political science, Barr earned his law degree at the Illinois Institute of Technology, and now lives in Rockville, Maryland.\n\nFrom February 2007 to September 2008 Barr served as counsel to members of the Federal Elections Commission. He was lead counsel to FEC commissioner David Mason and to Don McGahn, a Republican appointee who worked for five years to relax campaign finance regulations.\n\nWyoming Liberty Group attorney Klein worked with Barr at the FEC as an intern for four months in 2008.\n\nBarr\u2019s experience at the FEC led to starting his consulting firm Government Watch and working with the Wyoming Liberty Group beginning in Sept. 2008. IRS documents show Barr received significant consulting fees from the Wyoming Liberty Group during its startup phase.\n\nFrom 2008-2011 his total compensation was $774,397, according to IRS tax forms. After that he is not listed as an independent consultant making more than $100,000.\n\nBarr\u2019s first legal project with the Wyoming Liberty Group was a friend of the court brief that the Supreme Court cited in its 2010 Citizens United vs. Federal Elections Commission decision.\n\nIn part, the ruling struck down the ban on electioneering communications by corporations, unions, and nonprofits. That means such groups can spend money to advocate for or against candidates.\n\nRepublic Free Choice founded\n\n\n\nBenjamin Barr\u2019s work on Citizen United in 2010 helped open the door for 501(c)(4) social welfare groups to engage in political speech without having to disclose their donors to the IRS.\n\nDonations to 501(c)(4) groups are not tax-deductible, and the organizations are prohibited from spending a \u201csubstantial\u201d part of their funds \u2014 more than 50 percent \u2014 on lobbying and elections.\n\nThe designation allows donors to give as much as they want, anonymously, without violating campaign finance laws.\n\nTo that end, Gore founded Republic Free Choice in 2012. The new group allowed Gore to diversify her spending and broaden her impact by creating direct mail campaigns on specific issues.\n\nContributions to the Wyoming Liberty Group topped $1 million in 2011, then dropped to $610,000 in 2012 \u2014 the same time that Gore founded Republic Free Choice with a budget of $358,000, according to IRS tax forms. In 2013 Republic Free Choice raised $803,000 in revenue.\n\nIRS records don\u2019t indicate if or how much Susan Gore may have given to Republic Free Choice.\n\nRepublic Free Choice in the 2014 elections\n\n\n\nDuring the 2014 primary campaign several Wyoming candidates experienced the mass-mailing techniques that a group like Republic Free Choice can bring to bear.\n\nChris Knapp of Gillette was a Republican candidate for Wyoming House. In the weeks before the primary, voters in his district received multiple flyers from Republic Free Choice and other groups that questioned his conservative credentials.\n\n\u201cObviously they had money behind them because literally it was about six different mailers to all the voters, and how do you compete with that?\u201d Knapp said.\n\nA 12-year veteran of the Campbell County Commission, Knapp says he is pro-life, pro-gun, and anti-Obamacare. Republic Free Choice didn\u2019t call him or fact-check its claims before sending out the material, he said.\n\nKnapp took to social media to rebut the mailers.\n\n\u201cYour tactics have been deplorable and don\u2019t belong anywhere in Wyoming,\u201d Knapp wrote in a public Facebook post to Republic Free Choice.\n\nHe suspected he became a target of the ads because he did not answer a position questionnaire sent out by the group.\n\n\u201cI hate to see politics when it gets slimy and goes there,\u201d Knapp said in an interview with WyoFile.\n\nChris Knapp lost the primary election to Roy Edwards by 123 votes.\n\nRepublic Free Choice also sent out mailers opposing Ed Opella, a former Casper mayor, city council member and county commissioner. He ran unsuccessfully against Rep. Kendell Kroeker (R-Casper). Another group called Wyoming Freedom Riders ran ads against Rep. Kroeker. Unlike most independent groups, Wyoming Freedom Riders has no public presence or website, and the only name associated is a registered agent who provides similar services to many companies.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like people with deep pockets trying to influence an election up here,\u201d Opella said. \u201cThey came after me and bad-mouthed me and said things about me that weren\u2019t true, and I didn\u2019t appreciate it. But that\u2019s politics. \u2026 They can do what they want. It\u2019s a free country.\u201d\n\nKlein said hard-fought races are only a prelude to what lawmakers face in Cheyenne.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t handle the high school nature of legislative election, you are going to be in for a big surprise when you get to the actual big show at the Legislature,\u201d he said.\n\nAnonymous money growing in Wyoming, nationally\n\n\n\nAt least six Wyoming groups used mass mailing to distribute \u201cissue ads\u201d in the 2014 election cycle without having to disclose their donors. That\u2019s more groups than ever before, according to Wyoming Secretary of State Elections Division director Peggy Nighswonger.\n\nThe proliferation is happening across the country, according to election law expert and University of Montana law professor Anthony Johnstone.\n\n\u201cCitizens United and related cases released a flood of independent campaign spending from a mix of Super PACs and less transparent groups,\u201d Johnstone wrote in an email. \u201cMany disclosure laws no longer effectively follow the money funding these new groups.\u201d\n\nIn pursuing campaign finance cases for Wyoming Liberty Group, Barr and Klein cast their position as a defense of free speech. Money is speech, and more speech \u2014 anonymous or otherwise \u2014 makes for more robust participation in elections, they argue.\n\n\u201cIt is really disingenuous for them to say that,\u201d said Adam Smith, spokesman for Every Voice, national group working for more transparency on money in politics. \u201cThe only thing they have helped is the wealthiest people to write bigger checks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese donations are paid speech, and in this post-Citizens United world, free speech has gotten really expensive, and very few people can actually afford it,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe influx of money from donors using nonprofits and PACs can quickly outpace the small amounts of money raised by local interests and constituents, Johnstone said. It becomes an affordable way to support candidates that may end up making multi-million dollar decisions once in office.\n\nDisclosure of funding sources allows average citizens to judge whether those donors share their interests, Johnstone argues.\n\nMore disclosure?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to add up the growth in spending from independent groups because they are not required to file such information with the secretary of state. Yet anecdotally, the 2014 election brought an increased volume of mailers.\n\nThat raised calls for more disclosure from independent groups, and opposition to disclosure by the Wyoming Liberty Group.\n\nIn a November 2014 meeting of the Legislature\u2019s Corporations Committee, lawmakers chose not to take up a proposed bill that would require independent expenditure groups to file reports about their activities with the secretary of state.\n\nWyoming Liberty Group lobbyist Steve Klein spoke against the bill at the meeting. So did committee chairman and Wyoming Liberty Group board member Sen. Cale Case (R-Lander). Sen. Charlie Scott (R-Casper) moved to table it.\n\nCase later told WyoFile that he hadn\u2019t violated any conflict of interest rules because there was no formal vote on the bill. Read this WyoFile feature for more.\n\nThe Pillar of Law Institute\n\n\n\nThe founding of the Pillar of Law Institute demonstrates Gore\u2019s intentions to give more attention to campaign finance issues than would be possible with periodic litigation by the Wyoming Liberty Group.\n\nBarr is general counsel of the Pillar of Law Institute, and Susan Gore is a director. Klein moved to Washington D.C. this March to work full-time with the institute.\n\nThe institute states its position:\n\n\u201cCampaign finance laws are suffocating political debate in America. Organized and professional operatives use these laws to silence conservative activists from sharing their political views publicly.\u201d\n\nBarr wrote a column after the 2014 election saying that the influence of money in politics isn\u2019t as strong as people might think.\n\n\u201cMany will still disdain political spending, castigate the wealthy for being civic-minded, and claim the full ruin of our Republic. Don\u2019t listen to them. Money speaks, but not very loudly. Voters matter most and no amount of spending on slick political advertisements transforms Americans into an army of corporate lemmings. We are a fiercely independent people fully capable of making important political decisions. We\u2019d like to remain that way.\u201d\n\nKlein noted that campaign spending was important, but far from decisive in the 2014 Wyoming elections. Some candidates who outraised their opponents lost the vote in November.\n\nA changing Wyoming\n\n\n\nLooking back over the past century, Susan Gore\u2019s influence in Wyoming represents something new and unusual, according to University of Wyoming history professor Phil Roberts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not had \u2026 a person who is really wealthy who has tried to develop around them a group with the goal of extensively lobbying the Legislature on a multitude of issues,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nWith money at her disposal, Susan Gore seems to be pushing her own agenda that doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the popular will, Roberts said.\n\nAt the same time, the state has seen growing campaign spending over the past 20 years. Roberts worries the new money can bring a decline in the face-to-face culture of small-town politics.\n\n\u201cThe lack of civility we saw in the last election I think is directly attributable to being no longer a state where politics is personal,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWhen you have a campaign that is run on money and advertising and those circulars in the mail, there is no reason to talk to an opponent or compromise. [That\u2019s] the corrosive effect of any substantial amount of money in a campaign.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Roberts said the money nationalizes state issues, and devalues the civility that Wyoming politicians of both parties have long held in high regard.\n\n\u201c[You] basically start modeling yourself after that awful example of U.S. Congress that has become a fundraising machine more than a deliberating body,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is good for democracy, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for Wyoming.\u201d\n\nRoberts\u2019 position squares with many groups that believe the growth of money in politics poses a threat to the process.\n\nYet for Klein, the Gore groups\u2019 efforts to reduce campaign finance regulations would benefit not just the wealthy, but all donors who want to give to a group and speak their minds. He said the dangers are \u201cvastly overemphasized.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Americans] spend a heck of a lot more on Halloween than in an election cycle,\u201d Klein said. \u201cI think we are certainly out of danger.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "by Gregory Nickerson | WyoFile.com Susan Gore is arguably Wyoming\u2019s most influential libertarian promoter.", "description": "by Gregory Nickerson | WyoFile.com Susan Gore is arguably Wyoming\u2019s most influential libertarian promoter.", "copyright": "Copyright 2010, Sheridan Media", "og": {"url": "http://www.sheridanmedia.com/news/libertarian-gore-tex-heiress-fuels-hidden-political-donations78417", "image": "http://www.sheridanmedia.com/files/image/susan_gore-745x455.jpg", "type": "website", "title": "Libertarian Gore-Tex Heiress Fuels Hidden Political Donations | SheridanMedia.com"}, "abstract": "Sheridan Wyoming's News #1 News Source.", "msapplication-tooltip": "Sheridan Media", "geo.position": "44.4756;-106.5552", "revisit-after": "1 day", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.sheridanmedia.com", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-29T00:00:00Z", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "application-name": "Sheridan Media", "icbm": "44.4756,-106.5552", "keywords": "Sheridan Wyoming,Buffalo Wyoming,News,Newspaper,Radio,Swap Shop,Country Bounty,Obituaries,Weather,Sports,Webcams", "google-site-verification": "FQ_MfxbALqCTmQvFF1i0BUpfHazuzzi0dEfBgVuOWU4", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#40638E", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe155e\"", "article_summary": "Susan Gore\u2019s political contributionsAfter coming back from the brink of bankruptcy, Gore showed interest in donating to political causes.\nThe State Policy NetworkThe Wyoming Liberty Group is part of a nationwide organization called the State Policy Network, founded in 1991.\nInside Gore\u2019s groupsSusan Gore\u2019s philosophies were evident during WyoFile\u2019s recent visit to the Cheyenne offices of the Wyoming Liberty Group.\nSusan Gore\u2019s sonsSusan Gore\u2019s sons Joel and Nathan Otto contribute to her efforts by serving on the boards of her nonprofits.\nWyoming Liberty Group attorney Klein worked with Barr at the FEC as an intern for four months in 2008."}
