They\u2019re proposing Senate Joint Resolution 19, which would amend the U.S. Constitution by scratching out a sorta important part of the Bill of Rights.\n\nSenate Joint Resolution 19 would repeal the First Amendment.\n\nWell, not all of it, actually: just our right to speak out politically, to engage in political action and campaign for or against those in power.\n\nThe new amendment would remove all protections against Congress regulating our speech, at least insofar as we have to spend even a plug nickel for a megaphone in what they deem to be their campaigns. Yes, the idea is to reward incumbent politicians \u2014 the same dudes earning the approval of less than one in ten Americans and suffering from a screaming conflict of interest \u2014 with the carte blanche power to pass any rules and regulations and limits they so desire on both the raising and spending of money by their challengers and organizations opposed to their policies.\n\nSJR 19\u2019s lead sponsor, Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) states that his goal in re-writing our rights is to \u201cgive the power back to the Congress.\u201d\n\nBut, wait, that would constitute amending reality as well. Congress never had any such power. The instructions in the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment were written quite soberly, and remain crystal clear: \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people to peacefully assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d\n\nSJR 19 would simply remove those words \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d above from our highest law and allow Congress to make any speech-regulating law they damn well feel like.\n\nThe guts of the new amendment reads: \u201cCongress shall have power to regulate the raising and spending of money and in-kind equivalents with respect to Federal elections, including through setting limits on \u2014 the amount of contributions to candidates for nomination for election to, or for election to, Federal office; and the amount of funds that may be spent by, in support of, or in opposition to such candidates.\u201d\n\nSo, were Congress to pass a law prohibiting campaigns from spending more than $10,000 on a run for office \u2014 thereby denying challengers the ability to spend enough to compete with the superior name recognition of longtime incumbents \u2014 it would then be constitutional, instead of, as now, unconstitutional.\n\nIf Congress outlawed \u201coutside groups\u201d (associations other than the candidate\u2019s campaign committee) from spending any money to publicize the name and track record of incumbents, it would become, instead of a gross violation of the First Amendment, an enforceable and lawful regulation.\n\nOur brand new First Amendment would not contain a single word of restraint regarding the regulation of political speech. Instead, powerful congressional incumbents would wield complete and total control over all money to be raised and spent by their competitors and by everyone engaged in any way, shape or form in the debate.\n\nThe whole point of the First Amendment was to protect the people\u2019s right to criticize those in power. It was meant to restrain Congress. That\u2019s why it begins, \u201cCongress shall make no law . . .\u201d The whole point of SJR 19 is to do the opposite, to protect politicians from citizens by providing Congress precisely what our Founders denied to it: any power to restrain the speech of citizens by legislation.\n\nIn fact, this new amendment\u2019s negation of rights is so sweeping that the text\u2019s authors felt the need to include this statement in the amendment: \u201cNothing in this article shall be construed to grant Congress the power to abridge the freedom of the press.\u201d\n\nNo, just abridging freedom of speech. For now.\n\nThe New York Times and the Washington Post need not worry.\n\nWhen I alerted readers of my Common Sense e-letter to the danger of SJR 19, one savvy commenter insisted that SJR 19 stands little chance of passing. Indeed, in this session of Congress, \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d stands little chance of being ripped out of the Bill of Rights via SJR 19.\n\nIt would require two-thirds support \u2014 67 votes in the Senate.\n\nBut how placid should we be about 44 percent of the U.S. Senate favoring a return to government absolutism?\n\nPlus, the number of supporters may be greater than just the 44 sponsors. The Democratic Senate leadership has announced that Senate Joint Resolution 19 \u2014 what you and I should think of as the \u201cRemove Freedom of Speech from Our Constitution Act\u201d \u2014 will be brought to a vote this year.\n\nLet\u2019s hope it is well before the election. We need to know where all the Senators stand on reversing the First Amendment to put Congress in charge of what can be said in politics.\n\nThose aware of the many exhortations to the IRS from Senate Democrats in recent years, urging an official Washington clampdown on political groups, are not surprised at SJR 19\u2019s blatant assault on fundamental rights and the basic notion of small-d democracy.\n\nThe word \u201cextremist\u201d gets tossed about easily in Washington, at least when aimed at tea party activists, libertarians and conservatives. But what could be more extreme than proposing to machete the First Amendment and cross out \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d from our rights?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The First Amendment, I think I\u2019ll keep it. .05/25/2016 15:20:40PM EST.", "author": "Paul Jacob", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The First Amendment, I think I\u2019ll keep it.", "title": "- Let's Repeal Freedom of Speech?", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/pauljacob/2014/06/29/lets-repeal-freedom-of-speech-n1856964", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/40/29c6934c-df26-4b7b-b75c-b9142c1950a3@news.ap.org.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The First Amendment, I think I\u2019ll keep it.", "title": "- Let's Repeal Freedom of Speech?", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/pauljacob/2014/06/29/lets-repeal-freedom-of-speech-n1856964", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/40/29c6934c-df26-4b7b-b75c-b9142c1950a3@news.ap.org.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Let's Repeal Freedom of Speech?, Paul Jacob, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde129\"", "article_summary": "When I alerted readers of my Common Sense e-letter to the danger of SJR 19, one savvy commenter insisted that SJR 19 stands little chance of passing.\nIndeed, in this session of Congress, \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d stands little chance of being ripped out of the Bill of Rights via SJR 19.\nBut what could be more extreme than proposing to machete the First Amendment and cross out \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d from our rights?\nOur brand new First Amendment would not contain a single word of restraint regarding the regulation of political speech.\nSenate Joint Resolution 19 would repeal the First Amendment."}
