He wants to fix two bridges first because they present safety concerns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say they\u2019ll be at the top of the list as far as urgency to get fixed,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the tour, Glidewell used words such as \u201cawful, extremely bad and unsafe\u201d to describe infrastructure in his district. He pointed out one intersection where the road had deteriorated \u201cdown to the dirt in several places.\u201d\n\n\u2018When are you going to fix these roads?\u2019\n\nThe biggest problems are in the western part of his district, such as in the Kossuth area. When he was campaigning last summer, people on the east side of the district were less concerned about roads than those who lived on the west side.\n\nWhen he would speak to residents on the western side of District 4 they would ask, \u201c\u2018When are you going to fix these roads?\u2019\u201d Glidewell said.\n\nThere is not an easy answer to that question, officials say.\n\nAs soon as his truck left the Fourth District and entered the Third District the roads got much smoother.\n\nGlidewell thinks one road in his district, County Road 510, could be one of the worst roads in the state and needs an overlay.\n\nVehicles that repeatedly drive on bumpy roads require extra maintenance, Glidewell said, adding, \u201cIt actually enforces the speed limit, but not in a good way.\u201d\n\nCrack in bridge beam\n\nGlidewell also pointed out a wooden beam on a bridge that was cracked.\n\n\u201cThis is a very unsafe bridge,\u201d he said as he stood underneath the structure on County Road 632.\n\nAnd a bridge on County Road 510 has rusted and bent pilings, he said. That bridge \u201cdefinitely\u201d needs to be replaced, said Johnny Crotts, who works for the county\u2019s engineering firm.\n\nGlidewell hopes to use funds through the Mississippi Office of State Aid Road Construction to overlay County Road 510 and replace the bridge on that road. The county is expected to soon get word on state-aid road funding allocations. Roads that get those funds must be developed to state standards.\n\nBut it is unclear when work could actually begin on County Road 510 or the bridge.\n\nAs far as the bridge with the cracked beam, officials say that could either be paid for with county dollars or another pot of state money. That bridge would be repaired while the other one would be completely replaced, officials said.\n\nGlidewell hopes the cracked beam can be addressed in the next year and said the bridge has a low traffic count.\n\nIn addition to these major problems, there are other roads scattered throughout his district that need to be addressed, he said. Those would likely need to be fixed with county dollars, he said. The county money only goes so far after paying for labor, fuel and materials.\n\nShould county do overlays in house?\n\nThe county contracts out overlay work, but there has been discussion of buying some equipment and doing it in-house, he said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the only way we can probably get a whole lot of roads done,\u201d Glidewell said. \u201cI worry about the expertise.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the county continues to struggle with major budget issues dealing with solid waste, 911 and the correctional facility.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some ideas on how to fix a couple of those but how quick the money starts coming back to our general fund will depend on how quickly we get these other problems fixed,\u201d Glidewell said. \u201cIt will continue to pull money out of our general fund that we use for roadwork if we don\u2019t get them fixed . . .\u201d\n\nThe county needs more industry so there will be more tax dollars to maintain infrastructure, he added.\n\nHe still plans some roadwork in the western part of District 4 this year.\n\n\u201cIt may be very limited as to how much, but we will do some roadwork,\u201d Glidewell said.\n\njosh.mitchell@journalinc.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Josh Mitchell Corinth Today ALCORN \u2013 Alcorn County taxpayers are upset about living on damaged roads, Fourth District County Supervisor Steve Glidewell said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be very frustrating,\u201d said Glidewell, who took Corinth Today on a tour of some of the rough roads and bridges in his district Thursday. \u201cYou probably didn\u2019t know \u2026", "title": "Roads, bridges suffer in Alcorn County as budget problems persist - Daily Journal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://djournal.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/42/files/2014/02/county_alcorn_green-130x130.png", "url": "http://djournal.com/news/roads-bridges-suffer-in-alcorn-county-as-budget-problems-persist/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "By Josh Mitchell Corinth Today ALCORN \u2013 Alcorn County taxpayers are upset about living on damaged roads, Fourth District County Supervisor Steve Glidewell said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be very frustrating,\u201d said Glidewell, who took Corinth Today on a tour of some of the rough roads and bridges in his district Thursday. \u201cYou probably didn\u2019t know [\u2026]", "creator": "@djournalnow", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/djournal.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/42/files/2016/02/county_alcorn_green-130x1302.png?fit=130%2C130", "title": "Roads, bridges suffer in Alcorn County as budget problems persist - Daily Journal", "site": "@djournalnow", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=486426430, affiliate-data=1l3vpBD, app-argument=http://djournal.com/news/roads-bridges-suffer-in-alcorn-county-as-budget-problems-persist/", "fb": {"admins": 26506061, "app_id": 441890629197277}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/djournalnow", "section": "Local Government", "published_time": "2016-02-16T06:37:33-05:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/djournalnow"}, "viewport": "width=1075"}, "article_summary": "By Josh MitchellCorinth TodayALCORN \u2013 Alcorn County taxpayers are upset about living on damaged roads, Fourth District County Supervisor Steve Glidewell said.\n\u2018Extremely bad\u2019Glidewell said he is working to address taxpayers\u2019 concerns about the roads and bridges but said the county is dealing with budget problems.\n\u201cHe was dead serious.\u201dGlidewell seems to keep an optimistic outlook regarding the road and bridge problems in his district.\nGlidewell thinks one road in his district, County Road 510, could be one of the worst roads in the state and needs an overlay.\nThe county money only goes so far after paying for labor, fuel and materials."}
