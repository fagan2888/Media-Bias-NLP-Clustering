The Republican Governors Association went up this week with a new television ad that casts Jason Carter as a big spending liberal and tries to undercut the Democrat’s repeated pledge to boost funding for schools.

Mr. Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, is running neck and neck with Republican Gov. Nathan Deal, who is considered one of the more vulnerable incumbents in the country.

In the RGA ad, the narrator says that Mr. Carter “won’t be a jobs governor” and “won’t be an education governor, either” — accusing him of opposing education funding in the state Senate.

(PolitiFact has since rated the claim mostly true, saying that Mr. Carter supported three of Mr. Deal’s budgets that included cuts, but then voted against his 2015 budget, which had the “smallest austerity cuts in years.”)

“Jason Carter will be a spending governor — expanding Obamacare, billions in spending,” The narrator in the RGA ad goes on to say in the ad. “Georgia families can’t afford Jason Carter.”

Mr. Deal, meanwhile, been operating under a cloud of ethics complaints.

He also came under fire for the latest jobs report, which showed that Georgia has the highest unemployment rate in the nation.
