I'm sure we have the opportunity with the current systems and technology,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"It shouldn't be a big problem. It's just about finding the right compromise so everyone is happy.\"\n\nMcLaren racing director Eric Boullier told reporters separately that the sport could test a new system as early as the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, in two weeks' time.\n\nWhiting indicated on Friday, however, that the main aim was to ensure any changes were well thought through and to get them in place by the start of the 2015 season.\n\n(Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alan Baldwin", "Author": "Alan Baldwin", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Formula One drivers have backed proposals to introduce a 'virtual safety car' or automatic speed limiter that would force the entire field to slow when yellow warning flags are waved.", "title": "F1 drivers back speed limit proposals", "image": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20141011&t=2&i=982693805&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXNPEA9A0B4", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
