The ACA-FUL data is available immediately.\"\n\nMorgan noted that ACA-FUL uses Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) data, which is reported monthly and quarterly after the fact. By the time CMS aggregates AMP data and publishes new ACA-FULs, they are based on data that are three to four months old. It is estimated that there is a 60-90 day lag from the time a drug is purchased to the time an actual ACA-FUL price is published. Also, AMP can be changed per market share agreements based on rebates, causing additional price changes to happen within the 60-90 day lag time. This can have a significant impact, such as when new generics enter the market and it takes several months to calculate the ACA-FUL and additional time to calculate any changes to the AMP.\n\n\"With these delays, being able to provide prompt updates for all drug information, such as clinical and patient safety data, drug pricing and images, is critical,\" said Morgan.\n\nAbout Elsevier:\n\nElsevier is a world-leading provider of information solutions that enhance the performance of science, health, and technology professionals, empowering them to make better decisions, deliver better care, and sometimes make groundbreaking discoveries that advance the boundaries of knowledge and human progress.
