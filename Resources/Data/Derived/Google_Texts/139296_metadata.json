Jared Polis said he had a \u201cpleasant\u201d exchange on the floor of the Colorado House with a controversial Colorado Springs Republican who last summer accused the \u201copenly homosexual congressman\u201d of wanting to join Islamic terrorists and behead Christians.\n\nLikewise, state Rep. Gordon Klingenschmitt, who took office in January, called their encounter Thursday \u201cvery positive\u201d and said he felt \u201cjoyful\u201d about it.\n\nState Rep. Perry Buck, the wife of Congressman Ken Buck, introduced the pair before Gov. John Hickenlooper delivered his fifth State of the State address in the House chamber. Both Polis and Klingenschmitt confirm their discussion centered on Klingenschmitt\u2019s other job \u2014 he\u2019s a pastor whose comments have attracted national attention \u2014 and the difficulty of separating the various hats elected officials wear.\n\n\u201cIt was a pleasant exchange. It was nice to finally meet him,\u201d Polis said. \u201cMaybe now he won\u2019t call me a terrorist again.\u201d\n\nBoth lawmakers were asked what they talked about. Klingenschmitt provided a lengthy explanation via e-mail, which Polis said was an accurate reflection except for one part.\n\nKlingenschmitt, who has compared President Barack Obama to a demon on his religious television show and claimed Obamacare causes cancer, was thrust into the spotlight in June after he won his primary race in a GOP-heavy district. Other Republicans moved to distance themselves from Dr. Chaps, as he calls himself.\n\nKlingenschmitt in August was critical of Polis\u2019 support for legislation that would prohibit discrimination in hiring and employment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n\u201cThe open persecution of Christians is underway. Democrats like Polis want to bankrupt Christians who refuse to worship and endorse his sodomy. Next he\u2019ll join ISIS in beheading Christians, but not just in Syria, right here in America,\u201d Klingenschmitt said.\n\nKlingenschmitt then filmed a video in which he \u201chalf-heartedly apologized, saying that he was merely using hyperbole and some Democrats do not have a sense of humor,\u201d according to the group Right Wing Watch.\n\nKlingenschmitt said Polis appeared \u201ccheerfully surprised\u201d when Buck introduced them, \u201csaying something like, \u2018So this is Dr. Chaps, who wears two hats.'\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was referring to my two roles as TV preacher on Sundays and state rep Monday through Friday,\u201d the state lawmaker said. \u201cIf I recall properly, I said to Jared, \u2018Wow, it\u2019s an honor to meet you, sir. I admire your political courage, and despite our obvious theological differences, you take such bold stands. May I take a photo with you?\u201d\n\nBuck took their picture and others joined in, including Sen. Pat Steadman, D-Denver, who is gay. Steadman posted his shot on Twitter.\n\nannual State of the State speech brings all Coloradans together, incl Reps.

You\u2019ve got to realize you\u2019re still a state representative seven days a week.\u2019 To which I replied, \u2018Yes, but I\u2019m also perhaps the only ordained minister in my Republican caucus here, and my identity as a chaplain also follows me seven days a week, so I do have two roles in life, and I can\u2019t easily give up one at the expense of the other.\u201d\n\nKlingenschmitt said Polis questioned whether he could continue his TV show.\n\n\u201cI answered, \u2018You might be trying to give me good political advice, so maybe I should say \u2018thank you.\u2019 However, I feel I should not forsake my identity as a minister, or stop believing and preaching the Bible on Sundays, just because I got elected,\u201d Klingenschmitt said.\n\nHe said the congressman implied the pastor should keep doing what he has been doing \u201cor words to that effect.\u201d\n\nOn this point, Polis disagrees.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that I implied that he \u2018should keep doing what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 I just offered advice in a friendly context that what he did on weekends as Dr. Chaps would reflect on the perception of him as a legislator and there is no way to separate the two.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really have a secret alter ego,\u201d Polis said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Dr. Chaps,Gordon Klingenschmitt,ISIS,Jared Polis,John Hickenlooper,Ken Buck,Pat Steadman,Perry Buck", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Rep.
