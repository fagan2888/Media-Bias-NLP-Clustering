Mark Pryor, D-Ark., on Tuesday called on his Republican election opponent to explain a 2013 vote against a bill that benefited Arkansas Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nPryor spoke to reporters in a news conference outside the Little Rock hospital, where he was joined by the family of a North Little Rock boy who has received treatment at the facility. He accused U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Dardanelle, of favoring special interests over Arkansas and discussed his decision to bring his own medical history into the race.\n\nA spokesman for Cotton said he has voted numerous times for funding for the hospital and blamed Pryor for sequestration cuts that affected the facility.\n\nPryor said Cotton has never adequately explained why he was the only member of the Arkansas delegation to vote against Senate Bill 1557, the Children\u2019s Hospital GME (Graduate Medical Education) Support Reauthorization Act. The bill, which became law, reauthorized up to $330 million a year for graduate medical education at children\u2019s hospitals, including Arkansas\u2019 only pediatric hospital.\n\n\u201cThat funding helps us support 170 full-time residents here at Children\u2019s Hospital,\u201d Pryor said. \u201cThe bottom line is if my opponent would have had his way, we would have been training fewer pediatricians, and that would have hurt health care in Arkansas.\u201d\n\nPryor said only one explanation makes sense: That Cotton was acting on instructions from the Club for Growth, a conservative group that has provided financial backing for Cotton\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cFrom my standpoint, it\u2019s a vote against Arkansas families, it\u2019s a vote against Arkansas jobs, and it\u2019s really a vote against our future,\u201d Pryor said.\n\nJason Green of North Little Rock told reporters his 11-year-old son has a condition, which he declined to name, that requires access to pediatricians and said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Cotton\u2019s vote.\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has released television ads on the matter, prompting a response ad from the Cotton campaign.\n\nCotton spokesman David Ray said Tuesday that Cotton voted against Senate Bill 1557 because he believed it had been fast-tracked to the House floor without giving members enough time to read and review it, not because of opposition to the GME program.\n\n\u201cThese attacks against Tom Cotton reek of desperation,\u201d Ray said. \u201cTom Cotton supports children\u2019s pediatric research, plain and simple, and he\u2019s voted for it five times. Senator Pryor and his allies have been in Washington so long they\u2019ve forgotten how to tell the truth.\u201d\n\nRay also said it was Pryor who voted for legislation that actually led to tens of millions of dollars in funding cuts for the GME program at Arkansas Children\u2019s Hospital. That legislation was the Budget Control Act of 2011, a compromise bill that allowed the debt ceiling to be raised, to avoid debt default, in exchange for spending cuts. Because a deal on where to make the cuts could not be reached, they were imposed automatically through sequestration.\n\nPryor also was asked Tuesday about his decision to produce a television ad in which he discusses being a cancer survivor and talks about provisions of the Affordable Care Act that prevent insurance companies from refusing coverage because a person gets sick or has a pre-existing condition.\n\nThe health care law, which Pryor voted for and Cotton opposes, has been a major issue in the race. In the ad Pryor does not mention the name of the law, which polls have shown is unpopular in the state.\n\n\u201cI just want people to understand that I\u2019ve been through the system,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cI know that basically most Arkansans have been touched some way or another by cancer or by some other serious illness, and we all know that before the law passed medical debt was the leading cause of bankruptcy in this country.\u201d\n\nAsked why he did not mention the law by name in the ad, Pryor said, \u201cWhen we put the ad together that\u2019s just how it came out.\u201d\n\nHe added that the law is \u201cfar from perfect\u201d and said he hopes to see a bipartisan effort to improve it after the November elections.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 U.S. Sen.
