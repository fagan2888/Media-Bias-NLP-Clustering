"article_text": "WASHINGTON, Sept. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- A group of national home care provider organizations has formed a new coalition \u2013 the Partnership for Medicaid Home-Based Care (Medicaid Partnership) \u2013 to advance the integrity and delivery of high-quality, cost-effective Medicaid home-based care through proactive and constructive engagement with government leaders and across the Medicaid home-based care stakeholder community.\n\nThe coalition was formed to address changing dynamics in the delivery of Medicaid home-based care including a dramatic increase in beneficiaries through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the shift to Managed Long Term Services and Supports (MLTSS), and the implementation of demonstration programs that merge funding and care management of dually eligible Medicare-Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\nAs the largest payer of home-based care services in the country, the Medicaid program invests nearly $75 billion in annual spending on home-based care services, an amount which represents over 17 percent of the total federal Medicaid budget, underscoring the need to ensure public policies are advanced to protect quality and efficient care for this at-risk population.\n\n\"The new Medicaid Partnership is an opportunity for Medicaid home-based providers to take action on policy issues impacting our consumers and the high quality care delivered to Medicaid beneficiaries daily,\" said David Totaro, Medicaid Partnership Director and Chief Marketing and Government Affairs Officer of BAYADA Home Health. \"Through the Medicaid Partnership, we look forward to working with Congress, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other federal agencies and the full spectrum of stakeholders to elevate and address the policy issues most impacting our consumers and the home-based services they depend upon.\"\n\nThe Medicaid Partnership will launch an advocacy program to educate federal policy makers on the delivery of home-based care to ensure Medicaid policies are crafted that protect \u2013 and strengthen \u2013 the delivery of home-based, cost-effective care.\n\nFounding members of the Partnership for Medicaid Home-Based Care include AccentCare, Addus HomeCare, BAYADA Home Health Care, Caring Associates, Council for State Home Care Associations, Home Care by Black Stone, Interim HealthCare, Molina Healthcare, ResCare, Sutter Care at Home and VNA Health Group.\n\nSOURCE Partnership for Medicaid Home-Based Care", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "district of columbia",
