REUTERS/Larry Downing\n\n4564306\n\nPresident Barack Obama believes \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csex\u201d are different things.\n\nIn a Monday press release issued to support National Women\u2019s Health Week, Obama declared that affordable health care is a fundamental right \u2014 for all sexes and genders.\n\n\u201cThe security of quality, affordable health care should not be a privilege \u2014 it should be a fundamental right for every person, regardless of their sex or gender,\u201d Obama stated in the proclamation.\n\nThe distinction made by the president reflects a growing movement to emphasize that the two words mean different things. According to the World Health Organization, sex \u201crefers to the biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women,\u201d while gender \u201crefers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women.\u201d\n\nAs an example, the WHO gives \u201cwomen earn[ing] significantly less money than men for similar work\u201d in the United States as something that constitutes a \u201cgender characteristic.\u201d\n\nWhile this statement seems to mark the first time the White House has distinguished between the two terms, it\u2019s not the only instance of the administration wading into gender identity.\n\nAccording to reports last fall, individuals desiring gender reassignment surgeries can now get them paid for by Obamacare.\n\nPresident Obama also became the first president to say the word \u201ctransgender\u201d in a public speech when he used the term in his 2015 State of the Union.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Scott Greer", "description": "What difference does it make?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "President Barack Obama believes \"gender\" and \"sex\" are different things.
