The new GOP hard right wing bills are actually intended to add more penalties and to attack all clinics that provide any abortions, regardless of whether this illegal procedure is involved. The votes here were intended to pull a \u201cgotcha\u201d on the Dems, and they backfired. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s sham outrage at the Dems who refused to vote for even more penalties and additional attacks is laughable.\n\n\n\nMore laughable is O\u2019Reilly\u2019s attempt to spin the Pope\u2019s statements as \u201ca shot at Obama\u201d, when in fact the Pope was offering mutually supportive and friendly statements. Sadly, O\u2019Reilly was so committed to his feelings on this that he refused to allow Jessica Ehrlich to finish a sentence in correction to his rant. It\u2019s interesting that he allowed Andrea Tantaros to throw some fairly nasty invective, including a shameful cheap shot at the end of that segment \u2013 and showed none of the righteous anger he\u2019s displayed at moderate or liberal guests who have behaved similarly in the past. For Ehrlich\u2019s gentle statements, O\u2019Reilly had no patience at all \u2013 he cut her off and began lecturing her before she could even make her point. In fact, she was reminding him that he was taking the Pope\u2019s sentences out of context and even trying to speak for the Pope. She tried to note that the very next sentence from the Pope completely disproved what O\u2019Reilly was saying, and that his body language (something O\u2019Reilly has always professed to study) showed his support and friendship toward President Obama. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s response was to have a bit of a tantrum \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019ll see that I am RIGHT and you are WRONG\u201d, etc.\n\n\n\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s only little allowance to Dems or President Obama was that he acknowledged that the President was a good host and showed good manners. Mike Huckabee, on the other hand, seems to have abandoned his earlier statements along those lines. Maybe three years ago, Huckabee sounded a bit like John McCain at times, noting that he disagreed with the President but didn\u2019t doubt his faith or his sincerity. This week, Huckabee tried something fairly vile \u2013 he threw in the notion that the President is only \u201cpretends\u201d to be a Christian, and issued an embarrassing apology to the Pope for what Huckabee somehow thinks is disrespectful behavior by President Obama. Like Huckabee\u2019s frantic rush to the side of Kim Davis, this move was similarly disregarded by most media. It was seen for what it is \u2013 a desperate attempt by Huckabee to stir up more of the hard right GOP base and thus allow him to stay in the race a little longer. (It\u2019s becoming obvious that Huckabee and Cruz are each attempting to outlast each other \u2013 they\u2019ll wind up as the Santorum/Gingrich couple of the 2016 campaign. This is why Cruz is desperately trying to say he\u2019s raising \u201cso much\u201d money and why Huckabee keeps jumping up and down for every extremist cause. (I confess to enjoying the spectacle of Cruz trying to crash Huckabee\u2019s Davis event and being told no.) When the 2016 election is over, we\u2019ll see if Cruz gets his wish and winds up in Huckabee\u2019s old slot at Fox News, or if Huckabee himself takes it back. I\u2019d guess the latter, with Cruz getting a \u201ccommentator\u201d position like that of Sarah Palin. But the bad blood between these guys is palpable, even thousands of miles away. You can see it directly through all the false piety and the desperate clambering for the moral high ground neither man possesses.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "lUg9pcsEu0tjaqF5IccQdd8s46P6B9uGqrXwvJEHQKI=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/bill_o_reilly_uses_pope_s_visit_to_smear_obama_and_pro_choice_democrats_092315", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Bill O\u2019Reilly Uses Pope\u2019s Visit To Smear Obama And Pro-Choice Democrats"}, "Title": "Bill O\u2019Reilly Uses Pope\u2019s Visit To Smear Obama And Pro-Choice Democrats"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe31e5\"", "article_summary": "For Ehrlich\u2019s gentle statements, O\u2019Reilly had no patience at all \u2013 he cut her off and began lecturing her before she could even make her point.\n(I confess to enjoying the spectacle of Cruz trying to crash Huckabee\u2019s Davis event and being told no.)\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s only little allowance to Dems or President Obama was that he acknowledged that the President was a good host and showed good manners.\nMore laughable is O\u2019Reilly\u2019s attempt to spin the Pope\u2019s statements as \u201ca shot at Obama\u201d, when in fact the Pope was offering mutually supportive and friendly statements.\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s sham outrage at the Dems who refused to vote for even more penalties and additional attacks is laughable."}
