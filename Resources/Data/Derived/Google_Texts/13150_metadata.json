They\u2019re Democrats, but they\u2019re not acting like the Democrats of old. Here comes Sandy Levin (D-MI), charging into the House with a scathing opening statement during yet another GOP attempt to dismantle Obamacare, in which he totally destroyed Eric Cantor\u2019s (R-VA) silly claim that Obamacare was on \u201cborrowed time\u201d.\n\nLevin started with, \u201cThis weekend House Majority Leader Eric Cantor declared that the Affordable Care Act \u2018is on borrowed time.\u2019 Well let\u2019s review what the Affordable Care Act has accomplished on Mr. Cantor\u2019s so-called \u2018borrowed time.'\u201d\n\nOh, dear. Is Representative Levin going to beat Cantor\u2019s claim with the truth stick? Things are about to get ugly up in the House.\n\nHere\u2019s what Cantor said on Face The Nation on Sunday, \u201cFirst of all, the Affordable Care Act \u2014 I think most of the public has now seen what we\u2019ve been talking about. This law is a disaster. In my opinion, Obamacare is on borrowed time. You know, policies are being canceled, prices are going up, access to hospitals and doctors are being limited \u2013\u201d\n\nSo Levin dropped some facts on Cantor:\n\nMore than three million people have enrolled in private insurance through the new marketplaces.\n\nOver six million people have been determined eligible for Medicaid.\n\nNo one can be denied coverage for a preexisting condition or kicked off an insurance plan.\n\nMore than 100 million Americans no longer have a lifetime limit on coverage.\n\n105 million Americans have received access to free preventative services.\n\nSix million young adults have been able to get health insurance through their parent\u2019s plans.\n\nOver seven million senior citizens have saved more than $8.3 billion on prescription drugs.\n\nOh, but, wait. Glitches! Running against Obamacare was the entire GOP 2014 plan. Can they get a redo?\n\nNo, not unless they want to do something instead of wasting time pretending to dismantle Obamacare. Levin accused Republicans of preferring failure since they refuse to do anything positive, \u201cRegrettably, rather than working to achieve success, it is clear with every new bill that Republicans simply prefer its failure. Today\u2019s effort is just the latest salvo.\u201d\n\nLevin is not impressed with the agenda set by House Republicans.\n\nThe alleged purpose of today\u2019s \u201chearing\u201d on Obamacare was to \u201cfocus on the employer mandate and the so-called 30-hour rule of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d In reality, it was meant to create free Republican ads for the upcoming election. But Levin poured a little truth sugar on it anyway, \u201cEven without that employer mandate in effect yet \u2013 the vast majority of employers today offer coverage to their workers. Why? Because providing employee coverage is good for business.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not like the authors of Obamacare didn\u2019t spend months crafting the law. Yes, not only did they read their own law (instead of pulling a Republican by submitting an ALEC law and not even bothering to retype it), but they wrote it. They put thought into it.\n\nLevin was forced to explain reality to Republicans, which is always a bit embarrassing, \u201cThe ACA\u2019s use of a 30-hour standard to define full-time was set to minimize gamesmanship and incentives that might tempt some employers to reduce hours in order to avoid their responsibility to offer affordable coverage, or in order to help offset the \u201cfree rider\u201d costs that would come about to public programs as their uninsured workers seek health insurance elsewhere.\u201d\n\nEven worse, Democrats did this because they used studies.\n\nYes, the garlic to Republican beliefs \u2014 science. Facts. Will the persecution of House Republicans never end? Levin was not finished, \u201cStudies have found that raising the threshold from 30 hours to 40 hours would place two to five times as many workers at risk of having their hours reduced and, therefore, at risk of losing benefits. The bottom line is that many businesses define full-time as somewhere between 32-40 hours. While changing to a 40-hour standard might help businesses escape their responsibility to contribute to a healthy workforce, if you care about workers and their benefits, you will oppose this measure.\u201d\n\nEr, maybe Levin should have left that last bit out, because we all know Republicans do not care about workers and their benefits.\n\nAs to Republicans other objection, if only they paid attention. Whilst they\u2019ve been screaming about Obama acting like a President by using executive orders, they apparently chose to ignore what he was going to address with his executive office powers. \u201cHowever, legislation is unnecessary at this point. The Administration has already announced that it will use its authority to take the necessary action to ensure that volunteer firefighters and emergency responders will not be treated as employees within the context of the employer mandate.\u201d\n\nSo, this entire hearing was irrelevant, redundant and a waste of money? Yes. Naturally.\n\nObamacare is not on \u201cborrowed time\u201d. Quite the contrary, it\u2019s here to stay and now that people are signing up, it\u2019s rather awkward for Republicans to run on taking away their health insurance.\n\nWill we spend the entirety of 2014 relitigating Obamacare as House Republicans again ignore the job crises facing the people? I believe you already know the answer to that question. What you may not have known was how Democrats were going to react to yet another year of GOP Total Fail.\n\nBuckle up, people.
