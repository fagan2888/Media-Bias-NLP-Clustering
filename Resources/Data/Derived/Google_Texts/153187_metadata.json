The exchange\u2019s board of directors said they plan to name an interim CEO within a week.\n\n\u201cIt was a hard decision,\u201d Fontneau said. \u201cThis was one of the most interesting, challenging experiences I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nFontneau was among the first employees to join the exchange, when she took the top post in December 2011.\n\nDuring her tenure, Fontneau has been the lightning rod for controversies and political battles surrounding the startup of the state\u2019s health insurance exchange and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPart of the criticism Fontneau and the exchange has faced stemmed from personnel issues, including Fontneau\u2019s $190,000 salary and 2.5 percent raise this year. Her pay and that of other exchange officials is higher than counterparts at three similar state exchanges.\n\nAnother personnel issue, the forced resignation in March of a midlevel manager placed on administrative leave after she was indicted for theft and fraud in Montana, drew criticism of her hire.\n\nFontneau and supporters say Connect for Health Colorado opened on time Oct. 13, 2013, and under budget, with more than 140,000 Coloradans having used the exchange to enroll in private insurance. The exchange\u2019s enrollment fees are among the lowest in the country.\n\n\u201cEverything is in such good shape,\u201d Fontneau said. \u201cWe have such a strong team in place. We are financially secure. We are self-sustaining.\u201d\n\nCritics, however, have expressed doubts that the exchange will remain financially solvent once the period of federal grants ends.\n\nConnect for Health Colorado, a public nonprofit established by the Colorado General Assembly in 2011, aims to enable individuals, families and small employers to shop for affordable health insurance online or in person.\n\n\u201cContinuing political uncertainty is perhaps the biggest challenge for the state exchange,\u201d Fontneau said.\n\nDavid Guilmette, president of Cigna\u2019s Global Employer Segment, said in a news release the company hired Fontneau to lead its rapidly growing private exchange business.\n\nElecta Draper: 303-954-1276, edraper@denverpost.com or twitter.com/electadraper", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado health insurance exchange CEO Patty Fontneau leaves for Cigna", "title": "Colorado health insurance exchange CEO Patty Fontneau leaves for Cigna", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/24/colorado-health-insurance-exchange-ceo-patty-fontneau-leaves-for-cigna/", "image": {"width": 446, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140724__Patty-Fontneaup1.jpg", "height": 530}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140724__Patty-Fontneaup1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-24T13:13:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:47:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "The state health insurance exchange\u2019s chief executive, Patty Fontneau, announced Thursday she will leave Connect for Health Colorado to take a job as president of Private Exchange Business for Cigna.\n\u201cContinuing political uncertainty is perhaps the biggest challenge for the state exchange,\u201d Fontneau said.\nConnect for Health Colorado, a public nonprofit established by the Colorado General Assembly in 2011, aims to enable individuals, families and small employers to shop for affordable health insurance online or in person.\nDuring her tenure, Fontneau has been the lightning rod for controversies and political battles surrounding the startup of the state\u2019s health insurance exchange and the Affordable Care Act.\nFontneau and supporters say Connect for Health Colorado opened on time Oct. 13, 2013, and under budget, with more than 140,000 Coloradans having used the exchange to enroll in private insurance."}
