Justices on the high court are nominated by the president and must be approved by the Senate. They serve life terms.\n\nSome Republican candidates, including former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, have struck a more conciliatory tone on the gay marriage ruling, criticizing it while also urging the country to move on.\n\nFormer Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, however, has been strongly critical, telling CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday that the court\u2019s decision was a \u201cnail in the coffin\u201d for the institution of marriage.\n\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, another Republican presidential hopeful, also criticized the court for what he said was interference in politics and redefining the meaning of marriage.\n\n\u201cIt will be destructive,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d.\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz repeated his call that the constitution should be amended so voters could recall Supreme Court justices. Cruz said the court was wading too deeply into policy decisions, including its ruling that upheld the way Washington provides subsidies under President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be rewriting Obamacare,\u201d Cruz told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d.\n\n(Reporting by Jason Lange; Additional reporting by Krista Hughes; and Bill Trott; Editing by Frances Kerry)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Chris-Christie-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Chris Christie: My Supreme Court justices would have ruled differently on same-sex marriage, Obamacare"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Texas Senator Ted Cruz repeated his call that the constitution should be amended so voters could recall Supreme Court justices.\nSupreme Court decisions play a perennial role in U.S. elections.\nThe two landmark rulings last month angered many conservative Americans and several Republican presidential candidates have condemned the decisions.\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be rewriting Obamacare,\u201d Cruz told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d.\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, another Republican presidential hopeful, also criticized the court for what he said was interference in politics and redefining the meaning of marriage."}
