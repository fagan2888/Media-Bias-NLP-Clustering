However, less than 10% of plan participants that have the option currently make Roth 401(k) contributions.\n\nA report from Willis Towers Watson notes Roth 401(k) contributions can be one of the most tax-effective ways for employees to save for retirement. With Roth 401(k) contributions, workers make contributions using after-tax dollars and are able to take tax-free withdrawals at retirement. More importantly, Roth contributions can offer tax diversification for many retirees as they begin to take pensions, employer-match contributions from regular 401(k) plans and other taxable income. And unlike with regular 401(k)s and Social Security, Roth 401(k) contributions are not subject to minimum distribution requirements after age 70 \u00bd if they are rolled over to a Roth IRA.\n\n\u201cWhen employees bypass Roth 401(k) contributions, they unnecessarily narrow their tools for tax-effective retirement savings. For some, using distributions before age 65 may enable qualification for health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Roth contributions can also help some retirees avoid the tax torpedo, which can increase a retiree\u2019s marginal tax rate based on the tax phase-in on certain Social Security benefits,\u201d says Kevin Wagner, a senior retirement consultant at Willis Towers Watson in Southfield, Michigan.\n\n\u201cOne other real important point,\u201d Wagner tells PLANSPONSOR, \u201cis tax diversification is helpful since participants don\u2019t know what the tax rules will be in the future. Having savings in different categories can address changes in tax laws.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Roth, Education/Advice, Plan Design", "Description": "Willis Towers Watson explains the benefits of saving for retirement in Roth accounts and how to promote them to retirement plan participants.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "article_summary": "However, less than 10% of plan participants that have the option currently make Roth 401(k) contributions.\nAccording to a Willis Towers Watson survey, the percentage of plan sponsors offering a Roth option has increased from 46% in 2012 to 54% in 2014.\nAnd unlike with regular 401(k)s and Social Security, Roth 401(k) contributions are not subject to minimum distribution requirements after age 70 \u00bd if they are rolled over to a Roth IRA.\nWith Roth 401(k) contributions, workers make contributions using after-tax dollars and are able to take tax-free withdrawals at retirement.\n\u201cWhen employees bypass Roth 401(k) contributions, they unnecessarily narrow their tools for tax-effective retirement savings."}
