We may see some regulation at the federal level to make it more difficult for small and midsize employers to access stop-loss. So this very much remains a tier 1 issue for us,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.\n\nThe issue also affects SIIA members \u201cinvolved in the stop-loss captive marketplace. Rest assured that we have this as a primary focus for SIIA now and in the foreseeable future,\u201d he said.\n\nMore assessments on self-insured employers and their business partners is another issue, he said during SIIA's 24th annual National Educational Conference & Expo last week that attracted more than 1,700 self-insured employers and their providers to Phoenix.\n\n\u201cWe saw a little bit of this earlier this year when the state of Connecticut tried to impose an assessment on the self-insurance marketplace\u201d to subsidize a state program designed to implement value-based health care payment rules, Mr. Ferguson said.\n\n\u201cWe think that is going to be a hot issue to watch in 2015,\u201d he said, adding that SIIA also plans on seeking U.S. Supreme Court review of a federal appellate court decision upholding a Michigan law that imposes a 1% tax on paid health care claims.\n\nWhile SIIA works to preserve self-insured employers' pre-emption from state benefit mandates under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act pre-emption provision, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and other federal legislation and regulations continue to erode this protection, Mr. Ferguson said.\n\n\u201cThe threats to ERISA pre-emption take many different forms, from taxes and assessments to regulatory schemes,\u201d he said.\n\nSIIA also is keeping a close eye on the debate over whether to reauthorize the federal terrorism backstop, which reinsures some captives that self-insure terrorism risk, he said.\n\n\u201cIf that law expires, the option to use captive insurance for terrorism exposures goes away,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. \u201cIn the waning days of this congressional session, we expect this to go down to the wire, and we're engaged on that.\u201d\n\nThough SIIA has a federal lobbyist, that alone \u201cjust doesn't cut it these days,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to be an effective advocacy organization, we have to have what I call an \"advocacy toolbox,' which includes multiple tools that you use in different ways in order to get where you want to go,\u201d he said. To this end, \u201cSIIA has been building its toolbox to make it larger and more effective over time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its federal lobbyist in Washington, SIIA has added an in-house state lobbyist and put another on retainer in New York, Mr. Ferguson said. SIIA also urges its members \u2014 especially employers \u2014 to join the fight as part of a grass-roots lobbying campaign.\n\nIn many cases, \u201cwhen you put a constituent in front of a member of Congress and have them talk eyeball-to-eyeball about the issues that are affecting them,\u201d it can have a greater effect than professional lobbying efforts, Mr. Ferguson said. \u201cEmployers need to get more involved by meeting with their elected officials to explain the role of self-insurance and why it's so important.\u201d SIIA also has joined forces with nine other insurance industry and employer groups to form the Self-Insurance Defense Coalition, he said.\n\nIn addition to SIIA, the other members of this coalition are the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers, the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, the National Retail Federation, the National Association of Health Underwriters, the National Franchisee Association, the National Electrical Contractors Association and Heating, Air-Conditioning & Refrigeration Distributors International. The group will coordinate lobbying, litigation and media relations of the national trade associations on self-insurance issues at the federal and state levels, Mr. Ferguson said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "PHOENIX \u2014 The Self-Insurance Institute of America Inc. is mobilizing for battle as self-insured group health insurance comes under attack from lawmakers at the state and federal levels.In addition to some states' regulatory crackdowns on the use of stop-loss coverage by self-funded employers, ...", "title": "Self-insured group coverage comes under attack - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20141012/NEWS03/310129943", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20141012/NEWS03/310129943/AR/0/self-insured-group-coverage-under-attack.jpg", "type": "article"}, "title": "Self-insured group coverage comes under attack - Business Insurance", "description": "PHOENIX \u2014 The Self-Insurance Institute of America Inc. is mobilizing for battle as self-insured group health insurance comes under attack from lawmakers at the state and federal levels.In addition to some states' regulatory crackdowns on the use of stop-loss coverage by self-funded employers, ...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png"}, "article_summary": "PHOENIX \u2014 The Self-Insurance Institute of America Inc. is mobilizing for battle as self-insured group health insurance comes under attack from lawmakers at the state and federal levels.\nThe group will coordinate lobbying, litigation and media relations of the national trade associations on self-insurance issues at the federal and state levels, Mr. Ferguson said.\n\u201cIf that law expires, the option to use captive insurance for terrorism exposures goes away,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.\nSo this very much remains a tier 1 issue for us,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.\n\u201cThe regulation of stop-loss insurance is a hot issue both at the state and federal levels."}
