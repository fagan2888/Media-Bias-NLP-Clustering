But I received a bill from an outside lab for balances left unpaid by my insurance company. I thought everything included in these annual preventive visits was free. Why am I getting stuck with unexpected bills?\n\nAnswer:\n\nPerhaps one of the most widely celebrated changes ushered in by the Affordable Care Act is the inclusion of free preventive care. Although you were smart to take advantage of this opportunity to see a doctor and receive annual screenings, it\u2019s unfortunate you\u2019ve been left with out-of-pocket costs. It could be a mistake on the part of your medical provider, but the costs might end up being your responsibility.\n\nThe importance of free preventive care\n\nResearch indicates that preventive care can save lives. But prior to the ACA, many Americans were postponing regular doctor\u2019s visits because of cost concerns. According to a 2013 health survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation, 20% of women put off seeing the doctor for preventive services. The hope was that making many of these services free would motivate women to seek out this care and improve health outcomes in the long run.\n\nWhile we call these services \u201cfree,\u201d the term isn\u2019t exactly appropriate. Your insurance is paying for your care, with no \u201ccost sharing\u201d passed on to you. So although you don\u2019t necessarily have out-of-pocket costs for these services, they are not entirely free.\n\nThe key to understanding why you got charged lies in understanding what\u2019s covered.\n\nWhat\u2019s included in free preventive care under the ACA?\n\nThe ACA specifies certain preventive screenings and treatments for adults and some specific to women. It\u2019s likely when you go to your OB/GYN for your annual well woman visit that you\u2019ll receive services off of both of these lists.\n\nFor adults, free preventive care includes things such as blood pressure screenings, cholesterol tests, Type 2 diabetes screenings and immunizations. An entire list of covered preventive benefits can be found at Healthcare.gov.\n\nFor women, the list is longer, with some benefits exclusive to pregnant women or women over certain ages. Your well woman visit itself should have been covered at no cost to you, as should have any of the following you might have received: screening for sexually transmitted infections, cervical cancer screening (pap smear), pelvic exam, and contraceptives and related counseling.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t covered as free preventive care?\n\nYou mentioned your doctor sent some lab work off for analysis, and that\u2019s where your bills came from. It\u2019s not unusual for some doctor\u2019s offices to use one (usually in-house) lab for basic testing and send more complex tests out to another location. It might be that these additional screenings were simply not among those covered under free preventive care.\n\nAn example would be if you have irregular periods and your doctor wanted to check your hormone levels, or if you have thyroid problems and she wanted to see whether your medication was working. Those additional lab tests aren\u2019t covered under the free preventive care offered by the ACA.\n\nCheck for billing errors\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the external lab or labs billed you for screenings that should have been covered \u2014 a cholesterol or HIV test, for instance. Take a look at the bills you received and determine what exactly you\u2019re being charged for. If the bill doesn\u2019t make it clear, call the lab and ask.\n\nA coding error on the part of the lab could have led to an erroneous denial by your insurance company. Many services have multiple billing codes, and it\u2019s possible that the billing department chose the code that doesn\u2019t correspond to preventive care. If this is the case, ask the lab to correct their error and resubmit. If their claim was correct but it was mistakenly denied, you can file an appeal with your insurance company.\n\nMake payment arrangements\n\nIf the lab services were not covered under free preventive care, their costs will fall under other cost-sharing aspects of your health insurance plan. The balances left to you will likely be applied toward your annual deductible or coinsurance specified in your policy.\n\nPaying these bills should be a priority. If the balances are too high to pay off with a single payment, contact the billing office to discuss payment arrangements. Medical providers are often willing to negotiate with patients who show a willingness to pay.\n\nPrevent unexpected bills in the future\n\nNow that you know what is and isn\u2019t covered under free preventive care, bills for those additional tests and treatments don\u2019t have to come as a surprise. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask your doctor whether or not the screenings she\u2019s recommending will come at a cost to you. Also, consider setting aside pre-tax dollars for medical expenses in a flexible spending account through your employer.\n\nUnexpected medical bills can throw off your monthly budget and cause significant financial stress. By planning for your share of any health care costs, you can avoid that stress without sacrificing valuable preventive care.\n\nHave a question for Christina?
