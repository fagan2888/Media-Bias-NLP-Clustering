(AP) - Several Catholic organizations have withdrawn from Norfolk\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade to protest the selection of Gov. Terry McAuliffe as grand marshal.\n\nAt least six schools and a church won\u2019t participate in Saturday\u2019s parade, which is organized by Knights of Columbus Council No. 3548. They oppose the governor\u2019s appearance because of his stances on abortion and same-sex marriage, WAVY-TV reported.\n\nMcAuliffe, who is Catholic, has vowed to block efforts at limiting abortion rights. He is the first Virginia governor to preside over a same-sex wedding ceremony.\n\n\u201cGovernor McAuliffe stands contrary to the Catholic Church in not one but many essential teachings of the Church in the political arena,\u201d Father Dan Beeman, pastor of Holy Trinity Church, wrote in a letter to parishioners obtained by WAVY. \u201cHe himself promised to be a \u2018brick wall\u2019 against restrictions on abortion, has taken away common sense protections for women in abortion facilities and lowered safety standards, and consistently takes money from pro-abortion lobbying groups.\u201d\n\nBeeman\u2019s letter said the parish will not support or participate in the parade.\n\nMcAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy said the governor is a lifelong Catholic who takes his faith seriously.\n\n\u201cHe also believes in keeping government out of decisions that should be left to women and their doctors, or to consenting adults who love each other. He is committed to building a new Virginia economy that is open and welcoming to people of all races, genders, creeds and sexual orientation,\u201d Mr. Coy said in a statement to WAVY.\n\nCatholic schools\u2019 participation in the parade is organized by the Ancient Order of Hibernians Division No. 1. Kevin Cassidy, the group\u2019s president, said the group\u2019s intention was to make a statement, and not to penalize the students.\n\n\u201cIt was the only way we felt we could make a statement because there was an affront to our principals. It really bothered many of us,\u201d Mr. Cassidy told WAVY.\n\nDave Nelson, deputy grand knight of the local Knights of Columbus, referred calls to other members who are in charge of parade. Other members didn\u2019t return WAVY\u2019s telephone calls, the station reported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several Catholic organizations have withdrawn from Norfolk's St. Patrick's Day parade to protest the selection of Gov.
