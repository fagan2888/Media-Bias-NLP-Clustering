× Tacoma-area woman charged in assault of boyfriend’s child

TACOMA, Wash. (AP) — A Tacoma-area woman has been charged with assault of her boyfriend’s 4-year-old son.

The News-Tribune newspaper reports charging papers say the boy’s older brother told investigators the back of his head was “squishy” after his father’s girlfriend allegedly threw the 4-year-old to the floor.

Sandy Figueroa Arriaga, 25, is charged with second-degree child assault.

Charging papers say the boy was taken to Mary Bridge Children’s Hospital on March 30 with a fractured skull, two black eyes and bruising on his legs and back.

He initially said he had fallen off a bike, but when his mother told him to be truthful, he said his father’s girlfriend had thrown him to the floor. Charging papers say he also told investigators he was hit and choked.
