Football players need good healthcare more than anyone #getcovered,\u201d Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo said in a tweet.\n\nThe official White House Twitter account later retweeted Ayanbadejo\u2019s message.\n\n[blackbirdpie url=\"https://twitter.com/brendon310/status/430036540736430082\"]\n\nAdditional pro-Obamacare tweets from the Ravens linebacker contained language allegedly pulled directly from Lierman\u2019s email.\n\n\u201cGetting ready for Super Bowl XLVIII\u2026 Football fans don\u2019t forget you can affordable healthcare at healthcare.gov #getcovered,\u201d Ayanbadejo added in another tweet.\n\n[blackbirdpie url=\"https://twitter.com/brendon310/status/430038866289229824\"]\n\nAs it turned out, the White House only retweeted one tweet, from Ayanbadejo. It did not promote tweets from other NFL players, including from former wide receiver Donte Stallworth, who posted, \u201cFootball fans, hope you\u2019re getting ready for Super Bowl XLVIII, don\u2019t forget you can #getcovered at healthcare.gov.\u201d\n\n[blackbirdpie url=\"https://twitter.com/DonteStallworth/status/430080877662863360\"]\n\nThe language in Stallworth\u2019s tweet was also supposedly pulled directly from Lierman\u2019s list of suggestions.\n\nIt seems likely that the White House avoided promoting tweets similar to Ayanbadejo\u2019s because it would have seemed redundant.\n\nA Beacon source said Lierman\u2019s email was forwarded to players\u2019 marketing representatives, meaning most of the players were likely aware of the pro-Obamacare efforts.\n\nAfter word of the alleged collaboration between NFL players and the White House surface, Ayanbadejo defended himself on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhen will these silly republicans that are on my timeline bashing Obamacare realize Mitt Romney created it?\u201d the linebacker asked in a tweet.\n\n[blackbirdpie url=\"https://twitter.com/brendon310/status/430468777902215168\"]\n\n\u201cI am on twitter to talk and engage with people. I just love all people. Not here for a Salem witch hunt,\u201d he added. \u201cI am a Obama supporter. I\u2019m not paid. The ACA has helped my family immensely. My mom has many health issues and she is affordable insured.\u201d\n\n[blackbirdpie url=\"https://twitter.com/brendon310/status/430541846079471616\"]\n\n[blackbirdpie url=\"https://twitter.com/brendon310/status/430546803482574848\"]\n\n\u201cI could have voted Romney & potentially paid less taxes. Id rather pay more & make sure the majority of Americans have gov programs,\u201d he added.\n\n[blackbirdpie url=\"https://twitter.com/brendon310/status/430549869879504896\"]\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens were awarded a $130,000 contract in 2013 from Maryland\u2019s Obamacare exchange to promote the massive health insurance program.\n\nThe NFL is currently operating as a 501(c)6 organization, meaning it\u2019s exempt from paying federal income taxes.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nThis post has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration reportedly collaborated with a handful of NFL players on Super Bowl Sunday to promote the Affordable Care Act on a social media site.
