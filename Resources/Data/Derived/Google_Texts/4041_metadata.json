It doesn't matter if a corrupt, dependent and hollow government with the use of petrodollars condemns it in a statement. To hell with it,\" he wrote.\n\nThe White House shares the view of Gulf Arab states that Tehran plays a destabilizing role, but its push for the nuclear deal Iran agreed with world powers last year caused fears in Riyadh that Washington was not listening to their concerns.\n\nREASSURANCES\n\nThere was no immediate word on whether Obama or Salman had addressed a New York Times report that Saudi Arabia has threatened to sell its multi-billion dollar U.S. assets if Congress passed a bill that could hold the kingdom responsible for any role in al Qaeda's Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.\n\nObama said he opposes the bill because it could expose the United States to lawsuits from citizens of other countries.\n\nThe attack was mounted by al Qaeda, then based in Afghanistan. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals, although no U.S. investigation to date has reported finding evidence of Saudi government support for the attacks.\n\nBefore Obama met King Salman, in an ornate room in a Riyadh palace, U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter had talks with his Gulf Arab counterparts on ways of countering Iranian influence and fighting the Islamic State group.\n\nThey agreed on joint cooperation towards improving Gulf missile defense, special forces and maritime security, but no new deals were announced.\n\nThe GCC secretary general said the bloc and the United States would stage joint maritime patrols to stop weapons smuggling to Iran. American officials said these were already taking place and did not represent a new step.\n\nObama's words of reassurance follow a series of top-level meetings between U.S. and Gulf officials in recent years in which Washington aimed to get across the same message.\n\nHe and Salman last met in the United States in September, a meeting that followed a Camp David summit with Gulf leaders in May that several of the monarchs did not attend.\n\nMore recently, Obama was quoted in a U.S. magazine interview describing some Gulf and European states as \"free riders\" who called for U.S. action without doing enough themselves.\n\nIn comments that were widely criticized in the Gulf but not directly responded to by top officials, he was also quoted as answering a question about whether Saudi Arabia was America's friend by saying \"it's complicated\".\n\nSaudi television earlier broadcast Gulf rulers being welcomed on the runway by King Salman and a host of other robed officials, scenes that were widely contrasted by Saudi social media users with the lack of pomp on Obama's arrival.\n\nObama is set to meet with the leaders of Britain, France and Italy in Hanover on Monday with Islamic State and other security issues high on the agenda.\n\n(Additional reporting by Yeganeh Torbati; Writing by Angus McDowall; Editing by William Maclean and Dominic Evans)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S.", "title": "Obama meets Saudi king as U.S. Iran policy strains alliance", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/President-Obama-arrives-Saudi-capital-Riyadh-summit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-obama_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/President-Obama-arrives-Saudi-capital-Riyadh-summit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-obama_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Obama said he opposes the bill because it could expose the United States to lawsuits from citizens of other countries.\nThe GCC secretary general said the bloc and the United States would stage joint maritime patrols to stop weapons smuggling to Iran.\nObama's words of reassurance follow a series of top-level meetings between U.S. and Gulf officials in recent years in which Washington aimed to get across the same message.\nFifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals, although no U.S. investigation to date has reported finding evidence of Saudi government support for the attacks.\nRIYADH (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama met Saudi Arabia's King Salman on Wednesday to seek joint action on security threats including Iran and Islamic State, but his visit is overshadowed by Gulf Arab exasperation with his approach to the region."}
