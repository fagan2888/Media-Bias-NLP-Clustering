The Florida governor’s race is heading “down to the wire,” according to a Quinnipiac University poll Monday that puts challenger Charlie Crist 1 point ahead of Republican Gov. Rick Scott.

Pollsters say Mr. Crist, a Republican-turned-Democrat who wants his old job back, leads 42-41 percent over Mr. Scott, while Libertarian candidate Adrian Wyllie takes 7 percent. Take away Mr. Wyllie, and Mr. Crist leads Mr. Scott by 44-42 percent, Quinnipiac said.

Nine percent of voters say they are undecided, just one day before the election.

Mr. Scott fares well among men and Mr. Crist has a sizable lead among women, while independents tend to back the Democrat over the incumbent governor, 39-32 percent.

Those who already voted backed Mr. Crist, 44-40 percent.

“After an incredibly expensive, extremely nasty campaign, the Florida governor’s race is too close to call. The winner will be the candidate best able to get his voters to the polls. Turnout, turnout, turnout,” said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac Poll.

Mr. Scott has lambasted Mr. Crist, who preceded him as governor, as unable to to match his economic record and only in the race to fulfill his political ambitions.

Mr. Crist says Mr. Scott has not done enough for struggling Floridians, for instance allowing the state legislature to block plans to expand Medicaid under Obamacare without putting up a fight.
