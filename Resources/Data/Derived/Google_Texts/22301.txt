Democrat State Rep. Ako Abdul-Samad seems to be as ignorant as Al Sharpton was on how the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed [“Candidates support restrictions on voting,” Aug. 6]. He insists Republicans are out to suppress minority votes, but fails to mention the GOP voted yea 94 percent to 73 percent Democrat. Surely, in the interest of fairness, he would have included that fact. Similar stats apply to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

U.S. voter fraud is overwhelmingly a Democrat phenomenon, and Republicans have tried to fix what Obama and his former attorney general have allowed to proliferate. Read “Injustice,” by a Justice Department lawyer who resigned in protest.

Early voting has proven to be a mechanism for fraud and restricting it has the same effect on both parties. Likewise requirements for identification at the polls. But Samad, Obama, the Register editorial board and others aren’t interested in fairness. If illegals were voting for Republicans, instead of free stuff, the left would be screaming for ID requirement. Which is no different than opening a checking account or buying a beer.
