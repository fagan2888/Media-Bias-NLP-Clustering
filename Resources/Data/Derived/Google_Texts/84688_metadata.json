The Commission reported that many Californians with Denti-Cal benefits struggle to find places to use them \u2013 because most dentists want nothing to do with Denti-Cal.\n\n\u201cDenti-Cal\u2019s long-standing inability to reform itself and deliver sufficient care is an unfair and needless condition in the lives of Californians with limited incomes,\u201d said Commission Chair Pedro Nava. \u201cPeople with state dental benefits deserve a government program that works. Instead, families already struggling to get by in California put up with a dysfunctional program that can\u2019t attract providers and too often lets them down.\u201d\n\nThe Commission, after a seven-month review, found that Denti-Cal alone is incapable of stemming a growing \u2013 and preventable \u2013 epidemic of tooth disease in which toddlers by the thousands have mouthfuls of cavities, children and adults are plagued with toothaches, whole counties have no Denti-Cal providers and families don\u2019t understand basic preventative dental care. More, the demand for Denti-Cal services continues to rise.\n\n\uf0a7 The Legislature should set a forceful target in which 66 percent of eligible children use their benefits to make annual dental visits \u2013 up from about half currently. This target should drive a wave of innovations that make the state system operate more like commercial insurance and attract more dentists.\n\nThe Department of Health Care Services, which operates Denti-Cal, should cut the red tape to make it easier for dentists to enroll in the program and care for clients.\n\n\uf0a7 The Legislature and Governor should create an evidence-based advisory group of dental and health experts to guide development of Denti-Cal priorities and oversee policy decisions.\n\n\uf0a7 The Legislature and Governor should pass and sign AB 648 (Low) or similar legislation to expand the concept of teledentistry statewide and help to take mobile dental care into schools, clinics and neighborhood settings where people will use their benefits instead of dentists waiting for people to show up at their offices.\n\n\uf0a7 As an epidemic of dental decay among Californians with Denti-Cal coverage is a larger responsibility than the state\u2019s alone, a large, powerful coalition that includes state government, major funders and non-profit organizations should lead a sustained statewide \u201cgame changer\u201d to reorient the oral health care system for beneficiaries toward preventative care.\n\n\uf0a7 The Legislature should exercise strong oversight over Denti-Cal\u2019s new targeted financial incentives to dentists who provide preventative care for children and encourage pilot projects that similarly use small targeted financial incentives to boost preventative care for children.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is encouraged by a wealth of powerful emerging ideas in California and also within Denti-Cal to focus on preventative care and take services to where they are needed,\u201d Commission Chair Nava said. \u201cFixing Denti-Cal is not about one big solution, but many, to do better by people who have benefits and need places to use them.\u201d\n\nThe Little Hoover Commission is an independent state agency charged with recommending ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of state programs. The Commission\u2019s recommendations are submitted to the Governor and the Legislature for their consideration and action.
