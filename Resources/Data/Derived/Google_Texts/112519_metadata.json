However, people who suffer from Eczema often spend a lot of time and money in order to manage the inflamed and itchy rashes that frequently occur. People have reported that they employ proactive measures in order to keep their skin calm, but flare-ups keep happening. In some cases, Eczema can be so severe that you\u2019ll need to treat it immediately to get back to your daily routine.\n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s quite difficult to hide the flare-ups and prevent a major embarrassment. Even makeups aren\u2019t good enough to cover/disguise your skin condition. An estimate suggests that 10% people in the United States suffer from Eczema, which causes itchy, swollen and red skin, prone to allergies. However, studies disregard the ways in which Eczema can affect lives of suffering individuals. A Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine dermatologist stated that many of his patients were quite unsatisfied with their options and wanted to make sure why.\n\nDr. Jonathan Silverberg used information from the National Center of Health Statistics for a study published in JAMA Dermatology. Silverberg declared that a part of his job was to figure out why Eczema isn\u2019t just skin deep. According to him, 2010 statistics suggests that Eczema victims spent an average of $371 out-of-pocket healthcare.\n\nSilverberg revealed that it was above the usual average that people paid. Meanwhile, in 2012 the figure increased to $489. Silverberg is worried about the increase, especially while looking at the Affordable Care Act. It means that there\u2019s a lot of patient burden of cost. According to him, the problem will keep getting worse.\n\nSilverberg further revealed that people suffering from Eczema missed 68 million working days in 2012. People missed work due to a variety of reasons associated with Osteoporosis, Eczema, allergies, heart disease and asthma. Silverberg explained that people suffering from Eczema were most likely to miss six or more days of work each year.
