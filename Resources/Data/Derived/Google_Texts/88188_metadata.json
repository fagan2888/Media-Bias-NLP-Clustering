I hope you have it in your heart to forgive me. I have not been walking my own bike talk. For even as I write these stories meant to inspire and inform thousands of others in their year-round bike riding, I have been driving around town in my Subaru.\n\nOriginally, it was a matter of logistics. Until last Spring I\u2019d been living 20 miles west of my office on NE Portland. Let me tell you, that commute on a good day is no joke. 25 miles door to door with 1,200 feet of climbing, in each direction.\n\nDuring summer months, it was fine. I rode my sleek, fast, old race bike because I wanted to get from A to B as quickly and efficiently as possible. But during wet weather there was no way I was riding in the dark, over the hill and through the zoo. The roads over the NW Hills are slimy in winter, with low traction and terrible visibility. Commuting became a seasonal thing.\n\nLast June, I moved back into Portland city limits. Summers in Portland being about as perfect as summers can be, I rode around during the week some, but still wasn\u2019t commuting the way I used to in years past. The main holdup was not having a dedicated city bike. Riding my old Cannondale was becoming problematic.\n\nBecause I needed to carry my \u201coffice\u201d with me, my laptop, charger, mouse, noise-cancelling headphones, notebooks and any spare clothing had to be carried in a backpack. I\u2019d stuff my waterproof, indestructible, well-loved Ortleib backpack and strap it on\u2026and start to have neck problems from carrying an extra 15 pounds on my shoulders.\n\nThen there was the fact that even though my race bike was 7 years old, it\u2019s still a really nice bike that would cost thousands to replace if stolen. I needed a dedicated commuter.\n\nI already had four bikes (down from nine). And while sometimes I feel like that\u2019s excessive, most of the time, I could definitely add a fat bike, a 27.5\" all mountain full-suspension bike, and a gravel bike for backcountry touring to round out my quiver. N+1 is my argument for how many bikes is the right amount. But I was hard hit by the reception, and I didn't want to get some $200 piece of crap junker from craigslist that would be thrown in the scrap heap in six months.\n\nFinally, this year, I was able to invest in a new city bike. She\u2019s a plain steel Virtue road frame\u2014nothing fancy\u2014but the boys at Cat Six Cycles (one of Portland's newest bike shops, in NE Portland) built her up with style. VeloOrange full-wrap hammered fenders keep the rain off my feet, legs, and face. PDW's Whiskey Grips provide both comfort and style in the cockpit. A heavy duty porteur rack now carries my heavy loads instead of my body. And Shimano hubs laced to SunRingle rims provide durable, reasonably-priced wheels made to take a beating.\n\nI named her Emma Peel, after the heroine of the \u201960s Avengers series. Like her namesake, she\u2019s classy, stylish, and packs a few surprises under her cool exterior. For one thing, the upright riding position is astonishingly comfortable. It\u2019s prim, proper and I'm able to look around more. It's better not just for safety\u2019s sake, but also because it allows me to take in the fabulous Portland neighborhoods as I amble through them, my shiny new wheels throwing slices of reflected sunbeams, like a spy woman\u2019s throwing knives.\n\nThe front load cargo handling is the biggest surprise. I expected as much, but it definitely requires an adjustment in handling skills. There\u2019s a wonkiness that I enjoy that lightweight high-performance bikes don't offer. It\u2019s completely the opposite of nearly every other bike I\u2019ve owned over the past 15 years.\n\nI still love my snappy road racer. I still love speed. And although I don\u2019t race much anymore beyond the odd mountain bike short track, Enduro, or Super D, there\u2019s something quite thrilling about pushing my limits. I imagine there will be days I have to hustle across town and won\u2019t have the luxury of time to ride my city bike casually. But for now, I simply allow extra time to get to my destination. I arrive warm, not overheated, wearing a healthy glow and a rosy attitude.\n\nSo forgive me, dear reader, for I have sinned. I have already paid my penance in the form of the 10 extra pounds I\u2019m wearing since last fall. As I climb the hill to my new residence on my new bike, I am reminded of the error of my ways with every pedal stroke.\n\nBut, my brothers and sisters\u2014you, the choir\u2014you already know; the Church of Bike is a forgiving institution. Redemption is found not on our knees, but every time we start spinning our wheels, no matter how far astray or how long away we\u2019ve been.\n\nCan I get an amen?\n\nlife in the saddle and outdoor adventure, she is also the author of Bike Yoga, a flexibility and recovery program for cyclists.
