I'm Davan Maharaj, editor of the Los Angeles Times. A shooting at a South Carolina church leaves nine dead. Here are some story lines I don't want you to miss today.



TOP STORIES

Mass shooting called a hate crime

Nine people were killed in a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C., in what the police chief called a hate crime. Police are looking for a white man about 21 years old.

Limiting 'Unlimited'

Unlimited means unlimited, right? Well, not exactly. AT&T customers with "unlimited" data plans have found that the company slows their data to a crawl after they use a certain amount. AT&T insists it has been "fully transparent" with customers. Many who cried foul to the Federal Communications Commission didn't think so. Now, the FCC wants to levy a $100-million fine.

Uberdoing it?

"Sharing economy" firms like Uber are based on an alluring principle: The drivers work for themselves, not the bosses. Not so fast, say California labor regulators in the case of a San Francisco Uber driver; she's an employee, not an "independent contractor." It's no small point and could upend a ride-sharing model that is taking off across the U.S.

Wanted: A Few Good Sunnis

U.S.-led trainers in Iraq have turned out only 7,000 soldiers this year, fewer than a third of the goal. Baghdad isn't sending enough recruits, the Pentagon says. What's really needed are minority Sunni fighters to take back largely Sunni towns overrun by Islamic State fanatics. Problem is, in this sectarian crucible, many won't fight for a Shiite government they don't trust.

NATO Made Me Do It

More saber-rattling from Russia: President Vladimir Putin is adding 40 long-range missiles to his nuclear arsenal. It's not an arms race, the Kremlin says, but a response to "aggressive moves" by NATO. Those moves are in former Soviet republics that have sought more visible NATO protection since Russia's military swiped Crimea from Ukraine. It's still a dangerous game.

When the Owl Calls Your Name



Hearing an owl call your name foretells death, in an old belief of the Kwakwaka'wakw nation in British Columbia. A world away in South Africa, the owl is similarly ominous, sent by a witch doctor, perhaps, with a curse. Happily for owls, there are more people now like Lerato Ramathopa, 13. Her care for barn owls horrified her family -- but brought her joy. It's today's Great Read.
