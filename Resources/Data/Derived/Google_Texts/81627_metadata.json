The vice president compared the event to his 2010 Affordable Care Act signing, in which he could be heard leaning into President Barack Obama\u2019s ear behind the podium to say, \u201cThis is a big f\u2014\u2014 deal.\u201d\n\nWhile being introduced, the event speaker said of Biden:\n\n\u201cFor those of you who don\u2019t know, Joe is famous for some of his one-liners,\u201d the speaker told the crowd. \u201cThere was a bill signing at the White House\u2026and he said it was a big f-ing deal. And that was a quote\u2026If I may say, sir, Ride to Recovery is a big f-ing deal.\u201d\n\nBiden responded that the famous utterance was not intentional and that one of the reporters present could actually \u201cread lips.\u201d\n\nThe speaker also said that Biden is \u201cgoing to run for president again,\u201d to which Biden responded with the sign of the cross, CNN reports.\n\n\u201cI just want you to know, I didn\u2019t intentionally say that,\u201d said Biden. \u201cI actually turned and I said, \u2018Mr. President,\u2019 and I whispered in his ear. Unfortunately, I was looking in the direction of one guy who could actually read lips \u2013 not a joke. Because no one picked it up at the time and one of the reporters read lips. Thank God my mother was gone or I\u2019d have been one dead vice president.\u201d\n\nBiden did offer any aspiring public officials a bit of knowledge from experience: \u201cPiece of advice about that BFD stuff \u2013 assume every microphone is on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vice President Joe Biden took a shot at one of his most famous political gaffes, noting that the best way to avoid such public mistakes is to \u201cassume every microphone is on.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/05/27/biden-offers-advice-assume-every-microphone-is-on/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/97968910-e1401199753682.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/97968910-e1401199753682.jpg?w=1500", "height": 825}, "type": "article", "description": "Vice President Joe Biden took a shot at one of his most famous political gaffes, noting that the best way to avoid such public mistakes is to \u201cassume every microphone is on.\u201d", "title": "Biden Offers Advice: 'Assume Every Microphone Is On'"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/97968910-e1401199753682.jpg?w=1500", "title": "Biden Offers Advice: 'Assume Every Microphone Is On'", "site": "/cbsdc", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Vice President Joe Biden took a shot at one of his most famous political gaffes, noting that the best way to avoid such public mistakes is to \u201cassume every microphone is on.\u201d"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Washington DC", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS DC", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "keywords": "cbs washington, politics, affordable care act signing, biden gaffes, cnn, cyclists, injured veterans, memorial day, microphone, political gaffes, president barack obama podium, road 2 recovery memorial challenge, vice president joe biden, virginia beach", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://washington.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b87f6ea5e510fe3d34ffe9a8dbe8c1cf?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act signing, biden gaffes, cnn, cyclists, injured veterans, memorial day, microphone, political gaffes, president barack obama podium, road 2 recovery memorial challenge, vice president joe biden, virginia beach"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe17\"", "article_summary": "Unfortunately, I was looking in the direction of one guy who could actually read lips \u2013 not a joke.\n\u201cThere was a bill signing at the White House\u2026and he said it was a big f-ing deal.\nThank God my mother was gone or I\u2019d have been one dead vice president.\u201dBiden did offer any aspiring public officials a bit of knowledge from experience: \u201cPiece of advice about that BFD stuff \u2013 assume every microphone is on.\u201d\n\u201cI just want you to know, I didn\u2019t intentionally say that,\u201d said Biden.\nBecause no one picked it up at the time and one of the reporters read lips."}
