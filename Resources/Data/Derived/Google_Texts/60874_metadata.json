At Ritz Carlton Bachelor Gulch (it was voted best ski hotel in the entire world in 2013), 50 luxurious \u2018residences\u2019 were created in 2006 \u2013 whole-ownership properties with ski-in/out access plus all of the storied services that Ritz Carlton brings to its resort guests. That was, of course, exactly the wrong time to have launched those; the only reason why you could imagine that 24 of them are still left; at prices that are literally too low to be real.\n\nThis week Kentwood City in cooperation with Fuller Sotheby\u2019s is bringing those final residences back on the market (three disappeared over the holidays) at prices from $699,900 to $1.6 million. To put that in perspective, figure that the costs-per-foot run from $675 to $1,050 \u2013 less than half the cost of private residences at Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons in Vail, lower still than at Solaris \u2013 well below condos at Four Seasons in Jackson Hole or Deer Valley Utah.\n\n\u201cThis market went really quiet for a number of years, but that\u2019s over now,\u201d says Stan Kniss of Kentwood City, marketing these with Sotheby\u2019s Kraig Forbes. \u201cIt was a time when it was impossible to compare values between resort properties, but now you can clearly see the disparity.\u201d Kniss, an expert on these (he marketed the very successful reintroduction of Four Seasons in LoDo), says he was nonetheless bowled over by the quality of Ritz Carlton Bachelor Gulch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the iconic mountain ski lodge, with the heavy timbers and the big fireplace,\u201d he said. There\u2019s Buffalo\u2019s restaurant and a Spago by Wolfgang Puck; a 19-room grotto spa (voted best spa in the U.S. this year by Travel and Leisure); even two bear-like canines that wander the premises, one a St. Bernard, the other a Berner Sennenhund.\n\nAmong the many services the Ritz Carlton provides, you\u2019ll find a ski concierge right outside the door, at the base of the lift. \u201cThey\u2019ll even help you get your equipment on,\u201d Kniss said. Services that come with residences (mostly two-bedroom plus some 1-bedroom and studio plans) match what hotel guests avail, including twice-a-day housekeeping. In summer the setting is just as alluring as now \u2013 trails into the back country and Eagle River Valley fly fishing.\n\nBut by then it will be unlikely these will be around. \u201cConsider that the biggest ski weekends are after Super Bowl,\u201d Kniss adds. \u201cIf you\u2019re not proactive, they\u2019ll disappear to destination vacationers.\u201d Indeed, that was already the case on one of the early sales over Christmas. Visit the web (WorldsBestSkiHotel.com) and register for a briefing, or call ahead to Kniss or Forbes and set an appointment.
