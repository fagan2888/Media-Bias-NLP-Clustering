Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Supreme Court has seven cases for which it still needs to issue opinions.\n\nOne of those is Obergefell v. Hodges, which looks at state bans on same-sex marriage. The other is King v. Burwell, which presents the latest challenge to President Barack Obama's landmark health care law, the Affordable Care Act. A ruling against the Obama Administration could yank tax subsidies that help low-income Americans afford insurance in federal marketplaces.\n\nMaps from the Kaiser Family Foundation show the wide-ranging impact of a potential ruling against the law.\n\nThe ruling would affect Americans in states relying on the federal marketplace. Although some states have set up their own state exchanges \u2014 California, Washington and Maryland, for example \u2014 most states haven't.\n\n\n\nCourtesy Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has said that 6.4 million Americans will lose their health insurance because they will not be able to afford it without the subsidies.\n\nCourtesy Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nA ruling against the law would pose a large challenge to states like Texas and Florida, which are highly populous and have more people living below or near the poverty line. These states stand to lose the most in tax credit dollars.\n\nCourtesy Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nThe result will be sky-rocketing premiums \u2014 with some people facing an increase as high as 650 percent.\n\nCourtesy Kaiser Family Foundation", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Data Mine [News]", "title": "Who Will Be Affected if SCOTUS Rules Against Obamacare?", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The Supreme Court tackles the Affordable Care Act again.&nbsp;", "title": "Who Will Be Affected if SCOTUS Rules Against Obamacare?", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/06/24/who-will-be-affected-if-scotus-rules-against-obamacare", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/57/21/136fee494480befec41a4bfeaebd/150622-obama-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The Supreme Court tackles the Affordable Care Act again.&nbsp;", "card": "summary", "title": "Who Will Be Affected if SCOTUS Rules Against Obamacare?"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "June 24, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lindsey Cook,Affordable Care Act,health insurance,health care,health,DatamineHealthcare,Pulse,Obama, Barack,Obama administration,Supreme Court,HHS,Data Mine [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Supreme Court tackles the Affordable Care Act again.&nbsp;"}, "article_summary": "Courtesy Kaiser Family FoundationThe result will be sky-rocketing premiums \u2014 with some people facing an increase as high as 650 percent.\nCourtesy Kaiser Family Foundation\nThe other is King v.
