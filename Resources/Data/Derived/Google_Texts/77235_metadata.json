But I think the biggest problem was Roby knew he would have to cover wide receiver Sammy Watkins, who became the No. 4 overall choice in the NFL draft. My point is not to tear Roby apart, but to say his ego will have to be kept in control by the Broncos \u2014 or he will hurt the team more than help.\n\nArt, Ohio State alum\n\nKiz: Who cares if Roby played hooky from the Orange Bowl? That is The Ohio State University\u2019s problem, not ours. But if Roby is getting burned by former CU star Paul Richardson in September, when the Broncos visit Seattle, we will wonder how excited John Elway is that this \u201ccover\u201d corner fell to No. 31 in the first round.\n\nMost valuable Peyton. Kiz, I saw your column on how the Broncos can\u2019t be so reliant on quarterback Peyton Manning to win the Super Bowl. Found it to be a great read, but do you truly believe the Broncos would be lucky to win six games if you took Manning off the Broncos?\n\nJerrett, has faith in team depth\n\nKiz: OK, it drives Denver offensive coordinator Adam Gase crazy when I say this, but \u2026 I will be shocked if Brock Osweiler is ever the starting quarterback for a winning NFL team. Pleasantly surprised. But shocked nonetheless.\n\nTeam player can\u2019t get tossed. How can Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki call himself a team player when he gets himself thrown out of a game against Kansas City while arguing about a strike?\n\nNoel, tough as Nails\n\nKiz: I love Tulo. His passion is a large part of what makes him great. At the same time, here\u2019s one of my golden rules of sports: You can\u2019t help the team win from the bench. Yes, manager Walt Weiss should do the arguing on his players\u2019 behalf. And, yes, umpires can sometimes be thin-skinned. But this one\u2019s on Tulowitzki. Shut up. And keep playing.\n\nRotating rotation. Kiz, you are right about the Rockies needing to acquire another starting pitcher. If Franklin Morales doesn\u2019t get his control together, where does Colorado turn between now and whenever Brett Anderson or Tyler Chatwood comes off the disabled list? But don\u2019t trade prospect Jon Gray. What about Colorado taking a run at left-hander Drew Smyly of Detroit? I say go bold and use Michael Cuddyer as trade bait.\n\nMichael, area code 970\n\nKiz: Kickin\u2019 It Headquarters has been bullish about the Rockies being a winning team in 2014. But if a team with 29-year-old shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, 33-year-old first baseman Justin Morneau, 35-year-old outfielder Cuddyer and 41-year-old closer LaTroy Hawkins isn\u2019t built to win now, it\u2019s poorly built. We hear the screams to keep Gray. Fine. Then let him or hotshot prospect Eddie Butler pitch the seventh inning for a bullpen that needs help now.\n\nRead it and weep. And today\u2019s parting shot is a shout-out of appreciation for the story of 65-year-old American Indian Brian Miller driving thousands of miles to watch his grandson play lacrosse for the University of Denver.\n\nI have been reading the sports pages of The Denver Post for more than 55 years, and do not recall reading an article that was more touching than your column on DU lacrosse star Zach Miller and his grandfather. I cried all the way through the column, which captured the best of what sports is about for me.\n\nDave, knows the score\n\nKick it with Kiz by writing mkiszla@denverpost.com.
