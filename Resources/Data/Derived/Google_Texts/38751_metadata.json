That is the most unaffordable housing market in the country on an absolute measure, according to the first-quarter affordability study released by RealtyTrac.\n\nThe next most unaffordable markets are Marin County, California, near San Francisco, where residents would need to use 109.2 percent of their wages to purchase a home; Santa Cruz County, California, at 106.9 percent; and Manhattan, New York, at 105.1 percent. The top 20 most unaffordable counties are in three states: California, Hawaii and New York.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost absurd,\u201d says Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at RealtyTrac, \u201cthat you have to spend more than 100 percent of your income to buy a home.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why So Many Middle Class Americans Can\u2019t Buy a House\n\nRealtyTrac considered a county\u2019s average wages and calculated the mortgage monthly payment using the county\u2019s median home price and the current mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan with a 3 percent down payment, a common amount for first-time homebuyers. The mortgage payment also included property taxes, home insurance and mortgage insurance.\n\nIn general, the maximum percentage of wages used to pay for a monthly mortgage payment is 28 percent to qualify for a conventional mortgage, says Pava Leyrer, chief operating officer of Northern Mortgage Services. Home loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration or the Department of Agriculture are a bit more lenient at 29 percent, she says.\n\nIn the majority of counties analyzed -- 264 out of 457 counties -- homebuyers would have to use more than 28 percent of their wages to make monthly mortgage payments. Nationwide, the average for wages spent on mortgage payments is 30.2 percent, up from 26.4 percent a year ago.\n\nBlomquist noted that homebuyers can make their monthly mortgage payments more affordable by contributing larger down payments to their home purchases.\n\nRelated: Prices Are Rising. Why Aren\u2019t There More Homes For Sale?\n\nNine percent of U.S. markets are unaffordable in historic terms in the first quarter, compared with only 2 percent the same time a year ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re way below the bubble in terms of markets that were unaffordable. During the bubble, 99 percent were unaffordable,\u201d says Blomquist. \u201cBut if home price growth continues to outpace wage growth, then maybe we\u2019re going down that path again.\u201d\n\nRelated: 12 States with the Hottest 2016 Housing Markets\n\nHere are the most and least affordable markets, ranked by the percentage of monthly wages needed to cover a mortgage payment.\n\nLeast Affordable Counties\n\n20.
