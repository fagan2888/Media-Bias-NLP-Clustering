He welcomed Megyn Kelly, the host of the 9 p.m. \u201cKelly File\u201d show on Fox News, to talk about her anchoring style, among other things. Here\u2019s how she described herself: \u201cI\u2019m a straight-news anchor. I\u2019m not one of the opinion hosts at Fox.\u201d Kelly went on to describe how guests have differing impressions of her politics: \u201cI always tell people if they think I\u2019m this conservative operative, ask Karl Rove if that\u2019s true. \u2026 The way we do it on the Fox News Channel is the straight-news anchors like myself give a hard time to both sides.\u201d\n\nThe problems with that short description of duties are almost too numerous to rebut. For one, that single, famous incident in which Kelly put Rove in his place during an Election Night meltdown was a single, famous incident. Nothing more. A better indicator of whether Kelly hews to Fox News\u2019s conservative politics may just be the makeup of guests that have appeared on the \u201cKelly File\u201d since its launch this fall. Media Matters for America recently completed a breakdown of those guests; it found they tilt more conservative than does the lineup on \u201cHannity.\u201d\n\nAnd that claim about giving a hard time to both sides? How many Obamacare opponents have been grilled mercilessly on Fox News in recent weeks?\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Kelly doesn\u2019t occasionally rip both sides. She does, and she\u2019s closer to a straight-news anchor than many or most of her colleagues at the network. Yet the product that comes off her set, especially on a pivotal political topic like Obamacare, is lopsided.\n\nLeno asked Kelly to cite her \u201clast heated exchange.\u201d She mentioned an entertaining throw-down with Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a former Obama adviser and proponent of Obamacare. \u201cHe tried to blame the failed rollout of HealthCare.gov on Fox News,\u201d said Kelly, prompting laughter from Leno\u2019s audience. \u201cA little off-point. I don\u2019t think we were responsible for that.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the exchange to which Kelly was apparently referring:\n\nEMANUEL: Remember, this was not an environment which was hospitable to setting up the exchanges. You and your colleagues were trying to underfund it and make sure that didn\u2019t work.\n\nKELLY: A lot of the criticism proved true.\n\nEMANUEL: It\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy. We\u2019ll try to do everything we can to make it fail and then when it fails, we\u2019ll say, why did it fail?\n\nKELLY: I don\u2019t think Fox News had anything to do with the rollout of HealthCare.gov.\n\nEMANUEL: You were constantly attacking the law and trying to make it underfunded.\n\nKELLY: It was all our fault.\n\nHad Leno been even a bit steeped in Fox News\u2019s history with the Affordable Care Act, he might have asked Kelly whether her influential network had anything whatsoever to do with attempts to block, defund and otherwise obstruct the health-care implementation. But this is the \u201cTonight Show,\u201d after all.\n\nOne of Leno\u2019s key questions was this: \u201cPeople assume if you\u2019re on Fox News, just as they do if you\u2019re on MSNBC, you have a certain bias. How do you deal with it? You seem pretty straight down the line. How do you deal with that?\u201d\n\n(h/t Mediaite)", "article_metadata": {"description": "She claims to give a 'hard time' to both sides of American politics.
