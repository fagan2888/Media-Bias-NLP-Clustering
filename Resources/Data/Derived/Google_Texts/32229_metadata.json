The law is the failure,\u201d Sexton interjected.\n\nWhen confronted with Obama\u2019s horrendous poll numbers, Hahn argued that the rising stock market is increasing Americans\u2019 optimism which will benefit Obama. That was about all he could muster when asked how Obama could turn things around going into 2014.\n\nLater in the segment, Sexton blasted Obama for acting like an \u201coutsider\u201d in Washington, D.C., despite the fact that he is the president of United States.\n\nThe panel began the segment by discussing Phil Robertson and the so-called \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d controversy.
