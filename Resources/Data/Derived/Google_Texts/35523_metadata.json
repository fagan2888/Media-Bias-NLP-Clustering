As a simple matter of arithmetic, the last Congress was the least productive since clerks started keeping track nearly a century ago \u2013 and the current Congress is significantly worse.\n\nAs we talked about last week, the GOP explanation for this has evolved over time. About a year ago, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) tried pure denial, saying it\u2019s \u201ctotal nonsense\u201d to say Congress is having a \u201chistorically unproductive\u201d term. Soon after, Boehner switched gears, acknowledging reality, but saying failure is a good thing: Congress \u201cought to be judged on how many laws we repeal,\u201d he said, not by how many laws actually pass.\n\nBut as lawmakers\u2019 August recess enters its second week, the Republican line has clearly changed once more. Now the right is wholly invested in the notion that the GOP-led House is a law-passing machine, but it\u2019s that rascally Democratic Senate that\u2019s the problem. Reader Jamie McCarthy flagged this National Review piece, which echoed the new Republican talking points nicely.\n\nThis notion of a \u201cdo-nothing Congress\u201d is yet another Democrat fabrication. In fact, America has a Republican Do-Lots House and a Democratic Do-Little Senate. Since January 2013, according to its Republican Conference, the Do-Lots House has adopted 347 bills that await votes in the Do-Little Senate. These include serious initiatives to reinvigorate the economy, reduce taxes, speed energy production, slice red tape, expand school choice, extend the flexibility of workers\u2019 hours, enhance federal accountability, and more.\n\nSee? House Republicans love governing! They\u2019re passing bills all the time! It\u2019s no wonder GOP House members are trying to work the phrase \u201c Do-Nothing Senate \u201d into public conversation.\n\nThe point, of course, isn\u2019t subtle. Congress is incredibly unpopular; the federal legislative process effectively broke the moment House Republicans took the majority in January 2011; and GOP officials are eager to avoid blame. Sure, Republicans refuse to compromise, refuse to consider concessions, reflexively oppose just about everything President Obama is for (even when he agrees with them), and are willing put aside their own legislative priorities (tax reform, immigration reform, et al), but that\u2019s no reason to hold the GOP responsible for Washington\u2019s policymaking paralysis, right?\n\nThere are, of course, a few problems with the thesis.\n\nFirst, desperate spin notwithstanding, the House always passes more bills than the Senate. Philip Bump explained last week, \u201cIn 11 of the past 19 Congresses \u2013 more than half \u2013 more than 300 bills were waiting for Senate action by the time the Congress completed its work.\u201d There\u2019s no great mystery to this: as a procedural matter, it\u2019s just easier to pass bills in the lower chamber than the so-called \u201c cooling saucer .\u201d\n\nSecond, Senate legislating dropped considerably starting in 2007 \u2013 the year after a Democratic wave pushed Senate Republicans into the minority \u2013 when GOP lawmakers started filibustering literally every bill of any consequence. Republican abuses drastically reduced the institution\u2019s productivity, and this continues to be a dramatic institutional problem, though this clearly doesn\u2019t support the GOP p.r. offensive. (If it\u2019s a \u201cDo-Nothing Senate,\u201d it\u2019s not in Republicans\u2019 interest to draw attention to their own party\u2019s role in creating the problem.)\n\nAnd finally, many of the House-passed bills awaiting Senate action aren\u2019t serious attempts at legislating. They\u2019re far-right bills \u2013 see the recently passed \u201cborder\u201d bill, for example, which House Republican leaders didn\u2019t even want to consider \u2013 crafted to satisfy the GOP\u2019s far-right base. For many of these measures, Republican leaders never had any intention of seeing them become law \u2013 the point was to \u201csend a message.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the GOP-led House voted to repeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act several dozen times, knowing in advance their efforts were pointless. The notion that this is proof of a \u201cDo-Lots House\u201d is plainly ridiculous \u2013 self-indulgent posturing isn\u2019t the same thing as governing.\n\nImagine a scenario in which House Republicans and Senate Democrats worked together on a legislative priority, found some common ground, and accepted a compromise. Then imagine the GOP-led House passed the bipartisan, bicameral bill, only to see the Democratic-led Senate sit on its hands and waste time on extraneous priorities.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Are we looking at a \"Do-Lots House\" vs. a \"Do-Little Senate\"?
