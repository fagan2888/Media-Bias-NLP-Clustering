But, for credibility\u2019s sake, it\u2019d be nice if once in a while someone would call out the president, or leading Democratic Party candidates, or the countless others who lie about firearms.\n\nPresident Obama, who not long ago made the ludicrous claim that in certain neighborhoods it was \u201ceasier for you to buy a handgun and clips than it is for you to buy a fresh vegetable,\u201d now says, \u201cIt\u2019s not just mass shootings. It is the daily shootings that take place in cities across America. It is easier to buy a gun than buy a book.\u201d\n\nDoes anyone in the media believe it\u2019s easier to purchase a Glock than it is a carrot or a book? Probably. I mean, why isn\u2019t there a slew of concerned CNN panels parsing this fantastical statement\u2014or the many others Obama makes about guns?\n\nThe president is supposedly referring to the lack of bookstores in low-income areas, but surely it isn\u2019t the case there, either. Books can be purchased or borrowed through schools, libraries, community centers, bookstores, Wal-Marts, Targets, many supermarkets, and, most importantly, through something called the Internet\u2014that not only allows you to download books almost instantaneously, but also allows you to buy used copies at very low prices. Let\u2019s put it this way: even if you can\u2019t afford books, they are surely far cheaper than any gun you could buy\u2014even if guns were, as so many liberals incorrectly claim, something that can be picked off the shelf without any ID and walked home.\n\nYet folks like Virginia Gov. Terry McCauliffe regularly assert, as he did at a DC rally a couple of weeks ago, that it\u2019s easier to buy a gun than beer in Virginia, because you have to provide ID to purchase alcoholic beverages. McAuliffe also claimed that gun shows have booths with signs that say \u201cno background checks.\u201d As my colleague Sean Davis has pointed out, the federal government has the statutory authority to define who does and does not qualify as an individual \u201cin the business of selling firearms.\u201d Since 1938, every gun dealer in the U.S. has been required to obtain a federal firearm license\u2014whether they sell it in a gun shop, or a gun show, or from a shack in somebody\u2019s backyard. (In some states, a private party firearm transfer between two residents of the same state is permissible without having to process the transaction through a federally licensed dealer.)\n\nWhen this kind of thing goes uncorrected by media, it begins filtering into the ether and millions of Americans begin to believe it. Take CNN, which was hoping to pump up ratings for the Democratic Party debate yesterday by having celebrities ask the candidates questions.\n\nHere is actress and comedian Judy Gold\u2019s entry:\n\nA few months ago, I sent my 13-year-old son out to pick me up some Mucinex and Nyquil. The pharmacist wouldn\u2019t give them to him because he\u2019s under 16. Why is it easier for him to get a gun than to pick up medicine for his sick mom?\n\nMaybe nanny-state, regulation-happy politicians should stop intruding into every aspect of American life, and kids would be able to buy medicine for their mommies without worry. But in California, and I\u2019m just guessing that\u2019s where Gold lives (if we\u2019re talking about New York City, the process for buying a gun is even more difficult) a person must be at least 18 years of age to purchase a rifle or shotgun and 21 years of age to purchase a handgun. A 13-year-old would never be able to buy a gun legally.\n\nAn adult would have to submit a Personal Firearms Eligibility Check application, along with a copy of her California driver\u2019s license or a similar ID card to make sure they are eligible. That already makes it a lot trickier to buy a gun than to purchase Nyquil. The application needs to be notarized and must include an impression of your right thumbprint\u2014which makes getting a gun, a right explicitly guaranteed by the Constitution, more difficult than it is to vote (one that is not). It can take up to 120 days for the state to get back to you. If you are eligible, there is the background check and a 10-day waiting period.\n\nWhen this kind of thing goes uncorrected by media, it begins filtering into the ether and millions of Americans begin to believe it. You might not ever know this if you listened to the Democratic debate on Tuesday or any of the commentary afterwards. When the candidates weren\u2019t advocating that gun manufacturers be held accountable for every crazy person who uses a firearm for nefarious purposes, or blaming the National Rifle Association rather than the millions of people who support the Second Amendment, nearly every candidate repeated some egregious falsehood about guns. Most of the candidates spoke about \u201ccommon sense\u201d gun regulations.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 14 Oct 2015 07:44:48 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The Fourth Estate has a responsibility to correct Democrats' wild exaggerations and untruths about guns.
