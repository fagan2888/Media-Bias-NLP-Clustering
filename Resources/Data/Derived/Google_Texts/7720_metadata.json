In North Carolina, for example, eugenics-based state medical programs sterilized thousands of people, often young, poor women of color, without informed consent from the 1930s through the late 1970s. As recently as the 1990s, several states had policies linking welfare benefits to obtaining the hormonal contraceptive Norplant\u2014effectively paying poor women to relinquish their ability to have children for years. Globally, the governments of China and India, among others, have used mass sterilization as a form of coercive population control.\n\nThat ugly history has led to the enactment of a number of safeguards on contraceptive care, which generally aim to ensure that women are comprehensively informed about the full range of contraceptive methods available, and that services are voluntary. But they have also led in some cases to tighter restrictions on publicly funded services, which raises the question of whether they go too far to protect women from coercion and end up overly restricting choice. For example, Medicaid rules impose a blanket ban on sterilization under age 21, but some advocates argue this measure \u201cmay block access to services for young people who freely and truly desire to terminate their childbearing ability,\u201d Gold writes. Similarly, any policy that encourages or incentivizes any particular contraceptive method could have the effect of steering women\u2019s decisions at the expense of independence of choice. When women are facing heavy economic and social pressures around childbearing, the reproductive health community has a responsibility to develop \u201cthe best way for practitioners to convey that some methods are more effective than others, while still ensuring that women are given the full information they need\u201d to make the best personal decision.\n\nGold explains via e-mail that real informed consent hinges on mutual trust and autonomy: \u201cpatients must possess the capacity to make decisions about their care; their participation in these decisions must be voluntary and they must be provided adequate, appropriate information to make the decisions before them.\u201d Ad Policy\n\nOn the ground, the implementation of Obamacare and other public health programs is still undermined by institutional barriers and lack of awareness. A report from the New York\u2013based healthcare network IUD Task Force found widespread misperceptions: \u201cA 2009-2010 study of office-based providers and Title X family planning providers found that 30 percent of those surveyed had misperceptions about the safety of the IUD\u201d for women who had never borne children. Among young patients, about one in three \u201creported incorrectly that birth control pills were more effective than IUDs for preventing pregnancy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, advocates fear the Hobby Lobby decision might further narrow contraceptive coverage for working women (though the Obama administration is developing reforms to accomodate the ruling). And with the hobbling roll-out of Obamacare, some insurers are simply failing to offer coverage for the full range of contraceptive methods.\n\nAnd the most pernicious barriers to reproductive choice aren\u2019t merely about coverage but about profound racial and economic inequality. According to Guttmacher, \u201cThe number of women in need of contraceptive services and supplies increased 11 percent between 2000 and 2012,\u201d with the rate of increase was even greater for publicly funded programs aimed at poorer women. Women of color generally suffer higher rates of uninsurance. Many immigrants face restrictions on Medicaid or are excluded from the ACA\u2019s insurance provisions.\n\nReproductive rights are just one pillar of a woman\u2019s ability to lead a full life and exercise essential human rights, whether she\u2019s trying to finish college or to get an IUD. The polarization of the wealth gap between genders, institutionalized racism in the healthcare system, and a culture that systematically marginalizes women for seeking to claim full control over their bodies and sexuality\u2014all are reproductive injustices. The tragedy that Hobby Lobby exposed is the distance between the conversation in Washington, fixated on litigating the politics of embryos, and the real debate on economic justice that we can\u2019t have, because politicians are too busy dictating women\u2019s lives to hear their voices.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/prochoice_ap_img_0-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Michelle Chen", "description": "Long acting reversible contraceptives could revolutionize reproductive healthcare...if only politicians would get out of the way.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Long acting reversible contraceptives could revolutionize reproductive healthcare...if only politicians would get out of the way.", "title": "Why Does the Most Effective Birth Control Cost an Entire Month\u2019s Wages?", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/why-does-best-birth-control-cost-entire-months-wages/", "image": {"width": 615, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/prochoice_ap_img_0.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 386}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T11:07:09+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Long acting reversible contraceptives could revolutionize reproductive healthcare...if only politicians would get out of the way.", "title": "Why Does the Most Effective Birth Control Cost an Entire Month\u2019s Wages?", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/why-does-best-birth-control-cost-entire-months-wages/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/prochoice_ap_img_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/prochoice_ap_img_0.jpg", "width": 615, "height": 386}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "September 15th, 2014", "sailthru.title": "Why Does the Most Effective Birth Control Cost an Entire Month\u2019s Wages?", "sailthru.tags": "Healthcare Policy,Reproductive Rights,The Right,Blog", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 112712, "keywords": "hobby lobby, reproductive rights, women s rights, feminism, birth control, healthcare, michelle chen, the nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "the nation", "published_time": "2014-09-15T18:20:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T11:07:09+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/mchen/"}, "sailthru.description": "Long-acting reversible contraceptives could revolutionize reproductive healthcare\u2014if only politicians would get out of the way.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/prochoice_ap_img_0.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Globally, the governments of China and India, among others, have used mass sterilization as a form of coercive population control.\nAnd the most pernicious barriers to reproductive choice aren\u2019t merely about coverage but about profound racial and economic inequality.\nIn North Carolina, for example, eugenics-based state medical programs sterilized thousands of people, often young, poor women of color, without informed consent from the 1930s through the late 1970s.\nAnd with the hobbling roll-out of Obamacare, some insurers are simply failing to offer coverage for the full range of contraceptive methods.\nAs recently as the 1990s, several states had policies linking welfare benefits to obtaining the hormonal contraceptive Norplant\u2014effectively paying poor women to relinquish their ability to have children for years."}
