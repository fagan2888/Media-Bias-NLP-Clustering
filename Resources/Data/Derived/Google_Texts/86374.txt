SOUTH JORDAN, Utah (AP) - A former Utah GOP leader has been convicted of child abuse in an assault on his 13-year-old son last year.

A jury found former Utah Republican Hispanic Assembly Chairman Marco Diaz guilty of the misdemeanor charge Friday in South Jordan Justice Court.

The Salt Lake Tribune reports (http://bit.ly/1K328hP ) a judge suspended a 30-day jail term, but placed Diaz for a year on probation, which includes parenting and anger management classes.

He also must pay a $300 fine.

Diaz is accused of grabbing his son in a choke hold last October, punching him twice in the face and pinning him to the ground. The boy’s face was bruised and swollen.

Police say the father didn’t feel his son was giving him the respect he deserved and was trying to discipline him.
