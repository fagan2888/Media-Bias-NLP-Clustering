Sioux City, Iowa

The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Sioux City's revenue in its first 11 months has fallen short of projections, but still outpaced its predecessor's all-time annual high.



The Hard Rock took in $70 million in gambling revenue in its first 11 months through June 30, the end of the casino's fiscal year. Original projections estimated $90.5 million in the first year of operations, and the first full year's revenue looks to come in lower than that.



But the 11-month total already exceeds the all-time annual high of $61 million set in 2012 by the Argosy riverboat casino, which closed when the downtown Hard Rock opened.



Hard Rock's top month for the year was $7.165 million, collected during its opening month last August.
