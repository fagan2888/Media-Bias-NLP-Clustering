Scott Brown visited the Frisbie Memorial Hospital in Rochester on Tuesday. That hospital is not part of Anthem’s provider network on the health exchange and its leadership has vocally criticized the Affordable Care Act. Brown’s appearance at the hospital coincided with Vice President Joe Biden’s arrival in Nashua.

Brown, who has been eyeing Senator Jeanne Shaheen’s US Senate Seat, told reporters his timing at the hospital was no coincidence. The vice president, he says, was clearly in New Hampshire to campaign for Shaheen. After a tour of the facility, Brown called Shaheen a rubber stamp for the President’s health care act.

So there’s basically a trail of broken promises by the President, the Vice President and Senator Shaheen misleading the people of this state.

Brown has yet to formally announce his candidacy for senate. But, he says, if elected he would vote to repeal Obamacare. Health care policy, Brown says, should be left to the states.
