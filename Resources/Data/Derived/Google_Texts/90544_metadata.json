Photo by Kim Silverstein\n\nDignitaries, students and Jewish community members gathered on Nov. 10 at Hillel at UCLA to celebrate the legacy of U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and the 40 years he has spent representing the area.\n\n\u201cWhy do we here all love Congressman Henry Waxman?\u201d his successor, Congressman-elect Ted Lieu, asked the audience during the event. \u201cThe reason we love him isn\u2019t just because he fought for our issues and he was right. It [is] because he was effective.\u201d\n\nAs Waxman, a giant whose name is synonymous with Southland Democratic politics, completes his final months representing of California\u2019s 33rd District, voices across the broader political landscape have been reflecting on the importance of his political legacy.\n\n\u201cHis retirement is drawing more attention than any congressional retirement that I can recall, because of his historical record,\u201d Burt Margolin, a lobbyist and former assemblyman who spent seven years as Waxman\u2019s chief of staff, told the Journal. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been another lawmaker in the last 50 years who has accomplished more on behalf of progressive values than Henry Waxman.\u201d\n\nWaxman attributed his success, in part, to a compatibility between Jewish and American values. First elected to Congress in 1974 as one of the so-called \u201cWatergate babies,\u201d Waxman made his reputation sponsoring legislation unpopular with many of his colleagues. In particular, Waxman\u2019s career-long efforts to improve the quality and accessibility of health care and to enact stronger environmental protections are now considered ahead of their time.\n\n\u201cI was elected to Congress by constituents who, I felt, wanted me to go there and be a leader on national and international issues,\u201d Waxman told the audience. \u201cWe were in Israel when [Egyptian leader Anwar] Sadat came to speak at the Knesset. We were in Israel when the Ethiopians were brought in. I remember being in Israel when we were struggling to get Jews out of the Soviet Union and it looked like it would never happen.\u201d\n\nDrawing a comparison between Waxman\u2019s career and Moses\u2019 leading of the Israelites across the desert, Hillel at UCLA\u2019s executive director, Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller, called the politician \u201cthe man of 40, our very own Moses.\u201d He added that Waxman \u201ccarried the biblical legacy as he led the battle against the seemingly divine corporate forces that endangered our health and enveloped us with this smoky deceit.\u201d\n\nOf the many bills related to health care Waxman had an essential role in passing are laws improving the quality of infant formula, incentivizing pharmaceutical companies to develop and market drugs to treat rare diseases, facilitating the sale of less-expensive generic drugs, authorizing the Food and Drug Administration to require nutrition labeling on foods, and allocating money for treating people with HIV and AIDS.\n\nWaxman also aggressively pursued improvements to the Clean Air Act during his time in Congress. More recently, Waxman played a prominent role in passing the Affordable Care Act of 2010.\n\nThroughout his four decades on Capitol Hill, Waxman was known as a tough negotiator and an ideologically consistent legislator. \u201cThis guy had a sense of discipline and a tenacity, and I think in some ways \u2014 most important of all \u2014 he was a legislator who could not be intimidated,\u201d said former U.S. Rep. Howard Berman, a close friend of Waxman\u2019s from their days as students at UCLA.\n\nFormer U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson, a Republican from Wyoming, once famously described Waxman as \u201ctougher than a boiled owl.\u201d As chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Waxman aggressively pursued investigations of the tobacco industry, Major League baseball and Wall Street, among many others.\n\n\u201cHe was never afraid to lose,\u201d Margolin said. \u201cHenry liked nothing more than taking on issues knowing that he had only a small chance of prevailing in the short view. He always fought with the long view \u2014 the sense that we might not win this year, but that two years, four years or six years down the road, we can prevail.\u201d\n\nUnwilling to allow his relative inexperience to be an excuse for not acting, Waxman early in his career challenged the seniority system entrenched in House committee politics.\n\nThe UCLA Hillel event was also a\n\nfundraiser for the establishment of the Henry Waxman Fellowship for Jewish Leaders at Hillel at UCLA. The fellowship, which will be awarded to 10 students per year, is intended \u201cto prepare students for a career in public service and train them to emulate the organizing and political styles of Henry Waxman,\u201d Seidler-Feller said.\n\nThe nine-month fellowship will allow Jewish students to meet weekly with local leaders inside and outside of the Jewish community, and to take on greater leadership roles in Hillel and in UCLA more broadly. The fellowship, Seidler-Feller stressed, is shaped in Waxman\u2019s image.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be exaggerating if I said that Henry the lawmaker embodies the classic Jewish-American impulse to establish a model society in our American homeland,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has displayed the divine chutzpah to take on the giants and to defeat them \u2026 in the name of tzedek umishpat, of justice and righteousness.\u201d\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nView our privacy policy and terms of service.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/los_angeles/article/waxman_honored_at_ucla_hillel", "site_name": "Jewish Journal", "image": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/featured/com_henry-waxman_111414.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Waxman honored at UCLA Hillel | Los Angeles"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 23102350, "title": "Waxman honored at UCLA Hillel | Los Angeles", "url": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/los_angeles/article/waxman_honored_at_ucla_hillel", "image": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/featured/com_henry-waxman_111414.jpg", "site": "@jewishjournal", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Jewish Journal, news, jewish, israel, los angeles, Tribe Media Corp, Hollywood, Israel, jewish, judaism, world, nation", "fb": {"app_id": 216180581861512}, "msvalidate.01": "1439B350A4269424970C93B18CEAF6FB", "verify-v1": "5CqSOVc2kyARWwZMAxu3QCpMoZGbB5Nu6xIPWK5MXvQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2d2\"", "article_summary": "The UCLA Hillel event was also afundraiser for the establishment of the Henry Waxman Fellowship for Jewish Leaders at Hillel at UCLA.\n\u201cWhy do we here all love Congressman Henry Waxman?\u201d his successor, Congressman-elect Ted Lieu, asked the audience during the event.\nCongressman Henry Waxman.\nPhoto by Kim SilversteinDignitaries, students and Jewish community members gathered on Nov. 10 at Hillel at UCLA to celebrate the legacy of U.S. Rep.
