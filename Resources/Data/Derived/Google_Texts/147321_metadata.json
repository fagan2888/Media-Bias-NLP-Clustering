At times, the letter seemed like it would never come. But, finally, it arrived.\n\nThe long-sought missive, signed by Deputy Defense Secretary Robert O. Work, states that Marine Lt. Col. John Brow and Maj. Brooks Gruber were not solely responsible for a deadly training accident that killed the Marine Corps pilots and 17 others in 2000.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe letter is a significant shift from the initial news release about the accident that pinned primary blame on Brow and Gruber.\n\nJones made exonerating the two men one of the main causes of his career over the past decade, delivering more than 150 speeches on the House floor on the issue, some with posters of the fallen pilots.\n\nAfter the Department of Defense issued its new position, Jones said, \u201cI knew in my heart that God had said, \u2018It\u2019s over. It\u2019s over. My children can rest in peace now.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn April 8, 2000, Brow, 39, and co-pilot Gruber, 34, were flying over the Arizona desert in a V-22 Osprey on a nighttime test flight. The plane, still in an experimental phase, was the first of its kind: It could take off vertically like a helicopter and then fly horizontally like a fixed-wing plane.\n\nInvestigators later found that a computer in the lead Osprey had failed, perhaps distracting the pilots, who descended upon their objective too steeply without enough forward momentum for the new aircraft. The rotors stalled and the plane flipped over, plummeting 200 feet to the ground and killing all aboard.\n\nThe crash came at a controversial time, as the debate about the merits and costs of the Osprey was intensifying. \u201c60 Minutes\u201d ran a story on the Osprey crashes and falsified test data in 2001.\n\nSome Pentagon officials, including former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, had tried to kill the V-22 program, but supporters in the Navy and Marine Corps wanted to save it.\n\nThe Marine Corps issued its official report on the accident three months later, on July 27, which said \u201ca combination of human factors\u201d was the primary cause of the crash. It was accompanied by a press release that said the pilots\u2019 drive to accomplish their mission \u201cappears to have been the fatal factor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew the minute I saw it that it dishonored the pilots,\u201d Gruber\u2019s widow, Connie, told The Hill. \u201cOne front-page headline followed and boldly screamed, \u2018Pilots to Blame!\u2019 \u201d\n\nConnie Gruber said she and Trish Brow tried to appeal to the Marine Corps. After being given the runaround, she reached out to Jones in 2002.\n\nThe Republican lawmaker from North Carolina said Connie Gruber sent him a letter that said, \u201cIf you are a man of integrity, then you must help me clear my husband\u2019s name who was falsely accused of being responsible for the accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat just really got my attention,\u201d he said.\n\nJones took it on as a personal mission. He wanted the Marine Corps to fix the record, and he wanted to give Brow and Gruber \u2014 and their families \u2014 peace. Gruber\u2019s daughter, Brooke, was just 8 months old when her father was killed.\n\n\u201cWhen these kids are 40 years from now, and tell the story of their daddy, I want them to be able to say, \u2018Go check the record. You\u2019ll see my daddy\u2019s not responsible,\u2019\u201d Jones said.\n\nHe spoke to the authors and investigators of the official report, experts, engineers and lawyers. He requested meetings with Navy and Marine Corps officials. He enlisted other members of Congress, such as Rep. Steny Hoyer (Md.), the No. 2-ranked Democrat in the House.\n\nBut for 13 years, they hit dead end after dead end. Jones said his efforts were rejected at least 20 times.\n\n\u201cI hate to say it, but we had so many meetings on this, particularly with the Marine Corps,\u201d he said. He met with then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel Chuck HagelHagel says NATO deployment could spark a new Cold War with Russia Overnight Defense: House panel unveils 5B defense spending bill Hagel to next president: We need to sit down with Putin MORE, who assigned someone to work with him. But Jones said that contact \u201creally didn\u2019t care about it.\u201d He also met with Navy Secretary Ray Mabus a couple of times.\n\nJones said the prevailing attitude was, \u201cThis is the way it is, and this is the way it\u2019s going to be.\u201d He noted this intransigence existed despite the lack of legal ramifications; the plane\u2019s manufacturers, Bell Helicopter and Boeing, had already settled with the families outside of court.\n\n\u201cNo one was ever wanting to say, \u2018Well let me see what you have, congressman. Let me see what these people who have joined you have said. Let us take a review of what you\u2019ve got,\u2019\u201d Jones said.\n\nBut then Work got involved.\n\nLast summer, Work, a retired Marine colonel, promised Jones he would thoroughly review the case. Several months later, on Dec. 15, 2015, he drafted a letter for the lawmaker, sent with a handwritten note.\n\n\u201cAs promised, please find my draft letter attached. I have spent some time crafting it, guided by prayer, research and discussion with a variety of experts,\u201d Work wrote. \u201cI know I did not go quite as far as you desired, but I believe it does clear the record.\u201d\n\nJones said he didn\u2019t want to open the letter until after Christmas, because if it was not what he needed, he didn\u2019t want to spend the holidays worrying about what to do next.\n\nOn Dec. 29, he opened the letter, and it was almost everything he could have asked for, except for the wording of one sentence, which Work agreed to delete.\n\nWork pointed out in his letter that while human factors did contribute to the accident, other events leading up to the crash made it \u201cprobable, or perhaps inevitable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI disagree with the characterization that the pilots\u2019 drive to accomplish the mission was \u2018the fatal factor\u2019 in the crash,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that there were deficiencies in the V-22\u2019s development and engineering and safety programs that were corrected only after the crash \u2014 and these deficiencies likely contributed to the accident and its fatal outcome. I therefore conclude it is impossible to point to a single \u2018fatal factor\u2019 that caused this crash.\u201d\n\nBut still, the letter needed to be approved by the families, Jones said.\n\nTrish Brow, who lives in Maryland, had told The Hill during the decade-plus struggle that her children, who are now in their 20s, deserved better from the Pentagon.\n\nWhen she viewed the final letter, she told Jones, \u201cCongressman, I believe John can rest now.\u201d\n\nJones described the meeting as \u201cemotional.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can imagine if you\u2019d been on a spiritual journey for 13 years, and the ups and downs and the disappointments, and the hopes and dreams, and that when you get one of the wives to say, \u2018This does it,\u2019 it just was \u2014 it was almost like being lifted off the ground,\u201d Jones said.\n\nHe brought Work\u2019s letter to Connie Gruber in North Carolina. Brooke, now 16, came home from school early. That day, Brooke, who is involved in her high school\u2019s Air Force Junior ROTC program, was in her uniform.\n\nJones said he was struck by the resemblance to her father. \u201cShe looks just like her daddy. She really does.\u201d\n\nAfter the two of them reviewed the letter in private and agreed it was what they wanted, Jones said he knew the fight was finally over.\n\nHe said he couldn\u2019t have done it without a team of people: \u201cThis has been a spiritual team effort.\u201d\n\nJones said there\u2019s one last thing he will do, for himself personally \u2014 visit Brow\u2019s and Gruber\u2019s graves, beginning with Brow\u2019s grave in Arlington.\n\n\u201cI want to say goodbye. I want to salute the colonel and tell him, \u2018Your family loves you very much, and many, many people, not just a congressman, love you. And this is for you to rest in peace,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so many times in life you don\u2019t live long enough to see the conclusion. And this is how God has blessed me. He\u2019s allowed me to see peace.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Two widows and Walter Jones have been waiting for a letter from the Pentagon.", "description": "Two widows and Walter Jones have been waiting for a letter from the Pentagon.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kristina Wong", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Two widows and Walter Jones have been waiting for a letter from the Pentagon.", "title": "The 13-year wait for 2 widows and a congressman comes to an end", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/273159-the-13-year-wait-for-2-widows-and-a-congressman-comes-to-an-end", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/joneswalter_072914gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-16T11:36:09-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-16T11:36-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/273159-the-13-year-wait-for-2-widows-and-a-congressman-comes-to-an-end", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-16T06:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Garrett Evans", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Chuck Hagel,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-16T06:00:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-16T11:36:09-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/273159-the-13-year-wait-for-2-widows-and-a-congressman-comes-to-an-end", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Two widows and Walter Jones have been waiting for a letter from the Pentagon.", "card": "summary", "title": "The 13-year wait for 2 widows and a congressman comes to an end"}, "dcterms.title": "The 13-year wait for 2 widows and a congressman comes to an end"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI hate to say it, but we had so many meetings on this, particularly with the Marine Corps,\u201d he said.\nTwo widows and Congressman Walter Jones have been waiting 13 years for a letter from the Pentagon.\nHe wanted the Marine Corps to fix the record, and he wanted to give Brow and Gruber \u2014 and their families \u2014 peace.\nHe requested meetings with Navy and Marine Corps officials.\nThe Marine Corps issued its official report on the accident three months later, on July 27, which said \u201ca combination of human factors\u201d was the primary cause of the crash."}
