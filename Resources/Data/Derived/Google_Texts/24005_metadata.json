Fermont took a photo of the baby curled up.\n\n\u201cI loved this photo so much,\u201d Fermont said. \u201cI noticed it was so nice for the parents to see!\u201d\n\nFermont has since become known for her pictures of newborn children posed as if still inside the womb. She tries to capture this type of photo whenever possible, and says that a lot of parents request it after seeing her portfolio. Fermont, or a midwife, show the parents how to coax the baby into the position.\n\n\u201cYou get a lot of oooh\u2019s and aaah\u2019s once it\u2019s shown to them,\u201d Fermont says.\n\n\u201cJust after birth [babies] can fold themselves, really curl up, the way they were before they were born,\u201d Fermont wrote in a post on her blog. \u201cMost of the time babies relax in this position, they feel secure again like inside [the womb]. When they grow older, it\u2019s harder and harder for them to curl up this way.\u201d\n\nAnd while sometime the parents request that the midwife hold the child in the photograph, Fermont says \u201cit makes is just a little more special if the dad does it.\u201d\n\nFermont also teaches birth photography workshops, training others to capture images of the magical moment when a child enters the world.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing more beautiful than the birth of a baby,\u201d Fermont says.\n\nOver the the last few years, she has been present for 100 births\u201399 taking place before her own child was born as baby 100.\n\nPhotographer Lobke Koppens, who she trained, captured the moment when her daughter Liv was born in July. Denny, Fermont\u2019s boyfriend, held Liv in the special pose while Koppens snapped a photo.\n\n\u201c[I]t made me realize even more how important photos are,\u201d Fermont says of becoming a mother. \u201cNot only to remember one of the most special moments in your life, but also to process the birth and everything that happened.\u201d\n\nMore of Fermont\u2019s birth photography can be seen on her Facebook page.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Netherlands birth photographer Marry Fermont captures newborn babies in a special pose, portraying how the baby looked inside the womb.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Netherlands birth photographer Marry Fermont captures newborn babies in a special pose, portraying how the baby looked inside the womb.", "title": "Birth Photos Capture Newborns in Special Pose", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150921_BabyWomb.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-22T11:01:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1FbHE7g"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Netherlands birth photographer Marry Fermont captures newborn babies in a special pose, portraying how the baby looked inside the womb.", "title": "Birth Photos Capture Newborns in Special Pose", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150921_BabyWomb.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-09-22T09:53:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-22T11:01:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "birth photography, Marry Fermont, Fermont Fotografie, womb"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNot only to remember one of the most special moments in your life, but also to process the birth and everything that happened.\u201dMore of Fermont\u2019s birth photography can be seen on her Facebook page.\n\u201cThere is nothing more beautiful than the birth of a baby,\u201d Fermont says.\nShe now spends her days photographing newborns, sometimes waking up in the middle of the night to rush to a couple\u2019s side.\nDenny, Fermont\u2019s boyfriend, held Liv in the special pose while Koppens snapped a photo.\n\u201c[I]t made me realize even more how important photos are,\u201d Fermont says of becoming a mother."}
