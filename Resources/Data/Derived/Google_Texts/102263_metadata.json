According to Fox News pollster Frank Luntz, asked recently about the sudden revival of the political ideology: \u201cIf you are a young person and you tell someone of the opposite sex that you are a socialist, you are much more likely to get some action at the end of the evening.\u201d Though pundits may disapprove, it seems that socialism is cool. Apparently, a whiff of Marxism can get you hookups and more.\n\nIt\u2019s been about six years since I graduated, but I\u2019m fairly confident that this is a bit overblown. Yet socialism does seem to have become the political orientation du jour among voters of a certain (read: young) age. As its popularity has grown, the response from older, purportedly wiser politicos has been fascinating \u2013 first mainly dismissiveness, then confusion and now, as the Bernie Sanders campaign improbably persists, genuine alarm.\n\n[The new Democratic Party proposal to rival Bernie Sanders\u2019s socialism]\n\nSo far in the Democratic presidential primary, 1.5 million people under 30 have voted for Sanders more than double the number who have cast a ballot for either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. A January YouGov poll asked respondents whether they had a \u201cfavorable or unfavorable\u201d view of socialism and capitalism. While capitalism rated significantly higher overall, those younger than 30 gave socialism higher marks: Forty-three percent viewed it very or somewhat favorably, compared with only 32 percent for capitalism.\n\nThis seeming rejection of America\u2019s golden key provides a perfect opportunity for older commentators to trot out their shopworn millennial skepticism. The youth are so naive! They\u2019ve forgotten what communism really means. They\u2019ve never witnessed the spirit-crushing methods of autocratic regimes or the grinding failure of centrally planned economies. They don\u2019t even know what socialism is! They\u2019ll grow out of it.\n\nThere is some truth to this. Most young voters did not live through the Cold War; for many millennials, the Soviet Union is little more than a grim backdrop for bad action films. But it\u2019s incredibly patronizing to say that newly passionate young socialists are simply too childish to understand their own beliefs. Pundits attempting to change minds in this manner will find their efforts wildly ineffective.\n\nAnd in reality, many of these dismissive critics played a role in decoupling socialism from its negative connotations. Since 2008, the right has waged war against Barack Obama with what it thought were obviously damaging terms: \u201cHe\u2019s a raging leftist!\u201d \u201cA communist organizer!\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll redistribute our income!\u201d \u201cObamacare is socialism!\u201d But most millennials\u2019 associations with President Obama were (and continue to be) positive, especially in contrast to what seemed to be an ineffective and often willfully obstructionist governing class. A young president with a multicultural background touting hope, change and unity? If that was socialism, it didn\u2019t sound so bad.\n\nMore than anything, however, simple economics have pushed a younger generation of voters to embrace what used to be a dirty word.\n\nThe past 10 years \u2013 for many millennials, the formative years of adulthood \u2013 have eroded the credibility of economic liberalism. The financial crisis and recession weakened youths\u2019 faith in markets, exposed deep levels of inequality and alerted many young people to the fact that their futures were likely to be far less bright than their parents\u2019 were at the same age. Yet they were also told that the solution to these problems was more liberal capitalism.\n\nBut those solutions haven\u2019t delivered, and their failure to do so is perhaps the most fundamental political influencer of our time. Underemployment, excessive debt, out-of-reach health care and delayed life goals are young peoples\u2019 defining concerns, and the traditional assumption \u2013 that free markets and limited state intervention lead to good outcomes \u2013 just doesn\u2019t ring true to them.\n\n[Democratic socialism might be inevitable in America, even if Bernie Sanders loses]\n\nIs it any wonder that young people seek answers elsewhere? And with the term sundered from its negative antecedents and newly associated with potentially positive policy measures, why not be a socialist?\n\nIndeed, for many millennials, \u201csocialism\u201d is simply shorthand for \u201cvaguely Scandinavian in the best way\u201d \u2013 free health care, free education and subsidized child care, a state that supports its citizens rather than leaving them at the mercy of impersonal corporations bent on profit. And if this vision is championed by a candidate whose establishment-rebel status renders him more trustworthy than his competitors, so much the better!\n\nWhen Sanders\u2019s critics raise the alarm about socialism\u2019s return, they paint a picture of collectivization, supply shortages and totalitarian regimes. But in fact, the socialism that most millennials want is simply a return to a more muscular form of traditional liberalism, one that would have felt right at home in the administration of FDR.\n\nPundits will continue to pontificate about how young people don\u2019t remember the bad old days. But the pundits aren\u2019t offering new solutions for the problems of our time. With no other options forthcoming, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that millennials are looking with fresh eyes at the remedies of the past. And while socialism may be trending today, it\u2019s quite possible that it won\u2019t be where large numbers of millennials end up. The question is whether the next idea will be better or worse.\n\nThis opinion piece was originally published in The Washington Post.
