For Republicans, 172 delegates are at stage \u2014 6.9% of the total. Of those, for Democrats, 158 (29%) are divided proportionally on a statewide basis, while 317 (58%) are divided proportionally by congressional district, with each district providing between 5 and 8 delegates. The remaining 73 (13%) are \u201csuperdelegates.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nFor Republicans, 13 (8%) are awarded statewide, with ten going to the candidate with the highest number of votes on a winner-take-all basis, and three going to \u201cpre-determined\u201d delegates (the State Chair, National Committeewoman, National Committeeman). Meanwhile, 159 (92%) are awarded by congressional district on a winner-take-all basis, with each district providing 3 delegates.\n\nThe result: a district-by-district battle in both parties, which we preview for you here.\n\nCA-22: This district takes in the northern and eastern sides of Fresno, including Cal State Fresno, before winding south through the Central Valley. While agricultural, the district also includes a good portion of the valley\u2019s urban population. Roughly half of the district is Hispanic. Moderate Republican Devin Nunes represents the area, and was a critic of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) during the abortive shutdown against Obamacare in 2013. Yet times have changed.\n\nProspects:\n\nDemocrats: Clinton will do well, though Sanders will find some votes in the cities, especially in Fresno.\n\nClinton 3, Sanders 2\n\nRepublicans: Cruz will dominate here, as in much of the Central Valley, thanks to Latinos and conservatives.\n\nCruz 3, Trump 0, Kasich 0\n\nJoel B.
