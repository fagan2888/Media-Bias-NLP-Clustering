Rick Snyder and Democratic challenger Mark Schauer faced off in a town hall event today. It was the only time the candidates will meet this election season. Free Press reporters John Wisely, Brent Snavely and Matt Helms checked the facts shared by the candidates throughout the forum.\n\nClaim: \"It is true that Rick (Snyder) cut a billion from public schools,\" Mark Schauer.\n\nRebuttal: Did you cut $1 billion from schools? \"Of course not,\" Gov. Rick Snyder.\n\nFree Press analysis: State funding for K-12 schools has increased by $723 million under Snyder, from $10.7 billion in fiscal year 2011 \u2014 the last budget of former Gov. Jennifer Granholm \u2014 to $11.4 billion in fiscal year 2014.\n\nDespite that, most school districts have less money for the classroom today than when Granholm left office because federal stimulus funds dried up, the state's per-pupil foundation grant has been cut, enrollment has dropped for many districts, and the $505 million extra that the state has pumped into school districts to help them pay their retirement costs still fell short of the spiraling retirement bills the districts had to pay.\n\nClaim: Schauer said Governor Snyder cut higher education funding by 15% in his first year as governor.\n\nFree Press Analysis: This is true. Snyder's 2012 budget did cut higher education funding by 15%.\n\nSince 2000, universities have seen their state funding cut seven times, including Snyder's first year in office. However, Snyder's 2014 budget includes a 6.1% increase in higher education funding.\n\nClaim: Gov. Snyder improperly worked to line up a furniture contract for his cousin, George Snyder.\n\nRebuttal: Snyder said his cousin has been an office furniture dealer for Grand Rapids-based Haworth for many years. They do business with the state, and \"the last time (the contract) was renewed\u2026it was before I became governor.\"\n\nFree Press Analysis: Not exactly. George Snyder owns DBI Business Interiors of Lansing. The Senate passed a budget bill in 2012 that would have capped furniture purchases at $1 million, but that got changed to a $41-million contract before the budget was finalized. Emails surfaced showing George Snyder contacted Rich Baird, a chief adviser to the governor, concerned about the potential contract cuts.\n\nClaim: \"Why would we lag (on the jobless rate)? We were at the bottom. We've improved dramatically,\" said Snyder, who argued that many Michigan manufacturing jobs moved to southern states before he was governor. \"Now we have the same unemployment rate as some of the states where those jobs went \u2026.like Tennessee.\"\n\nRebuttal: \"We have the fifth worst unemployment rate in country\u2026.We are one of the few states that has not recovered,\" when it comes to job creation, Schauer said.\n\nFree Press Analysis: Here, both Snyder and Schauer are correct. Michigan has come a long way. The state's unemployment rate hit a high of 15.2 % in June 2009. In August, the jobless rate was 7.4%, a reduction of more than half. Michigan's job growth has outperformed the nation's on a percentage basis, growing by 8.1% versus 7% for the nation. That's if you measure the gains from 2010 through June 2014.\n\nNevertheless, the national jobless rate in August was 6.1% and Michigan's jobless rate remains among the highest in the nation.\n\nAnd, at 7.4%, Michigan actually ranked the sixth worst in the nation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But Snyder is right when it comes to Tennessee. Tennessee's rate also is 7.4%.\n\nClaim: Schauer accused Snyder of supporting discriminatory policies against gays and lesbians.\n\nRebuttal: Snyder didn't address that specific allegation, but he has declined repeatedly to say whether he supports marriage rights for same-sex couples, a matter he said he would leave up to federal courts now weighing the constitutionality of Michigan's ban on same-sex marriages. He has also signaled he would like the state Legislature to take up the matter.\n\nFree Press analysis: Snyder in 2011 signed a bill banning insurance benefits for domestic partners of state employees, although it exempted colleges and universities and some other state government employees. Supporters of the bill said it was about fiscal responsibility because domestic partnerships were defined without parameters, and that it was in keeping with Michigan's 2004 constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Critics called it mean-spirited. But same-sex marriage has gained public support rapidly in recent years, and federal courts have repeatedly found same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional. Snyder declined to say what he would do if Michigan's ban is overturned.\n\nClaim: Snyder cut $1.7 billion in business taxes and raised taxes on individuals.\n\nRebuttal: \"We got rid of that unfair tax.\"\n\nFree Press analysis: Snyder's reforms eliminated the widely criticized Michigan Business Tax and replaced it with a 6% corporate income tax. About 95,000 corporations, mostly smaller businesses known as S corporations, don't have to pay that levy. The owners of those corporations still pay personal income tax on money they take out of a business in a given year in the form of income.\n\nSnyder raised about $900 million in taxes by reducing the homestead property tax credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit and by eliminating deductions for children, city income tax, charitable donations and by taxing some pensions.\n\nClaim: Schauer said Snyder has allowed a \"debacle\" to continue in not terminating a contract with Aramark Correctional Services, the state's problem-plagued prison food contractor.\n\nRebuttal: \"I try to work with people first before I throw them out,\" Snyder said.\n\nFree Press analysis: Snyder did not back away from his rationale for keeping Aramark on and giving the company time to correct deficiencies. Aramark's three-year, $145 million contract is supposed to save the state $14 million, but critics say the savings comes with too many troubles. The Free Press has documented a long list of problems since Aramark took over prison food services, including sexual relations between the company's workers and prisoners, Aramark employees smuggling drugs into prisons, food shortages, unauthorized menu substitutions and poor kitchen sanitation.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/1xHJ6FP", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Michigan Gov.
