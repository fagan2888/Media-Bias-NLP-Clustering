These things should be taught in school.\"\n\nRELATED: imagineNATIVE Film Festival Opens with Tribute to Alanis Obomsawin\n\nObomsawin's last two films tackled Canadian current events; People of the Kattawapiskak River looks at the housing crisis on the Attawapiskat First Nation, and Hi-Ho Mistahey!, about the Shannen's Dream campaign named after the young Cree activist Shannen Koostachin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Turtle Island's most esteemed documentary filmmaker is recognized alongside legendary directors Jean-Luc Godard and Michael Winterbottom.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/09/alanis-obomsawin-becomes-first-native-filmmaker-tiff-masters-program-156815", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/film_tiff_first_peoples_cinema_20130906_28270049.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Alanis Obomsawin Becomes First Native Filmmaker in TIFF Masters Program"}, "abstract": "Turtle Island's most esteemed documentary filmmaker is recognized alongside legendary directors Jean-Luc Godard and Michael Winterbottom.", "keywords": "Alanis Obomsawin, Toronto International Film Festival, TIFF, The People of the Kattawapiskak River, Hi-Ho Mistahey!, Documentary Film, James Bay Treaty", "dc": {"title": "Alanis Obomsawin Becomes First Native Filmmaker in TIFF Masters Program"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/09/alanis-obomsawin-becomes-first-native-filmmaker-tiff-masters-program-156815", "dcterms.creator": "jrobertson", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-09-09T16:45-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Alanis Obomsawin Becomes First Native Filmmaker in TIFF Masters Program"}, "article_summary": "And at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, Obomsawin is getting her due becoming the first Indigenous filmmaker to be included in the TIFF Masters Program.\nWith a legacy that stretches back to the early 1970s and consists of over 20 documentary films, Alanis Obomsawin is undoubtedly the most accomplished Aboriginal filmmaker in Canada, if not all of Turtle Island.\nObomsawin's film, Trick or Treaty?, premiered at the festival on Friday, September 5.\nIts subject matter is the 1905 James Bay Treaty, also known as Treaty No.\nThe program is described as \"the latest from the world's most influential art-house filmmakers,\" and Obomsawin's colleagues in the class of 2014 include Michael Winterbottom and Jean-Luc Godard."}
