W. Cooke is a staff writer at National Review.\nExplaining the nature of the new National Health Service in the late 1940s, the British socialist Aneurin Bevan told reporters that \u201cif a bedpan dropped in a hospital corridor, the reverberations should echo in Whitehall.\u201d (\u201cWhitehall\u201d is the part of London in which the national government is located.)\nGiven that we have agreed that our veterans\u2019 health care falls under such responsibilities, Veterans Affairs will always be home to some degree of corruption.\nWhat the VA foreshadows is what the Left would like American health care to become in the future."}
