Alex Mooney as congressman in West Virginia\u2019s 2nd Congressional District.\n\nHunt and U.S. Army lawyer Cory Simpson were neck and neck Tuesday night in the race, but The Associated Press called the race for Hunt just before midnight.\n\nAt press time, with 70 percent of precincts reporting, Hunt and Simpson each had 29 percent of the votes. Hunt had about 300 more votes than Simpson, according to results from the AP. Mooney, a Republican, easily defeated Marc Savitt, a Martinsburg mortgage broker. Mooney had 72 percent of the vote at about 11 p.m.\n\nTom Payne, a Martinsburg patent examiner, had 21 percent of the vote at press time against his Democratic contenders. Harvey Peyton, a Nitro attorney, had 14 percent, and retired Roane County teacher Robin Wilson had 7 percent.\n\nWhen they met with Gazette-Mail editors in April, all of the Democratic candidates criticized Mooney\u2019s time in office.\n\nHunt, a personal injury lawyer, who previously represented Kanawha County in the House of Delegates for 14 years, called Mooney \u201can absent congressman.\u201d\n\nHe repeated that claim against Mooney Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cMooney promised he would come to West Virginia and be one of us. He hasn\u2019t done that,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI\u2019m a native West Virginian. I understand the needs of our people.\u201d\n\nHunt, who was celebrating at the Marriott, said November\u2019s election would be a difficult, but that he could pull off a win.\n\n\u201cAnytime you run against an incumbent it\u2019s difficult, they have sources of funding that can be tough to deal with. But we\u2019ve done polling and we know Mooney is vulnerable,\u201d Hunt said.\n\nIn a statement late Tuesday, Mooney said that it isn\u2019t him who West Virginians can\u2019t relate to, but Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cI look forward to running an aggressive, issue-based campaign focused on standing up for West Virginia\u2019s conservative values,\u201d Mooney\u2019s statement reads. \u201cHillary Clinton and her West Virginia Democrat allies are out-of-touch with hardworking West Virginians. I look forward to continuing to fight for conservative values.\u201d\n\nBefore deciding to make a bid for Congress, Hunt announced last September he would run for state attorney general.\n\nSimpson, who grew up in South Charleston and is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, raised about $160,000 for his campaign. Peyton raised about $112,000 and Hunt about $77,000, according to the Center for Responsible Politics. Mooney raised close to $780,000.\n\nMooney, who lives in Charles Town in the state\u2019s Eastern Panhandle, was first elected two years ago when he defeated former state Democratic Party chairman Nick Casey. The seat was opened after Shelley Moore Capito successfully ran for the U.S. Senate.\n\nMooney, a former chairman of the Maryland Republican Party who moved to West Virginia in 2013, also previously ran for Congress as a college student in New Hampshire.\n\nMooney has campaigned vowing to fight the Affordable Care Act, while Simpson has said it\u2019s doing much good and that its flaws should be fixed.\n\nThe 17-county 2nd Congressional District stretches across the central part of the state, from the Ohio River to the Eastern Panhandle\u2019s borders with Maryland and Virginia.\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s two other congressional races weren\u2019t contested in Tuesday\u2019s primary. In November\u2019s general election, Republican incumbents David McKinley and Evan Jenkins will face, respectively, former state legislator Mike Manypenny and former U.S. Secret Service officer Matt Detch, both Democrats.\n\nReach Kate White at kate.white@wvgazettemail.com, 304-348-1723 or follow @KateLWhite on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "title": "With \u2018Star Wars\u2019 album release, Wilco proves it\u2019s still a rebel", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160526/GZ0607/160529692/AR/0/AR-160529692.jpg", "url": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/ae-music/20160526/with-star-wars-album-release-wilco-proves-its-still-a-rebel", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "description": "See attached", "creator": "@wvgazettemail", "image": {"src": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160526/GZ0607/160529692/AR/0/AR-160529692.jpg"}, "title": "With \u2018Star Wars\u2019 album release, Wilco proves it\u2019s still a rebel", "site": "@wvgazettemail", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-site-verification": "1bw05nOwAmeGwNrWfrMp361tiStYbQbOwqqj_P_-LVA", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/charlestongazettemail"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "dc.title": "With \u2018Star Wars\u2019 album release, Wilco proves it\u2019s still a rebel"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI look forward to running an aggressive, issue-based campaign focused on standing up for West Virginia\u2019s conservative values,\u201d Mooney\u2019s statement reads.\n\u201cHillary Clinton and her West Virginia Democrat allies are out-of-touch with hardworking West Virginians.\nWest Virginia\u2019s two other congressional races weren\u2019t contested in Tuesday\u2019s primary.\nMooney raised close to $780,000.\n\u201cMooney promised he would come to West Virginia and be one of us."}
