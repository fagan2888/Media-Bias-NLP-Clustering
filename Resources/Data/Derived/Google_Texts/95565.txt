Wichita Police Chief Gordon Ramsay says Club Indigo and Pandora Night Club in Old Town are repeatedly in the center of trouble.

A shooting right outside Pandora Night Club on Saturday sent four people to the hospital.

"Those problems of crime and disorder don't really exist anywhere else in Old Town. They are primarily micro hot spots right at these locations and immediately around them," said Chief Gordon Ramsay.

Ramsay says he is scheduling meetings the Old Town Association and the bar owners. He is asking for cooperation with the bar owners on stopping violence from happening.

Overall, Ramsay says that crime in Old Town is down and he plans on keeping that trend going.

"If they [the bar owners] choose not to cooperate, we will bring every single resource to bring them into compliance," Ramsey said. "We are not going to tolerate this going on in Old Town and I hope that is loud and clear," he added.
