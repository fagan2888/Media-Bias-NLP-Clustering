LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Los Angeles County coroner’s office says a human skull found this month in Griffith Park near the Hollywood sign belonged to a woman older than 20.

Two hikers stumbled on the skull March 19 about 400 feet from the Brush Canyon trail near the iconic sign.

Coroner’s Captain John Kadus said Sunday that a forensic anthropologist has determined the woman’s death occurred between 1 and 10 years ago.

City News Service reports the skull is known only as Jane Doe 22.

Other body parts have not been located.

Covering 6 ½ square miles in the eastern Santa Monica Mountain range, Griffith Park is considered the largest municipal park in the nation.
