In 2003, the court ruled in Lawrence v. Texas that sodomy bans such as Virginia\u2019s are unconstitutional.\n\nThe smackdown is the latest in a string of disappointments for Cuccinelli. These have included defeats of his challenge to the Affordable Care Act and his attempt to block the regulation of greenhouse gases.\n\nThe downward spiral of Cuccinelli\u2019s campaign has been so severe, Rachel Maddow dedicated several minutes of her program Monday night to point out why ultraconservative candidates may want to reconsider their campaign strategy.\n\nVisit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy", "article_metadata": {"description": "Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli's campaign suffered another setback after the Supreme Court dismissed the Republican gubernatorial candidate\u2019s appeal to reinstate Virginia's sodomy law.", "og": {"image": "http://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/2013/10/08/Ken-CuccinelliX400_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-17T22:28:15-05:00", "type": "article", "title": "Supreme Court Dismisses Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s Sodomy Law Appeal"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Advocate", "fb": {"page_id": 19799718480, "app_id": 625763650825412, "pages": 6030918854}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-08T18:01:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-08T18:01:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3e83\"", "article_summary": "Supreme Court Dismisses Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s Sodomy Law AppealVirginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli's campaign suffered another setback after the Supreme Court dismissed the Republican gubernatorial candidate\u2019s appeal to reinstate Virginia's sodomy law.\nDespite Cuccinelli\u2019s homophobic fearmongering, the Supreme Court announced Monday, its first day back in session, that it would not consider Cuccinelli\u2019s appeal to reinstate the law.\nThe downward spiral of Cuccinelli\u2019s campaign has been so severe, Rachel Maddow dedicated several minutes of her program Monday night to point out why ultraconservative candidates may want to reconsider their campaign strategy.\nConservative Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli experienced another setback for his campaign to become the state\u2019s governor when the U.S. Supreme Court announced Monday that it would not hear his appeal to restore Virginia\u2019s anti-sodomy law, reports Think Progress.\nIn 2003, the court ruled in Lawrence v.
