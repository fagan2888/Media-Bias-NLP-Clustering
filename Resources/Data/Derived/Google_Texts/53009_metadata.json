To address the need for a one-touch solution, ExamMed has announced the official launch of its universal healthcare technology platform that integrates several standalone functions including online scheduling, universal patient profile, interoperability, telehealth, referral management and billing \u2014 into a single platform. The company hopes to set a new standard for both virtual and in-office care. By catalyzing better population health management, this leads to more time for patient care, improved clinical workflow, bridged communication and continuum of care across multiple providers, drives revenue and increases the overall likelihood of positive outcomes.\n\n\u201cNew regulations including the Affordable Care Act have put a tremendous strain on many providers that are spread too thin managing an influx of patients, complying with stringent government standards and trying to establish new payment models that benefit both patient and provider,\u201d says Jeremy Trabucco, co-founder of ExamMed. \u201cWe developed ExamMed to equip providers with all of the core components they need to succeed and deliver the most personal, high-quality and affordable connected care in one simple and streamlined platform.\u201d\n\nPlatform Overview\n\nThe platform enables providers and institutional stakeholders visibility into key metrics and trends including, for example: treatments, outcomes, and additional revenue capture of telehealth and virtual care offerings.\n\nThe platform is ideal for any office setting and patients of any age \u2013 ranging from practices to hospitals, urgent care and home care to clinics \u2013 that manage patients with chronic diseases and high-risk illnesses or those living in rural areas. Leveraging ExamMed, providers can increase patient engagement and access, improve timeliness and medical home follow-up care with their own patients while remote monitoring promotes the continuum of care, minimizes liability and costly hospital patient readmissions.\n\nCore Features\n\nExamMed\u2019s core features include:\n\n\u2013 HIPPA Compliant HD Video \u2013 allows providers to see their own patients\u2019 24/7 from any camera-enabled technology device. Face-to-face consultation enables visual and physical patient assessment and personalizes remote provider-to-patient encounters, while also permitting multi-provider participation and the ability for trusted \u201cvisitors\u201d such as patient family members and caregivers to join.\n\n\u2013 Centralized Management Portal \u2013 streamlines patient management and promotes shared care through one central dashboard that allows providers to access, manage and communicate information \u2013 from scheduling to referrals to protocols and more \u2013 in real-time across multiple systems.\n\n\u2013 Interoperable EMR/EHR Exchange \u2013 enables provider access to medical records no matter what electronic medical record (EMR) system they operate and features a universal patient profile.\n\n\u2013 Provider Network and Referrals \u2013 platform supports in-network referrals with a database of specialists, allowing providers the ability to seamlessly connect patients with specialty care givers as needed.\n\n\u2013 Smart Coding\u2122 \u2013 simplifies the classification and labeling of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and ICD codes that determine insurance coverage eligibility for each patient encounter.\n\n\u2013 MedCoins\u2122 \u2013 serves as the universal healthcare currency, allowing patients to purchase \u201ccoins\u201d in advance for proactive payment. MedCoins\u2122 can be applied to insurance deductibles or out-of pocket expenses, ensuring the payment and reimbursement of all patient encounters. Coins (or credits) can be pooled by individuals or family purchase, gifting or clinic advances.\n\nAdoption of ExamMed\n\nAmong others, ExamMed has been successfully implemented in practices across the U.S. including MD-based MedPeds, and the pioneering all Nurse Practitioner led PA-based River Practice. Its proven solution is easy to deploy and available through a highly secure, HIPPA compliant dedicated cloud or a self-hosted model. Providers and institutions using ExamMed have unlimited access for a flat monthly fee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ExamMed has announced the official launch of its universal healthcare technology platform that integrates several standalone functions including...", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"description": "ExamMed has announced the official launch of its universal healthcare technology platform that integrates several standalone functions including...", "title": "ExamMed Launches Universal Healthcare Tech Platform", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1008, "identifier": "http://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ExamMed-1.jpg", "height": 520}, "updated_time": "2015-01-22T01:07:42-04:00", "url": "http://hitconsultant.net/2015/01/22/exammed-launches-universal-healthcare-tech-platform/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ExamMed has announced the official launch of its universal healthcare technology platform that integrates several standalone functions including...", "creator": "@hitconsultant", "image": "http://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ExamMed-1.jpg", "title": "ExamMed Launches Universal Healthcare Tech Platform", "site": "@hitconsultant", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "google-site-verification": "ZfA9TYzJhTo4Qq5hZKk2GVBYHj0-7Bu73PO0P5jbDaI", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/HIT-Consultant-Media/302199219847409", "section": "Health IT", "tag": "ExamMed", "published_time": "2015-01-22T00:48:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-22T01:07:42-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc351\"", "article_summary": "To address the need for a one-touch solution, ExamMed has announced the official launch of its universal healthcare technology platform that integrates several standalone functions including online scheduling, universal patient profile, interoperability, telehealth, referral management and billing \u2014 into a single platform.\n\u2013 Interoperable EMR/EHR Exchange \u2013 enables provider access to medical records no matter what electronic medical record (EMR) system they operate and features a universal patient profile.\n\u2013 MedCoins\u2122 \u2013 serves as the universal healthcare currency, allowing patients to purchase \u201ccoins\u201d in advance for proactive payment.\nProviders and institutions using ExamMed have unlimited access for a flat monthly fee.\n\u2013 Provider Network and Referrals \u2013 platform supports in-network referrals with a database of specialists, allowing providers the ability to seamlessly connect patients with specialty care givers as needed."}
