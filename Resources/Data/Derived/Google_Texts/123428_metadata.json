(Photo by Susan Biddle/The Washington Post/Getty Images) (Photo: Washington Post/Getty Images)\n\nfrom an interview with Thomas Frank, author of \u201cListen Liberal: Or, What Ever Happened to the Party of the People?\u201d The interview by Tobita Chow is published in In These Times.\n\nWhat\u2019s the content of the ideology of the professional class and how does it hurt working people? What are their guiding principles?\n\nThe first commandment of the professional class is the idea of meritocracy, which allows people to think that those on top are there because they deserve to be. With the professional class, it\u2019s always associated with education. They deserve to be there because they worked really hard and went to a good college and to a good graduate school. They\u2019re high achievers. Democrats are really given to credentialism in a way that Republicans aren\u2019t.\n\nIf you look at the last few Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Obama, and Hillary Clinton as well, their lives are a tale of educational achievement. This is what opened up the doors of the world to them. It\u2019s a party of who people who have gotten where they are by dint of educational accomplishment.\n\nThis produces a set of related ideas. When the Democrats, the party of the professionals, look at the economic problems of working-class people, they always see an educational problem, because they look at working class people and say, \u201cThose people didn\u2019t do what I did\u201d: go and get advanced degrees, go to the right college, get the high SAT scores and study STEM or whatever.\n\nThere\u2019s another interesting part of this ideology: this endless search for consensus. Washington is a city of professionals with advanced degrees, and Democrats look around them there and say, \u201cWe\u2019re all intelligent people. We all went to good schools. We know what the problems are and we know what the answers are, and politics just get in the way.\u201d\n\nThis is a very typical way of thinking for the professional class: reaching for consensus, because politics is this ugly thing that you don\u2019t really need. You see this in Obama\u2019s endless efforts to negotiate a grand bargain with Republicans because everybody in Washington knows the answers to the problems\u2014we just have to get together, sit down and make an agreement. The same with Obamacare: He spent so many months trying to get Republicans to sign on, even just one or two, so that he could say it was bipartisan. It was an act of consensus. And the Republicans really played him, because they knew that\u2019s what he\u2019d do.\n\n\u2014 Read the interview in its entirety at inthesetimes.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://bcene.ws/26KExNW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "An author\u2019s critique of the Democratic Party.", "og": {"site_name": "Battle Creek Enquirer", "description": "An author\u2019s critique of the Democratic Party.", "title": "Other voices: A party of elites?", "url": "http://www.battlecreekenquirer.com/story/opinion/2016/05/02/voices-party-elites/83787796/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/battlecreekenquirer.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An author\u2019s critique of the Democratic Party.", "title": "Other voices: A party of elites?", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd2c29cc9684659a3e8c20589cac2c6f7165f164/c=99-0-495-396&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/01/BattleCreek/B9321985661Z.1_20160501092451_000_GU2E7VG0Q.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@bcenquirer", "site": "@bcenquirer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=901491591", "fb": {"app_id": 179053648786175}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "What\u2019s the content of the ideology of the professional class and how does it hurt working people?\nAnd the Republicans really played him, because they knew that\u2019s what he\u2019d do.\nIt\u2019s a party of who people who have gotten where they are by dint of educational accomplishment.\nWith the professional class, it\u2019s always associated with education.\nThe first commandment of the professional class is the idea of meritocracy, which allows people to think that those on top are there because they deserve to be."}
