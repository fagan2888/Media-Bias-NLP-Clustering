State legislatures in South Carolina and Louisiana are also considering similar legislation, according to the Goldwater Institute, a conservative think tank that has monitored the matter.\n\n\u201cHaving worked as a doctor for over 30 years, I believe that patient privacy is of paramount importance,\u201d Colorado state Rep. Janak Joshi (R) said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that the government officials we trust to keep us safe would move forward with a program that lacks the most basic protections for Americans\u2019 privacy.\u201d\n\nNavigators have access to Social Security numbers, health information and financial information of consumers they sign up for Obamacare insurance policies.\n\nThe report released last month by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee found several instances of problems plaguing the navigators. Among those:\n\n\u2022 In North Carolina, a navigator grantee organization violated the rules for mailing documents on behalf of consumers. \u2022 Navigators in Dallas were caught on video encouraging applicants to lie on their health insurance applications so the applicants could qualify for tax subsidies. \u2022 Navigators were caught telling an applicant to lie about her smoking habit to get lower cost insurance. Another navigator gave a TV interview and told viewers that applicants\u2019 credit scores would impact their eligibility, which was inaccurate.\n\nMore than 120 navigator grants have been issued in 34 states. Many have gone to liberal groups with ties to the organization once known as ACORN, according to the Goldwater Institute, including Southern United Neighborhoods and Structured Employment Economic Development Corporation.\n\nAs many as 31 states do not require background checks, according to a survey by the National Academy for State Health Policy.\n\nNational Review reported that in Connecticut, one navigator convicted of a class-B felony was permitted to work, while in New Mexico one in seven certified navigators is on the FBI\u2019s criminal database. New Mexico caught and stopped several would-be-navigators charged with serious financial crimes, National Review reported, while 21 navigators applicants in Connecticut were flagged in background checks.\n\n(H/T: National Review)\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Fred Lucas (@FredVLucas3) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "After a congressional investigation found troubling information about the people hired to sign consumers up for Obamacare plans, state lawmakers are taking action to prevent fraud and identity theft.
