Mu\u00f1oz, who has been treating Padilla all along.\n\n\n\n\u201cInsurers discriminate against people who are mentally ill,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz said.\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s all going to change soon. When the historic Affordable Care Act fully unrolls on Jan. 1, 2014, it will require insurers to offer mental health care benefits equal to physical health benefits. In other words, a disorder in the brain will be treated no differently than one in the kidney, Mu\u00f1oz said.\n\n\n\nNot just people with mental disorders, but those with substance use disorders have encountered penny-pinching annual and lifetime caps on coverage, higher deductibles, or simply no coverage at all.\n\n\n\nFederal Parity Law\n\n\n\nThe blatantly discriminatory practices by health insurance companies prompted Congress in 2008 to pass the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), which mandated that psychiatric illness be covered just the same as other medical illnesses. It required insurers to offer the same annual and lifetime dollar limits for mental health care as for medical and surgical care.\n\n\n\nBut the law applies only to larger employers \u2013 those with 50 or more workers \u2013 that offered a health plan that covered mental health and substance abuse. Smaller employers, as well as people who buy their own insurance, are excluded from the benefits of the law.\n\n\n\n\u201cSmaller employers have resisted changing the law, saying they will go broke\u201d if they had to include mental health coverage in their health care plans, Mu\u00f1oz pointed out.\n\n\n\nThe ACA has extended the MHPAEA provisions to state insurance exchanges, known as Covered California in this state. This would require policies purchased by smaller employers and individuals through the exchange, as well as those purchased outside of it, to be MHPAEA-compliant.\n\n\n\nHad the MHPAEA mandated universal psychiatric benefits when it was created, insurers like Padilla\u2019s would not have been able to discriminate between the treatment of psychiatric and non-psychiatric medical illnesses, he said.\n\n\n\nOnly a Fraction of the Mentally Ill Get Treatment\n\n\n\nDr. Clayton Chau, who practices psychiatry in Orange County, Calif., said that because of the discrimination factor, poor access to care and inadequate insurance coverage, only a fraction of those with mental illness get treatment.\n\n\n\nA report by the Surgeon General indicates that one in four Americans has a diagnosable mental illness at any given time. National and international studies show that 1 percent of the general population has schizophrenia, an illness that is treatable, though not curable. Surveys, including those done by the National Institutes of Mental Health, show that only about 50 percent of Americans seek psychiatric treatment.\n\n\n\nAccording to Randall Hagar, director of government relations with the California Psychiatric Association, a state mental health parity bill signed by Gov. Davis in 2000 required insurers to cover the diagnosis and treatment of a range of mental illnesses under \u201cthe same terms and conditions applied to other medical conditions.\u201d The intent of the law was to eliminate the disparity in co-pays and higher deductibles.\n\n\n\nIn the opinion of many advocates, Hagar observed, the law is \u201croutinely violated by plans and insurers, and enforcement is generally weak.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat prompted Sen. Jim Beall, D-Campbell, to try five times to give more teeth to federal and state mental health parity laws. Beall\u2019s first four bills were vetoed by Gov. Schwarzenegger, and his most recent bill (SB22) didn\u2019t even make it out of committee.\n\n\n\nWhat the Health Care Law Will Do\n\n\n\nUnder the ACA, aka Obamacare, health insurers are forbidden from excluding people with pre-existing illness from medical coverage. By definition, Americans with a mental illness have a pre-existing disorder, and up until now, private health insurers have denied with impunity coverage to those with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\n\nCalifornia has added a mental health component to its expanded Medi-Cal program, under ACA, to ensure that its Medi-Cal population with mental disabilities receives more comprehensive mental health benefits, starting Jan. 1, 2014.\n\n\n\nThe current mental health component of Medi-Cal \u201cis limited in terms of the number of providers and the number of services\u201d it offers, Chau said.\n\n\n\nOlder people with mental illness will also benefit from the ACA because the law will close the notorious \u201cdonut hole,\u201d allowing the Medicare population to not have a break in medication.\n\n\n\nPadilla, who\u2019s currently working for his GED, has been able to stay on his father\u2019s insurance because of his age. A provision in the ACA allows children under 26 to remain on a parent\u2019s insurance plan.\n\n\n\nMu\u00f1oz is relieved that the ACA will help patients like Padilla access the care they so badly need. The removal of lifetime caps by insurance companies will enable mentally ill patients to access care before turning to suicidal thoughts, becoming violent or ending up homeless, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "mental health parity substance abuse equity act healthcare reform affordable care act", "description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
