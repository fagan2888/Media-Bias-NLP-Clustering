Thirty-six percent also said they hire independent contractors to reduce tax and benefits costs, and 23 percent said it\u2019s to stay below the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 50 full-time employee count.\n\nSurePayroll\u2019s Scorecard compiles data from more than 40,000 small businesses and exclusively reflects the trends affecting businesses with an average of eight employees.\n\nSurePayroll Inc. provides online payroll services to small businesses.
