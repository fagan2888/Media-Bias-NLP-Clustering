At Red Alert, we believe the offensive word in the Washington Redskins’ name is “Washington.”

However, many politically correct progressives disagree — so much so, that they believe it is offensive for the Redskins to wish their fans Happy Thanksgiving.

The Redskins tweeted a generic “Happy Thanksgiving” picture, saying, “Wishing you and your family a Happy #Thanksgiving.”

The Twitter universe freaked out, and the PC police attacked in full force with hundreds of tweets. Here are some of the most oversensitive and overzealous reactions (full feed here):

@Redskins remember how you continue to disrespect half of the people that were at Thanksgiving? Neat. — DwayneShintziusFan (@Cyrus_is_risen) November 26, 2015

@Redskins Wishing you would discontinue your disrespectful use of this logo and pejorative name. This is inexcusable. — Emily Galled-win (@oddmonstr) November 26, 2015
