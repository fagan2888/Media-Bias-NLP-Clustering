More than 11,000 people followed the Athleta sponsored events \u201cSolstice in Times Square: Athleta Mind Over Madness Yoga\u201d as they gradually moved from pose to pose with their bare feet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the longest day of the year. In the yoga tradition, this is the day you worship the sun,\u201d Christina Cielusniak, 25, a yoga instructor from Wayne, N.J., told NY Daily News.\n\nThe summer solstice occurs when the sun aligns directly over the Tropic of Cancer, which is the moment the earth\u2019s tilt toward the sun is at a maximum on June 21. This is the only day of the year that the sun is at its highest point in the sky, making it the longest day of the calendar year, according to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration.\n\nSolstice means \u201cstanding on the sun\u201d and marks the midsummer point when the earth returns back into the dark half of the year. The sun is an important aspect of yoga. In fact, one of the most familiar stances is Surya Namaskar, which means \u201csun salutation\u201d and represents a symbolic movement of the human reliance on the sun. For thousands of years Hindus, who are one of the original creators of yoga, have revered the sun they call Surya because they believe it is the creator of all life. The sun salutation pose stems from the word namas, which means to bow or adore the sun and is used as a reminder of our place in the world.\n\n\u201cSo it really is this metaphor for the larger challenges of our lives. How do we stay present, how do we stay focused with all the distractions,\u201d Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, told CBS News.\n\nTompkins led the first of eight free classes given on Saturday. The alliance aims to improve \u201ccultivating the creativity, energy and edge that have made the area an icon of entertainment, culture and urban life for over a century.\u201d Tomkins has been the president since 2002 and while New York City is one of the most famous cities in the world, he prefers sailing and practicing yoga.\n\n\u201cI am struck at how it actually is possible in the midst of all this busyness to get yourself into a different state of mind,\u201d he said.\n\nYoga is a meditative practice that is designed to weld the mind and body together through ancient philosophies. It reaps health benefits that range from lowering high blood pressure, to decreasing tension along with strengthening to flexibility, according to the National Institutes of Health. With over 15 million Americans practicing yoga each year, it\u2019s not a surprise that thousands rolled out their mats this weekend to pay patronage to the sun.\n\nAmateurs and yoga instructors alike were able to find their center in Times Square, where they participated in a total of 24 classes on Saturday and Sunday. The event was held both June 21 and 22 to give as many people as they could the opportunity to participate in the free classes, which were live streamed on several websites. The Times Square Alliance supported two yoga-related charities, Bent on Learning and Urban Zen, and promised to match the total donations up to $10,000.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "thousands, attended, yoga, classes, times, square, celebrate, summer, solstice, weekend", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Thousands rolled out their yoga mats and moved into poses in Times Square to welcome the summer solstice.", "title": "More Than 11,000 Yogis Worship Sun In Times Square", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/thousands-attended-yoga-classes-times-square-celebrate-summer-solstice-weekend-289432", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/23/thousands-strike-pose-yoga-event-times-square.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thousands rolled out their yoga mats and moved into poses in Times Square to welcome the summer solstice.", "title": "More Than 11,000 Yogis Worship Sun In Times Square", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/thousands-attended-yoga-classes-times-square-celebrate-summer-solstice-weekend-289432", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/23/thousands-strike-pose-yoga-event-times-square.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/23/thousands-strike-pose-yoga-event-times-square.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-23T11:12:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-23T11:12:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Thousands rolled out their yoga mats and moved into poses in Times Square to welcome the summer solstice."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9371\"", "article_summary": "Thousands of sun-worshipping yogis lined their mats up in the middle of Times Square to celebrate the summer solstice on Saturday.\nThe Times Square Alliance supported two yoga-related charities, Bent on Learning and Urban Zen, and promised to match the total donations up to $10,000.\nHow do we stay present, how do we stay focused with all the distractions,\u201d Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, told CBS News.\nSolstice means \u201cstanding on the sun\u201d and marks the midsummer point when the earth returns back into the dark half of the year.\nAmateurs and yoga instructors alike were able to find their center in Times Square, where they participated in a total of 24 classes on Saturday and Sunday."}
