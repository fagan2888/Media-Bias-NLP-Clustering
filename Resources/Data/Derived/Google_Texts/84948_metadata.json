While some local efforts have been made to identiy the uninsured and reach out with information and assistance in accessing coverage, the IRS and federal government could take the efforts far further.\n\nThe Urban Institute researchers say officials should use the tax data and data from other assistance programs.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Treasury could explore notifying all individuals receiving the EITC in the past year that they may be eligible for substantial financial assistance for coverage,\u201d the report states. It suggests the Treasury could also offer an easy route, such as text messaging, for interested individuals to ask to connect with a navigator for further information and assistance.\n\nHowever, the IRS' current involvement is limited to directing people from its website to HealthCare.gov to learn about health insurance options, and to advising tax preparers to inform eligible clients about their options. However, as KHN notes, many eligible people don\u2019t use tax preparers.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nKaiser Health News: IRS Could Help Find Many Uninsured People, But Doesn\u2019t\n\nThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: Report: Who Are the Remaining Uninsured, and What Do Their Characteristics Tell Us About How to Reach Them?", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Heather Caspi", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/b0/a2/b0a208960f2f4eef865df5d2b90c07a5.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer", "news_keywords": "Payer", "category": "News Post", "title": "Report calls on IRS to tap data to find uninsured", "pub_date": "apr 06, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-06T15:53:16", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Wednesday, April 06, 2016, 03:53 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-03-25T15:53:16", "teaser": "<p>Federal officials have the capacity to find many of the uninsured--if they want to, researchers say.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-04-06", "sailthru.description": "Federal officials have the capacity to find many of the uninsured--if they want to, researchers say.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "Federal officials have the capacity to find many of the uninsured--if they want to, researchers say.", "title": "Report calls on IRS to tap data to find uninsured", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/report-calls-on-irs-to-tap-data-to-find-uninsured/416872/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/flickr_IRS_building.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/c2/32/c232a6e47d260bc7b2b5c9146212d2dc.jpg"}, "article_summary": "The Urban Institute researchers say officials should use the tax data and data from other assistance programs.\nThe Urban Institute calls it a lost opportunity to find and connect eligible, uninsured people with opportunities to gain health coverage.\nRecommended ReadingKaiser Health News: IRS Could Help Find Many Uninsured People, But Doesn\u2019tThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: Report: Who Are the Remaining Uninsured, and What Do Their Characteristics Tell Us About How to Reach Them?\nDive Insight:Despite the impact of the Affordable Care Act in reducing the uninsured rate to its lowest level, U.S. Census data indicate about 33 million people remain uninsured, Kaiser Health News reports.\nWhile some local efforts have been made to identiy the uninsured and reach out with information and assistance in accessing coverage, the IRS and federal government could take the efforts far further."}
