Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-VT) 2016 presidential run.\n\nAccording to new data published by political technology startup Crowdpac, Sanders has attracted more than double the number of former Obama donors than has Democrat presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton at this point in the 2016 race.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe intuitive new graph on Crowdpac\u2019s website, compiled from Federal Election Commission campaign contribution data, shows that 24,582 former Obama donors have contributed money to Sanders\u2019 campaign. Meanwhile, just 9,101 former Obama donors have contributed money to Clinton\u2019s campaign, and 383 have supported former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s 2016 bid.\n\nThe graph only takes into account \u201crepeat\u201d donors, Crowdpac\u2019s Mason Harrison tells Breitbart News, so if a donor hasn\u2019t yet contributed in 2016, he or she will not be represented on the chart. But the preliminary numbers offer a useful window into where supporters of each of the 2012 campaign\u2019s candidates will pledge their contributions in next year\u2019s election.\n\nWith more than a dozen Republican candidates already in the race, 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s donor base has apparently splintered, with Florida Sen. March Rubio being the largest beneficiary of former Romney donors\u2019 dollars. According to Crowdpac, 2,891 former Romney donors have already contributed to Rubio\u2019s campaign, while 1,840 donated to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and 1,562 donated to former Florida Gov. and GOP establishment favorite Jeb Bush. Dr. Ben Carson has also drawn over 1,000 contributors from Romney\u2019s donor base, while Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul have also drawn some support.\n\nMeanwhile, former donors to Libertarian candidate Ron Paul\u2019s 2012 campaign were, unsurprisingly, more inclined to support his son Rand Paul\u2019s (R-KY) 2016 bid, although Sanders has drawn from some of Paul\u2019s former donors as well.\n\nNoticeably absent from the list is Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who only announced his candidacy earlier this week.\n\nCrowdpac says it will continue to update the graph with the latest figures from the FEC as the election continues.\n\nThe graph is just the latest piece of Crowdpac\u2019s 2016 \u201cMoney Race\u201d toolkit, which uses FEC data to paint a picture of each campaign\u2019s financial strength. Voters can quickly and easily see which big donors and super PACs have contributed to each campaign, which industries contribute the most to each candidate and which candidates have raised the most money.\n\n\u201cThis page speaks directly to the core mission of Crowdpac: to give politics back to the people and get everyone to participate more easily and effectively in the political process,\u201d Crowdpac CEO Steve Hilton said in a statement provided to Breitbart News.\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign has gained momentum in recent weeks; though Clinton is still the favorite among Democrat candidates by a large margin, a recent poll found voter support for Clinton slipping and, at the same time, support for Sanders rising.\n\nHarrison tells Breitbart News that the graph indicates Sanders has \u201cclear momentum among the small-donor donor base that fueled President Obama\u2019s election and re-election.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile this group isn\u2019t known for cutting the kinds of \u2018max-out\u2019 checks that Hillary Clinton is getting, they are exactly the type of supporters who will volunteer to help get out the vote \u2013 and that can\u2019t be underestimated,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Data: Obama's Small Donors Pick Sanders over Hillary", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Data: Obama's Small Donors Pick Sanders over Hillary", "title": "Data: Obama's Small Donors Pick Sanders over Hillary - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 639, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Bernie-Sanders-and-Hillary-Clinton-AP-Photos.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/07/17/data-obamas-small-donors-pick-sanders-over-hillary/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Data: Obama's Small Donors Pick Sanders over Hillary", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Bernie-Sanders-and-Hillary-Clinton-AP-Photos.jpg", "title": "Data: Obama's Small Donors Pick Sanders over Hillary - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Ben Carson, Bernie Sanders, Carly Fiorina, CrowdPac, Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Mason Harrison, Mitt Romney, Steve Hilton, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2015-07-17T10:52:49-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd046\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSmall donors to President Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign have flocked en masse to support Sen.
