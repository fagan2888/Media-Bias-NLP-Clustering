(Photo: George Walker IV / The Tennessean)Buy Photo\n\nPresidential politics and disappointment over legislative leadership took down two proposals regarding Insure Tennessee in a House subcommittee.\n\nThe Banking and Insurance Subcommittee heard testimony from those in favor of a measure, HJR0521, to empower Gov. Bill Haslam to enact Insure Tennessee through any means necessary.\n\nBut the sponsor, Rep. Larry Miller, D-Memphis, withdrew the resolution after instructing the purple-clad Insure Tennessee supporters to make the health insurance expansion plan an issue in this year\u2019s campaign for the General Assembly.\n\nMiller, who started off calling himself heartbroken about the situation, said getting Insure Tennessee through the legislature would require leadership, which he had not seen in the House or the Senate.\n\n\"I knew what the inevitable was in that committee. The votes were not there,\" Miller told The Tennessean. \"I hope every member will be faced with the question 'Why did you not support Insure Tennessee.' \"\n\nHaslam proposed Insure Tennessee, a tiered system, to use federal Medicaid funding to expand health insurance coverage. Two subsets of state senators killed Insure Tennessee in 2015 before the proposal ever made it to either floor for discussion and a vote. Much of the opposing rhetoric characterized the proposal as a further extension of Obamacare.\n\nA bill from Rep. Craig Fitzhugh, D-Ripley, to put a non-binding referendum on the November ballot asking whether voters support expansion with a \"yes\" or \"no\" was thwarted by Rep. Jeremy Durham, R-Franklin, who introduced \u2014 an ultimately successful \u2014 motion to send the measure to summer study.\n\nAfter public opinion polls and analysis by regional universities of those eligible, it's time, Fitzhugh said, to ask \"what our bosses think, and I'm talking about those who elect us.\"\n\nFitzhugh said a referendum was a risk that voters might say no, thus likely killing a future push for the plan, but that after two sessions of rhetoric in the General Assembly, a one-sentence question on the ballot was due.\n\nDurham said it was important to know who would sit in the Oval Office in Washington before giving voters a chance to voice an opinion. The presidential vote will matter regardless if it\u2019s a Democrat or Republican, Durham said, citing that Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, pushed through a Medicaid expansion plan. Durham said he thought Texas Sen. Ted Cruz would be against further expansions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to have as much information as possible even before we put it to voters,\u201d Durham said. \u201cWe need to know who the president is.\"\n\nFitzhugh and two committee members, Rep. David Shepard, D-Dickson, and Rep. Joe Towns Jr., D-Memphis, commented after the voice vote that they didn\u2019t think Tennesseans needed to know who the next president will be to have an opinion on whether the state should pass Insure Tennessee.\n\nHouse Democrats slammed Durham for helping push it to the summer review.\n\n\u201cI think we should never be afraid to hear from the people,\u201d Towns said.\n\nThe committee room was packed with supporters from across the state wearing the now recognizable purple shirts for Insure Tennessee.\n\nMichele Johnson, executive director of the Tennessee Justice Center, said the failure to bring the resolution to a vote pointed to a leadership void that has left Tennesseans with elected officials who aren't tending to the \"people's business.\"\n\nBuy Photo Rep.

(Photo: George Walker IV / The Tennessean)\n\n\"We didn\u2019t expect Insure Tennessee would pass today. It has less to do with the merits of it and more to do with the leadership,\" Johnson said. \"There has been a lack of leadership this session.\u201d\n\nThe legislators are looking to 2017 as the next serious reprisal of Insure Tennessee to give legislators the chance \"to catch up with the people,\" Towns said.\n\nMiller said he will refile the resolution, if he's back in the legislature, and hopes Haslam will be engaged with the plan.\n\n\"What I hear more than anything else, from the opposition, is it\u2019s not Insure Tennessee as much as it is the hate of President Obama. To me that doesn\u2019t make any sense,\" Miller said. \"It's not the Affordable Care Act. It's not Obama's initiative. It's Gov. Haslam's initiative.\"\n\nReach Holly Fletcher at 615-259-8287 or on Twitter @hollyfletcher.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1poUesy", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Presidential politics and disappointment over legislative leadership took down\u00a0two Insure Tennessee proposals.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Presidential politics and disappointment over legislative leadership took down\u00a0two Insure Tennessee proposals.", "title": "Political issues torpedo Insure Tennessee bills in House", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/health-care/2016/03/16/house-subcommittee-sinks-referendum-no-insuretn-resolution/81857108/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Presidential politics and disappointment over legislative leadership took down\u00a0two Insure Tennessee proposals.", "title": "Political issues torpedo Insure Tennessee bills in House", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/316ff50a760691fed42f06e62ebb4e308f390609/c=0-412-1640-2052&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/16/Nashville/Nashville/635937501451306726-insureTN.JPG", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/byhollyfletcher"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Tennessee General Assembly", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Tennessee General Assembly", "title": "Political issues torpedo Insure Tennessee bills in House", "author": "Holly Fletcher", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/industries/health-care", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e36efdf6aca4cc969ac5d5788ecd02cc885bdaaf/c=0-139-1640-2326/local/-/media/2016/03/16/Nashville/Nashville/635937501451306726-insureTN.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6fbbe3677e6fa758dd1f75453a69c541a1d85ed8/c=0-412-1640-2052/local/-/media/2016/03/16/Nashville/Nashville/635937501451306726-insureTN.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6053db627f08fb2dbaa7998fd8f838ba223c9a58/c=0-615-1640-1848/local/-/media/2016/03/16/Nashville/Nashville/635937501451306726-insureTN.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/65a83f9852a2bd13581cba48f459948935055eb9/c=0-769-1640-1696&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/03/16/Nashville/Nashville/635937501451306726-insureTN.JPG", "publishtime": "2016-03-16T17:48:00.987000-05:00", "shorthed": "Political issues torpedo Insure TN bills", "articleid": 81857108, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0db89ec520190af9a54446beda6a529f93dbd0b0/c=0-769-1640-1696/local/-/media/2016/03/16/Nashville/Nashville/635937501451306726-insureTN.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/456c2fb38d8a7dfaa0a5f0808bf81316717afcf1/c=130-0-1510-2464/local/-/media/2016/03/16/Nashville/Nashville/635937501451306726-insureTN.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "insure tennessee, jeremy durham, medicaid expansion, bill haslam"}, "article_summary": "The committee room was packed with supporters from across the state wearing the now recognizable purple shirts for Insure Tennessee.\n\"I hope every member will be faced with the question 'Why did you not support Insure Tennessee.'\nBuy Photo Insure Tennessee supporters fill a committee room at Legislative Plaza on Wednesday.\n(Photo: George Walker IV / The Tennessean)Buy PhotoPresidential politics and disappointment over legislative leadership took down two proposals regarding Insure Tennessee in a House subcommittee.\nBill Haslam to enact Insure Tennessee through any means necessary."}
