Larry Hogan, Jr.\u2019s new budget. It\u2019s largely a status quo blueprint that keeping spending under expected revenue growth without harming ongoing programs.\n\nThere\u2019s a bit of sunshine for just about every group \u2013 liberals, conservatives, environmentalists, law-and-order types, urban dwellers, rural residents and suburbanites.\n\nYet there\u2019s a yin and a yang to Hogan\u2019s financial plan for Maryland. The Republican governor seems to be pushing the state in different directions simultaneously.\n\nWhile he is keeping a lid on state spending, as would any conservative politician, Hogan also wants to cut taxes \u2013 a move that would reignite Maryland\u2019s structural deficit Hogan has pledged to eliminate.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nThe positives\n\nFirst, let\u2019s deal with some of the good news.\n\n\u2666Due to a positive economic outlook, the governor doesn\u2019t have to engage in fiscal tricks to balance his budget. He doesn\u2019t have to ask the legislature to suspend spending mandates for a year so he can shift funds to balance the state\u2019s operating budget.\n\n\u2666He also has a large surplus that allows him to clean up past fiscal finagling by former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley during the Great Recession, pay off unpaid bills and put the state\u2019s books in order.\n\n\u2666Hogan is pulling back ever so slightly on building up state debt. It isn\u2019t much of a reduction but it could save the state considerably over the next eight years.\n\n\u2666There\u2019s a substantial boost in spending to clean up the Chesapeake Bay, restore funding to retain open spaces and support environmental programs.\n\n\u2666He\u2019s adding extra funds, $150 million, to the state\u2019s annual pension contribution to help underfunded state retirement programs. It\u2019s a small step in a system that is $19 billion short of full funding, but a symbolic one.\n\n\u2666He\u2019s growing the state\u2019s contribution to community colleges by 6% \u2013 one of the wisest investments he could make.\n\n\u2666He\u2019s putting new emphasis on spending for prison improvements, rehabilitation and treatment programs as part of his effort to keep minor offenders out of jail and cut recidivism. Included in this category is $35 million to demolish and design a new Baltimore City Detention Center. He\u2019s also boosting local police aid nearly 10 percent.\n\n\u2666The Republican governor is leaving Maryland\u2019s Obamacare program alone at a time when the program is signing up a record number of low-income individuals for health care coverage. That\u2019s a common-sense, nonpartisan move that will save money for the state and for hospitals in the long run.\n\nOn the other hand\n\nNow for some of the bad news.\n\n\u2666Hogan\u2019s budget already is out of date, thanks to the continuing swoon on Wall Street and a lack of robust consumer spending. This is likely to throw revenue estimates off by hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\u2666Hogan\u2019s large budget surplus announced last week could largely evaporate by the time new revenue forecasts are put out in March.\n\n\u2666This, in turn, makes it unlikely Hogan will get the tax cuts he\u2019s seeking this legislative session.\n\n\u2666With Maryland\u2019s weak economic rebound now facing a costly dig-out from the Blizzard of 2016 and possibly more bad weather to come, this isn\u2019t the best time to press for action that shrinks state revenue.\n\n\u2666Hogan\u2019s capital budget puts too much emphasis on highway construction and not enough on the Port of Baltimore and mass transit. More alarming is his long-range plan to cut nearly $1 billion from transportation spending in 2021 \u2013 an unrealistic and dangerous move.\n\n\u2666Hogan is claiming credit, as does every governor, for funding education at record levels. In fact, he\u2019s mandated by law to do so. He\u2019s even taking credit for fully funding a program that helps high-cost counties run their schools \u2013 a program he cut in half last year. Angry lawmakers then required Hogan to put the full $137 million in his budget this year.\n\n\u2666Hogan added $5.6 million to his budget to help three Republican counties cope with falling school enrollments. Yet he refused to help Baltimore City\u2019s school system, which faces a loss of $21 million partly due to its own declining enrollment. This funding inequity won\u2019t be permitted by Democratic lawmakers.\n\n\u2666Hogan fails to give battered and struggling Baltimore City much relief. It\u2019s the only large subdivision that doesn\u2019t get a big boost in state aid -- $3.1 million for the city versus $24.7 million for Baltimore County, $26.7 million for Anne Arundel County, $44.3 million for Montgomery County and $83.4 million for Prince George\u2019s County. On a percentage basis Baltimore City gets less of an aid increase \u2013 0.3 percent \u2013 than any other Maryland subdivision.\n\n\u2666Hogan\u2019s budget documents focus on the state\u2019s continuing gap between ongoing spending and tax revenues. Yet the governor wants to diminish state revenue through tax cuts, which will worsen the situation. Hogan complains about this key fiscal gap but doesn\u2019t fully address it in his budget proposal.\n\nWe\u2019ll learn much more about the governor\u2019s blueprint when the legislature\u2019s fiscal advisers start their round of budget briefings after the snow dig-out. Their analysis will pinpoint further weaknesses and oversights in Hogan\u2019s plan as well as its strengths.\n\nGiven the uncertain economic outlook, a go-slow approach might be the best possible outcome.\n\nBarry Rascovar\u2019s blog is www.politicalmaryland.com.
