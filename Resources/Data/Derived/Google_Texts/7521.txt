ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — Once safety Da’Norris Searcy and the Buffalo defense chased Cleveland Browns quarterback Brian Hoyer, the Bills weren’t going to let Johnny Manziel change the outcome.

Searcy intercepted Hoyer twice, defensive end Jerry Hughes scored on an 18-yard fumble return and tackle Kyle Williams forced Manziel to throw a key incompletion in the final minutes to secure a 26-10 win over the Browns on Sunday.

“It didn’t change too much,” Searcy said of the Bills’ approach after Manziel took over with 12:01 left. “Coming on the field, we knew he was in there. We just told each other to look for (bootlegs).”

Coach Doug Marrone was more relieved by how the Bills (7-5) overcame a sloppy first half.

Buffalo took control by scoring touchdowns 10 seconds apart midway through the third quarter. Veteran QB Kyle Orton bounced back from two interceptions by throwing a 3-yard touchdown pass to Chris Hogan. Hughes returned Terrance West’s fumble for a touchdown on the Browns’ next play from scrimmage.

“I concentrate on my own team,” Marrone said when asked about Manziel, a rookie. “There’s not a lot of film on him, so you’ve got to see how he plays.”

Manziel did provide an initial spark in enjoying his most significant playing time of the season, and in his first appearance since a 23-21 loss to Baltimore in Week 3. The first-round draft pick capped an eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 10-yard touchdown run that cut the Bills’ lead to 20-10.

The Bills then put the clamps on Manziel during Cleveland’s next possession.

Williams got in Manziel’s face and forced what was initially ruled a fumble before a replay review ruled it an incomplete pass.

The Browns (7-5) then gave up the ball on downs on the next play.
