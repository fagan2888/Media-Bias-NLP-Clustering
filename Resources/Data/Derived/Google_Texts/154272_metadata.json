What\u2019s more, the West may not want him to.\n\nUntil his retirement in November, Sir John Sawers was head of the UK\u2019s secretive MI6, the rough equivalent of the U.S.\u2019s CIA. In the months since his retirement to the private sector and academia, Sawers has made a number of public statements about international security issues, but none as far-ranging on the situation in Ukraine as the speech he delivered at King\u2019s College London on Monday.\n\nRelated: Putin Sent Weapons to Ukraine Rebels During Peace Talks\n\nThe bottom line, according to Sawers, is that Russia wants eastern Ukraine more than the West wants to defend it. Moreover, he said, while Putin may not be the Russian leader Western governments had hoped to deal with, he\u2019s probably better than anybody waiting in the wings of the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cAs long as Mr. Putin sees the issue in terms of Russia\u2019s own security, he will be prepared to go further than us,\u201d Sawers said, discussing the possibility of further Western intervention in Ukraine and/or stronger economic sanctions. \u201cSo he would respond with further escalation on the ground \u2013 perhaps cyber attacks against us. We have thousands of deaths in Ukraine. We could start to get tens of thousands. Then what?\u201d\n\nThe best possible result, said Sawers, might be locking the current state of play in the troubled region into a sort of stasis.\n\n\u201cUkrainians look to us to help them have their chance to embrace the order and values we enjoy here in modern Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe and they may end up with a new debilitating frozen conflict in Ukraine, well into the future. That is a wretched outcome for Ukrainians. But it may be the least bad attainable outcome.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is Putin Trying to Pry Greece Out of the European Union?\n\nThe hope in the West that a post-communist Russia might increasingly turn toward democracy has been dashed by Putin\u2019s return to aggressive nationalism. Worse still, he said, the alternatives to Putin might not be preferable.\n\n\u201cThe convergence between Russia and the West which we had hoped for after the Cold War won\u2019t happen while he is in charge. We now know that,\u201d Sawers said. \u201cAny foreseeable change of power in Russia may well be for the worse. Managing relations with Russia will be the defining problem in European security for years to come.\u201d\n\nSawers, after leaving MI6, became a visiting professor at King\u2019s College, as well as chairman of Macro Advisory Partners, a London-based consulting firm.\n\nSince his retirement, he has controversially argued that while terrorist attacks on cartoonists who mock Islam \u2013 specifically the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris \u2013 \u201ccannot be justified on any basis whatsoever,\u201d westerners should recognize \u201ca requirement for some restraint.\u201d\n\nSawers has also been a vocal defender of the controversial information gathering programs of western governments, particularly joint efforts between the U.S. and U.K.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A frozen conflict in Ukraine, with both sides locked in place for the foreseeable future, might be awful for the Ukrainian people, but Britain\u2019s former top spy says it might also be the \u201cleast bad attainable outcome.\u201d", "title": "Why Putin May Be the Lesser of All Russian Evils", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/17/Why-Putin-May-Be-Lesser-All-Russian-Evils", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/russia-crisis-putin-support_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/17/Why-Putin-May-Be-Lesser-All-Russian-Evils", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/russia-crisis-putin-support_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A frozen conflict in Ukraine, with both sides locked in place for the foreseeable future, might be awful for the Ukrainian people, but Britain\u2019s former top spy says it might also be the \u201cleast bad attainable outcome.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Putin Sent Weapons to Ukraine Rebels During Peace TalksThe bottom line, according to Sawers, is that Russia wants eastern Ukraine more than the West wants to defend it.\nBut it may be the least bad attainable outcome.\u201dRelated: Is Putin Trying to Pry Greece Out of the European Union?\nMoreover, he said, while Putin may not be the Russian leader Western governments had hoped to deal with, he\u2019s probably better than anybody waiting in the wings of the Kremlin.\nUntil his retirement in November, Sir John Sawers was head of the UK\u2019s secretive MI6, the rough equivalent of the U.S.\u2019s CIA.\nWorse still, he said, the alternatives to Putin might not be preferable."}
