The administration can do all the papering over they wish, but there\u2019s no obscuring the truth that just landed with a thud: In the seventh of Obama\u2019s eight years in office, we\u2019re staring at abject policy failure\u2014and it extends beyond Syria to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIt\u2019s somewhere between ironic and perfectly predictable that this news was delivered by Vladimir Putin\u2014Obama having spent the past several years fashioning the Russian president as America\u2019s archenemy. Since Moscow began moving materiel into Syria\u2014and, as of Wednesday, started bombing runs\u2014it\u2019s just too obvious that the initiative in Syria has slipped from this administration\u2019s grip.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Is Putin\u2019s Favorite Presidential Candidate\n\nIn their much-anticipated encounter at the U.N. last week, Putin presented a strategy to defeat the Islamic State that is clear, decisive, and\u2014like it or not\u2014right. In other words, a strategy that is everything the Obama administration\u2019s isn\u2019t.\n\nPutin\u2019s plans aren\u2019t too complicated. One, it\u2019s time to go beyond bombing, for that alone will not do the job: The U.S. record over the past year and a half is painful proof of this. Two, he urges Washington to join a united front against the Islamic State, setting aside all differences in the mold of the World War II alliance. Once ISIS falls, a transition to a post-Assad government in Damascus can be negotiated.\n\nOver the weekend a source in Moscow well-wired into Kremlin circles explained the thinking behind this sequence. \u201cPutin came back from New York convinced that the U.S., left to its present course, is going to turn Syria into another Libya,\u201d this source wrote.\n\nThe record supports this position, regrettably. Remove Bashar al-Assad first and you\u2019re copying the removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and the bombing of the Qaddafi government out of existence in 2011.\n\nRelated: The Real Reason Putin Wants to Keep Assad in Power\n\nBut the record also indicates that Washington isn\u2019t ready to take Step 1 toward a realistic solution in Syria\u2014that is, to begin seeing this crisis as something far greater than the usual geopolitical chess, as if it\u2019s \u201call about us\u201d and sustaining American primacy.\n\n\u201cThe meeting with Obama in New York did not go well,\u201d the Moscow source writes in explaining the Kremlin\u2019s view. \u201cPutin had expected a broader agreement to work together, but Obama did not engage\u2026. He didn\u2019t seize the opportunity to engage the battle in a coordinated way.\u201d\n\nThe White House and the journalists sympathetic to this administration\u2019s foreign policy thinking have since put more spin on Moscow\u2019s newly activist position in Syria than Mattel ever put on a top: Putin\u2019s \u201con the ropes,\u201d he\u2019ll make Syria more violent, Russia\u2019s not going after ISIS, it\u2019ll be Russia\u2019s second Afghanistan, Putin will be the target of terrorists everywhere, the Russian planes are old and may crash, nothing can work so long as Assad\u2019s in power.\n\nCharles Krauthammer wrote in The Washington Post, a day after Russian warplanes began bombing runs in Syria, \u201cIf it had the wit, the Obama administration would be not angered, but appropriately humiliated. President Obama has, once again, been totally outmaneuvered by Vladimir Putin.\u201d\n\nRelated: 13 Deadly Weapons Russia Has Sent to Syria\n\nThat\u2019s more like it. So was Peggy Noonan in the next day\u2019s Wall Street Journal, \u201cThe week\u2019s biggest failure was\u2026 of course, Russia\u2019s going full bore into Syria\u2026. The Obama administration didn\u2019t \u2018act,\u2019 really. They scrambled, desperately, stung by surprise and humiliation.\u201d\n\nI mentioned realities the Obama administration can\u2019t or won\u2019t accept. For the moment I count five:\n\n\u2022 The united front Putin urged on Obama is up and running as we speak. A week ago the Iraqi military command announced that Baghdad would begin sharing intelligence in the fight against ISIS with Tehran, Moscow, and Damascus. Once again, the White House was left \u201cscrambling,\u201d as a report in The New York Times put it.\n\n\u2022 Washington complains that Russian bombers aren\u2019t hitting ISIS. But the stated mission is to keep Assad from falling, and the targets appear to be those most directly threatening Damascus. Is there a surprise here? Equally, should Moscow discriminate against one group of Islamists from another, given that \u201cmoderates\u201d in this war long ago proved a figment of the CIA\u2019s ever-fertile imagination?\n\n\u2022 Russia may well reassert influence in the Middle East that the Soviet Union lost, but this begs two questions. One, whose failures opened this door? Two, is \u201cmulti-polarity\u201d nothing more than a long word, or is it an inevitable feature of the 21st century?\n\n\u2022 The collapse of Obama\u2019s minimalist policies now comes in two parts. As The Times reported Sunday, efforts to train and arm local forces to fight causes Washington favors but won\u2019t defend with troops come to a 15-year-record of failure across the Middle East. And there can\u2019t be any grimmer indictment of Obama\u2019s bombs-and-drones strategy than the tragic destruction of a hospital in Kanduz, Afghanistan on Saturday. The civilian casualties attaching to this policy can\u2019t be accepted any longer.\n\n\u2022 Last and largest, even Hillary Clinton is now openly at odds with the White House, so the assessment of failure is not a party-line question. But a more vigorous response, as almost everyone now urges, doesn\u2019t promise a solution.\n\nThat lies in a politically sophisticated use of assets, and these now include Moscow\u2019s new material commitment on Syrian soil and the (unexplored) potential for cooperation with Iran arising out of the recently concluded nuclear accord.\n\nAs of last week all the pieces are in place for a solution in Syria, except one: Washington\u2019s capacity to accept the bitter realities attaching to more or less complete strategic failure.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "What a week for President Obama and his toe-in-the-water strategy to stabilize the rio", "title": "Obama\u2019s Syria Strategy: \u2018Scrambling\u2019 and \u2018Desperate\u2019 as Putin Takes Charge", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/10/05/Obama-s-Syria-Strategy-Scrambling-and-Desperate-Putin-Takes-Charge", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/russia_syria_weapons_9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/10/05/Obama-s-Syria-Strategy-Scrambling-and-Desperate-Putin-Takes-Charge", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/russia_syria_weapons_9.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "What a week for President Obama and his toe-in-the-water strategy to stabilize the rio", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5a6f\"", "article_summary": "What a week for President Obama and his toe-in-the-water strategy to stabilize the riotous anarchy that is Syria.\nRelated: Why Trump Is Putin\u2019s Favorite Presidential CandidateIn their much-anticipated encounter at the U.N. last week, Putin presented a strategy to defeat the Islamic State that is clear, decisive, and\u2014like it or not\u2014right.\nFor the moment I count five:\u2022 The united front Putin urged on Obama is up and running as we speak.\nAnd there can\u2019t be any grimmer indictment of Obama\u2019s bombs-and-drones strategy than the tragic destruction of a hospital in Kanduz, Afghanistan on Saturday.\n\u201cPutin came back from New York convinced that the U.S., left to its present course, is going to turn Syria into another Libya,\u201d this source wrote."}
