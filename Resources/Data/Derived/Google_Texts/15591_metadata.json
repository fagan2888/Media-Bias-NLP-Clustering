The new rule will take effect Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nThe current policy ends such employees\u2019 FEHBP enrollment if they don\u2019t pick a new plan within a certain time frame, typically within the annual Open Season, which runs from early November to early December, or within 60 days of a disaster. Since carriers that decide to leave FEHBP tend to do so at the end of the contract year, under the current policy if feds do not choose a new plan during Open Season, they would have to wait until the next Open Season -- a year -- to re-enroll.\n\nRetirees whose plans leave FEHBP are currently enrolled in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan that is most similar to their cancelled plan. Under the new rule, they too will be automatically enrolled in the cheapest available nationwide FEHBP plan. Retirees will have 90 days to switch plans after an involuntary enrollment.\n\nOPM will not consider a High Deductible Health Plan, or a plan that requires an association or membership fee, as an option in which to involuntarily enroll participants whose plans were dropped.\n\nSix plans will drop out of FEHBP next year, affecting 3,000 individuals. In 2015, five plans left the federal insurance program, affecting 25,000 federal employees and retirees.\n\nDavid Ermer, a managing partner at Washington-based Ermer Law Group who represents the Association of Federal Health Organizations, a trade group of FEHBP plans, previously told Government Executive the new policy was \u201ca reasonable protection for [OPM] to make.\u201d\n\nCommenters on the proposed rule issued earlier this year asked OPM to include local plans when considering which plan in which to automatically enroll FEHBP participants, but the agency declined.\n\n\u201cOPM's intent in this regulation is to ensure that all enrollees with terminating plans have adequate access to affordable health insurance coverage while maintaining a procedure that is reasonable to administer and communicate,\u201d the agency wrote. \u201cEnrollees will have opportunities to change plans according to existing rules if they feel a better plan would meet their needs.\u201d\n\nAnother commenter expressed concern that the option selected for automatic enrollment may not be able to handle a sudden influx of new enrollees. OPM attempted to dissuade those fears, saying, \u201cNationwide FEHB plans have adequate networks and system capabilities to accommodate enrollees in any region of the U.S.\u201d\n\nThe proposed rule would not affect feds who voluntarily enroll or switch their plans during the annual Open Season, or within 60 days of a qualifying life event. Qualifying life events include marriage, divorce or a return to civil service from military duty.\n\nKellie Lunney contributed to this report.\n\n(Image via hxdbzxy/Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Eric Katz", "description": "New rule would involuntarily enroll FEHBP participants whose plans are terminated in the cheapest remaining option.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "New rule would involuntarily enroll FEHBP participants whose plans are terminated in the cheapest remaining option.", "title": "Some Feds Could Soon Be Automatically Enrolled in New Health Plans", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2015/10/some-feds-could-soon-be-automatically-enrolled-new-health-plans/123223/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/10/28/shutterstock_245905552.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New rule would involuntarily enroll FEHBP participants whose plans are terminated in the cheapest remaining option.", "creator": "@EricM_Katz", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/10/28/shutterstock_245905552/open-graph.jpg", "title": "Some Feds Could Soon Be Automatically Enrolled in New Health Plans", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-28T20:36:29Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/10/28/shutterstock_245905552.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Some Feds Could Soon Be Automatically Enrolled in New Health Plans", "keywords": "opm, fehbp, health care, federal employee health benefits program", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/10/28/shutterstock_245905552/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "fehbp,health-care,channel-pay-&-benefits,type-story,length-medium,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "New rule would involuntarily enroll FEHBP participants whose plans are terminated in the cheapest remaining option."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca22f\"", "article_summary": "Under the new rule, they too will be automatically enrolled in the cheapest available nationwide FEHBP plan.\nIn 2015, five plans left the federal insurance program, affecting 25,000 federal employees and retirees.\nOPM will not consider a High Deductible Health Plan, or a plan that requires an association or membership fee, as an option in which to involuntarily enroll participants whose plans were dropped.\nRetirees whose plans leave FEHBP are currently enrolled in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan that is most similar to their cancelled plan.\nFederal employees will not have to worry about losing their health insurance if the plan in which they are enrolled is dropped from the government\u2019s offerings, a rule finalized on Wednesday ensured."}
