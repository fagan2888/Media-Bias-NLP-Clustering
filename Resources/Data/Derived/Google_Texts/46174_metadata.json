Yet on this shriveled cactus of purpose, baubles hang that delight anyway.\n\nThis is the lesson Ira Glass taught me in the latest episode of This American Life in which reporter Sara Corbett gloriously spins out the story of her father-in-law's obsession with Cisco's default hold music.\n\nYes, Cisco! The leading purveyor of fine corporate phone systems. And on these systems, there is hold music. It sounds like this:\n\nGroovy, no?\n\nYou probably hate it. I mostly do. At three minutes, there is this horrifying funky Michael Bolton breakdown played on a xylophone synth.\n\nIn the stale elevator descending slowly into hades, this is what pours from the padded, yellow walls.\n\nBut some people love it!\n\nAnd if you leave it on in the background while you're working, just sitting in a tab, and then you turn it off, you may notice a curious absence.
