From there, he\u2019ll travel to Myanmar and to Australia for another summit.\n\nChinese officials have been restrained publicly in their comments about the GOP\u2019s landslide last week, but their state-run media was blistering in its criticism of Mr. Obama\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cObama always utters, \u2018Yes, we can,\u2019 which led to the high expectations people had for him. But he has done an insipid job, offering nearly nothing to his supporters,\u201d said the Global Times, published by China\u2019s state-run People\u2019s Daily. \u201cU.S. society has grown tired of his banality.\u201d\n\nIt said \u201cthe lame-duck president will be further crippled\u201d by the Republicans\u2019 victory, which included a takeover of the Senate.\n\nSpecialists on U.S.-Asia relations said world leaders at the summits have fresh doubts about Mr. Obama and the staying power of his oft-proclaimed \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re wondering, who is Barack Obama now after the midterm elections?\u201d said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cThey\u2019ll be trying to discern whether he has the commitment and political capability, [the] political capital to follow through on earlier commitments. This is going to be a tough trip for the president.\u201d\n\nAsked about concerns that Mr. Obama can\u2019t deliver on his international promises, White House National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice responded, \u201cQuite the opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you actually are engaged in the dialogues that I am [having] with our partners in the region, you\u2019ll hear them say that they recognize that the United States is making an unprecedented commitment to the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d she said Friday. \u201cThe fact that we are engaged in a very energetic and constructive way in the Asia-Pacific region and are there talking about some of the global challenges that we all share just shows how integral the Asia-Pacific region is not only to our prosperity but to our national security as well as global security.\u201d\n\nThe most glaring of Mr. Obama\u2019s unmet goals is the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact that would include 12 Pacific Rim nations encompassing about 40 percent of the world\u2019s trade. The president initially wanted to complete the agreement by the end of 2013, but now administration officials say it\u2019s unlikely to get done on this trip either.\n\nNegotiators have conducted 20 rounds of formal talks on the pact since March 2010. Ms. Rice and other administration officials describe the agreement as nearly completed. But Japan in particular is still holding out in negotiations with the U.S., and analysts say the president\u2019s losses in the midterm elections have raised another question mark about the president\u2019s ability to deliver.\n\n\u201cThere has to be some sense, in Japan, in particular, that [the] Republican Congress is on board, or we\u2019re going to very possibly be stuck where we are,\u201d said Michael Green, chair of the Japan program at CSIS.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have been mostly supportive of the trade deal, while Democrats beholden to organized labor oppose giving the president \u201cfast-track\u201d trade promotion authority to push the pact through Congress without changes. Outgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada was particularly outspoken in his opposition to the deal.\n\nTPP was on the agenda when Mr. Obama met Friday at the White House with congressional leaders, including incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican.\n\n\u201cMost of [Mr. Obama\u2018s] party is unenthusiastic about international trade,\u201d Mr. McConnell said after the election. \u201cWe think it\u2019s good for America.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental groups are vowing to oppose any efforts of Mr. Obama to work with the GOP on trade promotion authority.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama would be naive to believe that cooperation with Senator McConnell and Speaker Boehner will ultimately [result in] a TPP deal,\u201d said Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth. \u201cFast-track bills written by the Republican leadership and the U.S. Trade Representative Mike Froman have cut Democrats out of the process and have alienated even pro-trade Democrats. President Obama\u2019s attempt to fast-track the TPP also is inconsistent with his claims to be an environmental champion.\u201d\n\nThe Republic of China, also known as Taiwan, will be watching to see whether Mr. Obama discusses the Taiwan Relations Act with Mr. Xi as a sign of support for democratic Taipei.\n\nLyushun Shen, Taipei\u2019s representative in the U.S., noted that Taiwan is one of the largest trading partners of the U.S. and said it also wants to be included in the TPP.\n\n\u201cTaiwan is the largest external investor in mainland China,\u201d Mr. Shen said. \u201cWe know them better than anybody else. I tell my American friends, \u2018This is your diplomatic asset. We are siding with you in your rebalancing Asia strategy.\u2019 So don\u2019t ignore us in the TPP.\u201d\n\nHuman rights will also be on Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda in China and Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. Ms. Rice said she expects Mr. Obama to raise the subject of China\u2019s harsh treatment of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, as well as \u201cother aspects of human rights and civil liberties in China.\u201d\n\nIn Australia, the president will participate in a G-20 summit where the focus will be on economic growth, with economies in Europe and elsewhere in danger of falling back into a recession.\n\nMr. Obama got some good news on that front on Friday, when the Labor Department reported solid growth in the U.S. in October, with 214,000 jobs added and the unemployment rate dropping a notch to 5.8 percent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be able to say that we\u2019ve actually created more jobs here in the United States than every other advanced country combined,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters Friday. \u201cAnd they notice that we\u2019re doing something right here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hamstrung by a disastrous midterm election, President Obama departed the U.S. on Sunday for crucial meetings in Asia with world leaders who now view him as a very lame duck in Beijing.", "Author": "Dave Boyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hamstrung by a disastrous midterm election, President Obama departed the U.S. on Sunday for crucial meetings in Asia with world leaders who now view him as a very lame duck in Beijing.", "title": "Obama heading to Chinese economic summit", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/9/obama-heading-to-chinese-economic-summit/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/09/obama-plane.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/09/obama-plane.jpg", "title": "Obama heading to Chinese economic summit", "description": "Hamstrung by a disastrous midterm election, President Obama departed the U.S. on Sunday for crucial meetings in Asia with world leaders who now view him as a very lame duck in Beijing.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Barack Obama, China, Australia, Myanmar"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0b0\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Obama arrives in China Monday for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, followed by a state visit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\u201cMost of [Mr. Obama\u2018s] party is unenthusiastic about international trade,\u201d Mr. McConnell said after the election.\nSpecialists on U.S.-Asia relations said world leaders at the summits have fresh doubts about Mr. Obama and the staying power of his oft-proclaimed \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia.\nChinese officials have been restrained publicly in their comments about the GOP\u2019s landslide last week, but their state-run media was blistering in its criticism of Mr. Obama\u2019s leadership.\nTPP was on the agenda when Mr. Obama met Friday at the White House with congressional leaders, including incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican."}
