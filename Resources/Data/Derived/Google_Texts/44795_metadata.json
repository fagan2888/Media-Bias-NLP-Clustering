Well, there have been several cars, meals in top restaurants, luxury holidays with her new boyfriend, lots of new clothes and improvements to her home in Ipswich, including an outdoor Jacuzzi.\n\nLast but not least, she also bought seven Chihuahuas. When Adam found out his mother had blown his compensation, he felt he had no choice but to pursue her through the civil courts.\n\nLast week, she was ordered by a county court judge to repay him \u00a343,790. But former care worker Louise has decided to appeal against the ruling.\n\nThe relationship between mother and son is in tatters. \u2018First I lost my father and now I\u2019ve lost my mother,\u2019 says Adam, in his first interview since the judgment was passed.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s hard to believe this could happen to us after all we\u2019ve suffered.\u2019\n\nLouise Gray claimed this week that she had apologised to Adam but insisted that she doesn\u2019t have the money to pay him back.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s all a mess,\u2019 she said. \u2018I\u2019ve said sorry to my son over and over again, but he won\u2019t listen to me. I want to talk to him and explain.\u2019 Other relatives have also entered the family row.\n\nOne told the Mail that they were struggling to understand how Louise \u2014 who also sold the family home, spent the proceeds and now lives in a council house \u2014 could have betrayed her son.\n\n\u2018You can imagine what it was like for him when he found out there was nothing left,\u2019 said the relative, who did not wish to be named. \u2018He was absolutely heartbroken.\u2019 A bitter state of affairs, then. Adam says: \u2018After my father was killed I had this feeling that life would inevitably get back to normal but it never did. It got worse and worse.\u2019\n\nAdam's mother Louise Gray, 42, and her daughter Ruby are pictured meeting the Queen at a memorial service for the 52 who were killed in the Tube bombings on July 7, 2005. Mr Gray this week took his mother to court to reclaim the compensation money she spent on a lavish lifestyle\n\n\n\nUntil July 7, 2005, Adam had been enjoying a typically middle-class childhood. He remembers his hard-working father, a tax expert, often leaving the house in Ipswich so early and returning so late that he didn\u2019t see Adam and his sister Ruby, now 16, until the weekends.\n\n\u2018He worked really hard to support the family,\u2019 says Adam, who has now moved to Epping, Essex, and is working as a street canvasser for a charity. \u2018He was always on the computer or looking at paperwork even at home. He was often exhausted.\u2019\n\nSome of Adam\u2019s happiest memories are his father taking him to Ipswich and East Suffolk Hockey Club, where Richard was a talented player and founding member.\n\n\u2018We used to listen to Seventies and Eighties music in the car,\u2019 says Adam. \u2018We\u2019d sing along to Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith. I used to borrow all Dad\u2019s music.\u2019\n\nThere were happy family holidays, too, particularly a trip to Luxor the year before Richard died. \u2018I remember my mum smiling on a sun lounger and my dad larking around and trying to throw me and my sister in the pool,\u2019 says Adam. \u2018He was so loving, fun and kind.\u2019\n\nAdam\u2019s memories of July 7 the next year are hazier, filled with pain and confusion. He was at school when news of the bombings began to emerge. \u2018A teacher told us what had happened. My dad worked in London so I made the connection in my mind. But nothing more.\u2019\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until he saw his grandfather waiting at the school gate that he knew something was wrong. Adam arrived home to find the house full of relatives and his mother making frantic phone calls.\n\nShe had heard nothing from her husband since he left the house that morning at 7.15am. He remembers being told that his father was missing and remembers his mother, frustrated at the lack of information, setting off for London.\n\n\u2018When she returned, she took me upstairs to her room,\u2019 recalls Adam. \u2018She told me straight that Dad was dead. It was like someone had taken a hammer and smashed my reality.\u2019\n\nRichard\u2019s death was confirmed when Louise returned to London the next day and formally identified her husband\u2019s remains.\n\nGrief engulfed the Gray family but, initially at least, it appears to have brought them closer.\n\nAdam\u2019s impression of his mother at the time was of someone strong, capable and determined to put her family first. \u2018She was devastated and there were a lot of tears but there was very much the feeling that life had to go on,\u2019 he says.\n\nHappier times: Adam, pictured bottom left aged 11, with his father Richard, mother Louise and sister Ruby, then aged 7, during a family holiday to Egypt. The family have been grappling with the fall-out of a terrible row over the money awarded to them by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority\n\nIndeed, Louise Gray seemed the embodiment of emotional courage when she and Adam\u2019s seven-year-old sister Ruby presented the Queen with a bouquet at a remembrance service at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral four months after the tragedy, in November 2005.\n\nBut without their breadwinner, the Grays soon had money worries and were among hundreds of victims and relatives who applied to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. They were awarded interim payments to tide them over.\n\nAfter a few months Louise also received a lump sum from her husband\u2019s life insurance policy, which settled the mortgage on the family home, and, says Adam, thousands of pounds in grants from the London Bombing Relief Charitable Fund.\n\nTwo years later the compensation amounts were settled at \u00a3250,000 for Louise, as well as \u00a350,000 for Adam and \u00a3100,000 for Ruby (who, as the younger child, would suffer her father\u2019s loss for longer). The children\u2019s money was placed in trust in a Bank of Scotland account, to be handed to them on their 18th birthdays.\n\nEarly on, however, Adam noticed that his mother was spending more. It began with clothes and handbags. Then they had a new kitchen fitted, and the garden of their semi-detached house on a 1970s housing estate was professionally renovated. The house was decorated. New flooring was put down. Then Louise began dining at expensive restaurants.\n\nBesides the seven little dogs, her purchases included at least five furniture suites, each replacing the last as its novelty faded. A crane was hired to lift a new Jacuzzi over the roof and into the garden.\n\nAdam says his mother also bought three VW Beetles, a two-seater sports car and a seven-seater people carrier, as well as tanzanite jewellery from a TV shopping channel.\n\nSome might suggest that enduring grief was behind her spending, but Adam disagrees.\n\n\u2018She probably always had lavish tendencies but my father was there as a buffer before. Then suddenly she had all this money in her hands.\n\n\u2018I kept asking her if we could afford all this stuff, but she just told me: \u201cWe\u2019ve got the money, we\u2019re fine.\u201d \u2019\n\nMr Gray, 41, died when suicide bomber suicide bomber Shehzad Tanweer blew himself up on a Circle Line train travelling between Liverpool Street and Aldgate\n\nMatters were further complicated by the appearance of Louise\u2019s new boyfriend, 33-year-old Iraqi refugee Umar Shamshoom, around three years after her husband\u2019s death.\n\nAdam insists that at first everyone was happy about her relationship with the staff nurse from Ipswich Hospital, who fled Iraq with his Christian family as a child and was granted political asylum in the UK.\n\n\u2018He seemed like a good person and I understood her need to move on,\u2019 says Adam. So did my father\u2019s family. They gave her their blessing.\u2019\n\nBut when Umar moved into the family home, Adam says, the atmosphere deteriorated.\n\n\u2018They used to fight all the time,\u2019 says Adam. \u2018There were huge rows. My mother kept saying it was over but then it was back on again. He was constantly moving in and out.\u2019\n\nFinally, in 2011, Louise sold the house and moved to West Sussex.\n\nAdam recalls: \u2018She said she was turning over a new leaf and stopping spending. She said the rent was more affordable and she\u2019d be living close to my uncle and aunt, who would give her emotional support.\u2019\n\nAdam, 17 and studying music, philosophy and history for A-level at the time, remained in Ipswich to finish his studies and moved into council accommodation. \u2018I was upset,\u2019 he says, \u2018but I tried to be adult about it. My mother said she needed a fresh start and I wanted the best for her.\u2019\n\nLouise\u2019s on-off relationship with Umar continued and in December 2011 they became parents to a daughter, Violet, before moving back to Ipswich in 2012.\n\nLouise continued to reassure Adam that her spending was in check. He trusted her \u2014 and asked her to look after his money when it was signed over to him on his 18th birthday in January 2012.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t want the responsibility of it at 18,\u2019 he says. \u2018I didn\u2019t want to spend it, so I asked Mum to look after it. She said she would and I transferred it to her account.\u2019\n\nHe thought no more about the money until November last year, when he decided to use some of it to move from Ipswich to London and look for a jewellery apprenticeship with a goldsmith.\n\nWhen he asked, the answer he received from his mother was blunt: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Adam. I\u2019ve spent it.\u2019\n\n\u2018I tried to stay calm,\u2019 he says. \u2018She said she\u2019d spent the money on rent and other stuff but she wouldn\u2019t give me clear answers. She just said: \u201cGive me time and I\u2019ll sort it out.\u201d\u2019\n\nAdam changed his plans and moved to Epping instead.\n\nHis drastic decision to take his mother to court came when he discovered that, as well as spending money on rent for her partner\u2019s flat, she had bought him a car and paid for a holiday to Jordan.\n\n\u2018It was obvious to me that she was going to make no effort to pay the money back if I didn\u2019t take action,\u2019 says Adam.\n\n\n\n\u2018She probably always had lavish tendencies but my father was there as a buffer before. Then suddenly she had all this money in her hand s' Adam Gray\n\nHe was concerned, too, for Ruby, who still lives with her mother and will receive her \u00a3100,000 in two years\u2019 time when she turns 18.\n\nAfter Louise was ordered by a judge to repay her son, she wrote to Northampton County Court in May this year, claiming that she was living in council-funded accommodation and unable to find the money.\n\nAnd yet, says Adam, she has booked a holiday to Morocco later this month.\n\nTwo weeks ago a package arrived in the post. Inside, Adam found his father\u2019s watch and gold wedding ring \u2014 items he was wearing on the day he died \u2014 with a note from his mother that said: \u2018I don\u2019t want them to be taken by the bailiffs.\u2019\n\nAdam dismisses the gesture as emotional blackmail.\n\n\u2018My father would be ripping his hair out if he was alive,\u2019 he says. \u2018He was very careful with money.\u2019\n\nTheir story raises questions about how large compensation sums are administered to families and whether better support should be given when children are involved.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "7,7,widow,betrayed,son,Adam,lost,dad,Tube,bombings,mother,blown,50,000,compensation,fancy,cars,Jacuzzi,SEVEN,Chihuahuas", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2681169/7-7-widow-betrayed-son-Adam-lost-dad-Tube-bombings-mother-blown-50-000-compensation-fancy-cars-Jacuzzi-SEVEN-Chihuahuas.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Adam Gray, 20, from Ipswich, was forced to take his mother to court after she squandered the cash on a luxury lifestyle.", "title": "7/7 widow who betrayed her son by blowing father's \u00a350k compensation", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2681169/7-7-widow-betrayed-son-Adam-lost-dad-Tube-bombings-mother-blown-50-000-compensation-fancy-cars-Jacuzzi-SEVEN-Chihuahuas.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/04/article-2681169-1F66B22C00000578-769_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2681169/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2681169/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2681169, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "7,7,widow,betrayed,son,Adam,lost,dad,Tube,bombings,mother,blown,50,000,compensation,fancy,cars,Jacuzzi,SEVEN,Chihuahuas", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-07-04T21:08:42.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Barbara+Davies+for+the+Daily+Mail", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-07-04T22:19:35.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "7 7 widow betrayed son Adam lost dad Tube bombings mother blown 50 000 compensation fancy cars Jacuzzi SEVEN Chihuahuas"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Adam Gray, 20, from Ipswich, was forced to take his mother to court after she squandered the cash on a luxury lifestyle.", "title": "7/7 widow who betrayed her son by blowing father's \u00a350k compensation", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2681169/7-7-widow-betrayed-son-Adam-lost-dad-Tube-bombings-mother-blown-50-000-compensation-fancy-cars-Jacuzzi-SEVEN-Chihuahuas.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/04/article-2681169-1F66B22C00000578-769_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Adam Gray, 20, from Ipswich, was forced to take his mother to court after she squandered the cash on a luxury lifestyle."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccdbd\"", "article_summary": "Grief engulfed the Gray family but, initially at least, it appears to have brought them closer.\n\u2018First I lost my father and now I\u2019ve lost my mother,\u2019 says Adam, in his first interview since the judgment was passed.\nIt got worse and worse.\u2019Adam's mother Louise Gray, 42, and her daughter Ruby are pictured meeting the Queen at a memorial service for the 52 who were killed in the Tube bombings on July 7, 2005.\nWhen Adam found out his mother had blown his compensation, he felt he had no choice but to pursue her through the civil courts.\nIn what many will regard as a staggering act of betrayal, Adam\u2019s mother, 42-year-old Louise Gray, has squandered not only the \u00a3250,000 awarded to her, but Adam\u2019s \u00a350,000 compensation as well."}
