L.D. 652, which would eliminate the permitting requirement to carry a concealed weapon (and also permit people to carry a weapon in a car), passed with bipartisan support in a 83-62 vote. The bill passed through the Senate on May 28. Gov. Paul LePage has indicated that he will sign the bill into law.\n\nMaine, a \"shall-issue\" state, has issued over 36,000 concealed weapons permits, including permits to out-of-state residents. Maine has exceptionally low crime rates, and a relatively high rate of gun ownership.\n\nIt was already legal to openly carry a firearm in the state of Maine. Seven other states, including fellow New England state Vermont, have \"Constitutional Carry\" laws on the books.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Another forward step..05/26/2016 20:08:17PM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Another forward step.", "title": "- Maine House Overwhelmingly Passes Constitutional Carry", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2015/06/01/maine-house-overwhelmingly-passes-constitutional-carry-n2006641", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/19/a6a160de-640d-4c90-828b-b5db32a510b0.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Another forward step.", "title": "- Maine House Overwhelmingly Passes Constitutional Carry", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2015/06/01/maine-house-overwhelmingly-passes-constitutional-carry-n2006641", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/19/a6a160de-640d-4c90-828b-b5db32a510b0.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Maine House Overwhelmingly Passes Constitutional Carry , Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The Maine House of Representatives has overwhelmingly passed a bill to allow citizens to carry concealed weapons without a permit.\nMaine, a \"shall-issue\" state, has issued over 36,000 concealed weapons permits, including permits to out-of-state residents.\n652, which would eliminate the permitting requirement to carry a concealed weapon (and also permit people to carry a weapon in a car), passed with bipartisan support in a 83-62 vote.\nThe bill passed through the Senate on May 28.\nSeven other states, including fellow New England state Vermont, have \"Constitutional Carry\" laws on the books."}
