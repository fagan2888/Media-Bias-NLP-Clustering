As the Inquisitr previously reported, Trig has Down syndrome, and the dog in the photos is a service animal from the Puppy Jake Foundation.\n\nSarah Palin didn\u2019t seem to see anything wrong with letting her son put his full weight on the pooch. Instead of removing Trig from atop the dog and holding the child up so he could reach the sink, she grabbed her camera and snapped a few photos of her son using his pet as a step stool. In a Facebook post that has gone viral, Sarah tried to spin the moment into an inspirational one. She praised Trig while criticizing the service dog for being lazy.\n\n\u201cHappy New Year! May 2015 see every stumbling block turned into a stepping stone on the path forward. Trig just reminded me. He, determined to help wash dishes with an oblivious mama not acknowledging his signs for \u2018up!\u2019, found me and a lazy dog blocking his way. He made his stepping stone.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, animal rights groups were not pleased with Palin\u2019s callous disregard for the safety of the service dog. Friends of Animals President Priscilla Feral told Politico that Sarah Palin was the one being lazy, not the dog.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise to Friends of Animals that Sarah Palin is so insensitive she thinks a Black Lab should be tolerant of a child who isn\u2019t told to not put his full weight on top of the dog\u2019s back by standing on him,\u201d Feral said in a statement. \u201cHow lazy of Sarah Palin not to move the dog out of the way and teach her child the right lessons.\u201d\n\nPETA President Ingrid Newkirk also issued a response to the photos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s odd that anyone \u2014 let alone a mother \u2014 would find it appropriate to post such a thing, with no apparent sympathy for the dog in the photo. Then again, PETA, along with everyone else, is used to the hard-hearted, seeming obliviousness of this bizarrely callous woman.\u201d\n\nSarah Palin\u2019s \u201cstepping stone\u201d Facebook post has generated over 20,000 comments since it was posted on January 1, and it\u2019s sparked a huge online debate about whether Palin was doing anything wrong by letting her son stand on his dog.\n\n\u201cMuch like the mother \u2013 stepping on living things to get higher up in life,\u201d one commenter wrote.\n\n\u201cIf that dog had bitten that child, then what would she have done?\u201d another asked.\n\nHowever, many Sarah Palin supporters saw nothing wrong with the photo.\n\n\u201cThe dog is happy to help shut up,\u201d one commenter fired back at Palin\u2019s critics.\n\nAnother tried to defend the photo, but admitted that Trig was in a potentially dangerous situation.\n\n\u201cUnhappy people like to share their unhappiness by tearing others down. The Palin\u2019s dog could have easily gotten up and hurt Trig but didn\u2019t,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAccording to one of Sarah\u2019s Facebook posts, the English black lab/stepping stool is named \u201cJill Hadassa Palin.\u201d The dog joined the Palin family last summer.\n\nSome might find it a bit odd that Sarah chose to use a dog in her New Year\u2019s greeting. According to the Los Angeles Times, the former Governor of Alaska once criticized Barack Obama for featuring his pet pooch in the White House holiday greeting card. Fortunately, no one was standing on top of Bo Obama.\n\nWhat do you think of Sarah Palin\u2019s Facebook photos? Are they harmless fun, or did she put her pet and her son in danger by allowing Trig to use the unsteady animal as a step stool?\n\n[Image credit: AP/Cliff Owen via Salon]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sarah Palin's dog should not be used as a step stool, according to animal rights groups.
