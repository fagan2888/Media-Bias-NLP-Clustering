Obama\u2019s Middle East policy, he seemed to have been attempting to shore up his wobbly support among the 5th District\u2019s far-right \u201cliberty voters.\u201d\n\nWho are the Colorado Springs \u201cliberty voters\u201d?\n\nA photo taken at the event captured among the crowd controversial Statehouse District 15 candidate Gordon \u201cDr. Chaps\u201d Klingenschmitt. He sits at one of the fold-out tables staring at the camera as Lamborn delivers his remarks.\n\nAs Corey Hutchins first reported yesterday, one of the audience encouraged Lamborn to \u201csupport the generals and the troops in this country despite the fact that there is no leadership from the Muslim Brotherhood in the White House.\u201d\n\nLamborn responded enthusiastically.\n\n\u201cYou know what, I can\u2019t add anything to that, but do let me reassure you on this,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of us are talking to the generals behind the scenes, saying, \u2018Hey, if you disagree with the policy that the White House has given you, let\u2019s have a resignation, you know. Let\u2019s have a public resignation, and state your protest, and go out in a blaze of glory.\u2019 I haven\u2019t seen that very much, in fact I haven\u2019t seen that at all in years.\u201d\n\nIt was the kind of remark that makes news: Republican lawmakers with nothing to lose but an endless number of news-cycles to win urging military generals to ruin their careers and resign during a time when the nation is engaging an expanding terrorist organization overseas.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of remark Klingenschmitt has been dropping at a regular clip for years.\n\nAs Right Wing Watch has documented, Klingenschmitt has said that \u201c\u2018Obamacare causes cancer,\u2019 that the Bible commands people to own guns in order to \u2018defend themselves against left wing crazies,\u2019 and that the FCC is allowing demonic spirits to \u2018molest and visually rape your children.'\u201d\n\nIn August, Klingenschmitt wrote an email to supporters of his Pray in Jesus\u2019 Name Project, denouncing Colorado Congressman Jared Polis for threatening Christian Americans by demanding equal rights for gay Americans. It got ugly.\n\nThe full quote:\n\nThe openly homosexual Congressman Jared Polis introduced a revised bill to force Christian employers and business owners to hire and promote homosexuals with ZERO RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS for Christians who want to opt out. Polis \u201cwants sexual orientation and gender identity treated the same way as race, religion, sex, and national origin, when it comes to employment protections,\u201d claims the Advocate, under the headline \u201cPolis trims ENDA\u2019s religious exemption.\u201d Dr. Chaps\u2019 comment: The open persecution of Christians is underway. Democrats like Polis want to bankrupt Christians who refuse to worship and endorse his sodomy. Next he\u2019ll join ISIS in beheading Christians, but not just in Syria, right here in America.\n\nHutchins tweeted the night of the event that Lamborn acknowledged Klingenschmitt and called him his \u201cfriend.\u201d He said of candidates for office: \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be perfect.\u201d\n\nHutchins told the Independent that the crowd at the bar barely reacted to Lamborn\u2019s comments about urging generals to resign.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]hen Colorado Congressman Doug Lamborn on Tuesday told a small crowd in a bar-basement in Colorado Springs that he and other Republican lawmakers were urging military offi...", "title": "Sidebar: Gordon 'Dr. Chaps' Klingenschmitt among crowd at Lamborn 'liberty' talk", "url": "http://www.coloradoindependent.com/149508/sidebar-gordon-dr-chaps-klingenschmitt-among-crowd-at-lamborn-liberty-talk", "image": "http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/klingeschmitt.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "i2NY0iV2fHy9AAYv78ajpH43BN_IO8SUYAgP0XBcpQs", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/klingeschmitt.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@COIndependent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-26T16:11:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-26T16:40:20+00:00", "author": "http://www.coloradoindependent.com/author/johntomasic"}}, "article_summary": "Chaps\u2019 Klingenschmitt among crowd at Lamborn \u2018liberty\u2019 talkWhen Colorado Congressman Doug Lamborn on Tuesday told a small crowd in a bar-basement in Colorado Springs that he and other Republican lawmakers were urging military officers to resign in protest over Pres.\nA photo taken at the event captured among the crowd controversial Statehouse District 15 candidate Gordon \u201cDr.\nObama\u2019s Middle East policy, he seemed to have been attempting to shore up his wobbly support among the 5th District\u2019s far-right \u201cliberty voters.\u201dWho are the Colorado Springs \u201cliberty voters\u201d?\nHe sits at one of the fold-out tables staring at the camera as Lamborn delivers his remarks.\nChaps\u201d Klingenschmitt."}
