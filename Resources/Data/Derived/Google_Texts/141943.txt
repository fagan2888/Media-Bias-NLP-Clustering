PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) - It was exactly a month ago that No. 25 UCLA upset then-No. 1 Kentucky to serve notice that the Bruins were an elite team.

On Sunday night, UCLA lost 85-78 to Washington State, a team it has utterly dominated for decades, to show that the Bruins are a mystery.

The loss followed a double-overtime loss at Washington and left UCLA 0-2 in the Pac-12.

“This is not the way we want to start the league and now it becomes a very long, tough road,” UCLA coach Steve Alford said.

Alford refused to blame the double-overtime loss for his team’s play at Washington State.

“That’s just part of college basketball and being fatigued, that’s a mental softness and we can’t have that,” Alford said. “We have to be tougher.”

Washington State’s Josh Hawkinson had 20 points and 10 rebounds, his ninth consecutive double-double, to lead the Cougars.

It was his 11th double-double of the season and 31st of his career. The 6-foot-10 forward added four blocked shots and three assists.

“He’s comfortable with anyone on the floor, I think,” Washington State coach Ernie Kent said.

The Cougars went with a smaller lineup to add some speed against the Bruins.

“We wanted to create tempo and pace and we wanted it to be fast,” Kent said. “We are better that way.”

“I thought that was a very, very good effort we put together against a very good basketball team,” Kent said, “playing smart, playing heady and playing tough defensively.”

Que Johnson and Renard Suggs each scored 14 points for Washington State (9-5, 1-1 Pac-12), while Charles Callison had 12, and Conor Clifford 10. The Cougars lost to Southern California in the conference opener Friday night.

Isaac Hamilton scored 27 points for UCLA (9-6). UCLA’s Bryce Alford, coming off a 30-point performance at Washington, was held to nine points.

The Bruins got 13 points and 10 rebounds from Thomas Welsh.
