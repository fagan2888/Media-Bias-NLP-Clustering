In fact, Bachmann appeared on Hannity last night to wax poetic about how this is just the absolute happiest they\u2019ve ever been in all their lives. Why? Is it because they\u2019re getting paid to do no work while other Americans are going to have to work for IOUs? Kind of! But also it\u2019s because they believe they\u2019re winning the \u201cnational dialogue.\u201d\n\nWhich they\u2019re not. They\u2019re not winning at all. They look like assholes. The vast majority of the American people are not happy with what they\u2019re doing. And yes, the vast majority blame them and not the Democrats. Which is fair, given that for the past year or so, Republicans have been going around bragging that they\u2019re going to shut down the government. People know a hostage situation when they see it.\n\nGiven the millions of Americans signing up for the Affordable Care Act\u2013 in such droves that the servers haven\u2019t been able to handle the traffic, it\u2019s getting harder to say that it is the \u201cwill of the people\u201d that it be defunded, delayed, or gotten rid of entirely.\n\nIn fact, they\u2019re not even really winning the dialogue in the House. Right now, with all 200 Democratic votes and the votes of 20 Republicans who are a bit more on the sane side, there are enough votes (217 are needed) to pass a clean continuing resolution.\n\nHowever, the reason this isn\u2019t even being passed to the floor is because Boehner is abiding by the \u201cHastert Rule.\u201d The \u201cHastert Rule\u201d\u2013named for Dennis Hastert\u2013is a principle used by Republican Speakers of The House that basically means that a bill will not be brought up unless it has support from the \u201cmajority of the majority\u201d party. It should be noted that even Dennis Hastert does not think this is the time or place for the Hastert Rule.\n\nBut I digress. It\u2019s almost monstrous for Bachmann and Co. to be this ecstatic over something that worries the rest of us. It\u2019s actually just creepy. I mean, there are over 3,000 low-income kids who will be denied Head Start programs, as over 50 have had to close their doors because they didn\u2019t have the funding to stay open. And that\u2019s on top of the 57,000 kids who lost their slots due to sequestration. There are Federal Workers living paycheck to paycheck who will have to accept an IOU in lieu of pay. So, it\u2019s pretty damn shitty for a whole lot of people who aren\u2019t up there grandstanding.\n\nTo add to the cognitive dissonance, Bachman, Cruz, and others are now also complaining about this shutdown that has made them so very happy. They\u2019re trying now, to present themselves as the ones who are trying to keep the National Parks open for WWII veterans. Which is weird because not only did they force this damn shutdown, but also they want to get rid of many National Parks in order to appease corporations who would like to build things in them. These parks, by the way, were a thing invented by non-crazy Republican Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nI also feel pretty compelled to mention that while they are out frolicking at the Lincoln Memorial and posting tweets about how very much they care about veterans and the \u201cGreatest Generation\u201d\u2013 these are also the people who want to slash the living hell out of Veteran\u2019s Benefits.\n\nYou can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too. You can\u2019t talk loudly and in public about your plans to force a shutdown, then actually force the shutdown, then claim you are thrilled and delighted by it, and then complain that really it\u2019s the fault of the Democrats and all the bad stuff about this should be blamed on them for wanting to fund something that is the actual law of the land now. The Affordable Care Act was approved by Congress, signed by the president, declared constitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States, and Obama was re-elected President in a campaign in which this was probably the biggest issue at hand. The \u201cdialogue\u201d is over now. You lost.\n\nYou can\u2019t say you are winning the national dialogue when you are hideously unpopular and hated by everyone. You can\u2019t even really say you\u2019re winning in the House when, if it came to an actual vote, you would lose. Repeating something over and over doesn\u2019t make it true. I could spend all day insisting I am the Queen of England, that doesn\u2019t mean that a crown will be arriving in the mail for me tomorrow.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, I think that what\u2019s really going to end this era of crazy ass Conservative Radicals is not just going to be the fact that they\u2019re nuts or that they suffer from severe cognitive dissonance, but the fact that they\u2019re just so goddamned mean. There is nothing more vicious than to speak rapturously of your own joy while other people are suffering from its cause. Schadenfreude isn\u2019t satisfying when it\u2019s leveled against the weak or impoverished, and this smarmy narrative of comforting the comfortable and afflicting the afflicted can\u2019t go to far before it starts to sicken people who don\u2019t happen to be actual sociopaths.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is it because they're getting paid to do no work while other Americans are going to have to work for IOUs?", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "Is it because they\u2019re getting paid to do no work while other Americans are going to have to work for IOUs?", "title": "Bachmann: Republicans are \u2018about the happiest\u2019 they\u2019ve ever been over this shutdown", "url": "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/206990/bachmann-republicans-are-about-the-happiest-theyve-ever-been-over-this-shutdown/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-03-at-9.13.55-AM.png", "height": 441}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Is it because they\u2019re getting paid to do no work while other Americans are going to have to work for IOUs?", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 119986914707220}, "keywords": "michele bachmann,michele bachmann sociopath,shutdown,tea party,politics", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-03T12:30:51Z", "modified_time": "2013-10-03T12:23:59Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ef2\"", "article_summary": "Which is fair, given that for the past year or so, Republicans have been going around bragging that they\u2019re going to shut down the government.\nBut also it\u2019s because they believe they\u2019re winning the \u201cnational dialogue.\u201dWhich they\u2019re not.\nIn fact, Bachmann appeared on Hannity last night to wax poetic about how this is just the absolute happiest they\u2019ve ever been in all their lives.\nIn fact, they\u2019re not even really winning the dialogue in the House.\nWhile you, silly person, have been worrying about the government shutdown, its effect on the economy, its effect on people\u2019s jobs and veteran\u2019s benefits, etc."}
