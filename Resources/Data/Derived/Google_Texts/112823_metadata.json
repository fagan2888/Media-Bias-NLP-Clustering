The famed rocker, who has been known to go head-to-head with outspoken CNN host Piers Morgan, paused while discussing his \u201chaters\u201d to scrape some of Morgan\u2019s brain matter off the bottom of his shoe.\n\n\u201cI have to take a break here Dana, if you mind, I\u2019m scraping a little bit of Piers Morgan\u2019s skull tissue out of my shoe,\u201d Nugent said.\n\nThe rocker challenged the CNN host and any others on the Left to a face-to-face debate, but said no one will take his offer because they are too scared he will do the \u201cTed Nugent-Piers Morgan skull boogie.\u201d\n\n\u201cDebate me,\u201d Nugent told Morgan and his other dissenters. \u201cBring me on your show. Teach me a lessen. Because I\u2019ll eat your guts.\u201d\n\nNugent defended his views, which he often faces criticism for, by saying that the things he asserts are not opinion, but fact, including what happened at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my opinion that there are four dead Americans at our embassy, who not only refused to be provided security after multiple requests, but when security was on the way to save them, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and the United States of America government punks refused to save their lives,\u201d he said.\n\nMorgan wasted no time in responding to Nugent\u2019s diss, taking to his Twitter account to fire back at the conservative rocker.\n\nI'm still looking for Ted's > RT @theblaze .@TedNugent finds @PiersMorgan's \"brain matter\" in his shoe - http://t.co/evzuOuGYOU \u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 30, 2014\n\nI've got plenty left, relax > RT @Mediaite Watch Ted Nugent Scrape @PiersMorgan 's 'Brain Matter' Off of His Shoe http://t.co/Fi8TN077Th \u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 30, 2014\n\nWatch Nugent\u2019s interview below, courtesy of TheBlaze.\n\nh/t Mediaite", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Piers Morgan doesn't have too much of a brain bouncing around in his head, and what he does have is stuck on the bottom of conservative rocker Ted Nugent's shoe, he told TheBlaze earlier this week", "title": "[WATCH] Ted Nugent scrapes Piers Morgan's brain matter off his...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/02/Ted-Nugent-600x332.jpg", "height": 332}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/02/01/watch-ted-nugent-scrapes-piers-morgans-brain-matter-off-his-shoe/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "us-government", "published_time": "2014-02-01T09:22:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-04T09:48:40+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d38\"", "article_summary": "@TedNugent finds @PiersMorgan's \"brain matter\" in his shoe - http://t.co/evzuOuGYOU \u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 30, 2014I've got plenty left, relax > RT @Mediaite Watch Ted Nugent Scrape @PiersMorgan 's 'Brain Matter' Off of His Shoe http://t.co/Fi8TN077Th \u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 30, 2014Watch Nugent\u2019s interview below, courtesy of TheBlaze.\n\u201cI have to take a break here Dana, if you mind, I\u2019m scraping a little bit of Piers Morgan\u2019s skull tissue out of my shoe,\u201d Nugent said.\nThe famed rocker, who has been known to go head-to-head with outspoken CNN host Piers Morgan, paused while discussing his \u201chaters\u201d to scrape some of Morgan\u2019s brain matter off the bottom of his shoe.\nPiers Morgan doesn\u2019t have too much of a brain bouncing around in his head, and what he does have is stuck on the bottom of conservative rocker Ted Nugent\u2019s shoe, he told TheBlaze earlier this week.\nMorgan wasted no time in responding to Nugent\u2019s diss, taking to his Twitter account to fire back at the conservative rocker."}
