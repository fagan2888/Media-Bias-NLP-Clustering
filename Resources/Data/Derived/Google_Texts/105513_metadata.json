Several years earlier, the duo\u2014friends for decades\u2014co-founded PragerU, a small digital university for conservatives with a modest audience. Now, a stranger was suing them.\n\nThe man, a photographer in Ireland, alleged through a Houston lawyer that PragerU had used one of his photographs in an online educational video without his consent.\n\nEstrin, a former Hollywood screenwriter with little experience navigating the intricacies of digital copyright issues, calls the episode \u201ctraumatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had a visual style that used photographs, and someone really almost out of nowhere sued us for the use of a photo,\u201d Estrin recalls in an interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cAs a result of being sued, we did a lot of investigation into [how you can] use photos on the Internet, and the copyright ramifications of photos, and what to do going forward.\u201d\n\nWhat Estrin and Prager did was overhaul their entire visual video aesthetic to a streamlined, animation-based model, abandoning four years of work and 80 educational videos.\n\n\u201cAnd in one of those things that doesn\u2019t happen very much in life but I\u2019m happy to say I\u2019ve experienced, this very traumatic experience was the best thing that could have possibly happened to us,\u201d Estrin says.\n\n\u2018Very Big Numbers\u2019\n\n\u201cThis year we will have more than 50 million views as confirmed by YouTube and Facebook,\u201d Prager says in an email to The Daily Signal, adding that \u201cthe largest single demographic of our videos are people under 35 years of age.\u201d\n\nPragerU also has 1 million subscribers to its videos across platforms, including a digital newsletter, Estrin says.\n\nPrager, who already had a loyal radio audience, says such access is exactly what the partners hoped for when they launched PragerU.\n\n\u201cWith the birth of the Internet, the ability to influence even more people\u2014especially young people\u2014opened up,\u201d he writes.\n\nThe numbers\u2014and demographics\u2014appear surprising for a new conservative outlet primarily sharing content on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nEstrin credits PragerU\u2019s success to the 2013 overhaul.\n\n\u201cThe new visual style, people were much more receptive to it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe did a whole new website, and we went to a very organized release schedule, releasing a new course every Monday. And we started to see very big numbers.\u201d\n\nToday, PragerU focuses on that same aesthetic, primarily shooting and producing short, five-minute animated videos released every Monday. The videos explain complex political and social issues to a decidedly distracted audience and are promoted online by an internal marketing machine.\n\nA sampling of most-viewed videos include an explanation of the \u201cMiddle East Problem\u201d narrated by Prager, a summary of modern art as told by artist Robert Florczak, and a look at tax reform narrated by actress Carolyn Hennesy.\n\nA 501(c)(3) nonprofit, PragerU isn\u2019t able to comment on one large arena within modern political debates: the 2016 election and candidates.\n\n\u201cOur videos distill very important ideas down to five minutes, which induces or promotes virality,\u201d Estrin says, adding:\n\nObviously, you know, if you have somebody driving a motorcycle backward off a cliff or something you can get a lot of views, but George Gilder talking about why capitalism works, or Robert George talking about why we\u2019re losing our liberty, that\u2019s serious stuff. And we have built a very strong, very loyal student body, let\u2019s call it.\n\n\u2018Intellectual Ammunition\u2019\n\nA large piece of PragerU\u2019s mission is to combat what the organization sees as a liberal bias at American universities, changing minds on issues as well as equipping individuals who already identify as conservative with information.\n\n\u201cI went to UCLA, I grew up in California, and everybody around me is on the left,\u201d says Marissa Streit, PragerU\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cThe mission of Prager University is to arm people who are on our side with the intellectual ammunition they need to respond to these arguments, and to make the arguments really, really simple, so you don\u2019t have to be a genius to understand them.\u201d\n\nStreit says PragerU also works with about 3,000 educators across the country, allowing them to use the videos in classrooms at public and private schools or in homeschool programs.\n\nAsked whether five minutes is enough to inform and even alter someone\u2019s view of an issue, Estrin insists that \u201cyes, absolutely, positively, five minutes is enough time.\u201d\n\nStreit takes a more practical stance.\n\n\u201cWhat other choice do we have?\u201d she says. \u201cIf this person is going to be given a 300-page-long book, they will not read it. Can you explain an entire book in five minutes? Probably not. But you can extrapolate the key, important ideas in that book.\u201d\n\nStreit notes that most viewers watch roughly three minutes of the five-minute videos before moving on.\n\nA quick glance at PragerU\u2019s video library may leave some viewers wondering about sourcing; the videos don\u2019t cite the origin of statistics or the retelling of historical events.\n\nEstrin says this is because the videos tend to be narrated by experts who have written books or position papers on the subject at hand. Viewers know they can seek out additional information, which is PragerU\u2019s ultimate goal anyway, he says.\n\n\u201cThe individual does the rest,\u201d Estrin says, adding:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Radio host Dennis Prager founded online university Prager U in 2009.
