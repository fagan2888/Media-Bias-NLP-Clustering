(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nFox News aired two GOP presidential debates on Jan. 28: a prime-time event starring seven candidates and an earlier debate featuring four second-tier contenders, based on an average of recent polls. Front-runner Donald Trump opted out of the debate, preferring to hold his own televised rally.\n\nNot every candidate uttered statements that are easily fact checked, but the following is a list of 12 suspicious or interesting claims. As is our practice, we do not award Pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts in debates.\n\n\u201cFirst of all we have seen how in six years of Obamacare that it\u2019s been a disaster. It is the biggest job killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums sky rocket.\u201d \u2014 Ted Cruz\n\nCruz adds lots of things together to come up with his \u201cmillions.\u201d\n\nBut he glosses over the fact that the Affordable Care Act has added nearly 18 million people to the health-insurance rolls since it was enacted five years ago, according the Department of Health and Human Services. (There were at least 2 million discontinued insurance policies that were no longer eligible under the law, but those policies were either temporarily extended or could be replaced.)\n\nThe Washington Post's Fact Checker takes a look at some of the most suspicious claims from candidates at the Fox News/Google GOP debate on Jan. 28. (The Washington Post)\n\nAs for Obamacare\u2019s impact on jobs, there is slim evidence that jobs have been lost. (In fact, the unemployment rate is now just 5 percent.) Recent, detailed studies have found that the Affordable Care Act had little impact on employment patterns.\n\nOne study, published in January in the journal Health Affairs, examined Census data and found no increase in the likelihood of working part time, except for a 0.18 percentage point increase in the likelihood of working 25 to 29 hours per week between 2013 and 2014 \u2014 a trend that predated the ACA. Even the researchers said the findings were surprising, given widespread reporting of scattered companies that said they had moved some workers to part-time work in response to the health-care law.\n\nThus far, however, it appears such anecdotal reports do not reflect a trend with any real impact on employment.\n\n\u201cThe smallest Navy in 100 years.\u201d \u2014 Marco Rubio\n\nEgad, what does it take to kill this zombie claim? This was repeatedly debunked in the 2012 presidential election, and yet at least one GOP contender manages to repeat it in every debate. Now it\u2019s the turn of the senator from Florida.\n\nThe current number of ships in the Navy is 273. It is the lowest count since 1916, when there were 245 ships.\n\nBut a lot has changed in 100 years, including the need and capacity of ships. Here are some of the types of ships that were part of the Navy in 1916: gunboats, torpedo boats and \u201cmonitors\u201d (that\u2019s a kind of small warship).\n\nThese types of boats aren\u2019t in the Navy anymore. Instead, the current list of Navy ships includes behemoths such as aircraft carriers, \u201cSSBN\u201d (nuclear-powered, ballistic-missile carrying submarines) and \u201cSSGN\u201d (cruise-missile submarines).\n\nThere are other ways to measure seapower than just the sheer number of ships, according to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus: \u201cThat\u2019s pretty irrelevant. We also have fewer telegraph machines than we did in World War I and we seem to be doing fine without that\u2026. Look at the capability. Look at the missions that we do.\u201d\n\nThe current level of ships is on par with the level reached during the Bush administration, when the number of ships fell to 278 in 2007. The Navy is on track to grow to just over 300 ships, approximately the size that a bipartisan congressional panel has recommended for the current Navy.\n\n\u201cThere have been three different investigations that have proven that I knew nothing.\u201d \u2014 Chris Christie\n\nOnly one of the investigations conclusively found that the New Jersey governor had no knowledge of the massive traffic jams in Fort Lee, as a result of a two-lane shutdown on the George Washington Bridge. Media outlets had revealed that the traffic delays may intentionally have been caused by the Christie administration because the mayor of Fort Lee did not endorse Christie in a gubernatorial election.\n\nThe one \u201cinvestigation\u201d that found Christie had no knowledge of the scandal before or during the lane closures was actually a study that Christie\u2019s administration commissioned, through the law firm Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher.\n\nThe other two investigations were conducted by the New Jersey legislature and the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey.\n\nThe state legislature\u2019s investigation found \u201cno conclusive evidence\u201d as to whether Christie was aware of the lane closure before or during it, PolitiFact said. The U.S. attorney\u2019s investigation did not find criminal evidence that Christie was involved in the scandal, but did not say the case is closed.\n\n\u201cThe only budget that Ted [Cruz] ever voted for was a budget that Rand Paul sponsored, that brags about cutting defense spending.\u201d \u2014 Marco Rubio\n\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas did vote for Paul\u2019s budget proposal in 2013, and the proposal did brag about cutting defense spending. But the budget proposal used misleading language: the \u201ccut\u201d was not in actual defense appropriations, but a reduction relative to the president\u2019s budget and the budget baseline of the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe proposal said: \u201cThis budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st Century.\u201d But it proposed to raise discretionary national defense funding from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023.\n\nSo how is it a \u201ccut\u201d in defense funding? The proposal explained: \u201cThis budget proposal significantly reduces spending relative to both the President\u2019s budget and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war. When that war began, we had 8,000 planes. Today, we have about 4,000.\u201d \u2014 Cruz\n\nCruz\u2019s data are a bit mysterious. It would be no surprise that aircraft inventory has declined since the Persian Gulf War, because the collapse of the Soviet Union led to a 25 percent cut in military spending (engineered by then-Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney).\n\nBut the current aircraft inventory for the Defense Department shows nearly 14,000 aircraft, including 3,290 fighter/attack, 859 attack helicopters and 4,563 airlift and cargo planes. That\u2019s much higher than \u201c4,000 planes.\u201d\n\nBret Baier: \u201cCan you name even one thing that the federal government does now that it should not at all?\u201d \u2026\n\nChris Christie: \u201cHow about one that I\u2019ve done in new Jersey for six years: that\u2019s getting rid of Planned Parenthood funding.\u201d Baier: \u201cAnything bigger than that?\u201d Christie: \u201cBigger than that? Let me tell you something. When you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can\u2019t think of anything bigger than that.\u201d \u2014 Exchange at debate\n\nLet\u2019s add some context here. Planned Parenthood federal funding makes up nowhere near 1 percent of the federal budget \u2014 and even less from federal discretionary spending authorized by Congress every year.\n\nPlanned Parenthood receives about $450 million in federal funds annually, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The majority of federal funding that Planned Parenthood health centers receive is through Medicaid reimbursements or grants through the federal family planning program, Title X. In 2013-14, it received $528.4 million in state and federal funding, which comprised 41 percent of the organization\u2019s revenues that year.\n\nNearly 90 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal funding comes from entitlement programs, or mandatory spending, and the remaining 10 percent comes from discretionary spending, PolitiFact reported. Applying that percentage to annual federal funding for Planned Parenthood ($450 million), that means the organization receives $405 million in mandatory funding and $45 million in discretionary funding.\n\nFederal mandatory spending for fiscal 2015 was $2.45 trillion and discretionary funding for fiscal 2015 was $1.11 trillion. That means Planned Parenthood receives 0.02 percent of the federal mandatory funding and 0.004 percent of discretionary spending.\n\nA long-standing legal restriction bans federal funds from paying for any elective abortions, which are for pregnancies that are not caused by rape, incest or that threaten the mother\u2019s health. So while Christie mentions abortions, pulling federal money would not necessarily affect how Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortions are funded.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.\u201d \u2014 Rubio\n\nThis is one of Rubio\u2019s favorite talking points. Rubio again and again claims that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lied to the families of the victims of the Benghazi attacks and asserted that the attack on a diplomatic outpost took place because of a YouTube video.\n\nAs we have noted, the evidence for this claim is murky and open to interpretation. But Rubio really goes too far in suggesting that she told this to all of the families of the four who were killed in the terrorist attacks. Here\u2019s the rundown of what we know:\n\nU.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens\n\nHis father says Clinton did not mention a video.\n\nState Department Information Specialist Sean Smith\n\nHis mother says every administration official, including Clinton, cited the video.\n\nFormer Navy Seal Tyrone Woods\n\nHis father says Clinton cited the video as the cause.\n\nHis mother says Clinton did not mention the video.\n\nFormer Navy Seal Glen Doherty\n\nHis mother says Clinton did not mention a video.\n\nHis sister says she did not mention a video but referenced a \u201cspontaneous protest.\u201d\n\nAt the very least, Rubio cannot so sweepingly declare that she made such statements to the \u201cfamilies of those four brave Americans.\u201d Some of those family members say they did not hear that.\n\n\u201cWe know that 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care.\u201d \u2014 Carly Fiorina\n\nFiorina repeated an inaccurate and widely misreported figure about veteran deaths.\n\nThe 307,000 number comes from a Sept. 2, 2015, VA Office of Inspector General report, which detailed the findings of an investigation into alleged mismanagement in processing health-care applications.\n\nThe Veterans Health Administration\u2019s Health Eligibility Center, which processes eligibility and enrollment information, maintains about 22.3 million records in its system. Out of those records, about 867,000 records were in a \u201cpending\u201d status. That means the veteran applied for enrollment but the VA needed additional information (often financial) before approving the veteran for benefits. Of those, 307,173 were for people who were reported as deceased by the Social Security Administration.\n\nThat sounds like 307,000 veterans died waiting for care, right? Nope.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to know whether those 307,000 veterans who died ever applied for health care through the VA. The database includes records of veterans who died even before the VA\u2019s health care enrollment began in 1998. There also are records of veterans who never sought care from the VA, because millions of records from another VA data source were entered into the system in December 2013.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s an unreliable data system \u2014 which is what the VA\u2019s inspector general found.\n\n\u201cI cut 94 taxes in a state that had never had a general major tax decrease in its history.\u201d \u2014 Mike Huckabee\n\nSome talking points just don\u2019t go away; Huckabee has repeated this line since 2007. What he doesn\u2019t say is that there was a net tax increase under his leadership.\n\nThere were 90 tax cuts when Huckabee was Arkansas governor, from 1996 to 2007. Many of them were narrowly tailored. The tax cuts ranged from tiny cuts, such as a $500 sales tax break for manufacturing machinery, to larger items such as $2.7 million annually in car lease exemptions for the rental car tax.\n\nBut the effect of these cuts was offset by 21 tax increases. That resulted in a $505 million net tax increase when Huckabee was governor.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton famously asked, what difference does it make how four Americans died in Benghazi?\u201d \u2014 Fiorina\n\nThis comment by Hillary Clinton, made during a hearing on May 8, 2013, is frequently taken out of context.\n\nShe uttered it at the end of a tense six-minute exchange with Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), in which he pressed her why she had not tried to immediately contact survivors of the 2012 Benghazi attacks to find out whether they were preceded by a protest. (She said she did not want to interfere with an FBI investigation.) Johnson asserted that \u201cwe were misled that there were supposedly protests\u201d and \u201cthe American people could have known that within days and they didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,\u201d Clinton responded. \u201cWas it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they\u2019d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.\u201d She added that it was \u201cless important today looking backwards as to why these militants decided they did it than to find them and bring them to justice, and then maybe we\u2019ll figure out what was going on in the meantime.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reality is, most Americans find this practice [fetal tissue donation] horrific.\u201d \u2014 Fiorina\n\nFiorina is referring to the previous practice of taking reimbursement for fetal tissue donations, as revealed through the Center for Medical Progress\u2019s videos. She overstates by saying \u201cmost\u201d Americans oppose Planned Parenthood\u2019s fetal tissue donations, and/or accepting reimbursements for the donations.\n\nOur review of polling data showed there was one survey that specifically addressed fetal tissue donations, and meets The Washington Post\u2019s polling standards. Fox News in August 2015 asked: \u201cWhich of the following comes closer to your reaction to the [Planned Parenthood] videos?\u201d Of the respondents, 49 percent said the videos are \u201cdisturbing, and the use of fetal tissue from abortions in research should be stopped,\u201d and 43 percent answered that the videos are \u201cdisturbing, but if medical research needs this fetal tissue to save lives, it should continue.\u201d\n\nThe options may have biased respondents toward more negative answers, because the response options both included the word \u201cdisturbing,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s polling expert Scott Clement told us. The use of the word \u201cdisturbing\u201d implied to respondents that the videos are, in fact, disturbing. More neutral language is preferred in effective polling.\n\n\u201cWe saved 80,000 jobs. We went on to grow to 160,000 jobs.\u201d \u2014 Fiorina\n\nIn defending her record as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, Fiorina reached for a talking point that has been found misleading in the past.\n\nThe number of employees was 84,800 in 1999 and 151,000 in 2004, according to the 10-K reports. On paper, that certainly looks like an increase in jobs. But much of the growth came from an ill-fated merger with Compaq.\n\nBefore the merger with Compaq, HP had 86,200 employees and Compaq had 63,700 employees. That adds up to 149,900. HP\u2019s filings show that the combined company had 141,000 employees in 2002 and 142,000 employees in 2003. By 2005, the number was 150,000. In other words, the number of employees barely budged from the pre-merger total \u2014 and people lost jobs as a result.\n\nFiorina ultimately fired more than 30,000 workers in the wake of the Compaq merger.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times, evaluating Fiorina\u2019s record when she ran for the Senate in 2010, noted that during her tenure HP also acquired more than a dozen other companies with at least 8,000 employees.\n\n1 of 22 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Top quotes from the seventh Republican presidential debate View Photos The candidates shared these comments during the Fox News Republican primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa.
