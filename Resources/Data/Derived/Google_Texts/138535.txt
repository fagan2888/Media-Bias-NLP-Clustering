A Yukon woman is asking for help in finding her husband’s most-prized possession.

A Yukon woman is asking for help in finding her husband’s most-prized possession.

Her husband is a Tinker airman, who is currently deployed overseas.

Heather Fahr is a 2012 Mustang High School graduate.

He and her husband Stephen live at the Park at Westpointe apartments. It’s a gated community.

However, Heather said Monday morning, she discovered her husband’s Chevrolet pickup was missing from the apartment complex’s parking lot.

It’s a 1993 Chevrolet Long Bed 1500, that Heather Fahr said her husband fully restored last spring after his first deployment.

“I’m scared, I got a gun, and I have some friends staying with me. That way I’m not alone, when this happens, and I just don’t feel safe anymore,” she said.

Fahr filed a report with Oklahoma City police, and the manager of the apartment complex said she’s looking into it.
