Absent a major macroeconomic shock, Blackstone doesn\u2019t foresee a U.S. recession, according to Mr. James.\n\n\u201cThe market has overreacted,\u201d he said.\n\nTom Lacy, a managing director in the financial sponsors group at investment bank Robert W. Baird & Co., said the private equity community is \u201cdefinitely more interested in actively discussing ideas in the public markets, whether through PIPEs or take-private transactions, but those deals can be more difficult to consummate.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, he added, private equity firms considering a take-private deal must navigate the different constituents on corporate boards and among shareholders, which is often a complex process.\n\n\u201cIt can take some time for the stars and moons to align,\u201d Mr. Lacy said.\n\nAccess the full story in LBO Wire here (subscription required).\n\nWrite to Laura Kreutzer at laura.kreutzer@wsj.com and Amy Or at Amy.Or@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Private equity firms are once again looking for bargains in the public markets.", "title": "PE Firms Hunt for Bargains in the Public Markets", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/02/01/pe-firms-hunt-for-bargains-in-the-public-markets/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-MJ606_shoppi_P_20160201135029.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "PE Firms Hunt for Bargains in the Public Markets", "description": "Private equity firms are once again looking for bargains in the public markets.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Laura Kreutzer", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Private equity firms are once again looking for bargains in the public markets.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2016-02-01T20:48:45-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/02/01/pe-firms-hunt-for-bargains-in-the-public-markets/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-19506", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Private equity firms are once again looking for bargains in the public markets.", "title": "PE Firms Hunt for Bargains in the Public Markets", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/02/01/pe-firms-hunt-for-bargains-in-the-public-markets/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-MJ606_shoppi_P_20160201135029.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-19506", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-02-01T20:49:32-05:00"}, "article_summary": "istockphoto.com/wsfurlanBy Laura Kreutzer and Amy OrPrivate equity firms may be ready to shop in the public markets again.\nThe same stock market volatility that has sent some private equity portfolio valuations down, particularly for firms with sizable public company stakes in their portfolios, may translate into more public stock purchases by private equity firms, or perhaps even privatizations of public companies.\nMarket volatility and growing concern among public stock investors about the global economy have driven down valuations for many public companies, making them more attractive to some private equity buyers.\nHigh public stock valuations made public-to-private transactions less attractive to investors in recent years with the number of such deals in the U.S. dropping to just 18 deals totaling $26.04 billion in 2014 from 47 deals totaling $48.8 billion back in 2010, according to data provider Dealogic.\nAbsent a major macroeconomic shock, Blackstone doesn\u2019t foresee a U.S. recession, according to Mr. James."}
