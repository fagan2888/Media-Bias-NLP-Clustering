As prices in Highlands and LoHi head for the stratosphere, Adams\u2019 home sales arm, Real Estate Denver Team, is offering new routes into the Highlands area with much lower pricing \u2013 a row home concept at Sloan\u2019s Lake, with 2-car attached garage, rooftop deck, and the contemporary styling that Highlands projects have, from the $390s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like buying into LoHi seven years ago,\u201d said Adams, as we took the hardhat tour you\u2019ll get today at 1700 Irving Street Rowhomes, W. 17th at Irving Street, four blocks from Denver\u2019s largest lake and its second biggest park. \u201cAnybody coming in now has the potential to make phenomenal money.\u201d\n\nThe Denver Team has 5 projects totaling 43 units near the St. Anthony\u2019s redevelopment project, centered on Raleigh Street a few blocks further west along Sloan\u2019s Lake. St. A\u2019s is generating headlines \u2013 Alamo Drafthouse Cinema coming as part of a dining/retail component, along with apartments that are drawing major investors. Some 60 percent of the Denver Team\u2019s next three projects here are presold; often to urban buyers that had been priced out of the Highlands market, now getting out of apartments and into ownership, says Linda Kukulski Miller, managing broker. She\u2019s seen 23 of Real Estate Denver Team\u2019s Highland area units pre-sold this spring months prior to completion.\n\n\u201cBuyers are very receptive to our value and location,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting into a quality home for thousands less than what they\u2019re seeing in central Highlands, and still getting the latest look and urban lifestyle.\u201d All of these new development homes have two-car attached garages and rooftop decks with an outdoor fireplace \u2013 along with larger windows, wood flooring, and quartz countertops.\n\nYou can also tour a Denver Team duplex just completed in LoHi, at 3731 Lipan Street by Franco Park: 4-bedroom/4-bath sizing from $675,000. Both projects show the Denver Team\u2019s approach to building \u2013 using seasoned custom builders like Carter Custom, Malibu Homes and Augusta Homes to get higher quality in a very busy market.\n\nAt either location you can sign up to win an iPad mini to be given away this week \u2013 and find out how to finance your new home from Peyton Fullerton of Starkey Mortgage, Denver Team\u2019s preferred lender (NMLSR 492643, LMB 100048773) \u2013 offering discounted closing costs, competitive rates and long-term rate locks with float down options for qualified new construction buyers; apply at PeytonFullerton.com.
