I heard it on the top of my roof,\u201d Carone said.\n\nThe 52-year-old lineman for Detroit-based DTE Energy is one of the thousands of electrical workers who have put in double shifts trying to restore power to more than a half-million homes and businesses. Outages stretched from the Great Plains to Maine and into eastern Canada.\n\n\u201cMy power went out the same time as everybody else\u2019s,\u201d Carone said of the power to his Lapeer home, north of Detroit. It was about 7:30 a.m. Sunday, while he was on the phone with his utility\u2019s area leader. He walked out the door a half-hour later and has been working 16 hours a day ever since.\n\nThe storm has been blamed for 17 deaths in the U.S. and 10 in Canada. Five people apparently died from carbon monoxide poisoning tied to using generators.\n\nMichigan bore the brunt of the storm as nearly 600,000 homes and businesses lost power, and as of Friday morning, about 64,000 customers remained in the dark. Maine reported almost 12,000 outages and in eastern Canada, more than 77,000 hadn\u2019t had their power restored, including tens of thousands in Toronto.\n\nIt could have been worse, said Paul Graham, a lineman supervisor from Massachusetts whose crew was helping out in Gardiner, Maine.\n\n\u201cIf it was a little more ice, poles would have been broken,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThings would be on the ground. \u2026 If there was another quarter of an inch or a half-inch of ice, people would\u2019ve been out for a long, long, long time. But I\u2019m sure no one is thinking they\u2019re lucky, right?\u201d\n\nMany families affected by the outages sought refuge with relatives or hunkered down with generator-powered space heaters and fireplaces to keep warm. Utility officials say it could be days before power is restored to everyone.\n\nThe linemen face a dangerous and physical task, below-freezing temperatures aside. Ice can weigh down power lines so much that they break, or tree branches can fall and take the lines with them. So, the linemen must clear some debris, if needed, and then shimmy up slick utility poles to restring lines using belts and spiked boots.\n\n\u201cYou have to take your time. You have to watch what you\u2019re doing,\u201d said Carone, who was working in Columbiaville on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good feeling, climbing up an icy pole.\u201d\n\nA lineman fell Tuesday from a ladder in Lansing, suffering broken ribs and a shoulder injury.\n\n\u201cIt underscores the inherent dangers that linemen face in restoration efforts in a storm like this,\u201d Lansing\u2019s Board of Water & Light spokesman Stephen Serkaian said.\n\nConsumers Energy lineman Jeff Morrall has traveled throughout west Michigan in the last week, braving the elements.\n\n\u201cIt was miserable. Friday night it was the freezing rain coming in,\u201d Morrall said. \u201cYou look up and you can barely see out of your safety glasses. When we were working Sunday in Muskegon, you could see the branches breaking. You hear a big old crash, thinking \u2018I hope these branches don\u2019t break over our heads.\u2019\u201d\n\nMorrall, 51, was able to spend time Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with his family in Muskegon. Other than that, it\u2019s mostly been hotel and motel rooms.\n\n\u201cOur families pretty much understand that\u2019s our job to go out and get the lights on. \u2026 It\u2019s almost like being a fireman. You\u2019re there for public service.\u201d\n\nConsumers Energy had about 2,500 employees, contractors and workers from outside Michigan in the field. DTE Energy has about 1,500 focused on restoration efforts.\n\nBut in a twist of holiday spirit, Morrall said his crew\u2019s morale was lifted Wednesday by grateful homeowners who had been using generators for heat, light and cooking.\n\n\u201cThere were no restaurants open anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had just put the power on to this neighborhood and these people brought over plates of food with turkey, ham, green bean casserole. We did get a Christmas dinner.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press writer David Sharp in Gardiner, Maine, contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Thousands still without power from last weekend\u2019s ice storm", "title": "Thousands still without power from last weekend\u2019s ice storm", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/26/thousands-still-without-power-from-last-weekends-ice-storm/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131227__6d369e80-2c87-4e46-b9e6-c3a96aa72b4elsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 425}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131227__6d369e80-2c87-4e46-b9e6-c3a96aa72b4elsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-27T06:10:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T11:02:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9551\"", "article_summary": "When an ice storm glazed over Michigan last weekend, Tony Carone feared he wouldn\u2019t be spending Christmas at home with his family.\nConsumers Energy lineman Jeff Morrall has traveled throughout west Michigan in the last week, braving the elements.\n\u201cMy power went out the same time as everybody else\u2019s,\u201d Carone said of the power to his Lapeer home, north of Detroit.\nIce can weigh down power lines so much that they break, or tree branches can fall and take the lines with them.\nMaine reported almost 12,000 outages and in eastern Canada, more than 77,000 hadn\u2019t had their power restored, including tens of thousands in Toronto."}
