That\u2019s according to a new report by Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy and the Episcopal Health Foundation. An estimated 1 million Texans have signed up via the ACA.\n\nMore than 14 percent of Americans were uninsured in 2013 before the big coverage expansion under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. That share dropped to 9 percent last year, according to the government.\n\nNow, those historic gains could be stalling out. It\u2019s raising questions about the lasting impact of Obama\u2019s signature legislation, and spurring liberals like Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders to call for guaranteed coverage for all.\n\nThe health law\u2019s problems in part reflect entrenched political opposition, but there\u2019s also skepticism about whether the coverage is affordable for uninsured people of modest means. Premiums are up, and those who get sick can face significant out-of-pocket costs. Major health insurer Anthem said Wednesday it booked fewer customers than expected last year through the health care law.\n\nThe poll found that nearly half the uninsured (46 percent) have been without coverage for two years or longer.\n\nThe Kaiser poll is the second independent survey to raise questions recently. Earlier this month, the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index found that the law\u2019s progress stalled last year. The share of U.S. adults without health insurance was 11.9 percent in the last three months of 2015, according to Gallup, essentially unchanged from the start of the year.\n\nThe health law has added coverage in two major ways. Online insurance markets like HealthCare.gov offer taxpayer-subsidized private plans to people who don\u2019t have coverage on the job. Sunday is the marketplace sign-up deadline.\n\nThe Obama administration has set a modest goal of 10 million people enrolled through the markets and paying premiums at the end of the year. Earlier this week, the Congressional Budget Office reduced its own enrollment projections.\n\nThe law\u2019s other big driver of coverage is a Medicaid expansion aimed at low-income adults with no children living at home.\n\nThirty-one states, plus Washington, D.C., have opted to expand. But populous Republican-led states including Texas, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina have turned down the federal offer. If they were to accept, the coverage expansion would regain its momentum.\n\nThe poll found that Americans remain divided on the Affordable Care Act, with 44 percent viewing it unfavorably and 41 percent holding a favorable view.\n\nThe Kaiser survey was conducted Jan. 13-19 among a nationally representative sample of 1,204 adults. For the entire poll, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. For the uninsured, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 10 percentage points.\n\n(\u00a92016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc. All Rights Reserved.
