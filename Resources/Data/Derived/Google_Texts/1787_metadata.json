KBM invests in small publicly traded companies that have a hard time finding financing. The company provides capital in exchanges for shares it can buy at a discount.\n\nThe lender issued a conversion on May 28, seeking to exchange about $13.3 million for 8.86 million shares of common stock, which NetTalk was supposed to convert within three business days, according to the suit. NetTalk did not complete the conversion, and KBM alleges that it is owed $2,000 per day until the shares are issued.\n\nThe complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York on Sept. 2, alleges that NetTalk CEO Anastasios Kyriakides, CFO Steven Healy and board member Kenneth Hosfeld violated antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The lender is also seeking recovery of damages from NetTalk shareholder Telestrata LLC, and Samar Bishay, who controls Telestrata, because it says they have interfered with the KBM's contractual rights.\n\nNow, NetTalk is in default on the note and KBM is seeking $107,000, plus interest.\n\nNetTalk warns that its current cash resources combined with anticipated future cash flow may not be sufficient to fund operations, and that it is looking for additional capital, in the company's latest quarterly filing with the SEC, filed Aug. 19.\n\nFor the previous edition of Turnaround Tuesday, see Feeling Cash Squeeze, Mojo Organics Receives Infusion.
