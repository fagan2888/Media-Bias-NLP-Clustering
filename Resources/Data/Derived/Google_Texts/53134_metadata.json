He was running again this year until Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., announced his Senate campaign. Buck then shifted focus to winning Gardner\u2019s seat.\n\nHe\u2019s being opposed by Vic Meyers, a Democrat from Elizabeth. Meyers is an Army veteran and a Department of Corrections case manager.\n\nOn the question of dealing with the thousands of young Honduran and Guatemalan refugees at the U.S. border, Buck said they need to be returned to their countries.\n\n\u201cRepublican leaders in Congress have talked to the leaders of those nations and they want their children back as soon as possible,\u201d he said, adding he would support extra spending to speed up their repatriation.\n\nThe U.S. policy on Cuban refugees is called \u201cdry foot-wet foot,\u201d meaning if they if they can reach dry land, they are allowed to ask for asylum in the U.S. Intercepted at sea, they are returned to Cuba.\n\nBuck said he didn\u2019t consider the Honduran and Guatemalan refugees to be similar to Cubans leaving that country because the U.S. is not at odds with the governments there \u2014 even though the refugee families say they are fleeing drug-related violence there.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s another reason we need to assist those countries and their economies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to open our doors to everyone.\u201d\n\nWhich also is why Buck does not support giving a path to citizenship for the 11 million or so undocumented people in the U.S. He said most of those people don\u2019t want citizenship, just a way to legally work in the U.S.\n\nLike Gardner, Buck would repeal the federal health care law known as Obamacare. He said Republicans share the blame for the nation\u2019s health care problems by not making improvements when they were the majority party in Congress and had the White House as well.\n\n\u201cWe created the conditions that let Obama bring forward this legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t agree the government should force me to buy insurance to cover the health problems of someone else\u2019s lifestyle.\u201d\n\nWhile Buck supports energy development, he was uncertain whether he would support extending the federal wind-power tax credit for Vestas and other wind-turbine makers.\n\n\u201cThat credit was supposed to help the industry get on its feet,\u201d he said. \u201cIf wind power can survive on its own, then I don\u2019t want to extend the tax credit. That\u2019s just corporate welfare.\u201d\n\nproper@chieftain.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chieftain.com/news/politics/2756791-119/buck-health-obama-ukraine", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.chieftain.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=JQXaGqI2Y7WuDikuzBZH98$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYsl9Xqeituy1hYPW5yra8Z_WCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "site_name": "http://www.chieftain.com", "title": "Buck: More aid for Ukraine, other nations"}, "fb": {"admins": 166812535600, "app_id": 323205824384149}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Chieftain.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc37e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe should give the Ukraine the (military) training they need,\u201d Buck said Friday.\nBuck is the Weld County district attorney and was an unsuccessful candidate for the Senate in 2010.\nHe said most of those people don\u2019t want citizenship, just a way to legally work in the U.S.Like Gardner, Buck would repeal the federal health care law known as Obamacare.\nOn the question of dealing with the thousands of young Honduran and Guatemalan refugees at the U.S. border, Buck said they need to be returned to their countries.\n\u201cIf wind power can survive on its own, then I don\u2019t want to extend the tax credit."}
