The Good Shepherd clinic is in danger of closing.\n\nLast year the clinic logged 16,000 patient visits. Many thought with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act the need for clinics like this would drastically decrease. But it turns out it was just the opposite.\n\nMaryjane Fisher was seeing a doctor Tuesday morning at the Good Shepherd Clinic because of an ear infection and some hip pain. She comes here for all her medical care.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford to go anywhere else,\u201d said Fisher.\n\nShe had anticipated when the Affordable Care Act took effect she would be able to get health insurance.\n\n\u201cI thought I would be able to afford something, nope. It didn\u2019t happen for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one. I have a few friends that are in the same predicament as me.\u201d\n\nShe falls into a gap created when Oklahoma declined expanded Medicare coverage and because of that insurance through the Affordable Care Act still costs too much. Those are a lot of the patients they see at the clinic.\n\nStill nationwide, there has been a 40% increase in demand at free clinics over the last two years.\n\n\u201cA lot of times the deductibles are playing a factor on it too. People can\u2019t afford to go to the doctor with the deductibles they have,\u201d explained Pam Timmons, Executive Director of the Good Shepherd Clinic.\n\nThe Good Shepherd Clinic provides dental, medical and pharmacy care for their patients. A grant allowed them to expand but now donations aren't keeping up with expenses.\n\n\u201cI think basically the community is not aware the needs are not being met,\u201d said Timmons. \u201cI think they think the Affordable Care Act is taking care of everybody and it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nTimmons says they have already started laying off staff, and if things don't change in 6 months Timmons say they will have to close their doors, leaving those like Fisher with few options.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for this clinic I would be really in a bind,\u201d said Fisher.\n\nThe best way to donate to save the Good Shepard Clinic is through their web site. www.GoodShepherdOKC.org\n\nOpen enrollment in the Affordable Care Act ends January 31.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The Good Shepard Clinic in downtown Oklahoma City provides free medical care for people who can\u2019t afford it.
