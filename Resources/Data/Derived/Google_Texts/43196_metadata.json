The leftmost end of the political spectrum is championing the protesters\u2019 successful silencing of the \u201cMussolini part 2\u2033; their opposites on the right are arguing that the protesters \u2014 \u201cBernie\u2019s pawns\u201d \u2014 are denying the candidate his Constitutional right to freedom of speech. Perhaps Trump himself \u2014 as the soon-to-be official voice of the Republican party \u2014 tweeted it best:\n\nThe organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2016\n\nThe tweet is rife with hypocrisy. How is it that the protesters\u2019 First Amendment right to assemble is infringing upon your First Amendment right to indoctrinate the poorly educated? But to call protesters \u201cthugs\u201d simply because they disagree with your politics is next-level, even for Donald J. Trump.\n\nConservative media are using similar rhetoric to somehow reframe the guy who said of a protester, \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face,\u201d into the victim of collective liberal bullying.\n\n\u201cBlaming Donald Trump even in part for the violence that has broken out at his rallies is nonsense,\u201d wrote the New York Post editorial board. \u201cThis is the same left-wing agitation that has plagued the nation for decades now, a rage that fixes on one target of opportunity after another.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe live in a free society with a First Amendment,\u201d conservative columnist John Phillips told CNN\u2019s John Berman. \u201cPeople should be able to meet peacefully. If you have a problem with it, you have every right to protest. Just do it outside and don\u2019t be violent.\u201d\n\nDuring his Fox News show Friday, Sean Hannity called the Chicago protesters \u201cviolent agitators\u201d who \u201chijacked what was to be a peaceful campaign rally.\u201d\n\nThe list of conservatives pinning blame on protesters for violence at Trump rallies is unreasonably long \u2014 especially considering the same conservatives\u2019 incongruous response to protests that align with their politics.\n\nDuring the August 2009 congressional recess, representatives returned to their home states to host town hall meetings detailing the Affordable Care Act. Prompted by an extensive mobilizing effort by conservative lobbying and media groups, right-wing protesters derailed several of these events. In some cases, violence erupted and people wound up in the hospital.\n\nThe series of protests is widely considered to mark the dawn of the Tea Party movement. What ensued was a domino effect whereby Democrats lost their majority in the House, and a filibustering obstructionist and a pandering racist can viably compete for the GOP nom this coming July.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Tea Party hijacked Congress via uncivil disobedience; the right can't cry when its tactics are used vs. Trump VIDEO", "title": "The right\u2019s hypocrisy on Trump protesters: It was only OK when the Tea Party was crashing Obamacare meetings", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Tea Party hijacked Congress via uncivil disobedience; the right can't cry when its tactics are used vs. Trump VIDEO", "title": "The right\u2019s hypocrisy on Trump protesters: It was only OK when the Tea Party was crashing Obamacare meetings", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/15/the_rights_hypocrisy_on_trump_protesters_it_was_only_ok_when_the_tea_party_was_crashing_obamacare_meetings/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/tea_party_trump_protests.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Tea Party hijacked Congress via uncivil disobedience; the right can't cry when its tactics are used vs. Trump VIDEO", "title": "The right\u2019s hypocrisy on Trump protesters: It was only OK when the Tea Party was crashing Obamacare meetings", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/tea_party_trump_protests.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brendan Gauthier", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Arlen Specter, Donald Trump, Elections 2016, Fox News, Glenn Beck, John Berman, John Phillips, Obamacare, Sean Hannity, Tea Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "How is it that the protesters\u2019 First Amendment right to assemble is infringing upon your First Amendment right to indoctrinate the poorly educated?\nBut to call protesters \u201cthugs\u201d simply because they disagree with your politics is next-level, even for Donald J.
