If that can be accomplished, he thinks the now three-times-failed Insure Tennessee Medicaid expansion program can take hold throughout the state.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to get Insure Tennessee passed this legislative session,\u201d Garr said Monday.\n\nTwo local lawmakers, Micah Van Huss and Matthew Hill, will be in attendance for a town hall meeting at the Visitors Center in Jonesborough at 6 p.m. Aug. 11. Garr and Hill both said they would love to see as many engaged community members as possible at the meeting, Garr for the reason that he believes a lot of misinformation about the Affordable Care Act, or \u201cObamacare\u201d has worked against all the good that would come out of getting more lower-income state residents health insurance. Hill said he wants a packed house because that\u2019s how America should work on important issues.\n\n\u201cMy job is to hear all sides of the issue and that\u2019s what my goal is: to listen and to learn at the meeting,\u201d Hill said. \u201cIt\u2019s my number one goal to do what\u2019s best for the families of Washington County and if that\u2019s to vote \u201cno\u201d then that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. If that\u2019s to vote \u201cyes\u201d then that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201c\n\nTo get to position of support for expansion of Medicaid, Hill said he\u2019ll need answers as to how it will be paid for, how long that funding will last and what would happen after that initial funding were to go away and what the long term goals of such a program would be. Answers to those inquiries would go a long way for Hill. Dozens of his constituents have called him \u2014 in what he guesses is an 80-percent against, 20-percent for leaning \u2014 to share their thoughts.\n\nMuch of that, he said, comes from a general distrust of anything from the federal government.\n\n\u201dI understand that many distrust anything that comes from the federal government then we become even more distrustful of things that come from the federal government that have President Obama\u2019s name attached to it,\u201c Hill said. \u201dDoes that make me leery? Of course it does. It does give me pause, and that\u2019s putting it lightly.\u201c\n\nIn 2010, when the historic Obamacare law passed, it was mandated that states expand their Medicaid programs to lower-income residents. That mandate was rolled back in 2012 and Tennessee has, to this point, held the line of not expanding. When looking at the numbers, Garr said it\u2019s clear how many poorer Tennesseans would benefit for an expansion, following the national lead, which has seen more than 21 million citizens go from uninsured to insured.\n\nAccording to the Tennessee Justice Center, \u201cstatewide, 47 percent of all uninsured Tennesseans, ages 18 to 64, have incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which would make them eligible for Medicaid under the new law.\n\nExpanding Medicaid, which is called TennCare in Tennessee, could extend health coverage to over 300,000 Tennesseans.\u201d\n\nIn Washington County alone, by U.S. Census data, that number is 7,924. In Carter County, 4,011 would be eligible, 1,141 in Johnson County, 8,805 in Sullivan County and 1,219 in Unicoi County. All five of those counties border or slightly exceed a mark that represents half of their respective county\u2019s uninsured adults.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the health of many across the state that Garr and proponents of Medicaid expansion would benefit. Citing several studies, Garr said the accepted figure of 15,000 to 20,000 would the number of new jobs across the state to handle the influx of about 280,000 newly-insured citizens.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s big,\u201d he said.\n\nComparing Tennessee with nearby Kentucky and Arkansas, where expansion has already occurred and money has been made on the state level, the health care-focused volunteer sees Medicaid expansion in the Volunteer State as inevitable.\n\nTo get that to that point, he thinks people will need to get engaged in events like the upcoming town hall meeting in Jonesborough.\n\nFor more information on Insure Tennessee, go to www.tn.gov/tenncare/article/insure-tennessee.\n\nFollow Tony Casey on Twitter @TonyCaseyJCP.
