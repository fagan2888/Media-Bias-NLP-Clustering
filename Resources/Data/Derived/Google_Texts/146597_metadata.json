This isn\u2019t just about the more obvious distinctions between the two. It\u2019s about the inevitable yet ridiculous rush to equate the news that Davis misrepresented certain aspects of her personal history with the recent revelations of Christie\u2019s George Washington Bridge fiasco.\n\nDavis\u2019 narrative has long been one of a triumph over circumstances \u2013 the story of a woman who was by age 19, as the AP tightly sums it up, \u201cmarried and divorced with a child of her own and living in a mobile home.\u201d But over the weekend, the Dallas Morning News revealed that there were \u201ckey facts blurred\u201d in Davis\u2019 personal narrative. \u201cDavis was 21, not 19, when she was divorced,\u201d the paper said. Furthermore, \u201cShe lived only a few months in the family mobile home while separated from her husband before moving into an apartment with her daughter.\u201d It also revealed some differing accounts of the circumstances of her second marriage and divorce. As you can see, they really blew the lid off Wendy Davis and her WEB OF LIES.\n\nSpeaking to Wayne Slater for the story, the Texas gubernatorial candidate admitted that \u201cMy language should be tighter. I\u2019m learning about using broader, looser language. I need to be more focused on the detail.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t enough for critics of the woman who last summer earned the dubious nickname \u201cabortion Barbie\u201d for her filibuster for reproductive rights. Aside from the usual random tweeters wondering why they were seeing \u201cplenty still on Christie but not a word on Wendy Davis lying about her bio,\u201d Erick Erickson gleefully said that \u201cI await Wendy Davis\u2019s lawsuit against the Dallas Morning News claiming it harmed her mental health by revealing her lies,\u201d while Ben Shapiro wrote his own bio for her, declaring, \u201cWendy Davis apparently abandoned her children, had her husband foot her bills, and divorced after adultery accusations. #FeministHero.\u201d Drudge, meanwhile, excitedly reported that \u201cTX Abortion Heroine Lied About Being a Single Teen Mom\u2026\u201d And John Nolte went for the gold by connecting the dots: \u201cInteresting: As MSM destroys Christie, New Media is taking down Wendy Davis over fake bio \u2014 story MSM is ignoring. Whole new world.\u201d He went even further on Breitbart, saying, \u201cIt is not as though the media would have to quit their ongoing political assassination of Chris Christie to give the brewing scandal surrounding Texas Democrat Wendy Davis\u2019s bio falsehoods the attention it deserves.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The right pounces on discrepancies in her bio, but they're still not Bridgegate", "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The right pounces on discrepancies in her bio, but they're still not Bridgegate", "title": "Wendy Davis is not Chris Christie", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/21/wendy_davis_is_not_chris_christie/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/davis_christie.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The right pounces on discrepancies in her bio, but they're still not Bridgegate", "creator": "@embeedub", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/davis_christie.jpg", "title": "Wendy Davis is not Chris Christie", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Wendy Davis is not Chris Christie", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Breitbart, Chris Christie, Drudge, George Washington Bridge, George Washington Bridge scandal, Wendy Davis", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd647\"", "article_summary": "As you can see, they really blew the lid off Wendy Davis and her WEB OF LIES.\nTopics: Breitbart, Chris Christie, Drudge, George Washington Bridge, George Washington Bridge scandal, Wendy Davis, Life NewsIn case it isn\u2019t obvious that a Texas Democratic woman is not a New Jersey Republican man, let\u2019s make something clear: She isn\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s about the inevitable yet ridiculous rush to equate the news that Davis misrepresented certain aspects of her personal history with the recent revelations of Christie\u2019s George Washington Bridge fiasco.\n#FeministHero.\u201d Drudge, meanwhile, excitedly reported that \u201cTX Abortion Heroine Lied About Being a Single Teen Mom\u2026\u201d And John Nolte went for the gold by connecting the dots: \u201cInteresting: As MSM destroys Christie, New Media is taking down Wendy Davis over fake bio \u2014 story MSM is ignoring.\nWhole new world.\u201d He went even further on Breitbart, saying, \u201cIt is not as though the media would have to quit their ongoing political assassination of Chris Christie to give the brewing scandal surrounding Texas Democrat Wendy Davis\u2019s bio falsehoods the attention it deserves.\u201d"}
