A wraparound porch adds both curb appeal and an outdoor living space to this country home. The spacious kitchen offers seating for four at the snack bar, another serving counter and sink station, and a separate central island with the range. A corner desk in the breakfast nook, a butler’s pantry and a nearby “kid’s nook” provide more storage. The master suite is appointed with a whirlpool tub, dual sinks and walk-in closet. Upstairs, three more bedrooms share a computer center and bonus room.
