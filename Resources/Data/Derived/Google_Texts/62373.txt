12/23/14 -- Police are searching for a suspect who stabbed a man multiple times in Newton.

The incident happened around 5:30 p.m. in a mobile home community near 17th and Windsor Drive. Officers arrived to find a man in his 20's or 30's seriously hurt.

"There were multiple stab wounds, and he lost a lot of blood," said Newton Police Lt. Scott Powell.

The victim was rushed to a Wichita hospital, where he is undergoing surgery. He is expected to survive, Powell said.

Officers say there were multiple people in the home at the time of the incident, including children, a woman and three men. Powell said investigators do know who the suspect is, but they have not apprehended him.

The suspect and the victim knew each other. Powell said the public is not at risk.

"We have no reason to think there is," he said. "Like I said, it was not a random act. I'm not sure what started it, but they did know each other, and there's no other reason to think he's going to be on the loose, hurting other people at this point."
