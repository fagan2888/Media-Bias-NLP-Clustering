Andy Harris. Of course, of course, it\u2019s Andy Harris.\n\nThe decriminalization law, set to take effect this summer, would eliminate most criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana while leaving in their place a small fine of $25. For those who think it\u2019s ludicrous that people (typically people of color) are thrown in jail for marijuana possession, this law is a good thing.\n\nBut since this is Washington, D.C., Congress has to give final approval on money that the District spends \u2014 even though it raises it on its own. And so Harris, elected during the 2010 Tea Party wave and representing Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore, proposed an amendment during a House Appropriations Committee meeting Wednesday that would \u201cpreclude D.C. from spending any of its locally generated tax revenue to implement the new law.\u201d It passed, mostly along party lines, 28-21. The law\u2019s fate now is likely in the hands of House and Senate budget negotiators.\n\nHarris\u2019 rationale is that he is a DOCTOR and his DOCTOR opinion is that drugs are bad, especially for the children.\n\n\u201cAs a physician, I have read study after study on the devastating effects of marijuana use, especially on developing brains of teenagers,\u201d Harris said in a statement after the vote. \u201cCongress has the authority to stop irresponsible actions by local officials, and I am glad we did for the health and safety of children throughout the District.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s great that he cares so much about the children throughout the District. He doesn\u2019t care about them quite enough to keep their parents out of jail for possessing a little bit of weed, but he cares. He really does.\n\nHarris was even getting into it on Twitter with Mayor Gray.\n\nIronic that a representative from a state that has decriminalized marijuana would interject himself into DC's decision to do the same. \u2014 Vincent C. Gray (@mayorvincegray) June 25, 2014\n\n@mayorvincegray I opposed it in MD too. Decriminalizing marijuana will harm kids. U don't have to be a dr to know that - though I am. \u2014 Rep. Andy Harris, MD (@RepAndyHarrisMD) June 25, 2014\n\n.@RepAndyHarrisMD You have a right to your views. But I ask you to respect the decision of the elected reps of the 640K+ residents of DC. \u2014 Vincent C. Gray (@mayorvincegray) June 25, 2014\n\n\u201cThough I am.\u201d This guy is the worst.\n\nOn the national level, Harris is probably most famous for an incident during congressional orientation in late 2010. Harris, like many Republicans that year (and the next cycle \u2026 and the current cycle \u2026) had run hard against the Affordable Care Act. As soon as he\u2019d won, however, he \u201csurprised fellow freshmen at a Monday orientation session by demanding to know why his government-subsidized health care plan takes a month to kick in.\u201d\n\nBefore that, Harris was a state senator in Maryland. And it was in Annapolis that he honed his talent for pulling off obnoxious culture-war stunts like the one in the House Appropriations Committee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
