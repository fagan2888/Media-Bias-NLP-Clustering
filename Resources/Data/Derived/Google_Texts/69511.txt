Country singer Tim McGraw is giving mortgage-free homes to veterans.

The star, who is working in partnership with Operation Homefront and Chase Bank, has awarded six homes to veterans and their families so far during his Shotgun Rider 2015 Tour.

McGraw is aiming to award another 30 homes before the tour ends in September.

“These families made an incredible mark on me, and I’m more grateful than I’ve ever been for the sacrifices they make every day to serve our country,” McGraw said in a statement.

This isn’t the first time McGraw has awarded veterans with mortgage-free homes. Starting in 2012, McGraw has given 108 homes to veterans and their families from 30 different states.

“The return to civilian life can be a challenging transition. We want to welcome veterans home to the community they sacrificed to protect. A mortgage-free home provides stability for their families and also allows them to start this new chapter of their life with one less worry,” McGraw said in a press release as he prepared for the tour in Nashville.

“It’s an amazing feeling to see them receive something they so deeply deserve—and to be able to share that experience with thousands of fans each night makes me proud to be a part of this program,” he added.

Chase and Operation Homefront, along with several other non-profit organizations, have given over 800 mortgage-free homes to military families.

Both actively exercise military-friendly policies. Since 2011, Chase has hired more than 8,800 veterans. Likewise, Operation Homefront oversees 2,500 volunteers across the U.S. to offer assistance to the families of service members and wounded warriors.

“Everyone who is part of this program is working toward one goal—ensuring a bright and successful future for veterans and their families,” Ross Brown, director of Military and Veterans Affairs at Chase, said in a press release.
