This Tuesday, a pregnant woman at Boston's Brigham and Women’s Hospital danced in an attempt to relieve her labor pain, and thankfully her husband managed to capture the whole performance on video and share it with the world.

For the soon-to-be-mother, Yuki Nishitzawa, not even labor could stop her from busting out her favorite dance moves, USA Today reported. The new mom could be seen dancing the “Tootsie Roll” even while explaining that her water was beginning to break.

“I shouldn’t be laughing because I’m the husband,” Nishitzawa’s husband Connell Cloyd can be heard saying while filming the video, “but she wanted to be famous and I guess this is how you do it.”

Unfortunately, labor pains are a part of human childbirth. According to the “obstetric dilemma ” (OD) hypothesis, the pains are caused by an evolutionary design compromise stemming from the tug-of-war between a woman’s hips and the large skull-size needed to enclose a growing brain.

While Nishitzawa’s technique may be unorthodox, there may be some science behind it. According to the American Pregnancy Association, listening to music can be an effective way to help you relax and work through your contractions. Light dancing, as well as walking, can help to draw your baby’s head toward your pelvis, and the pressure of the baby on your pelvis can help to induce labor.

Earlier this year, Bonnie Northsea of Florida found brief Internet stardom when she posted a video of herself dancing to Michael Jackson’s "Thriller" in an effort to induce her labor.
