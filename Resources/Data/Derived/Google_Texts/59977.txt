This past NFL season was embroiled in controversy, but it wasn't hard to spot the one shining light of the last year in sports: Leah Still. The 5-year-old daughter of Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Devon Still grabbed the attention of both football fans and people who have never seen a game.

After kicking stage 4 neuroblastoma's butt into remission, Leah and her family looked forward to enjoying a normal life, but like football, life is unpredictable. This past Friday the Still family was "hit with a pretty serious complication" identified as VOD — a severe condition resulting from a stem cell procedure.

Thankfully, a photo posted to Still's Instagram on Monday confirmed that although Leah had not really been awake for the past four days, she was doing better and was making "a little progress." Despite Leah and Devon's setback, the father-daughter duo are still expected to be on hand for the 2015 ESPYs to accept the Jimmy V Perseverance Award.

“The perseverance that Devon and Leah have shown throughout this unfortunate process is incredibly moving,” said Connor Schell, senior vice president, ESPN Films and Original Content, who oversees the ESPYs, in a statement. “Each day that she fights, her father is by her side and their love and strength has captivated all of us in the sports world and beyond.”
