The top-ranked University of Denver men’s lacrosse team used a 25-for-34 performance on faceoffs by freshman Trevor Baptiste, and a 9-1 run in the second half to come from behind to beat No. 3 Duke 17-13 on Saturday afternoon at Fifth Third Bank Stadium on the campus of Kennesaw State University in Kennesaw, Ga.

Transfer Connor Cannizzaro shined in his first game in a DU uniforms, tallying eight points on three goals and five assists. The sophomore had just eight assists in his 2014 campaign at Maryland, transitioning into the Matt Brown offense in his DU debut. All five of Cannizzaro’s assists came in the second half.

Junior Jack Bobzien had a career-high six goals in his season opener to lead Denver in scoring, while the Pioneers were also paced by a four-spot from Erik Adamson. Bobzien tallied five of his six goals in the second half, while Adamson split his four two apiece in the two halves.

Senior goaltender Ryan LaPlante made nine saves in his first full game since the 2013 campaign.

Denver will open the home portion of its schedule on Saturday, Feb. 21 and Sunday, Feb. 22 in the 2015 Frontier Airlines Faceoff Classic. DU will play host to Air Force on Saturday at 1:30 p.m. and Furman on Sunday at 1:30 p.m.
