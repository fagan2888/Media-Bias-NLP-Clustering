The Cadillac brand has long been associated with affluence. In the 1950s and 1960s, owning a Cadillac signaled that a person had climbed to the top of the American socio-economic ladder. Following the fuel shortages and recession of the 1970s, the same Cadillac suggested excessive gas guzzling and unseemly conspicuous consumption.\n\nSo, on the face of it, a Cadillac tax presumably targets those rich people who are addicted to over-the-top consumerism. At least that\u2019s what some PR flacks must have thought when latching onto the phrase.\n\nBut contrary to what one might think, the Cadillac tax barely disturbs the infamous top 1 percent. That\u2019s because the Cadillac tax is not a tax on yachts or other luxury items, as one might expect.\n\nThe Cadillac tax is actually a tax, soon to be implemented under the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), on health insurance plans that the government deems \u201ctoo generous.\u201d It is a tax on those working Americans, including countless dues-paying union members, who successfully negotiated strong family health insurance benefits at the expense of short-term wage increases.\n\nIn general, the Cadillac tax will impose a 40 percent excise tax penalty on families with health insurance plans valued at $27,500 and single persons with plans valued above $10,200 annually.\n\nWhy would Congress have agreed to such a scheme? It is, of course, possible that some members of Congress did not know they were agreeing to this tax; that perhaps, like then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, they simply \u201cpassed the bill in order to find out what\u2019s in it.\u201d Only now are people beginning to realize that they were sold a bill of goods; that the law hammers middle class workers in order to cover the uninsured.\n\nParadoxically, the same Administration that claims to have improved American health care by extending benefits to more people, is responsible for increasing the cost and lowering the quality of coverage for those workers who already have effective health insurance. But, no matter. President Obama will be long gone when the tax finally goes into effect.\n\nYou see, the president purposely delayed the implementation of this part of Obamacare so that he will not suffer the political consequences when the tax kicks in.\n\nBut beginning in 2018, the new president will be forced to order the Internal Revenue Service to tax health insurance plans that the government classifies as too generous. Applying a convoluted Rube Goldberg-inspired formula, Obamacare will send workers scurrying to H& R Block offices to calculate whether the Cadillac tax will pinch their hard-earned, job-related benefits.\n\nAs with any sneaky hidden tax, the goal is to obfuscate through indirection. In the strict text of law, the assessment falls upon insurance companies, who will assuredly pass the cost onto businesses that provide health insurance to employees. As a result, workers will face a dispiriting choice between lower wages or slimmed-down health insurance benefits.\n\nAt this moment, only a minority of insurance plans reach the tax penalty level. But at the rate Obamacare is driving up health insurance premiums, it won\u2019t take long for many more working families to fall into this revenue trap. With companies like United Healthcare already planning to bail out of Obamacare due to financial losses, how high will other insurance companies hike rates in order to subsidize their Obamacare liabilities? In the end, middle-class families will get socked with costly premiums, higher deductibles, and multiplying co-pays.\n\nThere\u2019s still a chance that the Caddy tax could be repealed before it goes into effect. Some in Congress, including New Hampshire Republican Congressman Frank Guinta, are pushing for Obamacare changes in an end of the year tax package. Still, President Obama continues to favor the Cadillac tax, and he may veto any bill that includes its repeal. That would give him another opportunity to reprise class warfare rhetoric, bashing Republicans for \u201cfavoring the rich.\u201d\n\nMaking their argument for the Cadillac tax, Obamacare advocates fret that its repeal will \u201ccost\u201d the government nearly $100 billion in revenue over a decade. That\u2019s an odd and tendentious phrase: \u201ccost the government.\u201d It implies that personal wages and work-related benefits belong to the federal government, rather than to working men and women. In reality, tax relief can never \u201ccost\u201d the government anything. To paraphrase both President Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren, the federal government didn\u2019t earn that.\n\nCurrently, approximately 175 million Americans are enrolled in health insurance plans through a family member\u2019s workplace. For those families who did not lose their plans in the first round of implementing Obamacare, the new reality is: \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep your plan \u2014 if you can afford it.\u201d\n\nJoseph Tortelli is a freelance writer.
