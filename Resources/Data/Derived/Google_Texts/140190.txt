A major question Colorado voters face this November is Amendment 69, a sweeping plan to replace nearly all private health insurance with a single-payer plan funded by a new income tax on all residents.

Known as ColoradoCare, it would create a $25 billion to $30 billion fund to pay for universal health care for more than 80 percent of all state residents. Governed by a publicly elected board of 21 trustees, it would operate outside the constraints of state revenue and spending limits and outside the authority of the state Legislature.

Supporters insist it would save billions by simplifying insurance payments for patients, doctors and providers â€” mostly by eliminating the role of most private insurance companies.

The federal Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, lets states create insurance systems. State Sen. Irene Aguilar, D-Denver, who is a doctor, is a leading advocate for ColoradoCare.
