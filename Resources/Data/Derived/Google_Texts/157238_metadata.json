(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n\n3976482\n\nIt was easier for Arthur Fonzarelli to say he was \u201cwrong\u201d than it has been for many to admit that President Obama \u201clied\u201d when he repeatedly stated his eponymous health care law would allow people to keep their insurance, or their doctors, if they so wished.\n\nOf course the president lied. Politicians lie. And birds go tweet. If some of those placard-hoisters who spent eight years accusing George W. Bush of lying on a military-industrial scale could summon the same clarity of language now, we could dispense with this semantic silly-bears and move on to more important matters; namely, the continued dismantling of personal liberty in America, of which Obamacare is just a recent and conspicuous example.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, calling its sanction a \u201ctax.\u201d Finding this appellation politically inconvenient, the White House and an obliging media continue to refer to it as a \u201cpenalty\u201d (thereby contravening the very Supreme Court they point to for validation of their favored law \u2013 discuss).\n\nAbortion advocates have insisted for two generations that politicians should not come between a woman and her doctor. Today, thanks to Obamacare, you\u2019ve got the IRS poking around in there. Happy now?\n\nThe point is, even in making the most personal of life choices, you must do as the government deems best, or you will be punished. While Obama\u2019s mendacity should be as shocking as the discovery of gambling in Rick\u2019s Caf\u00e9, the paternalism this represents is true cause for alarm.\n\nModern America is a land in which most everything is mandatory or forbidden. Columnist Mark Steyn often notes that the essence of such tyranny is not iron-fistedness but caprice. No one can know when or how the rules will be enforced, or even what they are. But rest assured, whatever you wish to do in pursuit of your American Dream, there is a law to demand or prevent it.\n\nLaws run thousands of pages; and their attendant rules, tens of thousands. The authoritarian tendency affects everything from health care, to education, to taxes, to just getting around.\n\nEntering the United States, or even traveling within it, requires interaction with an ever-growing army of \u201csecurity\u201d personnel, whether actual law enforcement or not (who can tell, nowadays?), who imagine every border crossing, railway platform and airport gate to be Checkpoint Charlie. Hopped up on a noxious cocktail of Red Bull and self-regard, utterly convinced of the institutional rhubarb that they \u201cput their lives on the line each and every day\u201d to keep people \u201csafe,\u201d these costumed paragons of self-parody are the most conspicuous sign that liberty has been banished from the Land of the Free.\n\nIslamist terrorists will continue to wish harm upon the American citizenry, but so long as it is easier to corral the latter group as a pretense to combating the former, this conduct will continue, and worsen.\n\nThis is not merely a function of laws and mandates; it is also a mindset. If America\u2019s is truly a government of, by, and for the people, a president is a reflection of the nation\u2019s condition. The fact that America elected a person like Barack Obama, twice, says more about the country\u2019s civic bankruptcy than it does about him.\n\nThe question becomes, then, are the American people ready to reconsider the nature of government to which they give their consent?", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Theo Caldwell", "description": "The NSA, the prison explosion, and other infringements give the GOP an opportunity.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "It was easier for Arthur Fonzarelli to say he was \u201cwrong\u201d than it has been for many to admit that President Obama \u201clied\u201d when he repeatedly stated his eponymous health care law would allow peo", "title": "Amidst the Obamacare debacle, the GOP can\u2019t forget civil liberties", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/20/amidst-the-obamacare-debacle-the-gop-cant-forget-civil-liberties/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/3d473f25d81a45e98a41022102d3155f-e1416327498519.jpg", "height": 276}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The NSA, the prison explosion, and other infringements give the GOP an opportunity.", "title": "Amidst the Obamacare debacle, the GOP can\u2019t forget civil liberties Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/20/amidst-the-obamacare-debacle-the-gop-cant-forget-civil-liberties/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/3d473f25d81a45e98a41022102d3155f-e1416327498519.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-20 10:51:24", "sailthru.title": "Amidst the Obamacare debacle, the GOP can't forget civil liberties", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "cia,theo-caldwell,theo-caldwell", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "cia,civil liberties,theo caldwell", "sailthru.description": "It was easier for Arthur Fonzarelli to say he was \u201cwrong\u201d than it has been for many to admit that President Obama \u201clied\u201d when he repeatedly stated his eponymous health care law would allow peo", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/3d473f25d81a45e98a41022102d3155f-e1416327498519.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "A sign stands outside the National Security Administration (NSA) campus on Thursday, June 6, 2013, in Fort Meade, Md.\nAnother release of declassified government surveillance documents is underway as part of an ongoing civil liberties lawsuit.\nIf America\u2019s is truly a government of, by, and for the people, a president is a reflection of the nation\u2019s condition.\nThe question becomes, then, are the American people ready to reconsider the nature of government to which they give their consent?\nThe Obama administration published more than 1,000 pages of once-secret court opinions and National Security Agency procedures on the website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Nov. 18, 2103."}
