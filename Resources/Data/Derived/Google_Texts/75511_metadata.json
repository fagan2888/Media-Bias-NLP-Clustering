You don\u2019t give a hoot about social issues, and you don\u2019t follow any of this nonsense about identity politics or insiders and outsiders. All you care about is getting the nation\u2019s fiscal house in order.\n\nAre you sitting down? I hope you\u2019re sitting down. Because the candidate you should vote for might surprise you.\n\nAccording to a new report from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the most fiscally conservative presidential contender left standing is . . . Hillary Clinton.\n\nSeriously.\n\nYou\u2019re probably used to thinking of Clinton as just another spendthrift liberal, oblivious to fiscal restraint. And it is true that she wants to expand the footprint of the federal government.\n\nDemocratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton spoke with Kentucky workers at a campaign event on May 2, saying the coal industry needs government assistance. (Reuters)\n\nBy a lot.\n\nConsider her \u201cNew College Compact,\u201d which would substantially reduce higher-ed costs for new students and lower debt for past ones. She also plans to expand the Affordable Care Act. Her proposed expansions and investments in clean energy, early-childhood education, family leave, veterans\u2019 services and infrastructure look pretty costly, too.\n\nOn the other hand, Clinton also proposes a lot of tax changes and other policies that would raise revenue or save money.\n\nThese include imposing a surtax on personal income over $5 million; raising rates on medium-term capital gains; limiting the value of tax breaks; changing the immigration system; taxing carried interest as ordinary income; raising the estate tax rate; imposing a risk fee on large financial institutions; and some vague, as-yet-unspecified changes to the corporate tax code.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line for the nation\u2019s bottom line: Clinton\u2019s spending increases and other proposals that cost money have a total price tag of about $1.8 trillion over the next decade. But her offsets, which come mostly from tax hikes, would save an estimated $1.9 trillion over that same period (or closer to $1.6 trillion if you don\u2019t count those as-yet-unspecified business tax proposals).\n\nThe net fiscal impact of her plans, then, is pretty close to zero.\n\nTo be clear, she\u2019s not likely to reduce the federal debt. That presumably would be a more attractive outcome for the strictest of fiscal conservatives \u2014 including the number-crunchers at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, who based their estimates partly on existing analyses from the Congressional Budget Office, Tax Policy Center and other outside research groups.\n\n\u201cWhile Secretary Clinton would not worsen the fiscal situation, she also unfortunately does not offer concrete proposals for improving it,\u201d laments the organization\u2019s report. \u201cWith debt at post-war record-high levels and projected to grow unsustainably, simply remaining on our current course is not enough,\u201d it adds.\n\nStill, contrast Clinton\u2019s plan with those offered by, oh, every other presidential candidate in the race, all of whom would blow multitrillion-dollar holes in the budget.\n\nBernie Sanders proposes to expand the reach of the federal government far more than Clinton would, and he promises to offset his spending increases with commensurate tax hikes. Many of the underlying assumptions his campaign used to get these numbers to add up, however, are way too optimistic.\n\nAn earlier Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis estimated that the net budget shortfall resulting from all of Sanders\u2019s proposals would add somewhere between $2 trillion and $14.8 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade, depending on how quickly you assume health-care costs will rise.\n\nOn the Republican side \u2014 the party allegedly devoted to fiscal responsibility \u2014 things look just as bad. The GOP candidates all offer massive, across-the-board tax cuts that they don\u2019t even attempt to pay for.\n\nDonald Trump would cut tax revenue dramatically, while simultaneously raising spending on programs such as veterans\u2019 health care. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ballparks the total cost of his proposals at $11.7 trillion to $15.1 trillion over the next decade, again depending on what underlying assumptions you make.\n\nLikewise, Ted Cruz\u2019s various proposals \u2014 which include tax cuts, a repeal of Obamacare and a bigger military \u2014 would add between $2.7 trillion and $21.3 trillion to the federal debt.\n\nJohn Kasich, who somehow fancies himself the lone fiscal grown-up in the race, remains the only candidate who has released so few details that none of the major budgetary watchdog organizations has even attempted to score his policies. Given that his tax plan looks a lot like Jeb Bush\u2019s, however, we can assume he\u2019d add trillions in red ink, too.\n\nWithout fail, these candidates claim that ludicrous levels of economic growth will paper over their budgetary shortfalls. As I\u2019ve observed before, though, the more growth a politician promises, the worse their economic plan tends to be.\n\nMaybe when (if) voters start to notice this, Clinton will finally receive the praise she\u2019s been due, from arithmetic fans and fiscal conservatives alike.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At the end of the day, the net fiscal impact of her plans is close to zero.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/crampell", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "At the end of the day, the net fiscal impact of her plans is close to zero.", "title": "Actually, Hillary Clinton is a fiscal conservative \u2014 look it up", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clinton-is-a-fiscal-conservative--look-it-up/2016/05/02/62350526-109f-11e6-8967-7ac733c56f12_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/05/02/Editorial-Opinion/Images/hrc41459220051.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@crampell"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clinton-is-a-fiscal-conservative--look-it-up/2016/05/02/62350526-109f-11e6-8967-7ac733c56f12_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "catherine rampell, hillary clinton, fiscal conservative, tax plan, budget plan, gop, presidential election, bernie sanders, donald trump, ted cruz", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/crampell"}, "eomportal-uuid": "62350526-109f-11e6-8967-7ac733c56f12", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "catherine rampell, hillary clinton, fiscal conservative, tax plan, budget plan, gop, presidential election, bernie sanders, donald trump, ted cruz"}, "article_summary": "According to a new report from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the most fiscally conservative presidential contender left standing is .\nTo be clear, she\u2019s not likely to reduce the federal debt.\nYou\u2019re probably used to thinking of Clinton as just another spendthrift liberal, oblivious to fiscal restraint.\nMaybe when (if) voters start to notice this, Clinton will finally receive the praise she\u2019s been due, from arithmetic fans and fiscal conservatives alike.\nDemocratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton spoke with Kentucky workers at a campaign event on May 2, saying the coal industry needs government assistance."}
