The pro-life community opposed Obamacare because it includes abortion funding with tax dollars, the HHS mandate forcing employers to cover abortion-causing drugs, and concerns about rationing health care.\n\nCongressman Steve Kin, an Iowa Republican, filed the bill to repeal the controversial law.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the 2014 mid-term elections it has become clear that the American people overwhelmingly reject the President\u2019s failed healthcare law,\u201d said King. \u201cThe botched implementation of ObamaCare has been nothing short of a complete failure when millions of people had their health insurance plans cancelled because their grandfathered plans were in violation of ObamaCare\u2019s \u2018essential health benefits.\u2019 For several years now, conservatives in Congress have warned the American people of the damage this law has done to our personal health insurance. Unfortunately, our warnings have come true. ObamaCare was, is, and will always be dreadful public policy.\n\nKing continued: \u201cEvery Republican who was elected to Congress during the 2014 mid-term vowed to oppose ObamaCare during their respective campaigns. Now that Republicans have control of both the House and the Senate we must take swift action to keep pressure on the White House by repealing this unconstitutional and egregious law. My bill is the answer: full 100% repeal of ObamaCare \u2018as if such Act had not been enacted\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhen he signed the Obamacare bill into law, President Barack Obama promised the American people that Obamacare would not pay for abortions \u2014 going as far as signing an executive order to that effect. But a GAO report shows he misled Americans.\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nThe GAO report also found that nearly all of the insurance issuers sampled are not itemizing the required separate abortion surcharge on its bills \u2013 confirming that the Obama Administration is ignoring the law\u2019s abortion accounting gimmick.\n\n\u201cIn an 11th hour ploy to garner a remnant of pro-life congressional Democrats absolutely needed for passage of ObamaCare, the President issued an executive order on March 24, 2010 that said: \u2018the Act maintains current Hyde Amendment restrictions governing abortion policy and extends those restrictions to newly created health insurance exchanges\u2019,\u201d said Congressman Chris Smith, co-chairman of the Bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus. \u201cIt turns out that those ironclad promises made by the President himself are absolutely untrue.\u201d\n\nBelow is a list of original co-sponsors:\n\nRep.
