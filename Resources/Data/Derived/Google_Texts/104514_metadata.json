In fact, according to testimony supplied to the House Ways and Means subcommittee on Health and Oversight, the 2015 tax season has the potential to be \u201cone of the most chaotic in years.\u201d This according to the Tax Policy Director for Americans for Tax Reform, Ryan Ellis, who is also an Internal Revenue Enrolled tax agent.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is fraught with hidden and additional taxes that are sure to surprise many but a main issue concerns the \u201cadvanceable tax credits\u201d that have assisted people in their purchase of healthcare via the Obamacare exchanges. These credits, or subsidies have been issued based upon the applicant\u2019s estimate of what they believe their income will be \u2013 income that has not yet been verified by the Internal Revenue Service. They then receive an estimated subsidy to apply to their health insurance premiums. This subsidy is allotted in advance to the health insurance company by the IRS.\n\nThe shock value in this policy lies in the possible, if not probable miscalculation of income that could result in families and individuals having to pay back a portion of, or perhaps their entire received subsidy to the IRS. The health insurance companies are not required to refund the money disbursed to them, taxpayers whose income exceeded their estimates thus disqualifying them for the subsidy, are fully on the hook.\n\nThe IRS is actively seeking income verification but, according to Americans for Tax Reform, a daunting \u201c1.2 million of the 6 million federal exchange applicants\u201d need to have their income verified. Further, the process involves a \u201cconfusing twelve-page application\u201d almost as complicated as the notoriously confusing IRS tax forms Americans and their accountants attempt to wrangle into submission every tax season. Thus, income verification has slowed to a crawl.\n\nAmericans who have followed the mandate of Obamacare and signed up for health insurance via one of the healthcare exchanges but miscalculated their subsidy may be in for a shock. Even a relatively minor increase in annual income could cause them to be ineligible for the subsidy and liable to the IRS. As Dan Cook of Benefits Pro wrote, \u201cFirst you save money on insurance, then you pay it back.\u201d Cook called this \u201canother puzzling anomaly\u201d of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAmericans for Tax Reform hypothesizes that a taxpayer who estimated their annual income at $30,000 might receive a $2,000 tax subsidy towards health insurance. However, if via bonuses, extra work, a second job or some other means of income production the taxpayer makes $40,000 they now only qualify for a $1,500 subsidy and owe the IRS $500.\n\nAccording to Scott Gottlieb of Forbes, families and individuals whose annual income is close to the set thresholds for subsidy qualification are at the most risk. Gottlieb gives the example of family of four with an income of $90,000 that qualifies for a $3,700 subsidy to apply to their Obamacare insurance premiums. If that annual income increased to $96,000, they would no longer qualify for a subsidy and, as the money was already \u201cspent\u201d on health insurance, they will owe the $3,700 to the IRS.\n\nIncluded in the testimony before the House Ways and Means subcommittee on Health and Oversight was the statement that it is \u201cinevitable that many people are receiving tax credits for which they are completely ineligible.\u201d Relying on the self-reporting of consumers until 2015 when stronger income verification methods will be in place seems to be a serious flaw, in a series of flaws, in the rollout of Obamacare. Those in need of insurance but short on funds, will likely underestimate their annual incomes only to be faced with a financial burden in the 2015 tax season that might come as a serious shock to their budget.\n\nBy Alana Marie Burke\n\nSources:\n\nAmericans for Tax Reform\n\nForbes\n\nBenefits Pro\n\nTax News\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "Americans who have applied for and received Obamacare health insurance subsidies might be in for a big shock in 2015 when they get their tax bill.
