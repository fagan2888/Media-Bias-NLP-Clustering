About 3,000 to 5,000 people attend the event each year, said Sarah Troia of the Dundee Day Committee.\n\nThe celebration, which organizers estimated began in the 1960s, also featured a parade, live music, yoga in Memorial Park and 68 vendors, including Chad Lebo, owner of Cure Cooking and founder of the Omaha Bacon Club. Lebo served up samples of fermented pickles, sausage and bacon to hungry runners who had participated in the Rundee 5K.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to support events that really develop that sense of neighborhood,\u201d Lebo said. He added that Dundee residents seem to care about high quality food and where it comes from.\n\nOther vendors included Honey Creek Creamery, the Dundee Community Garden, Benson Soap Mill and Live Well Omaha, which provided free bike helmets for kids, a bike rodeo and free bike tune-ups in partnership with Dundee Presbyterian Church.\n\n\u201cOmaha\u2019s bike community is really growing, and the more we\u2019re at events like this, the more we have a chance to grow,\u201d said A.J. Moellenbeck, a volunteer.\n\nLiem Doan\u2019s 3-year-old daughter, Jayden, was able to score a new bike helmet to go with her tiger face paint. Doan said he and his wife live in west Omaha but grew up in a small town. Dundee Day reminds them of similar events they attended as kids.\n\n\u201cI want her to experience that culture,\u201d Doan said.\n\nMolly Romero, a Dundee resident of 37 years and co-owner of Marks Bistro, has been there to see the event grow. She said it all started as a way for neighborhood merchants to thank residents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chance for people to contribute, furthering the sense of community. Communities are the strength of any city,\u201d Romero said.\n\nMeanwhile, in Millard, hundreds lined Millard Avenue for a parade featuring local businesses and schools and then enjoyed a carnival and live music.\n\nLydia Tirrel brought her two toddlers to the parade. The Millard-area family planned to make a day of the celebration with a neighborhood block party, featuring a cookout, yard games and firetruck.\n\n\u201cEverybody brings a side dish. The kids are pretty excited,\u201d Tirrel said.\n\nLesley Dewey, a former Millard resident, drove in from the Elkhorn area for the parade with her 8-year-old daughter, Charley, and 5-year-old son, Graham.\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s a great sense of community,\u201d Dewey said. \u201cWe come every year. The kids love it.\u201d\n\nIt was Matt Williams\u2019 first time with his family at the parade, but he remembers attending when he was a child.\n\nWhile showing his three kids that community is important, Williams said, \u201cIt\u2019s more important for us to spend family time.\u201d\n\nMillard Days will continue today starting at 10 a.m. with a car show, followed by a carnival, tractor pull, face painting and an ice cream social.\n\nContact the writer: 402-444-1414, paige.yowell@owh.com", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s a chance for people to contribute, furthering the sense of community.
