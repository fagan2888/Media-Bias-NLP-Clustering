Did you get a sufficient amount of high-quality shut-eye?\n\nNewly published research suggests that if you believe you did, you\u2019re more likely to perform well at certain challenging tasks. It isn\u2019t the actual amount of sleep that matters, but rather your conviction that you got the rest you needed.\n\nThat\u2019s the conclusion of Colorado College psychologists Christina Draganich and Kristi Erdal. Writing in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, they provide further evidence of the remarkable strength of the placebo effect.\n\nThey describe two experiments in which they manipulated participants\u2019 perceptions regarding the quality of their sleep. In the first, the participants\u201450 undergraduates\u2014began by estimating (on a scale of one to 10) how deeply they had slept the night before.\n\nThey were then hooked up to a machine that supposedly uses certain biomarkers to determine how much REM sleep they had received. In fact, no such machine exists: The only thing that was measured was their brain activity.\n\nThe students were informed that people who spend one-quarter of their slumber in REM sleep tend to do well on learning and memory tests, while those who spend less than 20 percent of the time in that state tend to do worse. They were then presented with their (completely fictional) reading of either 16.2 or 28.7 percent REM sleep.\n\nAfterward, each took the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, a tricky assignment that is \u201cperceived as difficult and stressful,\u201d the researchers write.\n\nThe results: \u201cWhen participants were informed that they had experienced below-average sleep quality the night before, they tended to perform worse on the test, regardless of how well they felt they had slept,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cThe observed pattern of cognitive functioning is consistent with what one might observe if participants had actually experienced a poor night\u2019s sleep.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research suggests we perform better on cognitive tests if we\u2019re told we had a good night\u2019s sleep", "title": "The placebo effect even works for sleep", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New research suggests we perform better on cognitive tests if we\u2019re told we had a good night\u2019s sleep", "title": "The placebo effect even works for sleep", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/09/the_placebo_effect_even_works_for_sleep_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/shutterstock_173463638.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New research suggests we perform better on cognitive tests if we\u2019re told we had a good night\u2019s sleep", "title": "The placebo effect even works for sleep", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/shutterstock_173463638.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tom Jacobs", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, Pacific Standard, Placebo, placebo effect, Sleep, sleeping", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, Pacific Standard, Placebo, placebo effect, Sleep, sleeping, Life NewsThis piece originally appeared on Pacific Standard.\nThey were then hooked up to a machine that supposedly uses certain biomarkers to determine how much REM sleep they had received.\nThey were then presented with their (completely fictional) reading of either 16.2 or 28.7 percent REM sleep.\nWriting in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, they provide further evidence of the remarkable strength of the placebo effect.\n\u201cThe observed pattern of cognitive functioning is consistent with what one might observe if participants had actually experienced a poor night\u2019s sleep.\u201d"}
