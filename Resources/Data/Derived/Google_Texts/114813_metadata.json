The stock of the little-known developer of a liver treatment that has yet to hit the market shot up to nearly $500 a share late last week after the company halted testing on the drug early because it already had met trial goals.\n\nBloomberg Surgeons using Intuitive Surgical\u2019s da Vinci robotic system\n\nBut warnings from the National Institutes of Health over the weekend said that those who used the drug, known as obeticholic acid, experienced \u201cdisproportionate lipid abnormalities.\u201d That sent Intercept shares into a free fall Monday, which continued into Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, a stock that knows a thing or two about dizzying heights, Intuitive Surgical /quotes/zigman/90651/delayed /quotes/nls/isrg ISRG , was up more than 10% to $433.96 after the company said its full-year sales should come in better than expected.\n\nQuestions that came up throughout the year about the viability of Intuitive\u2019s robotic surgery systems, coupled with dropping sales and earnings, left investors thinking that 2013 would be a disastrous year. Sales expectations had been lowered throughout 2013, shares plunged to below $360 after touching the $580 level and the last revenue estimate from FactSet came in at $2.24 billion.\n\nBut Intuitive said it expected full-year sales of $2.26 billion, unexpected since fourth-quarter sales of its da Vinci surgical systems fell 23% during the fourth quarter and 11% for the year. Yet procedures calling for use of da Vincis climbed 16% to 523,000, thus increasing the company\u2019s service revenue. Intuitive also saw an increase in sales for instruments and accessories that helped offset the downturn in da Vinci sales.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nFederal Obamacare enrollment exceeds that of states\n\nMcKesson shares fall as Celesio buyout plan crumbles\n\nMerck shares hit 52-week high on drug plan hopes", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-01-14T10:51:04-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Intercept Pharmaceuticals continues to careen down after a dizzying skyward ride while Intuitive Surgical Inc. catches the lift up on better-than-expected sales numbers.", "title": "Intercept, Intuitive take diverging paths on the market roller coaster", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/14/intercept-intuitive-take-diverging-paths-on-the-market-roller-coaster/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS495_intuit_MG_20140114102056.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc.,Intuitive Surgical Inc.,liver treatment,robotic surgery", "article.headline": "Intercept, Intuitive take diverging paths on the market roller coaster", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc.,Intuitive Surgical Inc.,liver treatment,robotic surgery", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "Intercept Pharmaceuticals continues to careen down after a dizzying skyward ride while Intuitive Surgical Inc. catches the lift up on better-than-expected sales numbers.", "article.published": "2014-01-14T10:51:04-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/14/intercept-intuitive-take-diverging-paths-on-the-market-roller-coaster/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Intercept Pharmaceuticals continues to careen down after a dizzying skyward ride while Intuitive Surgical Inc. catches the lift up on better-than-expected sales numbers.", "title": "Intercept, Intuitive take diverging paths on the market roller coaster", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/14/intercept-intuitive-take-diverging-paths-on-the-market-roller-coaster/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS495_intuit_MG_20140114102056.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1848", "article.updated": "2014-01-14T10:51:04-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd30ab\"", "article_summary": "Intuitive also saw an increase in sales for instruments and accessories that helped offset the downturn in da Vinci sales.\nTwo health-care stocks took divergent paths in early trading Tuesday with Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc. continuing to careen down after a dizzying skyward ride, and Intuitive Surgical Inc. catching the lift up on better-than-expected sales numbers.\nBut Intuitive said it expected full-year sales of $2.26 billion, unexpected since fourth-quarter sales of its da Vinci surgical systems fell 23% during the fourth quarter and 11% for the year.\nIntercept /quotes/zigman/12230574/delayed /quotes/nls/icpt ICPT plunged another 16% in recent action to $307.44, a loss of $56.92 per share.\nYet procedures calling for use of da Vincis climbed 16% to 523,000, thus increasing the company\u2019s service revenue."}
