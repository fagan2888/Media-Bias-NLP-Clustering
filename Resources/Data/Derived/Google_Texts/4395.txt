SPRINGIFELD, Mass. (WWLP) – Baystate Health is one step closer to acquiring Noble Hospital in Westfield.

Baystate Health spokesman Ben Craft told 22News that the Massachusetts Public Health Council gave unanimous approval to their proposal for Noble Hospital to become part of the Health System on Wednesday.

“We hope to finalize the process of Noble joining Baystate Health in the next several weeks,” Craft said.

22News first reported details of the merger in March. At the time, Noble’s Chief Executive Ron Bryant told 22News the merger makes sense for the 97 bed hospital.

“Medicare each year gets less and less. It’s tougher and tougher to maintain the amount of revenue from the year before. We all know the state has budgeting problems each year,” Bryant said.

Baystate Health systems is already affiliated with Wing Memorial in Palmer, Franklin Medical Center in Greenfield and Mary Lane Hospital in Ware.
