The interview with Harvey is seen as a \u201csoftball\u201d interview with a friendly audience now that the media has declared Obama\u2019s second term practically over as his approval ratings struggle.\n\nPerhaps if those same beltway media types didn\u2019t write trivial columns about \u201cselfies\u201d the president would take them more seriously.\n\nSteve Harvey isn\u2019t really that unusual a choice for an interview. Maybe the beltway was too distracted by the health care website nonsense to realize that the date is creeping closer to the first deadline for healthcare reform. Blacks and Latinos have the highest rate of uninsured. The president taking the time to talk to his base of supporters, while at the same time reminding the folks who need healthcare the most, that they can sign up on a now-functional website and get coverage starting in a few weeks. And yes, talking about family and the holidays can\u2019t hurt either.\n\nBut that\u2019s never the way the beltway likes to analyze issues. President Obama\u2019s approval ratings go down. His presidency is over, until it isn\u2019t. The web site isn\u2019t working and Obamacare is a irreparable disaster, until it isn\u2019t. One of the characteristics of covering President Obama is that he\u2019s boring. His approval ratings overall have remained pretty consistent with a big dip in recent months after the government shutdown and the website glitches.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like previous presidents didn\u2019t do a friendly interview from time to time. President Bush did his share of softball interviews during his two terms as president. And it\u2019s also not like the serious beltway media doesn\u2019t also dabble in their share of softball or irrelevant questions from time to time. At a press briefing to announce gun safety legislation, the white house reporters failed to ask a single question about guns, instead only asked about the coming fiscal cliff.\n\nThe president should and will do hard-hitting interviews before the end of his second term. What is beneficial to him and people of color who make up Steve Harvey\u2019s audience is an interview with the president being a human being and reminding them to sign up for Obamacare. Sometimes an interview that humanizes the always under the microscope president is important. Every interview doesn\u2019t need to be Walter Cronkite.\n\nBut let\u2019s say President Obama gets his interview mojo back and decides to take on a \u201chard-hitting\u201d interview. Perhaps the media can ask him to expand his remarks about income inequality being the \u201cdefining challenge of our time.\u201d Americans really need to hear from the president on the latest NSA revelations where a federal judge called the collection of domestic phone records \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Americans definitely need to hear more from the president about the nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nAnd that interview will happen, but an interview that allows the president to speak directly to his community is important, too.\n\n(Follow Zerlina Maxwell on Twitter at @ZerlinaMaxwell.)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://newpittsburghcourieronline.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b4f60bd35762d37aa07531f20b161b08?s=16", "sailthru.author": "Zerlina Maxwell/theGrio", "description": "If you start with the premise that there is nothing President Obama can do to make the White House Press Corps happy, then it makes sense that an interview with comedian and talk show host Steve Harvey would cause controversy in the beltway.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=", "og": {"site_name": "New Pittsburgh Courier", "description": "If you start with the premise that there is nothing President Obama can do to make the White House Press Corps happy, then it makes sense that an interview with comedian and talk show host Steve Ha\u2026", "title": "Why President Obama was right to sit down with Steve Harvey", "url": "http://newpittsburghcourieronline.com/2013/12/17/why-president-obama-was-right-to-sit-down-with-steve-harvey/", "image": "http://ionenewpittsburghcourier.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/zerlina2d92357e10.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://ionenewpittsburghcourier.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/harvey_600.jpg?w=240", "site": "@NewPghCourier", "card": "summary", "creator": "@NewPghCourier"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-17 14:21:04", "sailthru.title": "Why President Obama was right to sit down with Steve\u00a0Harvey", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=, affiliate-data=, app-argument=", "fb": {"app_id": 788648951164276}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.tags": "Barack Obama, Harvey, Obama, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, President Obama, Steve Harvey, Twitter, Walter Cronkite, White House, White House Press Corps", "application-name": "New Pittsburgh Courier", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2013-12-17T19:21:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-17T19:21:04+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "30473C9E51B1FA7645F80C5736971CF1", "google-site-verification": "zagCC3pZZptPIt1ItBXcBVa1JWrKTE4mQx7HRuT2vNk", "sailthru.description": "Steve Harvey sits down for a one-on-one interview with President Obama.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc958b\"", "article_summary": "But let\u2019s say President Obama gets his interview mojo back and decides to take on a \u201chard-hitting\u201d interview.\nOne of the characteristics of covering President Obama is that he\u2019s boring.\nPerhaps if those same beltway media types didn\u2019t write trivial columns about \u201cselfies\u201d the president would take them more seriously.\nAnd that interview will happen, but an interview that allows the president to speak directly to his community is important, too.\nPresident Bush did his share of softball interviews during his two terms as president."}
