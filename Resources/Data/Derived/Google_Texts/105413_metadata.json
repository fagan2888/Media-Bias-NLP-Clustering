Mencken warned about such problems when he wrote for the Baltimore Evening Sun in 1920, \u201cAs democracy is perfected, \u2026 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart\u2019s desire at last and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama is not a moron, but evidence mounts from several compass points that he is not up to the task of running the country.\n\nFor starters, Obama has never run anything in his life. The closest he came was conducting local voter registration campaigns for Project Vote, which included ACORN, according to The Wall Street Journal. He\u2019s never managed or run an organization, even a small one. This man offers a thin resume, with near-zero experience in practical leadership abilities or big-picture wisdom. Obama doesn\u2019t have a clue how to run the most powerful organization in history, a monster with an all-powerful military and stupendous bureaucracy.\n\nIn the 19th century, the men who were successful in the White House were mostly military men who thought strategically and knew how to run complex operations. In the past century, the better presidents were most often former governors with experience as state chief executives.\n\nMore worrisome in Obama\u2019s case is that the man has no experience or skills in hiring managers or executives to run things for him. Such shortcomings are starkly evident in the people he has appointed or hired.\n\nObama joins mega-singing star to surprise troops in Afghanistan; some call it damage control\n\nIt would be comforting to find among Obama\u2019s czars and department heads anyone with executive skills from the private sector, or people with business experience running complex organizations. Search hard, but what you\u2019ll find are mostly political types and people from government or academia who believe in wishy-washy sanctions against America\u2019s geo-enemies and who develop government programs that fail or are ineffective.\n\nIn fact, Obama is in last place among the past 19 U.S. presidents in terms of the percentage of major appointees with prior private-sector experience.\n\nDebacles abound, including:\n\nThe Obamacare rollout, which became a calamity because Obama managed it like a rookie, not a seasoned executive;\n\nThe Benghazi tragedy, another example of a bungled operation, with deadly consequences;\n\nAn IRS scandal that targeted conservative groups. An oblivious Obama said he learned about it from news reports. Apparently, the commander in chief was the bystander in chief;\n\nThe National Security Agency scandal, when an aloof and insulated president again said he knew nothing about the revelations that the agency was spying on both Americans and foreign leaders. There appears to be no managerial chain of command in the Obama administration;\n\nObama\u2019s Cash-for-Clunkers program, which slaughtered the used-car market and cost taxpayers millions. Or the $800 billion stimulus package for shovel-ready projects that Obama said he had but didn\u2019t;\n\nFailed financial due diligence on companies like Solyndra, which promptly went bankrupt after receiving taxpayer money;\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s foreign-policy-that-isn\u2019t, such as abandoning the missile defense system in Poland without telling America\u2019s allies;\n\nThe failed projects of Obama\u2019s \u201cGreen Energy Policy\u201d and the more recent management failures of the nation\u2019s veteran\u2019s hospitals, resulting in deaths;\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s incompetent Fast & Furious \u201cgun-walking\u201d decision that put 1,400 firearms into the hands of criminals.\n\nIncompetence in a president does not violate the law of the land, and neither does ruling by personal charisma. But as CEO, Obama failed on multiple occasions to implement adequate controls and to monitor the actions of his departments, while imposing no limits on his managers\u2019 behavior. There\u2019s a good argument that the incompetence of Obama and his appointees is directly connected to his failure to recruit managers and executives trained in business decision-making.\n\nInstead, as we now see the full bloom of the imperial presidency, the administration\u2019s level of incompetence is frightening.\n\nWhite House blows it big time; accidentally outs CIA station chief in Kabul", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "One of the very few mistakes the Founding Fathers made in 1777 is failing to include in the U.S. Constitution some protections against electing an incompetent president.
