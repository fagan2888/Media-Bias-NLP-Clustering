Photo: Associated Press\n\nAnthem Inc. ANTM -1.03 % said its enrollment through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges grew more than expected in the first months of the year. The company said it is still targeting a slim positive margin on the business this year, striking a guardedly optimistic tone about the marketplaces amid questions about their sustainability.\n\nThe No. 2 U.S. health insurer said it had 975,000 exchange enrollees at the end of the first quarter, up by around 184,000 since the end of the year. The increase drew sharp questions from analysts after UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH -0.33 % \u2019s recent announcement that it would withdraw from all but a handful of the exchanges after steepening losses.\n\nDuring the company\u2019s call Wednesday to discuss first-quarter earnings\u2014which, on an adjusted basis, beat analysts\u2019 expectations\u2014Anthem Chief Executive Joseph R. Swedish noted that performance on the exchanges \u201chas lagged expectations throughout the industry as some of our peers have recognized.\u201d He said Anthem was being cautious in its projections and its management of pricing and products.\n\nAnthem believes it is \u201cwell-positioned for continued growth in the exchange marketplace if the market stabilizes to a more sustainable level,\u201d Mr. Swedish said, and he called for some changes by regulators to ensure the exchange business would work.\n\nThe company is still targeting a margin on the exchange business for this year that is lower than its ultimate goal of 3% to 5%, saying it likely won\u2019t achieve its 3%-to-5% aim in 2017 either, but sees it as more doable in 2018.\n\nAnthem has said it roughly broke even in 2015 on individual plans\u2014putting it ahead of many insurers that, like UnitedHealth, saw losses on the exchanges. The individual business has traditionally been a more important segment for Anthem than for some of its big national competitors. Analysts have also suggested that as Anthem\u2019s proposed $48 billion acquisition of Cigna Corp. CI -0.33 % remains under federal review, it may have reason to support the exchanges, a central part of the Obama administration\u2019s signature health law. Anthem said it was still looking to close the deal in the second half of this year.\n\nMuch of the boosted exchange enrollment came in states where nonprofit cooperative insurers had folded, including New York, Colorado and Kentucky, the company said. Seeking to reassure investors that it hadn\u2019t drawn enrollees with aggressive pricing, the insurer emphasized that the growth came despite rates that it said were higher than some others in those markets.\n\nAnthem said it now expects overall revenue for the 2016 year in the range of $81 billion to $82 billion, up from its previous forecast for $80 billion to $81 billion. It backed its view of adjusted earnings of greater than $10.80 a share, and Anthem executives emphasized that one reason it kept that number constant was the cautious stance it was taking on exchange-business projections.\n\nMedical enrollment grew 2.8% from a year earlier to about 39.6 million as of March 31. Revenue in the government-business segment jumped 14% to $10.8 million.\n\nAnthem said the growth was driven by enrollment increases in the Medicaid business, as well as national accounts and individual enrollment. Medicaid membership rose 7.6% from the prior-year period to 6.05 million in the quarter. But Anthem saw a dip in small-employer enrollment that it tied to the decision by some states to add larger employers to the \u201csmall group\u201d category under the ACA.\n\nThe insurer posted a profit of $703 million, or $2.63 a share, down from $865.2 million, or $3.09 a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, leaving out costs tied to transactions and investments, among others, earnings rose to $3.46 a share from $3.14. Revenue climbed 6.5% to $20.29 billion.\n\nAnalysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast per-share earnings of $3.32 on revenue of $19.86 billion.\n\nAnthem\u2019s medical-loss ratio\u2014the share of premiums used to pay patient medical costs\u2014was 81.8% in the first quarter, up from 80.2% a year earlier. The climb was largely driven by the extra calendar day in the quarter, a higher ratio in the Medicaid and individual businesses and higher membership in the Medicaid business, which carries a higher benefit expense ratio than the company average.\n\nWrite to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com and Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2016-04-27T10:57:00.000Z", "article.section": "Business", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "Anthem said its enrollment through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges grew more than expected in the first months of the year.", "creator": "@annawmathews", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NS579_0427an_G_20160426113212.jpg", "alt": "Anthem Affordable Care Act enrollments grew more than expected in this year\u2019s early months", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NS579_0427an_D_20160426113212.jpg"}, "title": "Anthem\u2019s Affordable Care Act Enrollments Grew More Than Expected", "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB11223869946966424246404582030143363529900&headline=Anthem%20Affordable%20Care%20Act%20enrollments%20grew%20more%20than%20expected%20in%20this%20year%u2019s%20early%20months&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB11223869946966424246404582030143363529900"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "aca,affordable care act,anthem,anthem earnings,anthem profit,commercial and specialty,enrollment,government business,health insurance,insurance earnings,insurers,medicaid,medical benefit ratio,medical cost,medicare,obamacare,unitedhealth,Anthem,ANTM,UnitedHealth Group,UNH,Swedish%2C%20Joseph%20R.,financial performance,earnings,earnings surprises,earnings projections,corporate,industrial news,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services,health maintenance organizations,private health insurance", "news_keywords": "aca,affordable care act,anthem,anthem earnings,anthem profit,commercial and specialty,enrollment,government business,health insurance,insurance earnings", "article.headline": "Anthem Affordable Care Act enrollments grew more than expected in this year\u2019s early months", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NS579_0427an_E_20160426113212.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NS579_0427an_D_20160426113212.jpg"}}, "description": "Anthem said its enrollment through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges grew more than expected in the first months of the year.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB11223869946966424246404582030143363529900&headline=Anthem%20Affordable%20Care%20Act%20enrollments%20grew%20more%20than%20expected%20in%20this%20year%u2019s%20early%20months&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB11223869946966424246404582030143363529900", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "article.page": "Health Care", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.summary": "Anthem said its enrollment through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges grew more than expected in the first months of the year.", "page.site": "wsj", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2016-04-27T16:49:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-c647", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"internal_link_count": 4, "image_count": 1, "word_count": 701, "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Anthem said its enrollment through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges grew more than expected in the first months of the year.", "title": "Anthem\u2019s Affordable Care Act Enrollments Grew More Than Expected", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/anthem-earnings-top-expectations-1461754635", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NS579_0427an_G_20160426113212.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Anna Wilde Mathews and Anne Steele", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "Anthem Earnings Top Expectations", "article.type": "Health", "article.id": "SB11223869946966424246404582030143363529900", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-04-27T16:49:00.000Z"}, "article_summary": "Photo: Associated PressAnthem Inc.
