The purpose of the article was to bring a new and personal perspective to an ongoing debate about racial profiling that had grown particularly pitched at the time.\n\nThis article is a preface to that story, which I hope will serve a similar purpose, but with respect to a completely different debate.\n\nRight now, a number of conservative groups, with financial backing from well-heeled fellow travelers like Charles and David Koch, are engaged in a campaign to convince young, uninsured people not to enroll in Obamacare \u2014 to remain uninsured rather than enter and strengthen the state-based health insurance markets the Affordable Care Act is building.\n\nYoung people are typically healthy. On average, they incur very low medical costs each year. In any social insurance system, most of them will end up paying in more than they get out during their early years, because most people make it through youth without contracting a major illness or befalling terrible accidents. Yes, they get healthcare coverage, and the peace of mind that comes with it. They also enter a social contract that promises to provide them affordable coverage when they\u2019re older and no longer healthy, as a form of back payment for cross-subsidizing today\u2019s aged and ill. But in the near term, and in the narrowest, most pecuniary sense, a system like Obamacare won\u2019t necessarily seem like a great deal.\n\nAdults will make their own decisions. My story underscores the moral failings of the people attempting to persuade strangers to assume a risk like uninsurance for the sake of their own dubious principles.\n\nIf you read my original article, you already know I was shot three times in the early morning hours of July 2, 2008. What you didn\u2019t know is that I\u2019d put my first insurance check in the mail on the evening of July 1, 2008.\n\nBack in 2008, I was pretty new to journalism. I had a decent job, and crucially the first one I\u2019d been offered since I\u2019d graduated college that agreed to pay part of my insurance premiums. But I was working on a contract. I wasn\u2019t on a group plan. On top of my monthly salary, my employers would send me extra money to pay my monthly premiums.\n\nI know from that, and from previous experiences, how frustrating the existing individual insurance market can be. Even a highly regulated one like Washington, D.C.\u2019s. Before that job, I\u2019d been insured in D.C.\u2019s market once before, with a really lousy high deductible plan. Like most young people I rarely needed it, but when I did, it didn\u2019t seem to cover much, and appealing charges was a significantly less rewarding experience than getting cable installed or fighting traffic tickets in court.\n\nWhen I got that job, I tried enrolling in a new plan, but for some reason \u2014 perhaps because I hadn\u2019t kept continuous coverage \u2014 I was rejected. Over my father\u2019s pleading, I allowed these frustrations to deter me from applying for a different plan. I pocketed the supplemental check each month for several months before his persistence wore me out and I fired up ehealthinsurance.com. Fortunately, D.C. required one of the major insurers operating in the area to offer a guaranteed issue plan, which meant they couldn\u2019t reject my application. It also meant that I\u2019d only be eligible for, or be able to afford, a high deductible plan once again. A few weeks after applying, Blue Cross sent me my plastic insurance cards and my first bill. I don\u2019t recall what day that bill was due, but I do recall that I was an enormously irresponsible young adult and an inveterate procrastinator, so I\u2019m quite confident that I held on to that bill for a while.\n\nOn July 1 \u2014 I must\u2019ve just received my paycheck \u2014 I bussed up to Cleveland Park, a quiet neighborhood in Northwest D.C., to meet my sister and brother-in-law for a celebratory dinner. They had just moved back to Washington after many years, and this was the first time she and I would be living in the same city. I met them at their new condo, with an envelope in my back pocket, we walked south down Connecticut Ave toward the restaurant, but before we reached our destination, I dropped the envelope into a corner mailbox.\n\nSix hours later two EMTs wheeled me into a trauma center.\n\nMy medical bills totaled about $200,000, mostly attributable to major surgery and a 10-day hospital stay. My deductible more than cleared out my bank account, but in the end, my insurer paid almost every other penny, and saved me from bankruptcy or a lifetime of debt. For $200,000 you can buy an Ivy League education, a home, a law degree, a secure retirement or a splenectomy. But there\u2019s no equity, dividend or residual value in a splenectomy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How a health insurance check sent 6 hours before being shot saved my life.
