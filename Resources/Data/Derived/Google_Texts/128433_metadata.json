Sam Brownback and Republican legislative leaders to drop their opposition to expanding KanCare, the state\u2019s privatized Medicaid program.\n\n\u201cKansas\u2019 failure to expand its KanCare program has resulted in almost $14 million in annual lost revenue to Via Christi \u2014 nearly $28 million over the past two years,\u201d Korsmo said in a statement. \u201cThis failure already has contributed to the pending closure of a hospital in Independence, Kansas, and has put many other health organizations in a precarious financial position.\u201d\n\nPhoto by Jim McLean Jeff Korsmo, CEO of Wichita-based Via Christi Health, spoke in support of Medicaid expansion in January before a legislative committee.\n\n\n\nView larger photo\n\nThe Via Christi system includes four hospitals and a behavioral health center in Wichita as well as hospitals in Manhattan, Pittsburg and Wamego.\n\nKorsmo said the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act was intended to help offset planned reductions in Medicare reimbursements. The state\u2019s rejection of expansion has denied hospitals access to those offsetting revenues, he said.\n\n\u201cOur financial pressures have been intensified because of the refusal of Gov. Sam Brownback and the Kansas State Legislature to approve expanding the KanCare Medicaid insurance program for the poor and vulnerable,\u201d Korsmo said, adding that two months into the fiscal year Via Christi\u2019s income is $3.3 million below budget projections.\n\nKorsmo said Via Christi would take several steps to manage costs, including focusing on hiring critical clinical staff, moving employees in low-volume areas to other positions that serve more patients, reducing the number of management positions and halting discretionary spending for travel, education and meetings.\n\nVia Christi has reduced its full-time employee count by more than 110 in the last year and a half, Korsmo said.\n\n\u201cWhile difficult, these cost-reductions are necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cFinancial challenges in health care are intensifying, so we must constantly be focused on controlling costs while also seeking opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nWithout expansion, Kansas hospitals stand to lose approximately $132 million in 2016 because of reimbursement reductions in Medicare and other federal programs, according to the Kansas Hospital Association.\n\nExpanding KanCare would not only offset those reductions, it would generate a net gain of nearly $100 million.\n\n\u201cOur financial pressures have been intensified because of the refusal of Gov. Sam Brownback and the Kansas State Legislature to approve expanding the KanCare Medicaid insurance program for the poor and vulnerable.\u201d - Jeff Korsmo, CEO of Wichita-based Via Christi Health\n\nA coalition of hospitals and other expansion advocates has failed to gain traction on the issue in the Legislature. The House Health and Human Services Committee conducted a hearing on an expansion bill backed by KHA during the 2015 session but didn\u2019t vote on the proposal.\n\nBrownback reiterated his opposition to expansion in a recent speech to students at Hutchinson Community College.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have the resources to get it done,\u201d he said, according to the Wichita Eagle.\n\nAt a Wednesday news conference, Brownback said the lack of expansion revenue was one of several factors that led to the closure of Mercy Hospital in Independence.\n\n\"I think there's a real question whether or not even if you had an expansion of Medicaid what that would have done in the financial picture,\" Brownback said, adding that repealing \"Obamacare\" would allow hospitals to \"get their Medicare payments back.\"\n\nPreviously, the governor has indicated a willingness to consider expansion but only if the plan is budget neutral and requires recipients to work or actively seek employment. Most of the 140,000 to 170,000 Kansans who would become eligible for coverage under expansion already work.\n\nIn addition, Brownback has said, KanCare services must be extended to Kansans with disabilities now on waiting lists before providing health coverage to more low-income but able-bodied adults.\n\nDespite the governor's continuing opposition, there are indications that the closure of the Independence hospital and the financial struggles of others have prompted some Republican leaders to reconsider the issue.\n\nSenate Vice President Jeff King, a Republican from Independence, now says he\u2019s willing to consider the kind of conservative, private-sector approach to expansion that some other red states are taking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to expand Medicaid just copying the Affordable Care Act, but want to take the model that we\u2019ve seen in Arkansas, seen in Indiana, that Pennsylvania attempted, to have a Kansas-based Medicaid program that expands to meet the needs of those it currently isn\u2019t covering,\u201d King said.\n\nArkansas used federal Medicaid money to purchase private coverage for more than 200,000 low-income residents. Indiana\u2019s expansion plan required some participants to contribute to health savings accounts.\n\nA coalition of expansion advocates is planning to focus on these \u201cred state plans\u201d at an \u201ceducational meeting\u201d for Kansas policymakers scheduled Nov. 3 at the Kansas Leadership Center in Wichita.\n\nIn addition to KHA and Via Christi, the coalition includes Wichita\u2019s Wesley Medical Center, the University of Kansas Hospital, the Kansas City-based St Luke\u2019s Health System and the Kansas Health Foundation.\n\nThe health foundation is the primary funder of the Kansas Health Institute, the parent organization of the editorially independent KHI News Service.\n\nThe hospital association has done several studies that show KanCare could be expanded at no additional cost to the state.\n\nThe ACA requires the federal government to pay 100 percent of Medicaid expansion costs through 2016. After that, its share of cost goes down incrementally until it reaches a floor of 90 percent, with states paying the remainder.\n\nKanCare now covers about 425,000 low-income children and families and disabled and low-income elderly adults. But that number includes relatively few non-disabled adults. Adults with dependent children are eligible for KanCare coverage only if they have incomes below 33 percent of the federal poverty level, annually $7,870 for a family of four.\n\nNon-disabled adults without children aren\u2019t eligible for KanCare regardless of income. Expansion would expand KanCare coverage to non-disabled, childless adults with incomes up to 138 percent of poverty: annually $16,105 for an individual and $32,913 for a family of four.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was updated at 4:10 p.m. Sept. 23.\n\nThe nonprofit KHI News Service is an editorially independent initiative of the Kansas Health Institute and a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor reporting collaboration.
