And this breaks a long tradition of important Latino figures, that have taken in their own hands, the responsibility of defending undocumented immigrants. \u2026 I still can\u2019t believe, how come Marco Rubio, who\u2019s the son of immigrants, both his parents were born in Cuba, or Ted Cruz, whose father, Rafael Cruz, was born in Cuba, how come they are not defending other immigrants like their parents? I really can\u2019t understand that. I think it is very important to have two Latinos running for the White House, and I think that the Democratic Party has a problem.\u201d\n\nRamos elaborated on his point that there is a lack of diversity in the Democratic Party, criticizing Democrats for not training candidates, and dismissing Democrats pointing to President Obama in response to questions about their party\u2019s lack of diversity as \u201cso 2008.\u201d\n\nHe later said that Rubio, Cruz, \u201cif he does better,\u201d and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush could win enough of the Hispanic vote to win a general election, but that Latino voters will not take a \u201cserious look\u201d at the GOP unless it puts away the issue of immigration, \u201cand they are not willing to do that.\u201d Ramos also said it\u2019s \u201cimpossible\u201d for Trump to win the Hispanic vote.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ramos: Trump Promoting 'Bigotry,' 'Can't Understand' Why Rubio and Cruz Aren't Defending Immigrants", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ramos: Trump Promoting 'Bigotry,' 'Can't Understand' Why Rubio and Cruz Aren't Defending Immigrants", "title": "Ramos: Trump Promoting 'Bigotry,' 'Can't Understand' Why Rubio and Cruz Aren't Defending Immigrants - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Ramos-826-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/11/02/ramos-trump-promoting-bigotry-cant-understand-why-rubio-and-cruz-arent-defending-immigrants/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ramos: Trump Promoting 'Bigotry,' 'Can't Understand' Why Rubio and Cruz Aren't Defending Immigrants", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Ramos-826-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Ramos: Trump Promoting 'Bigotry,' 'Can't Understand' Why Rubio and Cruz Aren't Defending Immigrants - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Jorge Ramos, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Immigration,Ramos", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2015-11-02T14:29:54-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Immigration,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "And this breaks a long tradition of important Latino figures, that have taken in their own hands, the responsibility of defending undocumented immigrants.\n\u2026 I still can\u2019t believe, how come Marco Rubio, who\u2019s the son of immigrants, both his parents were born in Cuba, or Ted Cruz, whose father, Rafael Cruz, was born in Cuba, how come they are not defending other immigrants like their parents?\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERUnivision and Fusion anchor Jorge Ramos stated Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is promoting \u201cbigotry and discrimination through his speeches\u201d and wondered why GOP candidates Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Florida Senator Marco Rubio weren\u2019t \u201cdefending undocumented immigrants\u201d or \u201cdefending other immigrants like their parents\u201d on an episode of \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast released on Monday.\nI really can\u2019t understand that.\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"}
