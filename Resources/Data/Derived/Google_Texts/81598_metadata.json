The wait is over.\n\nA little more than eight months after breaking his right leg during a Team USA scrimmage in Las Vegas, George will make his season debut Sunday night against Miami. Coach Frank Vogel said George will play 10 to 15 minutes, likely in the first and third quarters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like being drafted again and getting thrown back out there again for the first time. It\u2019s that same feel,\u201d said George, who will be wearing his new No. 13 for the first time.\n\nLarry Bird, the president of basketball operations for the Pacers, said Saturday that George had been cleared for game action a while ago, but was kept out because he was still working out with a limp. Before Friday night\u2019s 93-74 victory over Charlotte, George started lobbying harder, but still couldn\u2019t convince the top brass to let him play.\n\nIndiana started Saturday in the No. 10 spot in the East, 1 1/2 games behind Miami for the eighth and final playoff spot.\n\nLess than 24 hours after the victory over the Hornets jump-started the Pacers\u2019 fading playoff hopes, Bird and other team officials decided to put their biggest star back on the court.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to run as smooth as he used to, but over time he\u2019ll get better and better. Just in the last month I\u2019ve seen a major difference,\u201d Bird said. \u201cEverybody thinks Paul George is coming back and that he\u2019s 100 percent, but he\u2019s not 100 percent and he\u2019s in no condition to go out and play a 30-minute game.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s quite a turnaround from Aug. 1, when George ran into a basketball stanchion and broke his leg in two places. He had surgery within hours, and then returned to Indianapolis three days later.\n\nAfter returning to full practices Feb. 26, three days sooner than expected, the biggest question in Indy was whether it would be wise to bring George back. George said he has participated in full contact drills over that time and he is confident he will not re-injure the leg.\n\nNow George will make his grand entrance on the biggest basketball weekend in Indianapolis this season.\n\nJust a few hours after George spoke and a few blocks away from the Pacers\u2019 home court, Bankers Life Fieldhouse, the NCAA\u2019s Final Four was set to tip off. The national championship game will be played there Monday night.\n\nIn between, George will suit up against the team that has eliminated Indiana from the playoffs each of the past three seasons \u2014 including twice in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\n\u201cI probably won\u2019t be able to sleep tonight, but I\u2019m excited,\u201d George said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to get over this hurdle.\u201d\n\nApparently, George faced a bigger hurdle than initially thought.\n\nTeam doctor Tim Hupfer said George had a 14 milimeter-by-420 milimeter titanium rod inserted into the bone and then underwent a second surgery in October, a procedure the team had not previously divulged.\n\n\u201cWe did some things to help increase the stress across the fracture and stimulate some healing,\u201d Hupfer said.\n\nHupfer also said the medical staff will monitor whether George has any pain in the leg but there are no other medical limitations.\n\nStill unclear is how much the Pacers can expect from George.\n\nBefore the injury, the 6-foot-9, 230-pound swingman was one of the league\u2019s bright young stars. His scoring average had improved by at least four points in each of his first four NBA seasons, and he was named the league\u2019s most improved player in 2012-13.\n\nWhile he\u2019s been out, George said he has added about 10 pounds to his body and will be physically stronger when he does get back to 100 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how long that will take.\n\nThe biggest advantage to returning now is George will have a better concept of what he needs to work on during the offseason to complete his recovery, which is one reason he was pushing to make a return sooner rather than later.\n\n\u201cIt was me,\u201d George said when asked who made the final decision. \u201cBut I had to push it through Larry and the whole front office. But it was me telling everybody I was ready. We kind of knew it would be around this time. I just told them I was ready.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A little more than eight months after breaking his right leg during a Team USA scrimmage, George will play 10 to 15 minutes, likely in the first and third quarters, in the Pacers' game Sunday against Miami.", "Author": "Michael Marot", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A little more than eight months after breaking his right leg during a Team USA scrimmage, George will play 10 to 15 minutes, likely in the first and third quarters, in the Pacers\u2019 game Sunday against Miami.", "title": "Paul George to make return from gruesome leg injury in Pacers\u2019 game against Heat", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/5/paul-george-make-return-gruesome-leg-injury-pacers/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/28/heat-pacers-basketballjpeg-0ab32.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/28/heat-pacers-basketballjpeg-0ab32.jpg", "title": "Paul George to make return from gruesome leg injury in Pacers\u2019 g", "description": "A little more than eight months after breaking his right leg during a Team USA scrimmage, George will play 10 to 15 minutes, likely in the first and third quarters, in the Pacers' game Sunday against", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Paul George, Larry Bird, Indianapolis"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde777\"", "article_summary": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Paul George was so excited he took a picture of his game shoes and posted it online.\nGeorge said he has participated in full contact drills over that time and he is confident he will not re-injure the leg.\nCoach Frank Vogel said George will play 10 to 15 minutes, likely in the first and third quarters.\nHupfer also said the medical staff will monitor whether George has any pain in the leg but there are no other medical limitations.\nA little more than eight months after breaking his right leg during a Team USA scrimmage in Las Vegas, George will make his season debut Sunday night against Miami."}
