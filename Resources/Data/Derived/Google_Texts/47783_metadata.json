The place where this comes up most frequently are assistant managers everywhere \u2014 convenience stores, restaurants, small businesses \u2014 most (general managers) in every industry I work with think this is a really big deal.\u201d\n\nThe Labor Department also indicated it would take comments on what professional and administrative duties fall under the exemption. \u201cThere is also a very good chance they will update some of those duties,\u201d she says.\n\nMarshall Stair, a lawyer with Lewis Thomason and Knoxville city councilman, says the restaurant industry has been a vocal opponent of the change. In East Tennessee, it\u2019s not unusual for an assistant manager at a convenience store or fast-food restaurant to make between $35,000 and $40,000 and work longer than 40-hour workweeks, he says.\n\n\u201cThe industry is going to have to make a decision whether to hire two of those people or to raise their salaries,\u201d he said.\n\nHis law firm colleague, Chris McCarty, says the move could also affect some traditional professional jobs \u2014 an entry-level accountant or project manager, for example.\n\nOther regulatory issues to watch in 2016 include:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\n\n\u201c2016 is really when it hits the fan, because everybody who has 50 employees or more is required to provide or offer insurance to 95 percent of full-time employees or pay a penalty,\u201d Carrasco says. \u201cThe thing most people don\u2019t seem to realize is that if you have fewer than 50 employees there are still parts of the ACA that apply. Starting in 2016, there are new reporting requirements. There are three new forms that no matter how big or small you are you still have to file.\u201d\n\nBackground checks\n\nMcCarty advises employers to review whether background checks are really necessary for prospective employees.\n\nPresident Obama in November instructed the Office of Personnel Management to provide guidance to federal agencies about requiring prospective employees to disclose their criminal histories on job applications. He cited the move as one way to help former inmates reenter society.\n\nThe president has called on Congress to follow a growing number of states, cities and private companies by requiring all employers to \u201cban the box\u201d on job applications.\n\nMcCarty advises employers to re-evaluate whether the job requires a background check of an employee before or after a conditional offer is made.\n\n\u201cThe EEOC has already started calling out employers and hitting them with investigations \u2014 it\u2019s sort of already being enforced,\u201d McCarty says.\n\nFamily and Medical Leave Act\n\n\u201cOne of the huge issues I see, and it\u2019s the most common question I get, is managing leaves of absence,\u201d McConnell says. \u201cWe are seeing more and more employers who are struggling with how to manage leaves and keeping the workplace productive in those leave situations.\u201d\n\nHe urges supervisors to be \u201cproactive in managing the leave and communicate with the employee regularly. Don\u2019t wait too far down the road before asking questions about the leave.\u201d\n\nHe also notes that employees for whom managers are questioning the validity of leave are likely employees who have had attendance issues in the past. \u201cWhen you see attendance issues start, that\u2019s the time to deal with them, not later on,\u201d he says.\n\nImmigration\n\nCatherine Barnes, director of human resources for Shafer HR Solutions, says employers need to pay close attention filling out paperwork related to hiring immigrants, also known as I-9 employment eligibility verification.\n\n\u201cThe government is very much a stickler on how they are completed, and employers aren\u2019t filling it out exactly as they government requires,\u201d Barnes says.\n\nCarrasco encourages employers \u2014 who are responsible for ensuring both their and employees\u2019 forms are completed correctly \u2014 \u201cto take two minutes and look at each and every square to make sure it\u2019s filled out.\u201d\n\nProspective employees also have the choice on what to provide among listed documents to prove they can legally work.\n\n\u201cI have some employers who want to say bring me your passport or you drivers license or Social Security card,\u201d Carrasco says. \u201cWe have had a huge influx of people in refugee status, temporary protection status claiming asylum and those covered by the DREAM Act. Every one of those people in those categories are not truly in a visa category, but it doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nIndependent contractors\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s Wage and Hour Division administrator in July released a detailed \u201cadvisory\u201d on independent contractors, which many observers considered a more limited definition and the presumption that more of them should be classified as employees.\n\n\u201cThe undertone is we are going to starting investigating and will start fining,\u201d Carrasco says.\n\nIndustries that rely heavily on independent contractors \u2014 construction, for example \u2014 should examine whether they are classified correctly under the new standard.\n\nDon\u2019t panic, she says: Review the definition to determine what other actions can be taken rather than simply reclassifying them all as employees.\n\nFederal officials earlier this year touted that 2014 investigations related to misclassified employees resulted in more than $79 million in back wages to more than 109,000 workers in industries, including the janitorial, temporary help, food service, day care, hospitality and garment industries.\n\nSame-sex marriage\n\nEmployers have adapted quickly to the Supreme Court ruling requiring states to legally recognize same-sex marriages, with most updating their policies by discarding domestic partner benefits.\n\nWhile several lawsuits are pending from employers seeking a religious exemption to the requirement, lawyers said that\u2019s not been an issue locally.\n\n\u201cI predict the vast majority of employers if they grant benefits to married heterosexual couples that they extend them to same-sex couples,\u201d Stair said.\n\nBarnes said employers should review their insurance policies to ensure the language matches their employment policies and vice versa.\n\nCarrasco says the ruling is a relief to the many employers already offering domestic partner benefits.\n\n\u201cI am seeing more companies dialing back their benefits, so they don\u2019t have to monitor who is eligible and who is not. They\u2019re thinking, \u2018If it\u2019s recognized we don\u2019t have to get ourselves involved in relationships,\u2019 \u201d she says.\n\nSocial media\n\nTrash talking a government employer has always been protected by the First Amendment, but the NLRB has extended that protection to employees of private companies too by considering social media discussion by unhappy employees \u201ca protected concerted activity\u201d allowed under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. That interpretation can create holes in nondisparagement policies.\n\nThe NLRB, McCarty says, \u201chas always had the power to be a referee ... social media has caused them to get more involved with nonunion workplaces but to apply the same principles.\u201d\n\nBarnes says the NLRB also is protecting employees who disclose and discuss wages and benefits among themselves.\n\nUnsafe work environments\n\nOSHA in November was authorized to raise fines beginning in August 2016 by as much as 75 to 80 percent. Fines have not been raised since 1990.\n\n\u201cThat is an awful lot of money especially for a one-time issue,\u201d Carrasco says. \u201cManufacturers, in particular, should take a hard look at their safety plan.\u201d\n\nAmy Nolan is editor of the Greater Knoxville Business Journal.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Workplace rules: Federal agencies revamp standards amid partisan stalemate", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/business/journal/workplace-rules-federal-agencies-revamp-standards-amid-partisan-stalemate-ep-1398036438-361257091.html", "image": {"width": 319, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/mcconnell_27828953_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "East Tennessee employers will have to take a hard look at how they staff their operations as the result of federal actions expected in 2016, local labor law experts say.", "title": "Workplace rules: Federal agencies revamp standards amid partisan stalemate"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/mcconnell_27828953_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "East Tennessee employers will have to take a hard look at how they staff their operations as the result of federal actions expected in 2016, local labor law experts say.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Workplace rules: Federal agencies revamp standards amid partisan stalemate"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The new rule is also expected to establish a mechanism for automatically updating the salary and compensation levels going forward.\n\u201cEmployers are really having to rethink how they pay people,\u201d says Melissa Carrasco, an attorney with Egerton McAfee Armistead & Davis.\nPresident Obama in November instructed the Office of Personnel Management to provide guidance to federal agencies about requiring prospective employees to disclose their criminal histories on job applications.\n\u201cManufacturers, in particular, should take a hard look at their safety plan.\u201dAmy Nolan is editor of the Greater Knoxville Business Journal.\nUnsafe work environmentsOSHA in November was authorized to raise fines beginning in August 2016 by as much as 75 to 80 percent."}
