My daughter was under the care of MDS, now known as Strive, for 20 years. They transferred her to the Regional Center because, as they told me, they were not equipped to handle her condition. It has taken some years, but she has improved greatly and it is because of the care available to her at the Regional Center.\n\nWhat services can Strive provide for $350 per person per day? They say they are willing to become a provider of last resort if they can be compensated at a similar rate as the Regional Center, which is now the provider of last resort? Should that give anyone reason to question something? Those people on the campus have more complex issues than the Strive clients.\n\nWe have no reason to believe that they are any better equipped now to take care of our loved ones.\n\nParent/guardian meetings are held at the GJRC on a monthly basis. Perhaps it would be a good idea for a representative from the Sentinel to attend some of them.\n\nDONNA JACKSON\n\nGrand Junction\n\nWe need to support new BLM methane emission rules\n\nI attended the Sustainability Council\u2019s forum on the new BLM methane emission rules Wednesday evening at CMU. Like Dennis Webb, I found notable not only the excellent speakers but also the students who are well informed, involved and set on climate action.\n\nThe new rules are common sense given the impact of methane on the atmosphere. Billions of cubic feet of natural gas are wasted each year. From the literature distributed at the forum: \u201cBetween 2009 and 2014, enough natural gas was lost through venting, flaring and leaks to power more than five million homes for a year.\u201d\n\nThis waste means a loss of revenue for the companies and a loss of royalties for the taxpayer \u2013 but it is also critically dangerous to the future of the planet. Climate change is well documented by scientists, and we must all do our part to rein in the pollution from oil and gas development. Methane is up to 80 times more dangerous to the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.\n\nThe last question from the audience was how the rules would affect jobs locally. In our current economic situation, jobs are an important concern to families here. Responsible production of natural gas has wide support and will likely continue in our region. Monitoring and retrofitting of the thousands of wells in Colorado will provide additional jobs.\n\nAs we transition our energy economy from fossil fuels to renewable sources, Western Colorado, with its 300 days of sunshine, is a perfect place for solar installations. This will provide steady work if new or expanding local companies see that as an alternative to oil and gas production.\n\nThese students from CMU deserve to work in an industry that does its best to provide jobs, energy and a safer future for the planet. If we want to help air quality, save money and keep these admirable young folks in Western Colorado, we need to support these BLM rules to reduce wasted natural gas.\n\nI encourage my neighbors in the Grand Valley to support these rules and submit comments by the deadline of April 22 by going to http://www.regulations.gov and searching for \u201cWaste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation.\u201d Guidance for comments and letters will be held Wednesday, April 6 at Koinonia Church, 730 25 Road, from 5:15 to 6:30.\n\nI deeply care about reducing the waste of our shared public resources and conservation of our beautiful planet, and I hope my voice can make a difference.\n\nKATHY SLAUGHTER\n\nGrand Junction\n\nWe need to embrace transition from dirty coal to clean power future\n\nFormer Senator Tim Wirth\u2019s March 27 Op-Ed on climate change and coal reminds us of the pressing need to embrace the transition from dirty coal to a clean power future. Nowhere is this more relevant than in the coal country of the North Fork Valley. Whether the exemption to the Colorado Roadless Rule to allow coal mining is approved or denied, there is no denying that coal is rapidly facing extinction as an energy source in light of its tremendous climate-change causing properties. Former Senator Wirth is absolutely right that we should keep coal in the ground.\n\nIf the coalmining loophole to the Colorado Roadless Rule is rejected, coal mining can still continue for a decade at current rates. Whether coal mining ends in 10 years or a little later in the North Fork, one day it will end. Now is the time to transition to cleaner energy sources. Our communities and our environment depend upon it.\n\nALLISON N. MELTON\n\nCrested Butte\n\nWe should oust Republicans due to counter-productive obstructionism\n\nJ. E. Sundquist\u2019s response (\u201cWe need to oust Democrats, not our local leaders\u201d) to Gene Coffin\u2019s letter vainly tries to shift blame from free market forces and Republican policies to Democratic-led efforts to protect public health by cleaning-up the air we breathe.\n\n\u201cLost jobs\u201d in the coal industry are more attributable to the low market price of natural gas rather than to Democratic policies. \u201cLost jobs\u201d in the local oil & gas industry are more attributable to the availability of cheaper natural gas elsewhere (with lower transportation costs to market), to the glut of oil on international markets, and to the increasing cost-effectiveness of renewable energy sources \u2013 rather than only to environmental policies.\n\nWhile \u201cpoverty\u201d is a foreseeable outcome of unemployment, our local Republican \u201cleader\u201d \u2013 Tea Party Congressman Scott Tipton \u2013 helped defeat Democratic efforts to extend unemployment benefits. While the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (Food Stamps) mitigates some effects of unemployment, Tipton and his Republican ilk (not Democrats) insisted on cutting Food Stamp funding. While the Affordable Care Act provides access to affordable health care even for the unemployed, Tipton and his smug Republican colleagues (not Democrats) voted 64+ times to repeal, de-fund, and/or replace \u201cObamacare\u201d with inferior alternatives that would deprive millions of coverage.\n\n\u201cConservatives\u2019\u201d revered free market routinely and continuously produces \u201cwinners and losers.\u201d While Democrats generally favor governmental policies intended to mitigate the economic dislocations that inevitably result, Republicans remain committed to de facto social Darwinism \u2013 because the redistribution of public revenues from winners to losers via the progressive income tax is antithetical to their discredited ideology.\n\nRepublicans also prefer to preserve economic anxiety as a campaign issue \u2013 blaming the effects of their own misguided austerity on Democrats \u2013 rather than actually solving real economic problems. The absence of robust job retraining and economic development programs on the Western Slope is a testament to the opportunity costs of Republicans\u2019 counter-productive obstructionism. Thus, they \u2013 not Democrats \u2013 deserve to be \u201cousted.\u201d\n\nBILL HUGENBERG\n\nGrand Junction\n\nGrand Junction: A visionary city with pioneering grit\n\nFor just a moment, imagine a message like that. Imagine how powerful it could be in communicating how resilient, how forward-looking, how attractive \u2013in a substantial not frivolous way \u2013 our community is as it takes on 21st century challenges with pioneering grit. It\u2019s a message of hope in dark times, of future possibilities instead of past glories in this region of boom and bust.\n\nNo, these are not just pretty words or politician promises, they are real possibilities that are becoming realities now. Out there among us are hard-working, visionary folks who are working to transform our Grand Valley and make the City\u2019s 2020 Vision Statement a reality. Among them are folks in our own Grand Junction City government who years back came up with innovative ideas about renewable energy and built a leading edge solution converting methane from waste into biogas for transportation. Their work was recognized a few years ago in The Daily Sentinel. Now it has been recognized by a major national news organization: the PBS Newshour in their telecast of 28 March 2016.\n\nGo to http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/turning-poop-into-power-not-pollution/ and celebrate our new notoriety as 21st century pioneers in renewable energy! And I for one believe this is just the beginning\u2026\n\nRICHARD P. HYLAND\n\nGrand Junction\n\nWhat would Republicans do with the next president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee?\n\nIf admitted obstructionist Republicans are afraid to vote on a moderate Supreme Court nominee made by a black president, what would they do with a liberal judge, nominated by a woman or socialist President?\n\nCARL HECK\n\nAspen\n\n\n\nGrand Valley Drainage District fee is a way to get money without a vote\n\nI received my drainage \u201cfee\u201d in the mail from Grand Valley Drainage District and would like to share this observation. The statement has an amount due of $36 and I understand why more money is needed for improvements. But then I look at my Real Property Tax Notice and there is a line item called \u201cGrand Valley Drainage District\u201d which is a tax and the fee dollars goes to the same entity.\n\nOne is a tax requiring a vote and the other is a fee that does not require a vote. That is what Bill Ritter did with license plates a few years when he tacked a road fee and a bridge fee on our vehicle registration. No matter how you slice it, it is still a way to get money from the populace without a vote. So much for the Bill of Rights.\n\nALAN CORPORON\n\nGrand Junction\n\nTransgender and restrooms raises some questions\n\nRegarding transgender and restrooms.\n\nIf a deranged biological male exposes himself to a group of schoolgirls on a public street, may he not expect to be arrested for indecency and removed from the area?\n\nYet if the very same mentally ill individual demands to do so in a rest- or locker-room with the same girls present and in a state of undress, why is he now considered by the dissolute press, big corporations, and government to be the exemplar of virtue and damn the consequences?\n\nWhy do the demented three constituencies listed above, in state after state, relentlessly support this war on modesty and women in general or are they just plain evil?\n\nWasn\u2019t the \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d whose violation of the privacy of the female sports reporter brought a $55 million judgment (March 7) against the Nashville Marriott hotel, merely exercising the same so called fetish?\n\nRUSSELL W HAAS\n\nGolden\n\nIs the ACA a flop because it is successfully doing exactly what it was designed to do?\n\nA letter to the editor today complains about the unavailability this year of the annual Health Fair and the value to lower income people that it provided. I know a lot of people who availed themselves of the services the fair provided and I don\u2019t question the value they felt that they got from such services.\n\nBut then the author specifically mentioned the difficulty those with a high deductible Obamacare/ACA policy had in affording those services on his or her own. What? The ACA was designed to make otherwise unaffordable health insurance available to those that either couldn\u2019t afford a conventional policy or couldn\u2019t qualify at all for such a policy. People with an ACA policy that became available and affordable are somehow being singled out because their deductibles are too high? Did they have any insurance at all previously? Aren\u2019t high deductibles for any kind of policy a hindrance to affording the kind of services provided at a health fair, not to mention the affordability to people with no insurance at all?\n\nConservatives hate the ACA as being government intervention in a place that should be reserved exclusively for private enterprise. But the program is meant to include private enterprise. True, in Colorado it is made even more affordable with Medicaid support. But what is the mention of Obamacare in a letter meant to highlight the unavailability of valuable testing to those who previously relied on it? Is the ACA not generous enough? Should the availability of different programs balancing deductibles with monthly cost be changed?\n\nThe ACA program is hated by conservatives but it is not generous enough to help those in need? Is the ACA a needless flop because it is successfully doing exactly what it was designed to do? The government is bad because it is not doing enough?\n\nJOHN BORGEN\n\nGrand Junction\n\nIt\u2019s important that Colorado embraces plans to both save money and protect environment\n\nAs a resident of Colorado, I was very pleased to read last week\u2019s article \u201cMethane rule draws support,\u201d in which I learned that environmentalists and energy companies are agreeing on positive outcomes of using technologies that cut methane emissions. As the article explained, this new technology that monitors and regulates the amount of methane lost during extraction both helps save the energy companies money and helps save the environment.\n\nAlthough it is not usually discussed in the environmental debate, methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas. According to a NASA report, methane is 20 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.\n\nAs a student working toward a major in environmental studies, it is a huge victory in my eyes when people on both sides of the environmental debate can agree on something that works for everyone. Too often this debate is broken up into environmentalists versus polluters, when in reality we all want the same thing.\n\nI think I speak for most Coloradans when I say we want a healthy environment as well as a healthy economy. It is for this reason that it is so important to embrace plans that both save money and protect our environment, such as the plan discussed in this article, or the Clean Power Plan, which aims to cut coal fire power plant emissions. When the two sides of this debate set aside their differences and compromise on a plan that works for both parties, everybody wins.\n\nWILLIAM DOWNIE\n\nBoulder\n\nBill uses wildfire as cover for land grab\n\nFor the third year in a row the Colorado General Assembly is considering a bill, Senate Bill 160, which would claim \u201cpolice\u201d powers over federally \u00admanaged public lands like national forests and BLM lands.\n\nIn reality, this bill is nothing more than yet another Bundy-style attempt at the state level to seize control of our national public lands to sell them off for private profit. But this time the bill goes too far. This bill threatens the lives of our first responders and firefighters.\n\nColorado State Sens. Scott, Roberts, and Baumgardner are all claiming support for this bill by using the safety of our wild lands firefighters as a smokescreen to cover up the bill\u2019s true land-grab intent. But if put into action, this bill would actually muddle the chain of command on our public lands in emergencies, and could get people killed.\n\nMy brother was a an engine captain for the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s Little Snake Field Office when he was killed on the job in 2009. No family should ever feel the pain we feel from his loss.\n\nIt\u2019s too much to risk for a bill that was actually drafted by the Koch Brothers \u2014 a duo of oil and gas corporate elite that are shopping this same bill language to states across the West.\n\nThis bill, at its core, is about advancing an out-of-state ideological agenda like the one that led to the Oregon wildlife takeover earlier this year. It stands counter to the Colorado way; we work together toward constructive, pragmatic solutions for public lands management problems. We don\u2019t threaten the lives of our local heroes for political points.\n\nState Sen. Randy Baumgardner is co-sponsoring this bad bill. I, for one, have had enough of his reliance on Koch Brothers to do his job. Let\u2019s elect a new state senator for northwestern Colorado this November.\n\nBRAD STEARNS\n\nCraig\n\nLoss of health fair was not the fault of county commissioners\n\nThe 9 Health Fair had been providing low-cost medical tests to area residents for years when St. Mary\u2019s Hospital decided they wanted the business.\n\nThe first year they scheduled the local health fair before the 9 Health Fair so few people used the 9 Health Fair.\n\nThis year when I called the Health Department to inquire about the health fair I was told there would be no health fair this year and I needed to contact 9healtfair.org. I sent an email apologizing for the way they have been treated here and asking if I could do anything to help bring them back to Grand Junction. I got a lovely voicemail from Diane, director of business development for 9 Health Fair, telling me they had been coming here for 34 years and are working now with local Lions clubs to bring the 9 Health Fair back next year.\n\nThis year 9 Health Fair is charging $35 for 28 levels of blood chemistry, $30 for a PSA, $30 for hemoglobin A1C (screen for diabetes), $20 for a blood count, and $45 for a Vitamin D level. The total for all the tests except PSA is $130. Many people who lack medical insurance depend on the inexpensive lab work for a little peace of mind. People with huge Obamacare deductibles would like to have access to inexpensive lab work as well I\u2019m sure.\n\nI want to thank our local Lions Clubs for helping bring this important public service back to Grand Junction.\n\nROBERTA KNEISEL\n\nGrand Junction", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CO", "DC.format": "text/html", "geo.placename": "Grand Junction", "description": "Grand Junction - No reason to believe Strive is now better equipped to take care of loved ones  As the parent of a daughter who is one of the 28 people", "geo.position": "39.0500,-108.5500", "DC.description": "Grand Junction - No reason to believe Strive is now better equipped to take care of loved ones  As the parent of a daughter who is one of the 28 people", "DC.identifier": "http://www.gjsentinel.com/opinion/articles/email-letters-april-1-2016/", "DC.type": "Text", "robots": "index,follow,archive", "DC.publisher": "GJSentinel.com/The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel", "DC.date.valid": "2016-06-02T16:05:04-0600", "DC.creator": "Staff", "DC.rights": "The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel", "keywords": "concert,fair,grand junction,junior league,mesa county,music", "DC.date.created": "2016-04-01T16:18:46-0600", "DC.subject": "concert,fair,grand junction,junior league,mesa county,music", "DC.date.modified": "2016-04-01T16:30:47-0600", "DC.title": "Email letters, April 1, 2016  |  GJSentinel.com"}, "article_summary": "The first year they scheduled the local health fair before the 9 Health Fair so few people used the 9 Health Fair.\nThis year when I called the Health Department to inquire about the health fair I was told there would be no health fair this year and I needed to contact 9healtfair.org.\nBRAD STEARNSCraigLoss of health fair was not the fault of county commissionersThe 9 Health Fair had been providing low-cost medical tests to area residents for years when St. Mary\u2019s Hospital decided they wanted the business.\nI got a lovely voicemail from Diane, director of business development for 9 Health Fair, telling me they had been coming here for 34 years and are working now with local Lions clubs to bring the 9 Health Fair back next year.\nA letter to the editor today complains about the unavailability this year of the annual Health Fair and the value to lower income people that it provided."}
