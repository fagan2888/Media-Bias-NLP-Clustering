For years, the NSA has collected phone records en masse, archiving everyone\u2019s calls to check them for suspicious activity. After being deemed unconstitutional earlier this year, Congress finally shut down this shady program.\n\nCongress passed a law to end the program back in June, but gave the NSA 6 months to \u201cphase out\u201d of its current system, a deadline that arrived at 11:59 p.m. this past Saturday. Moving forward, telephone service providers will maintain these records instead of the government. The NSA and law enforcement agencies can still access this data from the companies after securing a court order. If a judge agrees that surveillance is warranted for a specific person, the NSA can track who Americans are calling for up to a six month period.\n\nThough the program has been in place thanks to the Patriot Act after the attacks on September 11, it didn\u2019t receive national scrutiny until whistleblower Edward Snowden leaked documents revealing the extent of these programs. A dialogue about whether citizens\u2019 privacy concerns should trump safety measures has ensued ever since.\n\nSenator Ron Wyden, a Democrat representing Oregon, has taken a leadership role in putting a stop to bulk phone record collection. \u201cThis is a victory for everyone who believes in protecting both American security and American\u2019s constitutional rights,\u201d he said.\n\nNot all legislators are as excited as Sen. Wyden, however. In light of the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, some U.S. lawmakers think now is not the time to decrease the amount of government surveillance. The head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Richard Burr, said, \u201cAnytime you can take electronics and use those selectors, it\u2019s beneficial to the world\u2019s intelligence community\u2026 the United States made a real mistake when they eliminated this program.\u201d The Republican from North Carolina is part of a group hoping to give the program at least a temporary extension.\n\nHowever, one main reason why the program has ultimately been scrapped is that it never actually helped prevent terrorist activity in the first place. By the government\u2019s own reluctant admission, bulk data collection did not provide the U.S. with information to thwart a single terrorist attack, making all this effort not just unconstitutional, but also pointless.\n\nWhile it\u2019s certainly a step in the right direction, opponents of government surveillance should realize that the fight is far from over. The new law in no way hampers the NSA from continuing to conduct mass data collection on Internet browsing and social media accounts, so remain wary that Big Brother may be monitoring your internet activity.\n\nPhoto credit: Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "That controversial phone record surveillance that Edward Snowden brought to finally has finally ended.
