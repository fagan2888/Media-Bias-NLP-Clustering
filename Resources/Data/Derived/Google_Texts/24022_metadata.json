Girls, they theorize, are afraid of being seen as an adjective that summons an image of a pouting, tyrannical grade-schooler, crossing her arms and stomping her feet: \u201cbossy.\u201d The two women base their opposition to the label on a 2008 Girl Scouts survey that found that girls are more worried about being seen as bossy than boys are. Sandberg and Chavez point to real problems when it comes to women in leadership roles: \u201cWomen make up just 19 percent of the U.S. Congress, 5 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs and 10 percent of heads of state,\u201d they write. The solution, they claim, is to eradicate the word \u201cbossy\u201d from our vocabularies, since it\u2019s disproportionately applied to girls and may have a chilling effect on their ambitions. \"Avoid excessive praise of girls who are \u2018well behaved.\u2019\" The organizational outgrowth of Sandberg\u2019s recent book, LeanIn.org, along with the Girl Scouts, launched an entire site dedicated to \u201cBanning Bossy.\u201d The cause might be noble, but many of the group\u2019s recommendations for parents, teachers, and other adults don\u2019t have anything to do with bossiness:\n\n\u201cAvoid excessive praise of girls who are \u2018well behaved.\u2019 Rewarding them for being quiet may inadvertently encourage similar behavior when speaking up is needed, like during class discussion,\u201d the group advises teachers. Or, \u201cAssure students that there\u2019s no right answer.\u201d neil-5110/Flickr Parents, meanwhile, are urged to help their kids express to their friends what they want to do on weekends. They\u2019re advised to \u201cavoid hedging or softening your opinions\u201d in front of their daughters and to \u201cbrainstorm examples of moments when being \u2018bossy\u2019 is a good idea.\u201d They should remind girls not to turn factual sentences into questions (\u201cMartin Luther King was a civil rights leader?\u201d). The question cadence\u2014it\u2019s called \u201cuptalk\u201d\u2014might be annoying, but it\u2019s an increasingly widespread among both genders of young people, bossy and otherwise. Most of the other things aren\u2019t necessarily markers of girls who are afraid to be \u201cbossy\u201d\u2014they\u2019re markers of introverts. Of course it\u2019s good to encourage girls to be leaders. But not all leaders have extroverted personalities. In fact, some of the best ones are quiet, shy loners who were likely never called \u201cbossy\u201d in their lives. Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and Barack Obama have all been at various points described as introverts. The anti-bossy movement aims to encourage girls to speak up \"even if you aren't sure about the answer,\" but introverts prefer to process their thoughts and form solid ideas before expressing them. Studies on introverted leaders have shown that they are not any less effective than their more gregarious counterparts, and some studies have even shown that humbler leaders can inspire better-functioning management teams. Charismatic CEOs get paid more, but their firms don't perform any better on average than those of more reserved principals. Introverts have a harder time getting high-powered jobs, since these spots usually require extensive self-promotion. \u201cI don\u2019t have the time to figure out who has achieved what,\" one manager told writer Jennifer B. Kahnweiler. \"I give opportunities to those who tell me what they are doing without my having to ask.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Let&#39;s not forget the quiet power of introverts in our quest to boost female leaders.", "author": "Olga Khazan", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Let&#39;s not forget the quiet power of introverts in our quest to boost female leaders.", "title": "Not All Good Leaders Are Bossy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/03/RTX13WGX/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/03/not-all-good-leaders-are-bossy/284363/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/olgakhazan"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9802\"", "article_summary": "Of course it\u2019s good to encourage girls to be leaders.\nIn fact, some of the best ones are quiet, shy loners who were likely never called \u201cbossy\u201d in their lives.\nThe question cadence\u2014it\u2019s called \u201cuptalk\u201d\u2014might be annoying, but it\u2019s an increasingly widespread among both genders of young people, bossy and otherwise.\nStudies on introverted leaders have shown that they are not any less effective than their more gregarious counterparts, and some studies have even shown that humbler leaders can inspire better-functioning management teams.\nRecently in the Wall Street Journal, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Girls Scouts CEO Anna Maria Ch\u00e1vez expounded why they think there aren\u2019t more women in leadership roles."}
