Two bystanders attempted to pull the dog off the man but they were unsuccessful. An officer then deployed his taser and the dog released its hold on the man.\n\n\u201cWe were afraid the dog was going to kill him,\u201d said the victim\u2019s wife Shelley Hudson about the dog named Atlus.\n\n\u201cThe dog kept biting deeper and deeper, almost gnawing on his arm. My husband was of course screaming in pain,\u201d Hudson said.\n\nPolice said the dog turned and charged at the officer. The officer discharged his handgun and the dog was hit and he retreated.\n\nOfficers said the homeowner was \u201cgravely injured as a result of the dog attack\u201d. He was taken to a local hospital in serious condition.\n\nHudson said her husband is going to be OK but that he can't feel his arm or fingers.\n\nThe couple had adopted the dog, who was abused in the past. The dog had bitten her husband about a year and a half ago, but had not shown signs of aggression since, she said.\n\nThe dog was treated at the scene and was taken to a veterinarian clinic for further treatment.\n\nThe dog was put down, Hudson told News 9.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "One man is in the hospital following what officers are calling a vicious dog attack Sunday afternoon.", "author": "News9.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/31161709/man-in-serious-condition-following-vicious-dog-attack-in-nw-okc", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9826385_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "One man is in the hospital following what officers are calling a vicious dog attack Sunday afternoon.", "title": "Man In Serious Condition Following 'Vicious' Dog Attack In NW OKC"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9826385_G.jpg", "description": "One man is in the hospital following what officers are calling a vicious dog attack Sunday afternoon.", "card": "summary", "title": "Man In Serious Condition Following 'Vicious' Dog Attack In NW OKC"}, "wnreadableurl": "man-in-serious-condition-following-vicious-dog-attack-in-nw-okc", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2016/02/07", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS09", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ea9\"", "article_summary": "One man is in the hospital following what officers are calling a vicious dog attack Sunday afternoon.\nOfficers said the homeowner was \u201cgravely injured as a result of the dog attack\u201d.\n\u201cWe were afraid the dog was going to kill him,\u201d said the victim\u2019s wife Shelley Hudson about the dog named Atlus.\nAbout 1:40 p.m., police responded to the 1200 block of NW 45th to a report of a dog attacking a homeowner.\nHudson said her husband is going to be OK but that he can't feel his arm or fingers."}
