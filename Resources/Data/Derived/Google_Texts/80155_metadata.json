That requirement includes coverage for diapers, which accounted for $266 million in Medicaid spending in 2012.\n\nBen Domenech, a senior fellow at the Heartland Institute, said excessive spending on incontinence supplies underscores a deeper and more long-term problem in the Medicaid system.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons Medicaid is spending so much on adult diapers in the first place is that the Medicaid program has morphed into an uncomfortable combination of two programs,\u201d Domenech explained in an email.\n\nIn addition to its role as an insurer for low-income Americans, he said, Medicaid has become \u201ca long-term care program which provides chronic care and nursing home services for seniors.\u201d\n\nDomenech lauded a proposal introduced on Monday by Sens. Tom Coburn (R., Okla.), Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), and Richard Burr (R., N.C.) that would repeal Obamacare and replace it with, the senators say, a more \u201csustainable, affordable, patient-centered\u201d system.\n\nThe legislation would roll back Obamacare\u2019s expansion of the Medicaid program and allow qualifying patients to apply Medicaid benefits towards a private insurance plan.\n\nDomenech said the bill would head off the potentially unsustainable growth in Medicaid spending resulting from its increasing role in insuring the elderly and indigent.\n\nThat portion of the program, he said, \u201cis in equally dramatic need of reform\u2014hopefully before the baby boomers\u2019 mismanaged diaper budget gets out of control.\u201d\n\nMedicaid fraud also poses challenges for Medicaid\u2019s generous coverage of disposable incontinence supplies, the IG noted.\n\nThe IG released its report less than a week after the Justice Department charged the husband-and-wife owners of a Texas medical practice with fraudulently claiming more than $2 million in Medicaid expenses for incontinence supplies.\n\nEach faces a 10-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine if convicted.\n\nThe owner of a Maryland medical equipment company pled guilty in April to a charge of federal healthcare fraud after submitting false Medicaid reimbursement claims for $212,893 in incontinence supplies.\n\nStates that implemented competitive bidding programs in an effort to use a single vendor saw reduced opportunities for such fraud, the IG noted.\n\nCompetitive bidding \u201creduced opportunity for beneficiaries to fraudulently use multiple suppliers to obtain an excess of supplies,\u201d the report noted.\n\nSix states\u2014California, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia\u2014account for more than half of the potential savings that could be achieved by implementing competitive bidding practices, the IG found.\n\nCalifornia alone could save $7.5 million per year on diapers, the report noted.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A lack of competitive bidding processes among state Medicaid agencies caused the program to overpay for diapers by about $62 million in 2012, according to a report released by federal auditors on Mond", "title": "Medicaid Overpays Millions for Diapers", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/medicaid-overpays-millions-for-diapers/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Diapers-Medicaid-Waste-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A lack of competitive bidding processes among state Medicaid agencies caused the program to overpay", "title": "Medicaid Overpays Millions for Diapers", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Diapers-Medicaid-Waste-150x150.jpg", "creator": "@lachlan", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc50\"", "article_summary": "The legislation would roll back Obamacare\u2019s expansion of the Medicaid program and allow qualifying patients to apply Medicaid benefits towards a private insurance plan.\n\u201cOne of the reasons Medicaid is spending so much on adult diapers in the first place is that the Medicaid program has morphed into an uncomfortable combination of two programs,\u201d Domenech explained in an email.\nThat requirement includes coverage for diapers, which accounted for $266 million in Medicaid spending in 2012.\nStates nationwide implemented cost control mechanisms, the report noted, but Medicaid could have saved about $62 million if competitive bidding processes were adopted nationwide.\nThose savings would amount to 23 percent of the Medicaid bill for disposable incontinence supplies, which include nine categories of diapers and liners, including products for adults and children."}
