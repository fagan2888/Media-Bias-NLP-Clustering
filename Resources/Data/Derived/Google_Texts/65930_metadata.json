Stewart Mills, CEO of Mills Fleet Farm, a family owned business in the Iron Range of Minnesota, eschews traditional notions of what a Congressman should look and sound like, and is carving out an independent GOP niche in order to challenge incumbent Democrat Rick Nolan. He has been referred to by more than one wag as the \"Brad Pitt of the Republican Party.\"\n\nMills' unusual appearance may be a campaign affectation, but according to this profile in Politico, he is very comfortable with it:\n\nCertainly, I stand out in a crowd, like I did today,\u201d Mills said in an interview after appearing with other, more traditionally coiffed Republicans vying for state office here. \u201cThe hair \u2014 I mean, everybody else there was very groomed.\u201d His latest ad opens with Mills saying, with a shrug, \u201cI guess I don\u2019t look like a typical politician.\u201d At the same time, Mills \u2014 who is married with children, but had pictures of him chugging beer plastered in an alternative newspaper last year \u2014 needs to show he\u2019s not an overgrown adolescent; that he can exhibit the gravitas of a congressman. The hair can help his campaign, he figures, but he doesn\u2019t want it to become the campaign. His bid \u201cis about a lot more than that,\u201d Mills said of the Pitt talk. \u201cIt\u2019s very serious, we want it to be a very serious campaign. Let other people kind of promote the novelty of it.\u201d\n\nThe 8th district runs from the Minneapolis exurbs all the way to the Canadian border. Mining is still important but not as much as it used to be. It is rural and small towns - many of which have fallen on hard times with the down sizing of the mining industry. Might Mills' personae have a certain attraction to the working class Dems in the district?\n\n\u201cStewart obviously represents kind of a fresh face for the Republicans,\u201d said state GOP Chairman Keith Downey in yet another nod to Mills\u2019 appearance. \u201cHe\u2019s another of this genre of Republicans who \u2026 haven\u2019t been in politics for forever, and who got to a point where they said, \u2018I have to do something.\u2019\u201d In relaxed environments, Mills is polite and funny, the kind of guy voters would want to have a beer with. Over the course of several conversations with this reporter, he made frequent references to experiences he\u2019s had with this or that \u201cbuddy of mine\u201d and showed off pictures of his young kids fishing (he has two children, three stepchildren and four step-grandchildren). And he offered a gleeful response to the story from last fall that showed pictures of him drinking from a beer bong. \u201cChugging a beer gives me credibility with the 8th District,\u201d he said. But on the campaign trail, Mills is far more reserved. At a news conference featuring Republican candidates running in Minnesota this year, Mills gave his pitch but let others answer questions directed to the whole group. He is confident giving a stump speech or taking questions in front of a group, but when talking with voters, Mills appears shy at times, allowing them to drive the conversation. Mills is courting conservative working-class Democrats and rallying the base by campaigning as socially conservative \u2014 he opposes abortion rights and staunchly favors gun rights \u2014 and pro-jobs. And he\u2019s trying to capitalize on frustration with Obamacare by fashioning himself as a health care expert, pointing to his experience overseeing the health care plans at his company. He is also painting Nolan as too liberal for this historically blue-collar, Democratic-leaning district that stretches from the Twin Cities exurbs north to Canada.\n\nMills may have long hair but he's no hippie. He is CEO of Mills Fleet Farm, a sporting goods-hardware outlet, and manages 33 stores in the upper midwest. He's no wonk, but he's no lightweight either:\n\nMills, plainly aware that the opposition is trying to paint him an intellectual lightweight, is eager to prove his policy chops. In meet-and-greets with voters in towns across the Iron Range, he fielded questions about a variety of policy issues \u2014 from the captured Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl\u2019s release (\u201cnegotiating with terrorists,\u201d he said of the Obama administration\u2019s approach to the issue) to Obamacare to mining \u2014 without hesitation, usually on message and sometimes in excessively wonkish detail. \u201cThe best they can do is say I was born on third base \u2026 or that I\u2019m just not that bright,\u201d Mills said. \u201cIf they want to try to paint me with that, please, bring it, because we have been a longtime employer, created a lot of jobs and prosperity and we\u2019re not publicly traded, there\u2019s no private equity money and no venture capital money. It is just hard work, sweat of the brow and reinvesting back in our businesses, which creates jobs.\u201d Whether or not he makes it to Congress, Mills is adamant about one thing: The hair is staying. \u201cLong before I ever thought I\u2019d run for office, this is the way I looked,\u201d Mills said. \u201cWhen I got into the race, the one thing I made sure of is that I\u2019m going to continue to be me. I wasn\u2019t going to change who I am.\u201d\n\nThe incumbent Democrat got 55% of the vote in 2012. He is making his first defense of the seat, which could spell trouble for him. President Obama got also 55% of the vote in the district which makes Rep. Nolan an inviting target for the right kind of Republican.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/06/the_gop_brad_pitt_looks_for_upset_in_minnesota_8th.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: The GOP 'Brad Pitt' looks for upset in Minnesota 8th"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He has been referred to by more than one wag as the \"Brad Pitt of the Republican Party.\"\nHe is confident giving a stump speech or taking questions in front of a group, but when talking with voters, Mills appears shy at times, allowing them to drive the conversation.\nThe hair can help his campaign, he figures, but he doesn\u2019t want it to become the campaign.\nHis bid \u201cis about a lot more than that,\u201d Mills said of the Pitt talk.\nLet other people kind of promote the novelty of it.\u201dThe 8th district runs from the Minneapolis exurbs all the way to the Canadian border."}
