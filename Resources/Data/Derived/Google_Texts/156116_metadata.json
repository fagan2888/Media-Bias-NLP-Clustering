The action came on the heels of the Obama administration\u2019s \u201ceighth try\u201d to reconcile the HHS mandate with the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty.\n\nThe latest revision of the rule, on Aug. 22, would allow religious nonprofits such as the Little Sisters of the Poor to write a letter to HHS informing the government of their objection on religious grounds.\n\nThe government then would direct the employer\u2019s insurance company or third-party administrator to cover the objectionable drugs, devices or services.\n\n>>> Commentary: Obama Administration\u2019s Eighth Try on HHS Mandate and Religious Liberty Still Fails\n\n\u201cMerely offering the Little Sisters a different way to violate their religion does not ease their conscience,\u201d said Adele Keim, counsel with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents the religious order.\n\n\u201cAdding another layer of paperwork is a solution that only a bureaucrat could love,\u201d she said.\n\nThe government, presenting itself as on the side of employee access to contraceptives, stated in the brief that it is \u201ccrucial that these appeals be resolved now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of the injunctions issued in these cases, the women employed by plaintiffs have been and continue to be denied access to contraceptive coverage,\u201d government lawyers said in the court filing.\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor was founded in the United States over 150 years ago. Sisters who belong to the Roman Catholic order dedicate their lives to running homes for the most vulnerable elderly. They vow to care for all human life, especially those deemed weak.\n\nThe order says it has served more than 13,000 elderly poor in 31 countries around the world.\n\nIn 34 cases challenging Obamacare\u2019s HHS mandate, courts have ruled 31 times against it, according to Becket Fund records.\n\nThe legal victories for religious liberty include the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Hobby Lobby decision. In that widely watched case, the justices ruled that the government can\u2019t compel a \u201cclosely held\u201d business such as the Hobby Lobby arts and crafts chain to cover abortion-inducing drugs or devices in employee health plans if doing so would violate the employer\u2019s moral and religious beliefs.\n\nThe Obama administration remains \u201cperfectly free\u201d to pursue its goal of contraceptive coverage by working with willing partners, Keim told The Daily Signal, \u201cbut what the Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act forbids is coercing the Little Sisters of the Poor to convert their own health care plans.\u201d\n\nThe Becket Fund attorney said oral arguments in the case are scheduled for Sept. 29, when the Little Sisters will have their first public opportunity to tell their side of the story.\n\nFor now, the sisters are protected by the Supreme Court\u2019s temporary injunction against enforcement of the HHS mandate. If it is not made permanent, supporters say, the nuns will have to decide to violate their religious convictions or pay crippling fines to the IRS.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration will continue its legal battle against Little Sisters of the Poor, which objects to Obamacare\u2019s mandate to cover certain drugs.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Obama administration will continue its legal battle against Little Sisters of the Poor, which objects to Obamacare\u2019s mandate to cover certain drugs.", "title": "Obamacare \u2018Doubles Down\u2019 on Fight Against Nuns", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140909_Sisters_Harkness.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-10T09:44:34+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tIyGHk"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Obama administration will continue its legal battle against Little Sisters of the Poor, which objects to Obamacare\u2019s mandate to cover certain drugs.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140909_Sisters_Harkness.jpg"}, "title": "Obamacare \u2018Doubles Down\u2019 on Fight Against Nuns", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "founding principles,obamacare,religious liberty", "published_time": "2014-09-09T17:51:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-10T09:44:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "little sisters of the poor, little sisters, little sisters obamacare, obamacare abortion mandate, affordable care act, becket fund, religious liberty, religious freedom"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5df\"", "article_summary": "In 34 cases challenging Obamacare\u2019s HHS mandate, courts have ruled 31 times against it, according to Becket Fund records.\nFor now, the sisters are protected by the Supreme Court\u2019s temporary injunction against enforcement of the HHS mandate.\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor was founded in the United States over 150 years ago.\nIf it is not made permanent, supporters say, the nuns will have to decide to violate their religious convictions or pay crippling fines to the IRS.\nThe action came on the heels of the Obama administration\u2019s \u201ceighth try\u201d to reconcile the HHS mandate with the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty."}
