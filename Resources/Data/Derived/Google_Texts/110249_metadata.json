According to the projections, the US deficit will soon stop shrinking and begin to rise again. Cue the Very Serious People, who are deeply distressed at the failure of the promised fiscal crisis to materialize; I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see editorials and op-eds in the next few days warning us that the deficit is still public enemy #1.\n\nBut as Matt Klein points out \u2014 and as I pointed out around a year ago, after a similar CBO projection \u2014 there\u2019s a funny thing about that projected rise in the deficit: it\u2019s not about rising entitlement spending or any of the usual things the VSPs want to cut. It\u2019s based on an assumption that interest payments will rise.\n\nWell, you might say, that makes sense \u2014 as debt rises, so do interest payments. Isn\u2019t this about that debt spiral?\n\nWell, no. CBO shows the ratio of debt to GDP barely rising; just about all the rise in payments comes from an assumption that interest rates will rise. And as both Klein and I have tried to explain, we don\u2019t really know that; there\u2019s a plausible case that it\u2019s wrong.\n\nI\u2019m not attacking CBO, which needs to make some kind of rate assumption. But if you read someone trying to resurrect deficit panic, bear in mind that even the modest rise in the new projections is just an assumption, with nothing solid behind it.\n\nOh, and in other news: It appears that Obamacare is coming in 20 percent cheaper than originally projected.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150127082339, "BN": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 27, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/The Debt Non-Spiral ( 20150127 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "twitter": {"description": "Is the deficit scare coming back?
