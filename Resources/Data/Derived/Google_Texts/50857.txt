Mercedes Benz Fashion Week A New York Fashion Week runway show

New York Fashion Week is upon us. Though the official launch of the Spring 2014 collections is scheduled for Thursday, some designers are trying to beat the heat of more than 300 collections scheduled to take be revealed by showing earlier in the week. So consider the de facto beginning to be…today.

What was once an insider-only event, with even cameras banned, is now full-on public, with many shows being livestreamed. Viewers at home will have better seats than many editors smashed into fifth-row seats at the catwalks. The Wall Street Journal and Speakeasy will post daily reports, photos and videos.

The folks at YouTube are preparing to bring much of it into our living rooms or onto our mobile phones at this YouTube Spotlight page. YouTube will be offering links to livestreams as well as a plethora of do-try-this-at-home videos on how to assemble looks seen on the runways and attain the latest hair and make up styles (Prediction: One hairdo we’re likely to see is a continuance of the ponytail).

Other places to keep up to date are to follow reviews and see photos at Style.com, and to follow the designers showing at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week at Lincoln Center, for shows at Milk Studios. Still shots from many runways can be found at NowFashion.

And don’t stop at New York. The collections will then move on the London, Milan, and Paris. (And then, if you really can’t get enough, Moscow.)
