Donald Trump added another nine delegates to his arsenal early Tuesday morning by winning in the Northern Mariana Islands. Trump won the U.S. territory with 73 percent of the vote.

â€œI encouraged CNMI GOP voters to come out and exercise their right and vote for their preferred presidential nominee. I am overwhelmed by the turnout and their support for my endorsement of Mr. Donald Trump. I thank all the voters for participating in this important process. The attention the CNMI has received this presidential cycle from all the candidates has truly shown that our votes matter," Ralph Torres, governor of the Northern Mariana Islands said.
