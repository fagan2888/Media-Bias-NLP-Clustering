Diane Black\u2019s newly-proposed bill, the ICD-TEN Act (Increasing Clarity for Doctors by Transitioning Effectively Now) or Texas Republican Rep. Ted Poe\u2019s resurrection of the Cutting Costly Codes Act, Heritage wades into both waters with suggestions of enabling dual-coding and essentially doing away with any mandate that healthcare entities must convert to ICD-10.\n\n[Innovation Pulse: Hardest part for FHIR still ahead.]\n\nWhere Heritage hits hardest is in the treatment of what it considers 'weak arguments for ICD-10.' On the point that ICD-9 is outdated as a way to track clinical data, O\u2019Shea and Grimsley write thart \"there is no good evidence that a substantially more complex coding system makes the billing process any easier. In fact, just the opposite may be true.\"\n\nAddressing the oft-cited claims that the U.S. lags behind those developed nations already on ICD-10, meanwhile, the Heritage authors counter that \"currently only 10 countries employ ICD-10 in the reimbursement process, six of which have a single-payer healthcare system.\"\n\nAnd to the proponents advocating that ICD-10 improves patient care, O\u2019Shea and Grimsley write that \"if the goal is to collect data that will make it easier for researchers and health care analysts to retrieve that data, there are better ways. For example, SNOMED-CT, a coding system specifically designed to capture patient data for clinical purposes and facilitate sharing of such data, may be more ideal for coding and classifying disease than ICD-10.\"\n\nHeritage stops short of recommending SNOMED-CT in lieu of ICD-10, but perhaps the most interesting suggestion to Congress is that the U.S. \"develop a more appropriate coding system that makes the billing process less, not more, burdensome.\"\n\nIn the past, there has been chatter of opting instead for SNOMED-CT or even LOINC -- or, as American Medical Association incoming president Steven Stack, MD, said in an interview Healthcare IT News sister site Healthcare Finance, holding out for ICD-11.\n\nIn reality, however, the Department of Health and Human Services has not exactly given any of those options serious consideration \u2013 so it seems rather unlikely that the U.S. is going to completely change course, eschew ICD-10 entirely, and build our own alternative.\n\nOr am I wrong? Should we seriously consider starting from scratch to create an ideal, if not near-perfect, modern classification system that benefits payers, providers of all sizes and, most important, patients?\n\nRelated articles:\n\nICD-10: What's different this time?\n\n3 ways Congress could still kill ICD-10\n\nShould HHS delay ICD-10 penalty by two years?\n\nAnti-ICD-10 bill gets AMA support\n\nRead the Heritage Foundation report on the next page.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The list of organizations lining up against ICD-10 is growing -- as is the ferocity of their tone, as the latest in the fray is a conservative think tank that's calling on Congress to abandon the code set transition.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare IT News", "description": "The list of organizations lining up against ICD-10 is growing -- as is the ferocity of their tone, as the latest in the fray is a conservative think tank that's calling on Congress to abandon the code set transition.", "title": "ICD-10: Heritage Foundation strikes hard at mandate", "url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/icd-10-opposing-think-tank-strikes-hard-mandate", "image": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/heritage_fdn.png", "updated_time": "2015-05-19T16:57:37-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/icd-10-opposing-think-tank-strikes-hard-mandate", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/heritage_fdn.png"}, "description": "The list of organizations lining up against ICD-10 is growing -- as is the ferocity of their tone, as the latest in the fray is a conservative think tank that's calling on Congress to abandon the code set transition.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "ICD-10: Heritage Foundation strikes hard at mandate"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-19T10:18:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-19T16:57:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3692\"", "article_summary": "That would be the Heritage Foundation, with its new report titled, \"The New Disease Classification (ICD-10): Doctors and Patients will Pay,\" which makes some rather strong recommendations.\n\u201cWhile an updated diagnostic system for disease classification might be in order, there are significant costs and trade-offs,\" write Heritage authors John O\u2019Shea, MD, and John Grimsley in the report.\nWhere Heritage hits hardest is in the treatment of what it considers 'weak arguments for ICD-10.'\nAnti-ICD-10 bill gets AMA supportRead the Heritage Foundation report on the next page.\n\"In the interim,\" they add, \"Congress should allow providers to have the choice of continuing to use the current ICD-9 system or adopt the new ICD-10 system until the alternative reimbursement arrangement is complete.\""}
