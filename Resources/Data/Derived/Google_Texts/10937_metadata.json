Obama's numbers have declined across a variety of issues. His rating on immigration dropped significantly in the past six months, falling from 43 percent in June to 32 percent today. His approval rating on the economy, which had hovered in the low 40s for most of this year, is now at 31 percent -- the lowest received by Obama or any of his three presidential predecessors, according to Pew.\n\nHis approval on health care is at a record low of 37 percent, slightly below where it stood during the 2010 battle over passing the Affordable Care Act. His rating on foreign policy, a winning issue for him until this year, is now at just 34 percent, little changed from September. A bare majority still approves of the way Obama has handled the threat of terrorism, the poll found -- the only issue tested for which he did not earn a negative rating.\n\nThe downward trend in presidential approval ratings is not without precedent.\n\n\"Obama\u2019s second-term job ratings have followed a similar downward trajectory as those of his predecessor, George W. Bush. A year after his reelection, 36 percent approved of Bush\u2019s job performance, down from 48 percent in December 2004,\" according to the Pew Research report. \"In contrast, the two prior presidents who won reelection -- Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan -- enjoyed positive ratings over the course of the next year.\"\n\nThe results align with other recent polling. An NBC/Wall Street Journal survey released in late October put Obama's approval at an \"all-time low.\"\n\nPew Research surveyed 2,003 adults between Oct. 30 and Nov. 6, using live phone interviews.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Obama's Handshakes Around The World Obama's Handshakes Around The World\n\n1 of 30 Raul Castro, President Of Cuba In this image from TV, US President Barack Obama shakes hands with Cuban President Raul Castro at the FNB Stadium in Soweto, South Africa, in the rain for a memorial service for former South African President Nelson Mandela, Tuesday Dec. 10, 2013.
