JAMES SCHRAGER: Hollywood does a horrible job of understanding the essence of business, although when it comes to a movie about the movie business, the Steve Martin epic, “Bofinger” does a great job of an inside look at what really happens—kinda.

For a real business, “The Social Network,” even though fictionalized, provides eerily accurate glimpses inside a new venture. Examples include: the way the game changes as the business grows, causing some key early employees to be cast aside; how good advice can come from strange places, including former CEOs who lost it all; how control matters more than money; and that at times, that it all comes down to a nasty lawsuit.

And don’t miss the scene where the Winklevoss twins chat up Larry Summers looking for legal assistance against Mark Zuckerberg.
