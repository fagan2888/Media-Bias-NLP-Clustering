When Apple’s new streaming service launches at the end of the month, Taylor Swift’s 1989 will not be on it.

The superstar’s latest release was the best-selling album of 2014, and has sold close to 5 million copies since it first came out in November. It’s not currently available on any subscription streaming service, and it’ll stay that way even after Apple’s new service launches, according to BuzzFeed. Apple Music will just carry the singer’s back catalog, which can already be accessed on competitive streaming services like Rhapsody and Tidal.

For a time, it looked like Taylor Swift was never, ever, ever getting back together with streaming music services again. Last July, Swift wrote passionately on the state of the music business in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, saying “Valuable things should be paid for.”

The singer then removed her entire catalogue from Spotify in November, telling TIME, “I think there should be an inherent value placed on art. I didn’t see that happening, perception-wise, when I put my music on Spotify. Everybody’s complaining about how music sales are shrinking, but nobody’s changing the way they’re doing things. They keep running towards streaming, which is, for the most part, what has been shrinking the numbers of paid album sales.”
