House Speaker Paul Ryan, who will be chairing the Republican National Convention in July, has a warning for the candidates: Get your act together now."I learned in running with Mitt Romney if you wait until after the convention to all of a sudden get your act together and then produce an agenda in, say August or September, it's too late," Ryan told "CBS This Morning" on Tuesday.Without mentioning any of the three remaining candidates' names specifically, Ryan said he and House Republicans are not worried about who becomes the eventual nominee, as that is out of their control.Instead, they are focused on offering their own agenda early enough so people can talk about it before November's general election.The agenda includes foreign policy, replacing Obamacare, tax reform, and regulatory relief, said Ryan.Ryan told Fox News' "America's Newsroom" in a later interview that he has spoken with Donald Trump, John Kasich and Ted Cruz, and plans to roll out the GOP's agenda in Cleveland regardless about who the eventual nominee will be, so it's not "about any particular personality. It's about ideas and solutions."But he refused to comment on a question from show co-host Bill Hemmer about Trump's potential impact on the party."I'm the chair of the convention so I'm neutral on this," said the Wisconsin Republican. "I don't worry about how that's settled out whether it comes one who gets the 1,237 before the convention or the delegates come up with the nominee."We give the country a clear choice. This is the kind of clarifying election we are desperate to have."At the end of the convention, "we'll have a standard bearer and one of those people will be running for president," said Ryan. "We are developing the standard. The standard is what are our principles, solutions and ideas so our country has a clear choice in the fall to make."But, he insisted that standard bearer won't be him, even if someone puts his name in for the nomination."I would say remove my name," said Ryan. "I made a conscious decision in 2015 not to run for president. I believe we in the country decided years ago not to have people coming out of conventions where delegates make the decisions. We set up the system so voters would inform delegates how the party selection is made."Ryan also said he is careful not to take anything for granted when it comes to making sure the GOP retains control of the House."I always run scared, [but] I personally think we'll be fined," said Ryan, but still, "there are issues we won't get settled with a liberal president."
