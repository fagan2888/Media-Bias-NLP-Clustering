Russell\u2019s \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d won the Screen Actors Guild award for outstanding cast Saturday, setting up the con-artist comedy as the film to beat at the Academy Awards.\n\nSaturday\u2019s ceremony was a somewhat low-key affair with a few memorable speeches but no earthquakes in a rapidly solidifying award season. The night\u2019s winners \u2014 Matthew McConaughey (\u201cDallas Buyers Club\u201d), Cate Blanchett (\u201cBlue Jasmine\u201d), Lupita Nyong\u2019o (\u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d) and Jared Leto (\u201cDallas Buyers Club\u201d) \u2014 are each probably the favorites of their categories.\n\n\u201cIt really shines a great light on this bull ride we call acting,\u201d said McConaughey, honored for lead actor in the Texas HIV drama. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to recently find some characters that I can humble myself to their humanities and get feverishly drunk on their obsessions.\u201d\n\nComing two days after Academy Award nominations, the SAG Awards are particularly monitored for predicting Oscar momentum. The outstanding cast category, the night\u2019s top honor, was a showdown between \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d and \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d victory lap continued as the show took honors for outstanding dramatic cast and for lead actor Bryan Cranston. For his indelible performance as teacher-turned-meth dealer, Cranston added his second lead actor SAG Award, to go with his recent Golden Globe win and his numerous Emmys.\n\nThe ABC sitcom \u201cModern Family\u201d enjoyed another round of awards, winning for ensemble in a comedy series and taking the male actor in a comedy series honor for Ty Burrell.\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus won for female actor in a comedy series for \u201cVeep.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "McConaughey, Blanchett, \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d win at SAG Awards", "title": "McConaughey, Blanchett, \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d win at SAG Awards", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/18/mcconaughey-blanchett-american-hustle-win-at-sag-awards/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140118__00002201_H16750453p1.jpg", "height": 491}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140118__00002201_H16750453p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-18T20:40:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T07:59:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "For his indelible performance as teacher-turned-meth dealer, Cranston added his second lead actor SAG Award, to go with his recent Golden Globe win and his numerous Emmys.\nThe ABC sitcom \u201cModern Family\u201d enjoyed another round of awards, winning for ensemble in a comedy series and taking the male actor in a comedy series honor for Ty Burrell.\n\u201cIt really shines a great light on this bull ride we call acting,\u201d said McConaughey, honored for lead actor in the Texas HIV drama.\nDavid O.
