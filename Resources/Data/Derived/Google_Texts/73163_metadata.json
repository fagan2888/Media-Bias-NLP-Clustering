Banyan Finance is the leader in the fast-growing Casualty Medical Plan segment, which offers physicians and other medical services providers, including MRI facilities, hospitals, and ambulatory surgery centers, an alternative reimbursement source to traditional health insurance for uninsured accident victims.\n\nRoss E. Elgart, Banyan Finance\u2019s CEO, said, \u201cMedical services providers accepting Casualty Medical Plans are able to treat accident victims who lack traditional insurance coverage while eliminating the risk of lost reimbursements and significantly reducing the risk of lower reimbursements due to the uncertainty and length of personal injury litigation. This is critically important to the practice economics of many providers, who find themselves in a state of constant unpredictability with regard to reimbursement rates from government-sponsored health plans at the same time that the Affordable Care Act is creating considerable uncertainty in the medical services community as a whole.\u201d\n\nElgart noted that:\n\nUnlike traditional insurance, companies in the Casualty Medical Plan industry do not charge the patients a cash premium.\n\nUnlike traditional factoring companies, Casualty Medical Plan companies share in the ultimate reimbursement received with the contracted medical services providers.\n\nBecause of its diversified capital sources and deep industry experience, Banyan Finance is typically able to guarantee minimum reimbursements to Banyan Casualty Medical Plan participants in excess of traditional insurance reimbursements.\n\nBanyan Finance is currently operating in 38 states. Its new expansion markets are: El Paso and Northwest Texas; Oklahoma City-Tulsa in Oklahoma; and Shreveport-Ruston and Northern Louisiana.\n\nAbout Banyan Finance, LLC\n\nFounded in 2007, Banyan Finance is the leading resource in the Casualty Medical Plan segment for physicians and other medical service providers.
