Slot receiver Wes Welker (concussion), cornerback Kayvon Webster (fractured thumb) and defensive lineman Derek Wolfe (seizure symptoms) didn’t practice for the Broncos on Friday.

They missed the entire week, so in his press conference Friday, Broncos coach John Fox will announce all three players are out for their game Sunday against the 2-12 Texans at Houston.

Cornerback Champ Bailey will be listed as probable to play against the Texans.

The rookie Webster had thumb surgery Monday and is expected to return to practice next week, if on a limited basis with a club-like cast on his right hand. Welker and Wolfe must first receive doctor’s clearance to practice.

The perfect scenario for Welker and Wolfe is the Broncos earn a first-round playoff bye, which would increase their chances of playing in the team’s first postseason game in the second round, on either Jan. 11 or 12.
