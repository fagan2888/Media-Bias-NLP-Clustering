Coulter praised the first of Sowell\u2019s columns in a tweet Wednesday.\n\nGod bless Thomas Sowell! The problem with Ted Cruz \u2013 http://t.co/NOf1AAeAuI \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 19, 2014\n\nLater, in an appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cHannity\u201d Wednesday night, Coulter doubled down on her praise of Sowell\u2019s anti-Cruz column: \u201cI never push anyone else\u2019s column but mine. Today everyone has got to read Thomas Sowell\u2019s article.\u201d\n\nDuring the \u201cHannity\u201d segment, Coulter attacked tea party groups for being filled with \u201cshysters\u201d and \u201cconmen,\u201d naming specifically the Senate Conservatives Fund as an example. The Senate Conservatives Fund was a key outside group that supported Cruz in his fight to \u201cDefund Obamacare\u201d last fall, which ultimately led to a government shutdown.\n\n\u201cAnd these people are just trying to get money off good Americans by saying we\u2019re going after \u2018establishment Republicans,\u201d Coulter complained about tea party groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund. \u201cHow about going after Democrats?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not trust anyone who says they are trying to defeat \u2018establishment Republicans,'\u201d she added.\n\nWithout mentioning Cruz by name, Coulter railed against tea partiers who fail to understand that the \u201conly way to repeal Obamacare is to elect Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not to be fighting against Republicans,\u201d she said.\n\nCoulter seems to be referring to Cruz\u2019s recent threat of a filibuster earlier this month when a House bill to raise the debt ceiling came to the Senate floor. The Senate Republican leadership wanted to avoid a politically perilous fight over the debt ceiling so they could continue to focus on Obamacare\u2019s failures heading into November\u2019s midterm elections. Instead of allowing the bill to pass with only Democratic support, Cruz\u2019s threat forced several Republicans to join the Democratic caucus in voting for cloture, or face a debt ceiling showdown and a possible government shutdown.\n\nCoulter has been effusive in her praise of Cruz in the past. In a September column titled \u201cCruz Control Should be Standard on GOP Models,\u201d Coulter slammed Republican critics of Cruz\u2019s \u201cDefund Obamacare\u201d strategy, which some conservatives pointed out at the time couldn\u2019t possibly succeed and very well could harm the GOP by leading to a government shutdown.\n\n\u201cBarry Goldwater didn\u2019t \u2018have the votes\u2019 when Ronald Reagan launched the conservative movement with his \u2018A Time for Choosing\u2019 speech in 1964,\u201d Coulter wrote. \u201cBut he galvanized conservatives and gave them the hope of future victories. Does Rep. Peter King think Reagan was a fraud who lost influence in the Republican Party with that speech?
