That page drew millions of followers and became one of the main engines for organizing the 2011 anti-Mubarak uprising in Tahrir Square.\n\nA cartoonist, Makhlouf, drew a cartoon dedicated to el-Sabbagh showing a flower confronting the barrel of a gun.\n\n\u201cPeople were very sympathetic when they learned\u201d of el-Sabbagh\u2019s death, said El-Masry, el-Sabbagh\u2019s friend. She added: \u201cWhen they kill a woman with flowers among about 30 protesters, it is clear that the regime \u2026 is only protecting itself.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Images of shot Egypt protester revive criticism of police", "title": "Images of shot Egypt protester revive criticism of police", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Images of shot Egypt protester revive criticism of police", "title": "Images of shot Egypt protester revive criticism of police", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/25/images_of_shot_egypt_protester_revive_criticism_of_police/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/mideast-egypt.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Images of shot Egypt protester revive criticism of police", "title": "Images of shot Egypt protester revive criticism of police", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/mideast-egypt.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah El Deeb", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPeople were very sympathetic when they learned\u201d of el-Sabbagh\u2019s death, said El-Masry, el-Sabbagh\u2019s friend.\nA labor rights activist with a history of involvement in protests that predated the country\u2019s 2011 revolution, el-Sabbagh was also a poet and mother of a 5-year-old boy.\nHer death renewed criticism of police use of force and the government\u2019s insistence that its crackdown is reserved for terrorists and violent protesters.\nThat page drew millions of followers and became one of the main engines for organizing the 2011 anti-Mubarak uprising in Tahrir Square.\nShe added: \u201cWhen they kill a woman with flowers among about 30 protesters, it is clear that the regime \u2026 is only protecting itself.\u201d"}
