John Cornyn is a principled lawmaker whose brand of Texas conservatism makes him the best choice in this eight-way GOP primary race for the Senate.\n\nCornyn is the deputy GOP Senate leader and a senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee. Holding these positions of influence can only bode well for Texas.\n\nCornyn, 62, also has long supported immigration reform, which we think is important, though at times in recent years he\u2019s not been as much a problem solver on this issue as we\u2019d like.\n\nStill, unlike his challengers, he\u2019s committed to governing, having recently won additional funds for rape test kits, and he\u2019s a champion for reforming drug-sentencing laws. Cornyn has clear conservative fiscal stripes; he co-sponsored a Balanced Budget Amendment and opposed the Affordable Care Act before it became law.\n\nThe other candidates are less informed, little known and generally offer extreme, vague or impractical ideas. Several are particularly intemperate.\n\nSouth Texas businessman Chris Mapp, 53, told this editorial board that ranchers should be allowed to shoot on sight anyone illegally crossing the border on to their land, referred to such people as \u201cwetbacks,\u201d and called the president a \u201csocialist son of a bitch.\u201d Ken Cope, 60, a retired aerospace executive, wants to build a fence along the entire border and deport anyone who fails to learn English. U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman has run a clownish campaign with the baseless claim that Cornyn supports the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAttorney Linda Vega, 47, and small-business owners Dwayne Stovall, 48, Curt Cleaver, 47, also are on the ballot. They didn\u2019t respond to interview requests, and their questionnaire answers give us pause about their ability to lead. Reid Reasor neither attended the interview nor filled out the questionnaire.\n\nThe winner of this March 4 GOP primary will face a Democratic opponent in the fall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He is a principled lawmaker whose brand of Texas conservatism makes him the best choice in this race.", "og": {"description": "He is a principled lawmaker whose brand of Texas conservatism makes him the best choice in this race.", "title": "Editorial: We recommend John Cornyn in GOP primary for the U.S. Senate", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20140216-editorial-we-recommend-john-cornyn-in-gop-primary-for-the-u.s.-senate.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140216-cornyndig.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/cornyndig.jpg", "height": 451}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-02-17T03:54:32Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-02-17T03:54:32Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Editorial: We recommend John Cornyn in GOP primary for the U.S. Senate\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20140216-editorial-we-recommend-john-cornyn-in-gop-primary-for-the-u.s.-senate.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140216-cornyndig.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/cornyndig.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1442197\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-17T03:54:32Z\", \"section\": \"Editorials\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140216-cornyndig.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/cornyndig.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-02-17T03:54:32Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4083\"", "article_summary": "Sen.
