They did great things in the Middle Ages, though.\u201d\n\nDawkins is known for pushing his provocative rhetorical style too far, providing ample ammunition for his critics, and already I\u2019ve seen my fellow Christians seize the opportunity to rail against the evils of atheism.\n\nAs tempting as it is to classify Dawkins\u2019 views as representative of all atheists, I can\u2019t bring myself to do it.\n\nI can\u2019t bring myself to do it because I know just how frustrating and unfair it is when atheists point to the most extreme, vitriolic voices within Christianity and proclaim that they are representative of the whole.\n\nSo, atheists, I say we make a deal: How about we Christians agree not to throw this latest Richard Dawkins thing in your face and you atheists agree not to throw the next Pat Robertson thing in ours?\n\nNow I\u2019m not saying we just let these destructive words and actions go\u2014not at all. It\u2019s important for both believers and atheists to decry irresponsible views and hateful rhetoric, especially from within our own communities.\n\n(Believe me. There are plenty of Christians who raise hell every time Robertson says something homophobic or a celebrity pastor somewhere says something misogynistic.)\n\nREAD MORE: Why millennials are leaving the church\n\nBut what if we resist the urge to use the latest celebrity gaffe as an excuse to paint one another with broad brushes?\n\nWhat if, instead of engaging the ideas of the most extreme and irrational Christians and atheists, we engaged the ideas of the most reasonable, the most charitable, the most respectful and respected?\n\nOnly then can we avoid these shallow ad hominem attacks and instead engage in substantive debates that bring our true differences and our true commonalities to light.\n\nIt\u2019s harder to go this route, and it takes more work and patience, but I\u2019m convinced that both Christians and atheists are interested in the truth and in searching for it with integrity, without taking the easy way out.\n\nPope Francis took a step in that direction this week with a letter in a Rome newspaper responding directly to questions posed by its atheist director and inviting respectful open dialog between nonbelievers and Christians.\n\nREAD MORE: Why millennials need the church\n\nSo, yes, Richard Dawkins is an atheist. But so are authors Greg Epstein and Susan Jacoby. So is my friend and fellow blogger Hemant Mehta. So is Sir Ian McKellen. So is ethicist Peter Singer, who may or may not be the best example.\n\nAnd yes, Pat Robertson is a Christian. But so is Nelson Mandela. So is acclaimed geneticist Francis Collins. So is Nobel Peace Prize winner Leymah Gbowee. So is Barack Obama. So is Stephen Colbert.\n\nAnd I'm willing to bet that the same collective groan emitted by millions of Christians each time Pat Robertson says something embarrassing on TV sounds a lot like the collective groan emitted by millions of atheists when Richard Dawkins rants on Twitter.\n\nStill, in the end, it\u2019s not about who has the most charismatic or generous personalities in their roster, nor about who has the most \u201ccrazies.\u201d It\u2019s about the truth.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about the truth, and with the people who most consistently and graciously point us toward it.\n\nRachel Held Evans is the author of \"A Year of Biblical Womanhood\" and \"Evolving in Monkey Town.\" Evans blogs at rachelheldevans.com, and the views expressed in this column belong to her.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Opinion by Rachel Held Evans, special to CNN (CNN) -- Famed atheist Richard Dawkins has been rightfully criticized this week for saying the \u201cmild pedophilia\u201d he and other English children experienced in the 1950s \u201cdidn\u2019t cause any lasting harm.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Hey atheists, let\u2019s make a deal", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/14/hey-atheists-lets-make-a-deal/", "image": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/sect/blogs/fb/belief.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Opinion by Rachel Held Evans, special to CNN\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- Famed atheist Richard Dawkins has been rightfully criticized this week for saying the \u201cmild pedophilia\u201d he and other English children experienced in the 1950s \u201cdidn\u2019t cause any lasting harm.", "title": "Hey atheists, let\u2019s make a deal"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "atheism, christianity, faith, atheists, christians, pat robertson, rachel held evans, richard dawkins", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/14/hey-atheists-lets-make-a-deal/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda825\"", "article_summary": "As tempting as it is to classify Dawkins\u2019 views as representative of all atheists, I can\u2019t bring myself to do it.\nREAD MORE: Why millennials need the churchSo, yes, Richard Dawkins is an atheist.\nAnd yes, Pat Robertson is a Christian.\nSo, atheists, I say we make a deal: How about we Christians agree not to throw this latest Richard Dawkins thing in your face and you atheists agree not to throw the next Pat Robertson thing in ours?\nIt\u2019s important for both believers and atheists to decry irresponsible views and hateful rhetoric, especially from within our own communities."}
