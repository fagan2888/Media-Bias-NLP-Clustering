When McGregor tried a takedown, Diaz quickly forced him to tap out on the ground.\n\n\u201cI knew I was the superior boxer, with superior kickboxing, with superior jiu-jitsu,\u201d said Diaz, who had lost five of his previous 10 fights. \u201cNothing surprised me except for that I got hit at all. I think with a full camp, I would have been flawless.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Tate (18-5) became the third 135-pound champion in UFC history by beating Holm (10-1), the woman who knocked out Rousey in November. Holm appeared to be out cold when Tate finally released her from the choke to celebrate.\n\n\u201cNot many people wouldn\u2019t tap out,\u201d Tate said. \u201cShe went out like a champion. \u2026 She\u2019s tougher than nails. She really pulled the most out of me and made me a better fighter tonight.\u201d\n\nThe main event was the greatest moment in the career of Diaz, a pugnacious veteran from a notorious fighting family in Stockton, California. Diaz had lost three of his past five fights, but his size and power abruptly finished McGregor, who had boasted of his plans to hold championships in multiple weight classes.\n\nThe loss was McGregor\u2019s first since November 2010, and it put a blemish on the loquacious Irish face of the UFC and the best-paid fighter in this rapidly growing sport.\n\nMcGregor was somber but reflective at the post-fight news conference, which often isn\u2019t attended by losing fighters. He thinks his next bout will be a featherweight title defense, but he vowed to return to higher weight classes.\n\n\u201cI will never shy away from defeat,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cThis is part of the game. I had many chances to not do this and sit and wait, but I went in. I took the fight and it didn\u2019t pay off. This is the fight business. It\u2019s another day. I will come back.\u201d\n\nMcGregor agreed to fight Diaz at the welterweight limit when 155-pound lightweight champion Rafael Dos Anjos dropped out of his matchup with McGregor due to a foot injury. McGregor set a new UFC record with his $1 million disclosed purse for this fight, and he predicted a comfortable win over Diaz, comparing the veteran to a gazelle about to be eaten by a lion.\n\nInstead, McGregor got bit.\n\n\u201c(McGregor) punches hard,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cHe\u2019s a hard-hitting little guy, but nothing I never felt before.\u201d\n\nThe penultimate fight at UFC 196 was a thrilling clash of styles, and Tate fought until the waning minutes before finally using her superior ground game to outstanding effect.\n\n\u201cI feel like we had a great game plan,\u201d Tate said. \u201cI had to be patient. She\u2019s very dangerous. She\u2019s capable of catching anyone at any moment. She\u2019s a very calculated fighter.\u201d\n\nFor 4 1/2 rounds, Holm appeared to be winning her first fight since she dethroned Rousey with a stunning head-kick knockout. Although Tate controlled the second round on the ground and got close to a finish, Holm picked apart Tate with punches for the other three rounds.\n\nEverything changed when Tate finally landed a desperate takedown attempt and got Holm\u2019s back with 2 minutes left.\n\nHolm fought desperately to get out, but the veteran wrestler sunk in a choke that she didn\u2019t let go until she was the champion.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the right move to shake her off my back,\u201d Holm said. \u201cIt was stupid, and I should have fought it off more. When you\u2019re up against a wrestler like that, of course that threat is there for a takedown, and you have to recognize it.\u201d\n\nTate was overwhelmed after finally reaching her longtime goal. She hasn\u2019t lost a fight since 2013 but realized this might be her last chance to fight for the belt.\n\n\u201cMy mentality is, it doesn\u2019t matter how many times you get knocked down in a fight,\u201d Tate said. \u201cIt\u2019s how many times you get back up. I think that\u2019s something a champion does.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nate Diaz beats Conor McGregor, Miesha Tate takes title from Holly Holm at UFC 196", "title": "Nate Diaz beats Conor McGregor, Miesha Tate takes title from Holly Holm at UFC 196", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/05/nate-diaz-beats-conor-mcgregor-miesha-tate-takes-title-from-holly-holm-at-ufc-196/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160305__Nate-Diazp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160305__Nate-Diazp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-05T23:34:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:16:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMy mentality is, it doesn\u2019t matter how many times you get knocked down in a fight,\u201d Tate said.\nEverything changed when Tate finally landed a desperate takedown attempt and got Holm\u2019s back with 2 minutes left.\nHolm appeared to be out cold when Tate finally released her from the choke to celebrate.\n\u201cI knew I was the superior boxer, with superior kickboxing, with superior jiu-jitsu,\u201d said Diaz, who had lost five of his previous 10 fights.\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 With a pair of rear naked chokes that finished two celebrated champions, Nate Diaz and Miesha Tate both accomplished the improbable in a pair of sport-shaking victories at UFC 196."}
