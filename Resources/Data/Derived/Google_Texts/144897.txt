CHICAGO (AP) - Northwestern Medicine in Chicago has opened a center devoted to the treatment of Huntington’s disease.

The Northwestern hospital system and Northwestern University’s School of Medicine announced Wednesday that the center will focus on patient care and research.

Huntington’s is a progressive, hereditary disorder that affects about 30,000 U.S. patients and has no known cure. Northwestern’s center will offer participation in clinical trials and allow the collaboration of experts in neurology, psychiatry, genetics and social work.

Dr. Danny Bega of Northwestern says the goal is “to improve the quality of care for patients in every stage” of Huntington’s disease.
