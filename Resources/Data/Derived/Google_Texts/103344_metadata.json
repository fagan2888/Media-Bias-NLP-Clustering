If true, that presents a troubling conflict of interest for the sheriff\u2019s office in conducting an unbiased review. At the least, it presents the appearance of a problem.\n\nIn a story by The Denver Post\u2019s Zahira Torres, one parent suggested that an outside agency should conduct an investigation.\n\nYet Sheriff David Walcher, who recently took over the office from Grayson Robinson, dismissed the idea almost immediately.\n\n\u201cWe are doing the investigation, period,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need someone to come in and do our investigation.\u201d\n\nWalcher said his office will work with a third party to review the investigation after it is complete, including the events that led up to the shooting, law enforcement\u2019s response and any lessons or changes that can be made.\n\nLaw enforcement\u2019s response that day appeared to be fast and heroic. But Coloradans have seen what can happen when incidents like this aren\u2019t given an independent review.\n\nThe Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office conducted its own investigation after the 1999 Columbine High attack. The review was roundly and rightly criticized for ignoring key points \u2014 including the length of time it took law enforcement to reach the victims.\n\nThen-Gov. Bill Owens\u2019 commission found the sheriff\u2019s office did not adequately respond to the massacre and had ignored warning signs involving the shooters.\n\nWhy risk another such controversy?\n\nIt would serve everyone to have an outside agency conduct an independent investigation given the role at the school played by the Arapahoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Seek outside review of Arapahoe High School shooting", "title": "Seek outside review of Arapahoe High School shooting", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/28/seek-outside-review-of-arapahoe-high-school-shooting/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140228__Arapahoe-High-School-shootingp1.jpg", "height": 499}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140228__Arapahoe-High-School-shootingp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-28T11:51:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T15:15:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c9b\"", "article_summary": "Parents of students at Arapahoe High School have raised legitimate issues about the school\u2019s lack of communication about December\u2019s shooting and whether safety issues have been addressed.\nIt would serve everyone to have an outside agency conduct an independent investigation given the role at the school played by the Arapahoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nBill Owens\u2019 commission found the sheriff\u2019s office did not adequately respond to the massacre and had ignored warning signs involving the shooters.\nIf true, that presents a troubling conflict of interest for the sheriff\u2019s office in conducting an unbiased review.\nThe Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office conducted its own investigation after the 1999 Columbine High attack."}
