Cuts as these major medical research hospitals is sure to slow advancements in treatment and will stall the development of new cures.\n\nOnce again, thanks Obamacare!\n\nWhile we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s not forget to thank Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid for joining forces with Obama to give the government more control of our healthcare system! On behalf of the 1,000 employees of Vanderbilt hospital who lost their jobs, and on behalf of an entire nation who can look forward to long wait times and rationing of care. And higher insurance premiums to top it all.\n\nPaying more, getting less\u2013that\u2019s the legacy of this big government train wreck about which Pelosi so memorably informed us, \u201cWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what\u2019s in it.\u201d Now we\u2019re finding out. And what a horrifying discovery it is.\n\nOne last time\u2013thanks Obamacare!\n\nNathan Harden is editor of The College Fix and author of the book SEX & GOD AT YALE: Porn, Political Correctness, and a Good Education Gone Bad.\n\nFollow Nathan on Twitter @NathanHarden", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The College Fix", "description": "A major center of advanced treatment and medical research has been forced to eliminate more than 1,000 jobs.
