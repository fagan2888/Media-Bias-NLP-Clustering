Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said the trajectory of China\u2019s foreign and domestic policy decisions are \u201cfundamentally at odds\u201d with a nation aspiring to become a leading power and \u201cthreaten to undermine\u201d the U.S.-China relationship along with security across the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\u201cBeijing\u2019s foreign policy has taken an aggressive and disturbing turn,\u201d he said during an event at The Heritage Foundation Thursday.\n\nGardner, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, said the president must \u201cdemonstrate leadership and deliver a strong message\u201d that the U.S. will not be \u201cdeterred by lawless behavior.\u201d\n\nHe noted China\u2019s recent uptick in human rights abuses, including the repression and coercion of groups engaged in political advocacy, the illegal detention of more than 200 human rights lawyers, and the continued harassment of religious and ethnic minorities.\n\n\u201cWe simply cannot accept this type of behavior from a nation that wants to be thought as a genuine, global partner of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong prioritized discussions of climate control and military cooperation, the leaders are expected to announce the world\u2019s first cyber arms control agreement that would prevent either nation from attacking the other\u2019s critical infrastructure during peacetime.\n\nThough the accord would address attacks on power grids and cellphone networks, it would not address the high-level forms of hacking China allegedly used against the U.S. to steal intellectual property and personal data from millions of government employees, according to The New York Times.\n\nGardner cited a report from the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property that found China accounts for about 50-to-80 percent of international intellectual property theft cases, which costs the U.S. economy over $300 billion annually.\n\nWednesday, a day before Xi\u2019s expected arrival, the Office of Personnel Management announced the hackers who breached its security database and stole 22 million personnel records also seized the fingerprints of 5.6 million government employees.\n\nWhile U.S. officials have privately named China as the perpetrator, Obama has remained publicly silent. President Xi denied involvement in the hacks earlier this week while speaking to business and technology executives in Seattle, the Chinese president\u2019s first stop in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government does not engage in theft of commercial secrets in any form, nor does it encourage or support Chinese companies to engage in such practices in any way,\u201d he told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nGardner dismissed the shifted blame and called on the president to personally reprimand President Xi for the cyberattacks during his visit, which he called a \u201cserious threat\u201d to U.S. national and economic security.\n\nDespite his skepticism, Gardner called the U.S.-China relationship the most \u201cconsequential\u201d bilateral relationship of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cDecisions made by Washington and Beijing will reverberate far beyond our two capitals, they\u2019ll reverberate around the world, and that\u2019s why we must get this relationship right.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama hosted President Xi Jinping of China Thursday evening for a private dinner intended to stem recent tensions between the two nations.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Barack Obama hosted President Xi Jinping of China Thursday evening for a private dinner intended to stem recent tensions between the two nations.", "title": "Obama, Xi to Wade Through Talks of Improved Relations", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150924_ObamaXi_Johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JsBTgm"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Barack Obama hosted President Xi Jinping of China Thursday evening for a private dinner intended to stem recent tensions between the two nations.", "title": "Obama, Xi to Wade Through Talks of Improved Relations", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150924_ObamaXi_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Asia", "published_time": "2015-09-24T21:38:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Xi Jinping, China, cyber security, cyberattack, South China Sea, Cory Gardner"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1c57\"", "article_summary": "Despite his skepticism, Gardner called the U.S.-China relationship the most \u201cconsequential\u201d bilateral relationship of the 21st century.\nGardner dismissed the shifted blame and called on the president to personally reprimand President Xi for the cyberattacks during his visit, which he called a \u201cserious threat\u201d to U.S. national and economic security.\nFresh off the heels of Pope Francis\u2019 historic Washington, D.C., visit, President Barack Obama hosted President Xi Jinping of China Thursday evening for a private dinner intended to ease recent tensions between the two nations.\n\u201cBeijing\u2019s foreign policy has taken an aggressive and disturbing turn,\u201d he said during an event at The Heritage Foundation Thursday.\nWhile U.S. officials have privately named China as the perpetrator, Obama has remained publicly silent."}
