However, Riggs tried to fake out deputies and took off again, fishtailing up and down country roads. He almost hit power poles and trees before a dead end road forced him out of his car.\n\n\"He kind of swerved around a little bit at that fence and through there,\u201d Leanna Sivils said. \"He nosed down into the hump of hay.\"\n\nThen, Riggs took off running, and in Leanna's opinion, the wrong way.\n\n\"He took off running that way, and that was stupid. He had to cross my donkey pen and over the back fence to go there. He could have got lost down there,\u201d she said.\n\n\"So you're saying he went the wrong way?\" asked News 9\u2019s Joleen Chaney.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said.\n\nLeanna wasn't the only one watching all this unfold. So was Sky News 9.\n\n\"An officer comes through and says which way did he go? I said, \u2018He's laying right over there.\u2019\u201d she said. \"The donkeys are looking right at him.\"\n\nRiggs was taken into custody.\n\n\"First you park in my horse pen,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then you go...\"\n\n\u201cTo the donkey pen.\u201d\n\n\"I can't believe some of these people. They do something bad and then come onto a dead end road,\u201d continued Sivils. \u201cThat is really crazy.\"\n\nRiggs is facing several charges including eluding authorities. Deputies also found a loaded syringe inside the center console of his car.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A school is put on lockdown after a high speed chase that ends in a donkey\u2019s pen.", "author": "Joleen Chaney", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31739223/cleveland-co-police-chase-suspect-found-hiding-in-ironic-location", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10341130_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A school is put on lockdown after a high speed chase that ends in a donkey\u2019s pen.", "title": "Cleveland Co.
