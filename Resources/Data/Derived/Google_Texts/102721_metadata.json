Emergency medical technicians told the newspaper they witnessed four officers beat a man being carried away in a stretcher in handcuffs, after he spit and cursed at the officers.\n\nOfficers responded by punching the patient in the face multiple times, pulling him off the stretcher and onto the ground, and then throwing him back into the stretcher, according to a written report by EMT officers to the Fire Department of New York. All the while, the patient remained helpless, restrained in both handcuffs and foot shackles. An EMT who reported the incident to the Fire Department of New York said in the report that he and another EMT who corroborated the story had to intervene to break up the beating. He said the patient \u201csustained injuries to the head and face\u201d that were treated in the ambulance.\n\nThe EMTs were first called to retrieve the patient from a Brooklyn police precinct and bring him to a hospital on the evening of July 20. The patient was described as \u201cemotionally disturbed,\u201d \u201ccombative\u201d and banging his head against the wall.\n\nA representative for the New York Police Department told Reuters on Tuesday that the Internal Affairs unit was investigating the incident. He declined to confirm the details of the incident.\n\nThe report comes in the wake of the death of Eric Garner hours after police held the asthamtic man accused of selling cigarettes in an illegal chokehold. The death was deemed a homicide by the medical examiner. Since then, numerous reports have surfaced of officers dragging a woman naked out of her home, putting another man in a chokehold after punching him in the face, and putting a pregnant woman in a chokehold for illegally grilling on the sidewalk.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "EMT workers said they had to intervene to stop police from beating the restrained patient.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "EMT workers said they had to intervene to stop police from beating the restrained patient.", "title": "Medical Workers Say NYPD Cops Beat Man Shackled In A Stretcher", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/08/06/3468160/medical-workers-say-nypd-cops-beat-man-shackled-in-a-stretcher/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/NYPDBadge.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "EMT workers said they had to intervene to stop police from beating the restrained patient.", "title": "Medical Workers Say NYPD Cops Beat Man Shackled In A Stretcher", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/NYPDBadge-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@NicFlatow", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/NYPDBadge.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/NYPDBadge.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-06T11:27:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b82\"", "article_summary": "Justice Medical Workers Say NYPD Cops Beat Man Shackled In A Stretcher CREDIT: Dave Hosford via FlickrThe New York Daily News has uncovered yet another allegation of egregious force by New York Police Department officers.\nEmergency medical technicians told the newspaper they witnessed four officers beat a man being carried away in a stretcher in handcuffs, after he spit and cursed at the officers.\nA representative for the New York Police Department told Reuters on Tuesday that the Internal Affairs unit was investigating the incident.\nHe said the patient \u201csustained injuries to the head and face\u201d that were treated in the ambulance.\nThe report comes in the wake of the death of Eric Garner hours after police held the asthamtic man accused of selling cigarettes in an illegal chokehold."}
