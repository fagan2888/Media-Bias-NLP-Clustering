Weil, associate chief for clinical affairs in the general internal medicine division at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The hospital is one of five in the Partners HealthCare system that began offering the waiver in April after testing a limited version.\n\n\u201cIt gets patients to the care they need much quicker and prevents them from clinically declining at home,\u201d Weil said. If patients can spend less time in the hospital, he said, that frees up resources for sicker patients and saves money for Medicare because nursing-home care or home-health care is cheaper than a hospital stay.\n\nMedicare\u2019s three-day rule has frustrated seniors who don\u2019t qualify for nursing-home coverage because they were in the hospital under observation care rather than being admitted. The number of observation patients ineligible for Medicare-covered nursing-home care has shot up by 88 percent in just six years, to 1.8 million in 2012.\n\nOfficials have said that only Congress can change the rule.\n\nDiane Paulson, the senior attorney at Greater Boston Legal Services who is handling observation care appeals for several seniors, said Medicare should get rid of the requirement without waiting for any experiment results.\n\n\u201cNursing-home care and other benefits are supposed to be covered if medically necessary and are not based on alleged cost savings,\u201d she said.\n\nOne of the payment experiments involves about 600,000 seniors at more than 170 hospitals participating in what Medicare calls Pioneer Accountable Care Organizations. Under this pilot, which includes the Partners Health hospitals, patients who spend little or no time in the hospital can still qualify for Medicare\u2019s nursing-home benefit. Medicare makes a set payment for a patient, which is shared by the patient\u2019s health-care providers, including the nursing home.\n\nThis waiver of the three-day rule applies even to patients kept for observation, which is considered an outpatient service. No matter how long these patients stay, observation care normally doesn\u2019t count toward Medicare\u2019s requirement for short-term nursing- home coverage.\n\nMedicare assigns patients to a program and does not accept volunteers.\n\nAnother experiment involves a \u201cbundled payment care initiative\u201d that also moves hospitals away from Medicare\u2019s traditional fee-for-service model and instead pays a set fee for any of 48 specific procedures chosen by the hospital. The list includes hip or knee replacements. Patients admitted to about 70 participating hospitals may be eligible for the waiver for nursing-home coverage. Hospitals, doctors, nursing homes and other providers share Medicare\u2019s discounted reimbursement for a patient receiving one of the eligible procedures. Medicare patients can check with their hospitals ahead of time to see if they are participating in the initiative.\n\n\u201cEven if patients are here 24 hours, they would still qualify for a skilled-nursing facility and are not penalized for getting well sooner,\u201d said Joe Harrington, president of Lodi Memorial Hospital in Lodi, Calif., which provides the waiver to knee and hip replacement patients.\n\nHospital officials participating in the pilot programs say the waiver should be used conservatively to ensure that patients don\u2019t leave the hospital prematurely, are not kept longer than necessary and enter a nursing home only if they have the potential for short-term rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long-standing Medicare policy, so if you want to change it, it\u2019s important to make sure it\u2019s safe to change it,\u201d said Mark Froimson, an orthopedic surgeon and president of the Cleveland Clinic system\u2019s Euclid Hospital. The hospital is in the bundled payment pilot project and offers the waiver to seniors who need nursing-home care after undergoing a knee or hip replacement. The Cleveland Clinic has asked Medicare for permission to expand the waiver to more procedures and additional hospitals.\n\n\u201cThis is one example where Medicare, to their credit, is saying \u2018we are willing to waive our rules and evaluate whether it is better care,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Medicare, three-day rule and Medicare, Affordable Care Act, hospitals and Medicare, hospitals and three-day rule and Medicare", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Some seniors exempted from plan that mandates three-day hospital stay to get coverage for nursing home", "title": "Affordable Care Act offering seniors exemptions in experiments meant to save money, boost care", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/some-seniors-win-medicare-exemptions-for-nursing-home-coverage-in-pilot-program/2014/07/20/6cde4030-0eaf-11e4-8c9a-923ecc0c7d23_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/07/Editorial-Opinion/Images/wonk0925.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/some-seniors-win-medicare-exemptions-for-nursing-home-coverage-in-pilot-program/2014/07/20/6cde4030-0eaf-11e4-8c9a-923ecc0c7d23_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Medicare, three-day rule and Medicare, Affordable Care Act, hospitals and Medicare, hospitals and three-day rule and Medicare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "6cde4030-0eaf-11e4-8c9a-923ecc0c7d23", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Some seniors exempted from plan that mandates three-day hospital stay to get coverage for nursing home"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNursing-home care and other benefits are supposed to be covered if medically necessary and are not based on alleged cost savings,\u201d she said.\nThe hospital is in the bundled payment pilot project and offers the waiver to seniors who need nursing-home care after undergoing a knee or hip replacement.\nThe exemptions are at hospitals participating in Affordable Care Act pilot projects meant to test ways to improve Medicare service while reducing costs or holding them steady.\nPatients admitted to about 70 participating hospitals may be eligible for the waiver for nursing-home coverage.\nOne of the payment experiments involves about 600,000 seniors at more than 170 hospitals participating in what Medicare calls Pioneer Accountable Care Organizations."}
