But Collins is most decidedly a Republican.\n\nCollins, this year, shares the top of her party\u2019s ticket in Maine with two candidates that are notably more conservative than she is: incumbent Gov. Paul LePage running for re-election and Bruce Poliquin, a former state treasurer and the GOP candidate for the state\u2019s 2nd District U.S. House seat, being vacated by Democrat Mike Michaud, who is running for governor.\n\nPundits have dubbed Poliquin and LePage favorites of the tea party movement because of their more conservative viewpoints. But Collins, like former Republican U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe, has largely avoided that affiliation, positioning herself as one of the top \u201cmoderates\u201d in the U.S. Congress.\n\nOn the hot-button social issues of same-sex marriage and abortion, Collins\u2019 positions conflict with LePage and Poliquin\u2019s.\n\nPoliquin has said his \u201cpro-life\u201d stance is a religious belief and not a political one, while LePage has made overtures to pro-life groups.\n\nOn gay marriage, Collins announced her support for Maine\u2019s recently passed referendum that legalized same-sex marriage.\n\nWhile her Democratic rivals will suggest Collins is migrating politically to the right as she gears up for the re-election bid, her steady election results over the years and the recent endorsement from King \u2014 who pointed to Collins\u2019 record and called her \u201ca good senator\u201d \u2014 will go a long way with the majority of Maine voters, who are not enrolled in either party, most objective political observers suggest.\n\nRepublicans say the top of their ticket shows a diversity of ideologies that Democrats can\u2019t duplicate and illustrates the GOP\u2019s \u201cbig tent\u201d philosophy.\n\nTo that end, a political action committee controlled by Collins recently made the maximum donation allowed under federal law to Poliquin\u2019s campaign.\n\nIn a new s release last week, Poliquin touted the $5,000 donation as evidence that he, too, could be a bipartisan lawmaker.\n\n\u201cSen. Collins knows I will work with anyone \u2014 Democrats, independents or Republicans \u2014 in doing what is needed to stand up for Maine,\u201d Poliquin said.\n\nThe same Collins PAC made a $5,000 donation to Isaac Misiuk, the Republican candidate challenging Maine\u2019s 1st District Democratic incumbent, U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree.\n\nCollins has appeared at least once with Poliquin and LePage on the same stage this year, during a June 13 \u201cunity rally\u201d following the state\u2019s primary elections.\n\nThe rally with all three candidates stands in sharp contrast to comments LePage made in 2010 about Collins when her former chief of staff, Steve Abbott, announced he would join the primary race for governor.\n\nLePage, who won the nomination, said during a meeting with a tea party group prior to the primary in 2010 that he had twice chaired Collins\u2019 re-election campaign in Kennebec County and he would have never suspected she would \u201cthrow you under the bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s time to beat the elite,\u201d LePage said to cheers and applause.\n\nDavid Sorensen, spokesman for the Maine Republican Party, said Collins, LePage and Poliquin agree on the most important issues, including job creation, limiting government overreach, reforming the welfare system and fiscal responsibility for government.\n\n\u201cOn the things that unite most Republicans, they agree,\u201d Sorensen said.\n\nBut critics say Collins is simply navigating a political path that allows her to survive in an increasingly conservative party.\n\nLiberal blogger and author Mike Tipping, a spokesman for the Maine People\u2019s Alliance, which largely supports Democrats, said Collins has always been adept at gauging the party\u2019s direction.\n\nIn a recently released book by Tipping titled, \u201cAs Maine Went,\u201d Tipping details LePage\u2019s overtures to Maine\u2019s tea party movement and the far right, including the reference to being \u201cthrown under the bus\u201d by Collins.\n\nTipping said Collins is savvy enough to know that despite LePage\u2019s earlier anger toward her, their fates are somewhat linked.\n\n\u201cCollins has always been a wind-sock politician, and I think her public endorsement of and fundraising for LePage and Poliquin shows that she has made a strategic decision about how to survive in the new Republican Party,\u201d Tipping said.\n\nHe noted that other moderate Republicans, even those who have been publicly critical of LePage\u2019s unrestrained rhetoric, have backed down for the sake of political expediency.\n\nBen Grant, chairman of the Maine Democratic Party, said sharing the top of the ticket with LePage and Poliquin will create a problem for Republicans.\n\n\u201cParties are more successful when they unite and there are a lot of moderate voters that will be turned off by that overall line-up,\u201d Grant said. \u201cIt becomes tougher for moderates to swallow, the closer [Collins] gets to LePage and Poliquin.\u201d\n\nGrant acknowledged that Collins\u2019 moderate image creates a conundrum for her Democratic rival, Shenna Bellows.\n\n\u201cMaine people are default ticket-splitters,\u201d Grant said.\n\nIn other words, they may vote for a Democrat like Michaud for governor or vote for Poliquin\u2019s Democratic rival, state Sen. Emily Cain, while at the same time casting a ballot for Collins.\n\nGrant said Bellows\u2019 campaign will have to clearly define how Collins isn\u2019t a moderate on key issues by pointing out her voting record, including her support for the Iraq War and her votes for the so-called \u201cBush tax cuts.\u201d\n\nRepublican operatives and campaign workers for both LePage and Collins dismiss any notion that one or the other is riding the \u201ccoattails\u201d of the other or standing on them.\n\nCollins\u2019 campaign spokesman Lance Dutson said Collins\u2019 popularity has never been based on her party affiliation but more on her actions as a lawmaker in Washington.\n\nDutson agreed with Grant that Maine voters have no qualms crossing party lines to vote for the best candidate and that\u2019s why Collins enjoys the support of Democrats, Republicans and independent voters.\n\n\u201cHer approval ratings are in the 70s and 80s across the political party spectrum and that kind of speaks to the fact she has governed in a way that the people of Maine respect, which is staying focused on the issues and coming up with common-sense solutions to things and putting the partisan infighting and bickering off to the side,\u201d Dutson said.\n\nHe said statewide elections in Maine \u201chave never been carried by rife partisanship.\u201d\n\nDutson said Collins has always focused on what Maine voters want and not necessarily what the party wants.\n\nHe said Democrats in 2014 face the same top-of-the-ticket dynamic as Republicans, in that Bellows is considerably more liberal than Michaud, who has typically been considered a \u201cBlue Dog\u201d \u2014 fiscally conservative \u2014 Democrat.\n\nBellows hasn\u2019t garnered endorsements typically picked up by statewide Democratic candidates, including some union endorsements like that of the powerful Maine Education Association, the statewide teachers\u2019 union.\n\nBellows\u2019 polling numbers reflect that Democratic voters are not coalescing around her the way Republicans are around Collins, Dutson said.\n\nHe said there\u2019s no effort on Collins\u2019 part to distance herself or avoid appearances with Poliquin and LePage. Just last week, all three appeared together at the Lisbon Moxie Festival, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what she\u2019s always done,\u201d Dutson said. \u201cShe\u2019s always been a supporter of the team.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, Collins\u2019 campaign is focused on reaching as many Maine voters as it can and that focus has nothing to do with political affiliations.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit the campaign trail this summer and fall, we are not focusing our efforts based on people\u2019s political parties, but we are making sure she gets the opportunity to speak with as many voters as possible across the state,\u201d Dutson said. \u201cThat\u2019s historically what she\u2019s always done.\u201d\n\nJim Melcher, a University of Maine at Farmington political science professor and author, said Collins epitomizes the Republican\u2019s \u201cbig tent\u201d ideal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Susan Collins finds it that hard to run with LePage and Poliquin,\u201d Melcher said. \u201cShe\u2019s always been a big-tent Republican who doesn\u2019t go after ideological purity for her party.\u201d\n\nMelcher said Collins\u2019 strong advocacy for business interests, especially small businesses, has won her much of her unwavering support in Maine, which also endears her to fellow Republicans, even if they don\u2019t always see eye to eye on all things.\n\nMelcher said extreme wings in the GOP see Collins as a so-called \u201cRINO\u201d \u2014 Republican in Name Only. The same factions in Maine\u2019s GOP also discounted former U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe, a lifelong Republican and one of the state\u2019s most popular elected officials.\n\nMelcher said Collins has been \u201ccareful to stay clear of LePage\u2019s controversies at the state level, as well, so she has not had to either defend criticisms nor praise of him.\u201d\n\nSteve Robinson, a conservative pundit and editor of T he Maine Wire, an online publication of the right-leaning Maine Heritage Policy Center, said liberal observations about Collins, such as Tipping\u2019s, are \u201chilarious\u201d and transparently hypocritical, given that the Democratic standard-bearer in this election cycle, Michaud, has changed his position on the issues of abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cMike Michaud has been on both sides of every major issues in the last 20 years,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nMichaud was first elected to Congress in 2002 as a pro-life Democrat, and during his time in the state Legislature, he helped kill legislation that would have leveled the legal playing field for same-sex couples in Maine.\n\nSomewhat ironically, Michaud, the Democrat, and Collins, the Republican, now are fairly well-aligned on both issues.\n\nRobinson noted that Collins, for the first time in recent history, has secured the endorsement of all four unions at the state\u2019s largest employer, Bath Iron Works, which builds ships for the U.S. Navy.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time in more than three decades any of the unions at the shipyard have endorsed a Republican in a Maine U.S. Senate race.\n\n\u201cSusan Collins has long been a part of the tradition that started with Margaret Chase Smith, where you have moderate Maine Republicans, strong women, who understand the value of national defense,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThe unions and Bath understand that Collins places a priority on national defense and making sure BIW gets those contracts, because they build the ships better than anybody else.\u201d\n\nRobinson likened the mix of ideologies \u2014 even conflicting ones \u2014 at the top of the GOP ticket in Maine to an ecosystem.\n\n\u201cDiversity in a political party, as with biodiversity in an ecosystem, is healthy,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cWith the Republican Party, the conservative motive has always been ideologically diverse and the best ideas compete and win.\u201d\n\nWhile Collins and Poliquin may not always agree on exactly how to fix certain problems, like how to fund Social Security going forward, they do agree on what the problems are, Robinson said.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that unites them both is they agree that there is a problem that needs to be fixed,\u201d Robinson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LEWISTON, Maine \u2014 She\u2019s been endorsed by labor unions, a leading environmental organization, a national gay rights group and Maine\u2019s popular independent U.S. senator, Angus King.
