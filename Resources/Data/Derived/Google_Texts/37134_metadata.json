Who ran Bain back in those days?\n\nOh, I remember now! Mitt Romney.\n\nAnd wasn't Tom Stemberg, its co-founder the guy who said Romney was a better job creator than Barack Obama?\n\nOh, I'm sure this isn't payback. That would be too tacky. Too obvious, too scary.\n\nNo, it's just coincidence that Staples' been stapled and other companies that avoid costs on a far grander scale, even shipping jobs overseas.\n\nCompanies like Apple, for example aren't mentioned.\n\nI'm sure that was just an oversight.\n\nAfter all, why rip the Apple guy for salary and stock grants running into the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWhen you can go after the Staples guy for his 10 million.\n\nSeems fair. Seems balanced.\n\nSeems nuts.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "yourworldcavuto", "prism.subsection3": "commonsense", "prism.subsection2": "transcript", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-11T17:55:28-05:00", "dcterms.abstract": "Your World w/ Cavuto on FoxNews.com - follow Neil Cavuto on Weekdays at 4:00 PM ET", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.genre": "transcript", "keywords": "your world, neil cavuto, common sense, staples, office deport", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "Your World w/ Cavuto on FoxNews.com - follow Neil Cavuto on Weekdays at 4:00 PM ET", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:dHJhbnNjcmlwdDU1Nzk=", "dc.subject": "your world, neil cavuto, common sense, staples, office deport", "description": "Your World w/ Cavuto on FoxNews.com - follow Neil Cavuto on Weekdays at 4:00 PM ET", "prism.section": "shows", "fb": {"admins": 100000924384522}, "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "Cavuto: A warning to all you companies that make a profit | Fox News", "dcterms.created": "2015-02-11T17:01:28-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Your World w/ Cavuto on FoxNews.com - follow Neil Cavuto on Weekdays at 4:00 PM ET", "title": "Cavuto: A warning to all you companies that make a profit", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/your-world-cavuto/2015/02/11/cavuto-warning-all-you-companies-make-profit", "image": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/v/all/img/og/og-fn-your-world-cavuto.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text", "dc.date": "2015-02-11"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab6e\"", "article_summary": "Watch the latest video at FoxNews.comThis is a warning to all you companies that make a profit.\nWhen you can go after the Staples guy for his 10 million.\nThe president wants it.\nAnd never mind Staples already offers part-time non-exempt associates insurance.\nNo, it's just coincidence that Staples' been stapled and other companies that avoid costs on a far grander scale, even shipping jobs overseas."}
