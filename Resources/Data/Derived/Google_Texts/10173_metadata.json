He was in the first half, completing 10 of 14 passes for 100 yards as the Redskins took a 10-3 lead into the break. Cousins threw an early interception \u2014 a miscommunication with Jordan Reed \u2014 but he bounced back well. The next drive, he guided the Redskins on a 17-play, 88-yard scoring drive.\n\nCousins was 5-for-6 on the drive and capped the series with a four-yard touchdown pass to Reed to give Washington a 10-0 lead. On the team\u2019s penultimate drive, Cousins threw another interception at the Miami two-yard line. It was a great play by corner Brice McCain, winning a one-on-one battle with Pierre Garcon, but a bad time for a turnover nonetheless.\n\nOn the team\u2019s final play, Cousins and Reed had their signals crossed again. At the Miami 20-yard line, Cousins\u2019 fourth-and-7 pass fell incomplete, sealing the victory for the Dolphins. At times, Cousins\u2019 performance was encouraging, but there\u2019s still plenty of kinks that need to be ironed out.\n\n** The Redskins set themselves back greatly in the second half by committing bad penalties. They finished the game with 11 penalties for 88 yards, all in the second half, which made it difficult for the offense to get going. Towards the end of the third quarter, a delay of game followed by consecutive holding calls on Reed and right tackle Ty Nsekhe had the Redskins facing third-and-29.\n\nOn the Redskins\u2018 first drive of the fourth quarter, a Derek Carrier holding penalty set them back to their own 10-yard line. Two plays later, right tackle Morgan Moses was called for unnecessary roughness, which backed them to the six-yard line. There were even two Redskins penalties on Matt Jones\u2019 nine-yard run, which were both declined. Tress Way was punting from the Redskins\u2018 15-yard line, and that\u2019s when Landry broke his 69-yard return.\n\n** One of the greatest positives from the game was the play of rookie right guard Brandon Scherff. He held up well against Dolphins nose tackle Ndamukong Suh most of the day, utilizing cut blocks to minimize Suh\u2019s impact. Second-year right tackle Morgan Moses played well against defensive end Cameron Wake, too. The Redskins allowed just one sack against the Dolphins\u2018 aggressive front. Behind a strong performance from the entire defensive line, the Redskins rushed for 161 yards.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A late Kirk Cousins interception and too many penalties made it hard for the Redskins' offense to get going when they needed it most.
