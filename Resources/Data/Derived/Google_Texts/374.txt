UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Optum will buy the administrative support services for ProHealth Physicians, one of Connecticut's largest independent physician groups.

ProHealth's approximately 370 physicians in 85 practice locations throughout Connecticut will continue to be physician-owned. Optum will provide clinical, administrative and technology support.

The financial terms were not disclosed.

Optum will provide access to advanced data, analytic and connectivity solutions, population health expertise and front-office administrative services to help physicians efficiently operate their practices and maintain their focus on patient care, it said.

It will help manage costs and improve communication and collaboration among patients, physicians, hospitals and health plans, Optum said. ProHealth is expected to continue to negotiate rates with UnitedHealthcare.

"As a progressive leader in helping patients access high-quality, compassionate care, ProHealth is a strong fit with OptumCare and our focus on advancing patient-centered care nationwide, starting at the local level, " said Larry Renfro, CEO of Optum.

In local markets where it operates, OptumCare collaborates with multiple health plans, care providers and employers. Nationwide, it has nearly 17,000 physician partners and 5,700 advanced practice clinicians.

This marks the latest expansion for the information and technology-enabled health services business. In April, Optum invested in MedExpress, a national retail clinic chain, for an undisclosed sum.
