No more.\n\nWith millions of baby boomers entering retirement and pricey new drugs hitting the market, U.S. health care spending, which had increased at relatively moderate 4% rate since the financial crisis, grew 5.5% last year, according to a new government study reported on Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nYou can expect more too. The actuaries who calculated the figures, project that spending will average 5.8% between 2014 and 2024. By then, health care as a share of the nation\u2019s overall economy will have grown to 19.4% from 17.4% in 2013. In other words, our nation\u2019s medical bills will account for one out of every five dollars we spend.\n\nThe changes aren\u2019t totally unexpected. A big part of the extra costs are tied to the fact that baby boomers \u2014 many now in their 60s \u2014 are requiring more care. Important but expensive new drugs, like one that helps treat Hepatitis C, are also a factor, according the Journal.\n\nStill, the rising costs aren\u2019t good news, especially considering a key promise of the Affordable Care Act, which brought access to health insurance to millions of Americans, was to get the growth in health care spending under control, a goal known as \u201cbending the curve.\u201d\n\nFor people who get their health insurance coverage at work, rising costs are likely to mean a continued push by employers toward high-deductible plans, which can have steep out-of-pocket costs.
