After three decades in Washington, he had become one of the most unpopular and divisive figures in modern CIA history. He left feeling that the agency was hamstrung by the people overseeing it. The White House micromanaged operations, slowing down everything. And Congress used its oversight authority to score political points. The CIA was stuck in the middle, an impossible position.\n\nNow [Police Commissioner Ray] Kelly was offering a chance to start something new in the New York Police Department, without any of the bureaucratic hand-wringing or political meddling. The World Trade Center attacks had changed the world. Cohen was being given an opportunity to change policing in response.\n\nHe didn\u2019t need a couple days to think about it. He called Kelly back two hours later and took the job.\n\n[Mayor] Bloomberg and Kelly introduced Cohen as the deputy commissioner for intelligence at a city hall press conference on January 24, 2002. Cohen spoke for just two minutes, mostly to praise the NYPD. He had been raised in Boston\u2019s Mattapan neighborhood, and though he\u2019d been gone for decades, he still spoke with a heavy accent.\n\n\u201cWe need to understand what these threats are, what form they take, where they\u2019re coming from, and who\u2019s responsible,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nThe new deputy commissioner offered no specifics about what he had planned. Weeks before his sixtieth birthday, he even declined to give his age, telling reporters only that he was between twenty-eight and seventy. The brief remarks from behind the lectern would amount to one of Cohen\u2019s longest media appearances ever.\n\n\u201cI look forward to just getting on with the job,\u201d he said.\n\nCohen\u2019s appointment was not front-page news. The New York Times put the story on page B3. The Daily News ran a 165-word brief on page 34. It was four months after 9/11, and the country was focused on doing whatever it took to prevent another attack. Nobody questioned the wisdom of taking someone trained to break the laws of foreign nations and putting him in a department responsible for upholding the rule of law. Nobody even checked out Cohen\u2019s hand-prepared r\u00e9sum\u00e9, which said he had a master\u2019s degree in international relations from Boston University. In fact, his degree was in government.15 The misstatement itself was inconsequential. That it went entirely unquestioned was indicative of the lack of media scrutiny Cohen could expect in his new job.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take him long to realize that he was not walking back into the CIA. The NYPD had an intelligence division, but in name only. Working primarily out of the waterfront offices of the old Brooklyn Army Terminal, across the Hudson River, facing New Jersey, the detectives focused on drugs and gangs. They were in no way prepared to detect and disrupt a terrorist plot before it could be carried out. Mostly, they were known as the glorified chauffeurs who drove visiting dignitaries around the city.\n\nCohen knew that more was possible.\n\nForce of will alone, however, would not transform a moribund division into something capable of stopping a terrorist attack. If Cohen wanted to remake the NYPD into a real intelligence service, there were four men\u2014four graying hippies\u2014standing in his way.\n\n* * *\n\nMartin Stolar first began hearing stories about the NYPD Intelligence Division in 1970 while working as a young lawyer for the New York Law Commune. A recently formed law firm for leftists, hippies, radicals, and activists, the commune operated entirely by consensus. It didn\u2019t take a case unless everyone agreed. They saw themselves as part of the New Left, lawyers who didn\u2019t merely represent their clients but who fully embraced their politics and were part of their struggle. They represented Columbia University students who\u2019d taken over campus buildings during a protest in 1968. They stood beside members of the Weather Underground, the Black Panthers, and other radical groups, and activists such as Abbie Hoffman. And they never, ever, represented landlords in disputes with tenants.\n\nIt was a new way of thinking about the law. The firm pooled all its fees and then paid one another based on need, not ability or performance. Operating out of a converted loft in Greenwich Village, the lawyers paid the bills thanks to well-to-do parents who hired them to keep their sons out of Vietnam. But about half their time was dedicated to political, nonpaying clients.\n\nEvery now and again, one of the lawyers would come across something\u2014a news clipping, a document, or a strong hunch\u2014that suggested the NYPD was infiltrating activist groups and building dossiers on protesters. When they did, they\u2019d add it to a plain manila folder, as something to revisit.\n\nStolar had no problem questioning government authority. In 1969 he applied for admission to the bar in Ohio, where he was an antipoverty volunteer. When asked if he\u2019d ever been \u201ca member of any organization which advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States by force,\u201d Stolar refused to answer. Nor would he answer when asked to list every club or organization he\u2019d ever joined. The questions were holdovers from the Red Scare days of the 1950s. Stolar, a liberal New York lawyer, would have none of it. He took his case to the United States Supreme Court, which, in 1971, declared such questions unconstitutional. \u201c[W]e can see no legitimate state interest which is served by a question which sweeps so broadly into areas of belief and association protected against government invasion,\u201d Justice Hugo Black wrote.\n\nStolar had moved back to New York by then and never bothered to return to Ohio to take the bar exam. He\u2019d proven his point.\n\nIn 1971 he was among the many lawyers working on the Panther 21 case, the trial of Black Panther Party members accused of conspiring to bomb police stations, businesses, and public buildings. While preparing their defense, the Law Commune attorneys came across something unusual: The case against the Panthers was built largely on the testimony of some of the earliest members of the New York chapter of the Black Panthers. There was Gene Roberts, a former security guard for Malcolm X who was present on February 21, 1965, when the Nation of Islam leader was assassinated in Manhattan\u2019s Audubon Ballroom. There was Ralph White, the head of the Panther unit in the Bronx who\u2019d once represented the entire New York chapter at a black power conference in Philadelphia. And there was Carlos Ashwood, who\u2019d sold Panther literature in Harlem.\n\nThey were founding fathers of the New York Panthers. And all three, it turned out, were undercover detectives. The NYPD had essentially set up the New York chapter of the Black Panther Party and built files on everyone who signed up.\n\nThat convinced Stolar that something had to be done with his manila folder. He called another young lawyer, Jethro Eisenstein, who taught at New York University. The two knew each other from their work with the liberal National Lawyers Guild, and Stolar regarded Eisenstein as a brilliant legal writer. If they were going to have a shot at challenging the NYPD, the lawsuit had to sing.\n\nTogether they put out the word to their clients and friends that they were looking for stories about the NYPD. The anecdotes came pouring in, both from activists and from other lawyers who, it turned out, had been keeping folders of their own. The mass of materials described a police department run amok. There was evidence that police were collecting the names of people who attended events for liberal causes. Detectives posed as journalists and photographed war protesters. Police infiltrated organizations that they considered suspect and maintained rosters of those who attended meetings.\n\n* * *\n\nOn May 13, 1971, the Panthers were acquitted of all charges. At the time, it was the longest criminal trial in New York history, spanning eight months. Closing arguments alone had stretched over three weeks. But the jury was out only three hours before voting for acquittal. And the first hour was for lunch.\n\nIn the courthouse lobby, jurors milled about, congratulating the Panthers and their lawyers. Some exchanged hugs. Jurors said there wasn\u2019t enough evidence that the conspiracy was anything more than radical talk. Defense lawyer Gerald Lefcourt called the verdict \u201ca rejection of secret government all the way from J. Edgar Hoover down to the secret police of New York City.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times editorial page read:\n\nIt is not necessary to have any sympathy whatever with Panther philosophy or Panther methods to find some reassurance in the fact that\u2014at a time when the government so often confuses invective with insurrection\u2014a New York jury was willing to insist on evidence of wrong-doing rather than wrong-thinking.\n\nFive days after the verdict, Stolar and Eisenstein filed a twenty-one-page federal lawsuit against the NYPD. It accused the department of widespread constitutional violations.\n\nThe plaintiffs represented a grab bag of the New Left. There were Black Panthers, members of the War Resisters League, and gay-rights advocates. There were well-known figures such as Abbie Hoffman and obscure groups like the Computer People for Peace. One young man, Stephen Rohde, sued because when he applied for admission to the New York bar, he\u2019d been asked whether he\u2019d ever opposed the Vietnam War. He had once signed a petition in a basement at Columbia University, and his views had ended up in a police file.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After 9/11, the NYPD wanted an intelligence unit to investigate threats to the city.
