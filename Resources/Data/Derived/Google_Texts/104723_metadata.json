No problem.\n\nA small but growing number of primary-care physicians has stopped taking insurance \u2014 and they may be radically reshaping how American families get their medicine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running a business that\u2019s profitable and caring for patients the way we\u2019ve been trained to care for patients,\u201d says Dr. Jonathon Izbicki, owner of Izbicki Family Medicine in Erie, Pa. \u201cWe have our voices back, and we\u2019re masters of our profession. There\u2019s nothing better than that.\u201d\n\nFor years, the no-insurance \u2014 or \u201cretainer\u201d or \u201cdirect-care\u201d \u2014 approach was almost exclusively reserved for the wealthy. Specialists or physicians who catered to deep-pocketed patients would charge a lofty monthly \u201cmembership\u201d fee, and in exchange, offer \u201cluxury\u201d amenities like same-day appointments, little to no wait times, more time with the doctor and consultations by phone, email, Skype or even text-message.\n\nBut with industry changes looming and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act bringing an influx of newly insured low-income and Medicare patients, some primary-care and family-practice physicians have set out to change this so-called \u201cconcierge\u201d model: in short, by offering the very same services at a mere fraction of the cost.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like the blue-collar concierge,\u201d Izbicki says.\n\n[READ: Treating Hunger as a Health Issue]\n\nAbout 6 percent of physicians were in concierge or cash-only practices last year \u2013 up from 4 percent in 2012, according to the health information website MedScape. Nevertheless, that number is \u201cgrowing very rapidly,\u201d says Mark Pauly, a professor of health care management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThey think this is a more noble way to deal with a patient population than trying to run everything through insurers,\u201d Pauly says. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to keep it affordable and keep it accessible.\u201d Izbicki and his brother, Dr. Harry Izbicki, embraced the retainer model in September. For years, they\u2019d worked under a traditional insurance model, first as employees of another practice in Erie, and then at the doctor's office they opened in April 2010. The work, they found, was relentless. \u201cMy office hours would start at 8 o\u2019clock in the morning, and I wouldn\u2019t get home until 8 o\u2019clock at night,\u201d Jon Izbicki says. \u201cI\u2019d see patients from 8 to 5, and then be at the office another three hours doing paperwork or typing up my notes.\u201d The reason, he said, was patient volume. Insurance companies essentially keep their reimbursements at a fixed rate, so one of the few ways to keep up with rising overhead \u2014 from salaries and taxes to medical malpractice insurance \u2014 was to see more and more patients.\n\nHarry Izbicki, left, and his brother Jonathon have converted their practice in Erie, Pa., into a retainer or direct-care model. \u201cThe system is built to be a production line,\u201d says Dr. Aly Cohen, an internist and rheumatologist in Monroe Township, N.J., who plans to switch to a retainer model July 1. \"It\u2019s just an unsustainable model.\u201d Primary care doctors have an average of 2,500 patients, surveys show, and the Izbicki brothers were no different. At their peak, they\u2019d see about two-dozen patients a day each, with consultations often just 15 minutes long. Doctors at other practices, meanwhile, saw even more patients \u2014 sometimes as many as 30 or 40 a day, they say. \u201cThe quality of care starts to go down, or the people\u2019s perception of care starts to go down, they don\u2019t feel safe, and the trust between patient and doctor starts to slip,\u201d Izbicki says. He and Harry first read about concierge medicine in 2008, but it wasn't until more recently that they learned about Atlas MD, a lower-cost retainer practice that opened in September 2010 in Wichita, Kan. There, each doctor is responsible for just 500 patients -- a mere 5 percent of the national average -- and the membership fees are far less than the typical high-end concierge practice. \u201cWe realized that insurance paying for primary care is akin to using car insurance to try to pay for gasoline,\u201d says Dr. Doug Nunamaker, Atlas MD\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s otherwise fairly affordable until you try to pay for it with insurance: My premiums would be much higher because they wouldn\u2019t know how much gas I would need, they would tell me where to get gas, and I\u2019d have to preauthorize trips out of town.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"In the U.S., 1 in 4 women dies of heart disease.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Once the bastion of high-end specialists, more and more primary-care and family physicians are launching concierge practices for middle- and lower-income patients.", "zone": "hospitalsoftomorrow/articles", "author": "Alan Neuhauser", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Once the bastion of high-end specialists, more and more primary-care and family physicians are launching concierge practices for middle- and lower-income patients.", "title": "Physicians Abandon Insurance for 'Blue Collar' Concierge Model", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/hospital-of-tomorrow/articles/2014/04/01/physicians-abandon-insurance-for-blue-collar-concierge-model", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/22/95/4fcc0837429d9bf5070dafb29fcf/140331-doctorstock-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Once the bastion of high-end specialists, more and more primary-care and family physicians are launching concierge practices for middle- and lower-income patients.", "card": "summary", "title": "Physicians Abandon Insurance for 'Blue Collar' Concierge Model - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "published_at": "2014-04-01", "site": "health-news", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/2963809/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F22%2F95%2F4fcc0837429d9bf5070dafb29fcf%2Fresizes%2F500%2F140331-doctorstock-editorial.jpg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-04-01"}, "keywords": "Pulse,picks,health care,health care reform,insurance,Medicare,medicine,family health,Hospital of Tomorrow,Alan Neuhauser", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Znxoa", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "healthcare, health care, insurance, affordable care act, obamacare, primary care, concierge medicine, family practice, doctor"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f0c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re like the blue-collar concierge,\u201d Izbicki says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to keep it affordable and keep it accessible.\u201d Izbicki and his brother, Dr. Harry Izbicki, embraced the retainer model in September.\nFor years, they\u2019d worked under a traditional insurance model, first as employees of another practice in Erie, and then at the doctor's office they opened in April 2010.\nA small but growing number of primary-care physicians has stopped taking insurance \u2014 and they may be radically reshaping how American families get their medicine.\nHarry Izbicki, left, and his brother Jonathon have converted their practice in Erie, Pa., into a retainer or direct-care model."}
