It also happens to be the most popular month for marriages to experience a deep freeze.\n\nAccording to eDivorcePapers.com, January has the dubious distinction of being \u201cDivorce Month,\u201d as, statistically, it has the most divorce filings.\n\nIt kind of puts a whole new spin on that lovely holiday tune \u2026 \u201cBaby, it\u2019s cold inside.\u201d\n\nSo, what\u2019s with all the marital breakups at the start of a new year? Common sense would dictate it\u2019s precisely that\u2014a new year, and a chance to hit the reset button on things that just aren\u2019t working. That is part of it, but Cathy Meyer, a divorce consultant and founder of DivorcedWomenOnline.com whose own husband left her in January, says there\u2019s a little more to it than that.\n\n\u201cWhat I hear from my clients is that they were struggling with the marriage before the holiday season. If they have children, the holidays are supposed to be a magical time, so they commit to giving the kids one last happy holiday as an intact family. By January, if it\u2019s still not working, it\u2019s time to move on.\u201d\n\nI can certainly understand how you try to hold a marriage together for the sake of the children. I know I perpetuated the happy-little-family fantasy for as long as I could for my two daughters. But that doesn\u2019t explain why Captain and Tennille, the popular singing duo from the \u201970s\u2014both IN their 70s, mind you\u2014have announced this month that they will be splitting up after almost 40 years of marriage. It\u2019s confusing even to the Captain, who claims he has no idea why his wife filed for divorce.\n\nCheck the calendar, Captain. It\u2019s JANUARY!\n\nAnd here\u2019s a real shocker \u2026 guess who is filing for divorce more than anybody? According to a very recent study, the surprising answer is conservative Protestants\u2014defined by the researchers as \u201cthose who believe the Bible to be literally true.\u201d The study claims that the states with higher concentrations of conservative Protestants had higher divorce rates, such as Alabama and Arkansas, with the second and third highest divorce rates in the U.S. Researchers say it\u2019s likely because this religious community encourages their members to marry at such a young age.\n\nSo if you want your marriage to last, consider moving to New Jersey and Massachusetts, liberal states where the incidences of divorce are very low.\n\nBut statistics and sociological studies aside, I know firsthand that the breakdown of a marriage doesn\u2019t happen overnight, let alone in one fluke month of the year. It is usually a gradual erosion and wearing down of trust and intimacy between two people, whether because of addiction, abuse, infidelity, marrying too young\u2014whatever the cause.\n\nI don\u2019t have the panacea for divorce, but I do know that if the marriage isn\u2019t working and staying together only brings out the worst in both of you, it\u2019s time to face the truth and move on\u2014before another day, another month, another year of unhappiness goes by.\n\nLynn Armitage is a single mother living in Northern California, and is an enrolled member of the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "January is typically the month where we see record cold snaps all across the country.
