He jumped into the race hoping to be the \u201cdifferent kind of Republican\u201d who would capture the affections of younger and libertarian-leaning voters and soak up press attention as the idiosyncratic candidate in the Republican field. That hasn\u2019t happened. His fundraising has been lackluster, he\u2019s slipping or treading water in both national and state polls, and the army of diehard supporters his father once commanded views Rand skeptically because of his increasingly hawkish views on foreign policy.\n\nPaul\u2019s campaign tried explaining it all away as part of a deliberate strategy \u2013 Rand is playing the \u201clong game,\u201d they said, he doesn\u2019t need the attention or even the sky-high fundraising. He has his slow-burn game plan and he\u2019s sticking to it.\n\nWell, that explanation is apparently no longer operative. With Donald Trump dominating all the headlines and the first primary debate just a couple of weeks away, Rand Paul is trying to get people to notice him again. Which means it\u2019s CAMPAIGN GIMMICK TIME!\n\nHere\u2019s the new video out from the Rand Paul anti-Washington machine, which features the senator inflicting three different forms of violence upon a printed-out copy of the tax code.\n\nIt\u2019s just Rand Paul hanging out in his\u2026 garage, I think? And he\u2019s doing the manly stuff that men do when they just need to bro out and have some guy time: playing with fire, waving chainsaws around, wearing jeans, putting on boots, and tucking in your t-shirt. Speaking of the t-shirt, I\u2019m not entirely certain what the phrase \u201cDetroit Republican\u201d is supposed to mean, but the word \u201cDetroit\u201d evokes romanticized notions of the blue-collar wage earner, and it helps Rand get into character as the \u201cworking class man\u201d who uses power tools and solves all his problems with a wood chipper.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rand Paul is slipping in the polls and wants people to notice him again, so he's busting out the power tools VIDEO", "title": "The taxes chainsaw massacre: Rand Paul is desperate for your attention", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Rand Paul is slipping in the polls and wants people to notice him again, so he's busting out the power tools VIDEO", "title": "The taxes chainsaw massacre: Rand Paul is desperate for your attention", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/21/the_taxes_chainsaw_massacre_rand_paul_is_desperate_for_your_attention/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/rand_paul_chainsaw.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rand Paul is slipping in the polls and wants people to notice him again, so he's busting out the power tools VIDEO", "title": "The taxes chainsaw massacre: Rand Paul is desperate for your attention", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/rand_paul_chainsaw.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, flat tax, Rand Paul, Republican Party, Republican Primary, Republicans, Supply-side economics, Taxes, trickle-down economics, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 Elections, flat tax, Rand Paul, Republican Party, Republican Primary, Republicans, Supply-side economics, Taxes, trickle-down economics, Video, Elections News, Politics NewsThe 2016 campaign hasn\u2019t been proceeding in accordance with Rand Paul\u2019s expectations.\nIt\u2019s just Rand Paul hanging out in his\u2026 garage, I think?\nWith Donald Trump dominating all the headlines and the first primary debate just a couple of weeks away, Rand Paul is trying to get people to notice him again.\nHere\u2019s the new video out from the Rand Paul anti-Washington machine, which features the senator inflicting three different forms of violence upon a printed-out copy of the tax code.\nHis fundraising has been lackluster, he\u2019s slipping or treading water in both national and state polls, and the army of diehard supporters his father once commanded views Rand skeptically because of his increasingly hawkish views on foreign policy."}
