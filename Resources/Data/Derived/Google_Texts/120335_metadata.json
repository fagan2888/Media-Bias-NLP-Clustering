He said he was \u201ctraumatized by the whole experience.\u201d\n\nThe Star Tribune reports the ruling is believed to be the first extensive federal court analysis on a section of the Affordable Care Act that prohibits sex discrimination in health care.\n\nTransgender Law Center staff attorney Sasha Buchert called the ruling \u201ca wonderful interpretation.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time a federal court has determined that the Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination against transgender people by a health care provider,\u201d Buchert said.\n\nHospital attorneys argue in court documents Rumble wasn\u2019t denied care and that the statute shouldn\u2019t be applied. The hospital declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nRumble said he was in severe pain when he went to the ER with his mother in 2013. According to the lawsuit, he had inflammation in his female reproductive organs and could hardly walk.\n\nAt the ER, Rumble registered as male, but was given a wristband with an \u201cF.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was very upset,\u201d Rumble said. \u201cMy identity was disregarded. It wasn\u2019t like I hadn\u2019t explained it.\u201d\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe lawsuit says an ER doctor came 4 1/2 hours later. Rumble said the doctor asked pointed questions about his sex life, including whether he was having sex with \u201cmen, women or both.\u201d\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the doctor examined Rumble\u2019s genitalia \u201cin a very rough manner.\u201d Rumble said he was in pain, but that the doctor didn\u2019t stop when asked, until his mother yelled, \u201cStop!\u201d\n\nRumble was admitted to the hospital. Weeks later he got a bill that said, \u201cDiagnosis inconsistent with the patient\u2019s gender,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nU.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson wrote in her ruling that the doctor\u2019s questioning of Rumble\u2019s sex life and not stopping the physical exam on request \u201cdemonstrate that the alleged mistreatment plaintiff endured was because of Rumble\u2019s gender identity.\u201d\n\nRumble, who goes to Minnesota Community & Technical College, said he filed the suit because he doesn\u2019t \u201cwant this to happen to other trans people.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2015, Associated Press, All Rights Reserved.\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Story Filed Under", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Discrimination, Edina MN, Hospitals, Minneapolis MN, Minnesota, Transgender", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "LGBTQ Nation", "description": "Jakob Rumble, who\u2019s identified in court records as a transgender man, said his gender identity was disregarded when he went to the emergency room at Fairview Southdale Hospital in Edina.", "title": "Judge: \u2018Plausible\u2019 case of discrimination of transgender man at Minnesota hospital", "url": "http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2015/03/judge-plausible-case-of-discrimination-of-transgender-man-at-minn-hospital/", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://static.lgbtqnation.com/assets/2015/03/Fairview-Southdale-Hospital-Edina.jpg", "height": 340}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://static.lgbtqnation.com/assets/2015/03/Fairview-Southdale-Hospital-Edina.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 162245191716, "app_id": 139331137822}, "viewport": "width=940", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-20T23:00:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-25T00:49:01+00:00"}, "bitly-verification": "d05cd30d47d0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b08\"", "article_summary": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 A federal judge has ruled that a transgender man has a \u201cplausible\u201d case that he was discriminated against and mistreated during a visit at a Minneapolis-area hospital.\nHospital attorneys argue in court documents Rumble wasn\u2019t denied care and that the statute shouldn\u2019t be applied.\nJakob Rumble, who\u2019s identified in court records as a \u201cfemale-to-male transgender man,\u201d said his gender identity was disregarded when he went to the emergency room at Fairview Southdale Hospital in Edina.\nIt wasn\u2019t like I hadn\u2019t explained it.\u201dArticle continues belowThe lawsuit says an ER doctor came 4 1/2 hours later.\nAt the ER, Rumble registered as male, but was given a wristband with an \u201cF.\u201d\u201cI was very upset,\u201d Rumble said."}
