The taxpayer-subsidized hospital has an annual budget of roughly $450 million. But Joseph said hospital administrators turned her down and suggested she look for outside funding.\n\n\u201cRight now, we don\u2019t have institutional support,\u201d said Joseph, who is now applying for outside grants.\n\nA hospital spokeswoman would not comment on why the hospital decided not to pay for regular screening. The hospital is part of a pilot program with other area hospitals to help \u201cpediatrics patients identified with PTSD,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Marisa Kollias.\u201cThe Cook County Health and Hospitals System is committed to treating all patients with high quality care.\u201d\n\nRight now, social workers try to identify patients with the most severe PTSD symptoms, said Carol Reese, the trauma center\u2019s violence prevention coordinator and an Episcopal priest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you we have everything we need in place right now, because we don\u2019t,\u201d Reese said. \u201cWe have a chaplain and a social worker and a couple of social work interns trying to see 5,000 people. We\u2019re not staffed to do it.\u201d\n\nA growing body of research shows that Americans with traumatic injuries develop PTSD at rates comparable to veterans of war. Just like veterans, civilians can suffer flashbacks, nightmares, paranoia, and social withdrawal. While the United States has been slow to provide adequate treatment to troops affected by post-traumatic stress, the military has made substantial progress in recent years. It now regularly screens for PTSD, works to fight the stigma associated with mental health treatment and educates military families about potential symptoms.\n\nFew similar efforts exist for civilian trauma victims. Americans wounded in their own neighborhoods are not getting treatment for PTSD. They\u2019re not even getting diagnosed.\n\nStudies show that, overall, about 8 percent of Americans suffer from PTSD at some point in their lives. But the rates appear to be much higher in communities \u2013 such as poor, largely African-American pockets of Detroit, Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia \u2013 wherehigh rates of violent crime have persisted despite a national decline.\n\nResearchers in Atlanta interviewed more than 8,000 inner-city residents and found that about two-thirds said they had been violently attacked and that half knew someone who had been murdered. At least 1 in 3 of those interviewed experienced symptoms consistent with PTSD at some point in their lives \u2013 and that\u2019s a \u201cconservative estimate,\u201d said Dr. Kerry Ressler, the lead investigator on the project.\n\n\u201cThe rates of PTSD we see are as high or higher than Iraq, Afghanistan or Vietnam veterans,\u201d Ressler said. \u201cWe have a whole population who is traumatized.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rates of PTSD we see are as high or higher than Iraq, Afghanistan, or Vietnam veterans.\u201d\n\nPost-traumatic stress can be a serious burden: It can take a toll on relationships and parenting, lead to family conflict and interfere with jobs. A national study of patients with traumatic injuries found that those who developed post-traumatic stress were less likely to have returned to work a year after their injuries.\n\nIt may also have a broader social cost. \u201cNeglect of civilian PTSD as a public health concern may be compromising public safety,\u201d Ressler and his co-authors concluded in a 2012 paper.\n\nFor most people, untreated PTSD will not lead to violence. But \u201cthere\u2019s a subgroup of people who are at risk, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, of reacting in a violent way or an aggressive way, that they might not have if they had had their PTSD treated,\u201d Ressler said.\n\nResearch on military veterans has found that the symptom of \u201cchronic hyperarousal\u201d \u2013 the distorted sense of always being under extreme threat \u2013 can lead to increased aggression and violent behavior.\n\n\u201cVery minor threats can be experienced, by what the signals in your body tell you, as, \u2018You\u2019re in acute danger,\u2019 \u201d said Sandra Bloom, a psychiatrist and former president of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.\n\nAnother issue, wrote researchers at Drexel University, is that people with symptoms of PTSD may be more likely to carry a weapon in order to \u201crestore feelings of safety.\u201d\n\nHospital trauma centers, which work on the front lines of neighborhood violence, could help address the lack of treatment. Indeed, the American College of Surgeons, which sets standards for the care of patients with traumatic injuries, is set to recommend that trauma centers\u201cevaluate, support and treat\u201d patients for post-traumatic stress.\n\nBut it\u2019s not a requirement, and few hospitals appear to be doing it.\n\n\n\n\n\nProPublica surveyed a top-level trauma center in each of the 22 cities with the nation\u2019s highest homicide rates. Just one, the Spirit of Charity Trauma Center in New Orleans, currently screens all seriously injured patients for PTSD. At another, Detroit Receiving Hospital, psychologists talk with injured crime victims about PTSD.\n\nOther hospitals have a patchwork of resources or none at all. At two hospitals, in Birmingham, Alabama and St. Louis, Missouri, trauma center staff said they hope to institute routine PTSD screening by the end of the year.\n\nDoctors in Baltimore, Newark, Memphis, and Jackson, Miss., said they wanted to do more to address PTSD, but they do not have the money.\n\nThey said adding even small amounts to hospital budgets is a hard sell in a tough economic climate. That\u2019s especially true at often-cash-strapped public hospitals.\n\nIn order to add a staff member to screen and follow up on PTSD, \u201cDo I lay someone else off in another area?\u201d asked Carnell Cooper, a trauma surgeon at Maryland Shock Trauma in Baltimore.\n\nMany public hospitals rely on state Medicaid programs to cover treatment of low-income patients. But several surgeons across the country said they did not know of any way they could bill Medicaid for screenings.\n\nThe federal government often provides guidance to state Medicaid programs on best practices for patient care and how to fund them. But a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the agency has given states no guidance on whether or how hospitals could be reimbursed for PTSD screenings.\n\nHospitals are often unwilling to foot the bill themselves.\n\nTrauma surgeons and their staffs expressed frustration that they know PTSD is having a serious impact on their patients, but they can\u2019t find a way to pay for the help they need.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t recognize that people have PTSD. We don\u2019t recognize that they\u2019re not doing their job as well, that they\u2019re not doing as well in school, that they\u2019re getting irritable at home with their families,\u201d said John Porter, a trauma surgeon in Jackson, Miss., which has a per-capita homicide rate higher than Chicago\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about it, if someone gets shot, and I save their life, and they can\u2019t go out and function, did I technically save their life? Probably not.\u201d\n\nWhen RAND Corp. researchers began interviewing violently injured young men in Los Angeles in the late 1990s, they faced some skepticism that the men, often connected to gangs, would be susceptible to PTSD.\n\n\u201cWe had people tell us that we\u2019d see a lot of people who were gang-bangers, and they wouldn\u2019t develop PTSD, because they were already hardened to that kind of life,\u201d said Grant Marshall, a behavioral scientist who studied patients at a Los Angeles trauma center. \u201cWe didn\u2019t find that to be the case at all. People in gangs were just as likely as anyone else to develop PTSD.\u201d\n\nIn fact, trauma appears to have a cumulative effect. Young men with violent injuries may be more likely to develop symptoms if they have been attacked before.\n\nThe Los Angeles study found that 27 percent of the men interviewed three months after they were injured had symptoms consistent with PTSD.\n\n\u201cMost people still think that all the people who get shot were doing something they didn\u2019t need to be doing,\u201d said Porter, the trauma surgeon from Jackson, Miss. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the racist thing, but everybody thinks it\u2019s a young black men\u2019s disease: They get shot, they\u2019re out selling drugs. We\u2019re not going to spend more time on them.\u201d\n\nWhile post-traumatic stress often does not show up until several months after an injury, experts say many trauma centers are missing the chance to evaluate patients early for risk of PTSD and to use clinical follow-ups \u2013 when patients come back to have their physical wounds examined \u2013 to check if patients are developing symptoms.\n\nDoctors say hospitals are unlikely to make significant progress until the American College of Surgeons makes systematic PTSD screening a requirement for all top-level trauma centers.\n\n\u201cIf someone gets shot, and I save their life, and they can\u2019t go out and function \u2013 did I technically save their life? Probably not.\u201d\n\nAn ACS requirement would be \u201ca much better hammer to show the administration,\u201d said Michael Foreman, chief of trauma surgery at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. Baylor, one of the few trauma centers to have a full-time psychologist on staff, surveyed 200 patients and found that roughly a quarter experienced post-traumatic stress. But Foreman said the center would not systematically screen all its patients until the ACS mandates it.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when that will happen. The organization\u2019s recognition of PTSD screening as a recommended practice is a first step. Those new guidelines will be released in March 2014, according to Chris Cribari, who chairs the subcommittee that evaluates whether hospitals are meeting ACS standards. Cribari declined to say when PTSD screening might become a requirement. He said the timing will depend on what hurdles hospitals encounter \u2013 such as patient privacy \u2013 when some of them start screenings.\n\nCribari acknowledged that at some hospitals, \u201cunless it\u2019s a regulation, they\u2019re not going to spend the money on it.\u201d\n\nAt minimum, experts say, hospitals should provide all trauma patients with basic education about post-traumatic stress.\n\n\u201cThe number one thing we do,\u201d is simply \u201ctell everybody in the trauma center about PTSD,\u201d said John Nanney, a Department of Veterans Affairs researcher who developed a program for violently injured patients at the Spirit of Charity in New Orleans.\n\nWithout education about symptoms, patients who have flashbacks or constant nightmares may have \u201cthese catastrophic beliefs\u201d about what is happening to them, Nanney said. \u201cJust say, \u2018This is something you might notice. If you do notice it, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going crazy. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re weak. This is something that happens\u2014don\u2019t freak out.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe city of Philadelphia has begun to focus on trauma as a major public health issue. Philadelphia is working with local mental health providers to screen for PTSD more systematically \u2013 and to focus on post-traumatic stress as part of drug and alcohol treatment. The city has also paid to train local therapists in prolonged exposure, a proven treatment for PTSD\u2013 the same kind of training the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has paid for its therapists to receive.\n\nFor violently injured Philadelphia residents, there\u2019s also Drexel University\u2019s Healing Hurt People, a program that\u2019s become a national model for addressing trauma and PTSD.\n\nHealing Hurt People reaches out to violently injured adults and children at two local hospitals and offers them intensive services. The program accepts a broad range of patients \u2014 from high-schoolers to siblings of young men who have been shot to former drug dealers. (One of Healing Hurt People\u2019s clients talked about his post-traumatic stress in 2013 on This American Life.)\n\nThe program\u2019s social workers screen all clients for PTSD symptoms and host discussions in which clients can share their experiences with one another. It\u2019s a way of fighting stigma around mental-health symptoms. Instead of thinking that they\u2019re going crazy, the conversations help them realize, \u201cOK, this is normal,\u201d as one client put it.\n\nOne of the program\u2019s central goals is to discourage victims of crimes from retaliating against their attackers and to help them focus on staying safe and rebuilding their own lives.\n\nThe program\u2019s therapists and social workers remind clients that the aftereffects of trauma may make them overreact and help them plan how to identify and avoid events that might trigger them. In one discussion last fall, a therapist sketched a cliff on a whiteboard, with a stick man on the top, close to the edge. The question: How do you recognize when you\u2019re getting close to the cliff edge\u2014and learn to walk away?\n\n\u201cOur thing is education,\u201d social worker Tony Thompson said. The more clients \u201cunderstand what\u2019s going on in their body and their mind, the more prepared they are to deal with it.\u201d\n\nIntensive casework like this has shown good results, but it\u2019s not cheap. Healing Hurt People is relatively small: Its programs served 129 new clients in 2013 and offered briefer education or assistance to a few hundred more. Its annual budget in 2013 was roughly $300,000, not including the cost of the office space that Drexel donates to the program.\n\nOther researchers have been working to develop quicker, more modest interventions for PTSD, including some that use laptops and smartphones\u2014programs that could easily be extended to more patients and still have some positive effect.\n\nWhatever the approach, there \u201cis untapped potential,\u201d said Joseph, the surgeon at Chicago\u2019s Cook County Hospital. Healing Hurt People is a model for what she wants to create. \u201cThese are kids, for the most part. When a 17-year-old kid crashes their parents\u2019 car, and they were drinking, we don\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, that kid\u2019s hopeless, let\u2019s just give up on them.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly had decades of trying to apply political solutions and social solutions to our inner cities\u2019 financial problems and violence problem, and they haven\u2019t been successful,\u201d said Ressler, the Atlanta researcher. \u201cIf we could do a better job of identification, intervention and treatment, I think there would be less violence, and people would have an easier time doing well in school, getting a job.\u201d\n\n\u2013Lois Beckett, ProPublica", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans with traumatic injuries develop PTSD at rates comparable to veterans of war.
