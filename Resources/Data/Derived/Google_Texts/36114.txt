Mississippi quietly passed Senate Bill 2681 Tuesday night to the ire of civil rights and LGBT activists who say the law opens the door for racial, religious and sexual discrimination. In a late night vote, the religious freedom proposal passed both houses of the Mississippi legislature and awaits a signature or veto from Governor Phil Bryant.

The religious freedom bill previously stalled as lawmakers wanted sufficient time to examine if the law would encourage discrimination against certain groups of people. After removing some of the language that could be construed as discriminatory, the bill was quickly pushed through. Even in its amended form, SB 2681 could open a time capsule of the past to the days of Jim Crow, Anti-Japanese sentiments, and other barriers from certain groups being served under the guise of religious beliefs.

Many in the Senate are still in disagreement over the language contained in the bill.
