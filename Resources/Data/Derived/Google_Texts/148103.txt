DENVER -- Give back to kids right here in your community this holiday season by helping us support our Season of Sharing toy drive here on FOX31.

Come to The Streets at Southglenn Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. with an unwrapped toy or gift to donate.

Tropical Smoothie Cafe at The Streets of Southglenn are part of the toy drive and today they're here with another incentive to donate when you come by their location tomorrow.

Welcome Michelle Shriver.
