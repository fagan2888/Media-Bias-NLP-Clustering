At the hospital, Szablya discovered her recently purchased LifeWise Health Plan did not include the premier children\u2019s hospital in its network. Also not in their network: Any hospitals with adolescent inpatient psychiatric units. A psychologist, Szablya wasn\u2019t taking any chances with her daughter\u2019s mental health. \u201cThere was no other place to go for this kind of specialty,\u201d notes Szablya, whose daughter was admitted to the hospital for a week.\n\n[SPECIAL REPORT: Hospital of Tomorrow]\n\nLifeWise, a Premera Blue Cross plan, is one of three Seattle-area insurers excluding Seattle Children\u2019s from their provider networks. Health insurance plans offered on Washington State\u2019s new Health Benefit Exchange by Regence Blue Shield and Coordinated Care Corp. also exclude Seattle Children\u2019s. (Coordinated Care is expected to list the hospital as a network provider beginning in May.) \u201cThe insurance companies are doing this to get around the costs associated with making sure everyone is covered,\u201d says Szablya.\n\nSeveral hospitals nationwide suddenly have found themselves excluded from exchange-offered health plan provider networks. Insurers say in order to offer affordable coverage under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s benefits and coverage mandates, they need to limit the numbers of hospitals and doctors in their provider networks to control costs. Insurers claim they pick network hospitals based on quality and cost-effectiveness, but others wonder if price is the biggest factor.\n\n[READ: When a Town's Only Hospital Shuts Down]\n\n\u201cThere is enough anecdotal evidence to say this is a trend,\u201d says Matthew Eyles, executive vice president with Washington, D.C., consulting firm Avalere Health. \u201cIt is part of a broader strategy by payers to get ahead of the costs.\u201d Excluding some of the higher cost settings, like academic medical centers, \u201cis an easy mark,\u201d Eyles says.\n\nThe impact of narrow networks has been small so far, as they are mostly associated with some new public exchange plans. \u201cThe bigger issue is what happens longer term? You could be looking at a much more significant impact,\u201d if narrow networks spread to commercial and private exchange plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care plans.\n\n\u201cOur biggest concern is wanting to provide quality care at an affordable price,\u201d says Eric Earling, spokesman for Premera Blue Cross. The smaller network allows Premera to reduce premiums by \u201cat least 5 percent\u201d compared to their regular network offerings, says Earling, adding Seattle Children\u2019s is \u201ctwice as expensive\u201d as other hospitals for delivering non-unique services. He adds Premera provides a mechanism, prior authorization, so non-network hospitals that provide unique services can be covered as an network provider when required.\n\nFor hospitals, network exclusion can hit the bottom line, affecting patient referrals and declining volume, and increase costs. Patients going to non-network providers pay significantly higher out-of-pocket costs\u2014sometimes the full tab\u2014under many new ACA exchange plans. Hospital officials in some markets say if they don\u2019t agree to significantly lower reimbursements, insurers are excluding them from networks. Hospitals fear narrow networks will expand into commercial plans.\n\n\u201cThis is moving very rapidly out of the public exchange plans and into other products,\u201d says Dr. Sandy Melzer, senior vice president and chief strategy officer of Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital. For example, Premera has extended its narrow provider network beyond its exchange plans to its individual and small group offerings, confirms Earling.\n\nMeanwhile, Seattle Children\u2019s is working with Szablya and has appealed to LifeWise to cover the family\u2019s claim as a so-called \u201csingle-case agreement\u201d after providing care. Szablya says she is on the hook for half of the eventual bill, since her PPO picks up 50 percent of out-of-network care. Many exchange offerings, such as HMOs, don\u2019t cover out-of-network care at all. Through late March, Seattle Children\u2019s has filed more than 300 \u201csingle-case agreements\u201d after treating patients whose health insurance plans have excluded the hospital. \u201cThis is not a viable plan for the long term,\u201d says Melzer. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful for families, it\u2019s taking a huge amount of our doctors\u2019 time\u2026we\u2019re spending hundreds of thousands of dollars [in administrative costs] and thousands of hours on this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Even if heart disease runs in your family, you can take steps to dramatically reduce your risk.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Patients aren't the only ones affected when health insurers drop hospitals from their networks.", "zone": "hospitalsoftomorrow/articles", "author": "Christopher J.
