The Neshoba County Sheriff\u2019s Department says he broke into the Neshoba Baptist Church in Union. Sheriff\u2019s deputies got a call Christmas morning about a suspicious person. On their way they found the Neshoba Baptist Church van crashed. From there, deputies went to the church where they found a broken window\n\n\u201cItems were missing. The church had been heavily vandalized. Found that there was a small amount of money, twenty to thirty dollars was taken. There was a computer system that had been taken,\u201d Sheriff Tommy Waddell says.\n\nAfter crawling through the window, he began to vandalize the inside of the church, and even wrote a message on a chalkboard.\n\n\u201cIn one of the Sunday school rooms the perpetrator entered, he left a message to law enforcement,\u201d Sheriff Waddell explains. \"It wasn\u2019t a pleasant message, but he did leave us a message that was directed to the law enforcement agency.\u201d\n\nThe church was equipped with security cameras and caught the burglar in the act. The sheriff's department was able to identify the man on surveillance as Kenneth Ray. After a dead end tip led them to Newton County, they went back to Neshoba County.\n\n\u201cWe received information that Mr. Ray had returned back to Neshoba County and we took him into custody at a residence on county road 488,\u201d Sheriff Waddell says.\n\nWhile inside the church Ray also acquired a set of keys to the church van, which he took on a joyride and wrecked on county road 317. Sheriff Waddell says he does not yet know a motive for the break-in, and can\u2019t understand why someone would do such a thing.\n\n\u201cAnybody that would break into the Lord\u2019s house on Jesus\u2019 birthday, taking from the church, you know, this is holiday season, this is the time to be giving not taking,\u201d Sheriff Waddell says.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A man arrested on Christmas day is charged with church burglary and auto theft.
