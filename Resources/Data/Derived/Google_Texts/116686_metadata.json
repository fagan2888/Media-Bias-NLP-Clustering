The California State Railroad Museum Foundation reminds us of the once-speeding postal trains, rather than today\u2019s trucks, where post office workers sorted letters during the trip. Moreover, they did so in \u201cswaying cars filled with canvas bags and wooden pigeon holes.\u201d That must have been fun.\n\nPerhaps a change back to rail and train is once again a practical venture. Reasons to encourage rail integration were laid out in a recent report by the Postal Service\u2019s Inspector General.\n\nBill McAllister for Stamp News and Coin World recently wrote on the new report, Suitability of Rail Transportation \u2014 New Jersey Network Distribution Center, and a dialog that followed.\n\nThe report supports the argument that, in this case, the New Jersey mail service could save about $10.8 million a year choosing to use rail instead of long-distance trucking. The information in IG\u2019s report seems solid. However, arguments from postal management ensued. McAllister continued with some back-and-forth points, noting that it is budget numbers that \u201cspeak the loudest.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2013, the Postal Service spent more than $3.4 billion on HCRs [highway contract routes] and only about $43 million on rail,\u201d the report cautions. Rail, management said, \u201cis not a viable way to meet service standards and does not fit into its operating plans.\u201d Even so, the IG argued that rail is \u201ca viable option and should be reconsidered.\u201d\n\nDue to the managerial opposition, it will be a while before any transition to trains that service postal loads. However, they did agree to consider the recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn spite of opposition, a convincing conversation might generate adaptation back to rail for some postal services. Last year, the rail industry did enjoy a resurgence as a Wall Street Journal video and Betsy Morris reported on America\u2019s New Railroad Age.\n\nThe postal service could certainly be much cleaner if it switched to rail. Trains from Seimens are just one example of how trains have become more fuel-efficient and burning cleaner. Roy L. Hayes in a CleanTechnica post reported that, according to Federal Railroad Administrator Joseph C. Szabo, \u201cthe lighter weight locomotives can operate at speeds up to 125 mph. A diesel version of the \u2018Charger\u2019 is currently pulling some 1,600 passengers and freight trains through-out Europe. The electric version was introduced in the US last year and already at work in the Northeast.\u201d\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nTrainsforming America: Documentary Advocates for More Robust Rail in the US\n\n100% Of Dutch Electric Trains Could Run On Renewable Energy BY 2018\n\nChicago High Speed Rail Line Gets Funded\n\nCalifornia High-Speed Rail Authority Has Formally Begun Process Of Procuring Trains\n\nCalifornia High-Speed Rail Groundbreaking\n\nIndian Railways Plans 1 GW Solar Power Capacity\n\nImage via California Railroad Museum Foundation\n\n\n\n\n\nGet CleanTechnica\u2019s 1st (completely free) electric car report \u2192 \u201cElectric Cars: What Early Adopters & First Followers Want.\u201d\n\n\n\nKeep up to date with all the hottest cleantech news by subscribing to our (free) cleantech newsletter, or keep an eye on sector-specific news by getting our (also free) solar energy newsletter, electric vehicle newsletter, or wind energy newsletter.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "United States Postal Service enjoyed a serviceable and successful relationship with the nation\u2019s railroads in the past --perhaps it is time to renew this.", "og": {"site_name": "CleanTechnica", "description": "Once upon a time, the United States Postal Service enjoyed a successful relationship with the nation\u2019s railroads.
