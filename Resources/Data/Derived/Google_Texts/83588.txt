BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) - Vermonters who use vending machines or like soft drinks are having to fork over a bit more cash for those things.

As of Wednesday, the state began applying its 6 percent sales tax to soft drinks and its 9 percent meals tax to vending machine purchases.

At Kerry’s Kwik Stop, owner Carrie Rockwood tells The Burlington Free Press (http://bfpne.ws/1GUMBLC) that “customers have been furious” about the new levy on soft drinks.

Customer Steve Grimm of South Burlington said that didn’t apply to him. He had to pay 12 cents in tax on the $1.89 price for a 20-ounce soft drink. “I probably would not have noticed if you hadn’t told me,” he said.

The new point-of-sale levies are part of a package of tax increases lawmakers passed in May to raise $30 million in new revenue. The biggest changes were new limits on income tax deductions.

The sales tax on soft drinks is expected to raise nearly $8 million a year. Applying the meals tax to vending machines is expected to raise about $1 million a year.
