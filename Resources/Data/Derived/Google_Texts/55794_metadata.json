It\u2019s a long delay that the Rams aren\u2019t accustomed to having. But it\u2019s nothing new to first-year CSU coach Mike Bobo; the Georgia teams he helped guide frequently endured a long layoff before going bowling.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s new for these guys, I\u2019ve had a few more practices than we normally would in a place like Georgia,\u201d Bobo said Friday. \u201cWe went last Friday and Saturday and we\u2019ll go this Friday and Saturday, where normally we\u2019d just have one, like tomorrow, because it\u2019s a recruiting weekend and show the recruits a practice. I went ahead and had four, just because these guys aren\u2019t used to it. They\u2019re used to playing relatively quick after their last game.\u201d\n\nBobo is confident the Rams (7-5) are on the right track. He credits the team\u2019s strength and conditioning staff headed by Ryan Davis for keeping the players in shape, as well as Terry DeZeeuw and his training staff for getting injured players healthy.\n\nAs for the practices, Bobo has made it a point to keep them short and quick paced.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re practicing, but not practicing too long a period of time,\u201d said CSU senior safety Kevin Pierre-Louis. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping our mind going, keeping our legs moving and keeping our technique still in our head. We\u2019re still constantly going back to football. We might get a little break, but next day, football is coming.\u201d\n\nThe practices will remain that way as long as Bobo sees the type of work he wants. If not, he said he may go to two-a-day workouts when CSU\u2019s finals are completed this week. That\u2019s the changeup for Bobo, who said he was accustomed to bowl practices at Georgia starting after finals were done and he had full control of his players. Now, he said finals become priority No. 1 as he expects the Rams to finish strong academically.\n\nThis week the team will practice every day but Tuesday, then after the session Dec. 20 he will send the players home to spend time with their families over Christmas. The Rams will reassemble Dec. 25 in Tucson, where they will play Nevada (6-6) in the Arizona Bowl.\n\nCSU\u2019s players plan to enjoy their family time, but they won\u2019t lose track of why they\u2019re eventually going to Tucson.\n\n\u201cYou stay in contact with your teammates and watch film as much as possible when you\u2019re on the road,\u201d said junior linebacker Deonte Clyburn. \u201cWhen you come back, you\u2019ve got to be sharp. You can\u2019t really be in a Christmas mind-set, even though you\u2019re going to be spending Christmas at home. We need to be homing in on what we need to do to win.\u201d\n\nEverybody has seen teams in bowl games that don\u2019t look sharp after a long layoff. Bobo thinks CSU has the right plan in place, with as much of the process being mental as it is physical.\n\nWith the exception of senior safety Trent Matthews (knee injury), Bobo will have a full roster. Still, the Rams will need to have the right approach on the field and off to be clicking against Nevada.\n\n\u201cI want them to be excited when they get to the bowl,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to just grind them all the way up to game time. I want to get our work done, and I want to enjoy the bowl experience and enjoy the rewards for going to a bowl. Again, what makes a bowl really fun is winning the ballgame, so we\u2019ve got to make sure we put in the work to do that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU playing a waiting game while prepping for bowl trip", "title": "CSU playing a waiting game while prepping for bowl trip", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/13/csu-playing-a-waiting-game-while-prepping-for-bowl-trip/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151123_015349_mike-bobo.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151123_015349_mike-bobo.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-13T20:14:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T21:37:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re keeping our mind going, keeping our legs moving and keeping our technique still in our head.\n\u201cI want them to be excited when they get to the bowl,\u201d Bobo said.\nAs for the practices, Bobo has made it a point to keep them short and quick paced.\nI want to get our work done, and I want to enjoy the bowl experience and enjoy the rewards for going to a bowl.\nBut it\u2019s nothing new to first-year CSU coach Mike Bobo; the Georgia teams he helped guide frequently endured a long layoff before going bowling."}
