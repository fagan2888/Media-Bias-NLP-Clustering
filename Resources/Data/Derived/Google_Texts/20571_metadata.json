This definition has given rise to a dispute over whether marijuana could be truly addictive, given that marijuana consumption isn\u2019t associated with severe negative physical consequences, compared to harder drugs like heroin, cocaine, or crystal meth.\n\nBut marijuana\u2019s entrance into more and more American homes has paralleled an escalating trend in the number of people seeking treatment for marijuana dependence. Last year in the U.S., 950,000 people sought help for marijuana dependence \u2014 more than cocaine or heroin \u2014 making pot the third leading reason for substance abuse therapy, behind alcohol and painkillers.\n\nUnlike with alcohol and opioids, however, there is no medication for marijuana dependence.\n\nTo search for one, scientists at the Maryland School of Medicine took aim at the compound behind weed cravings, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In particular, they searched for a way to keep THC from triggering the mind\u2019s reward pathways, which rely on the pleasure-inducing sensations of the brain hormone dopamine.\n\nPrior findings had shown that another brain chemical \u2014 kynurenic acid \u2014 could temper the production of dopamine in the mind\u2019s hedonistic centers.\n\nUsing a drug that increases kynurenic acid known as Ro 61-8048, the researchers found that the drug could quell marijuana cravings in monkeys and rats. The drug, moreover, reduced relapse rates in these animal models.\n\nAlthough this study supports the concept of modifying kynurenic acid levels to combat marijuana addiction, further research is needed before its ready for primetime.\n\nHigh levels of kynurenic acid in the brain\u2019s pleasure centers have been linked cognitive defects, although the monkeys and rats in this study did not suffer from any deficits in working memory after taking Ro 61-8048. In addition, drugs that target kynurenic pathway are approved for disorders like multiple sclerosis (Aubagio) and allergies (Rizaben).\n\n\u201cA medication that would safely and effectively assist in the treat\u00adment of marijuana dependence would be an important step forward in dealing with cannabis-use disorders,\u201d write the authors, led by Dr. Robert Schwarcz of the Maryland School of Medicine and Dr. Steven Goldberg of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nSource: Justinova Z, Mascia P, Wu HQ, et al.
