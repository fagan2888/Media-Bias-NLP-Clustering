If income is higher than projected, a household could be required to repay all or a portion of the credit. If income is lower, the household could receive a refund.\n\nFindings in the analysis include:\n\nHouseholds with an original income between 100 and 200 percent of the poverty level would have the lowest average repayment ($667) and refund ($412) amounts. Recently released federal data shows that approximately two-thirds of people who sign up for insurance through healthcare.gov and report their income have a household income up to 200 percent of the poverty level or $22,980 for an individual in 2013.\n\nHouseholds with an original income between 300 and 400 percent of the poverty level ($34,470 to $45,960 for an individual) would have the highest average repayment ($1,380) and refund ($1,601) amounts.\n\nFor nearly half (46 percent) of all households owing a repayment, the amount would be between $200 and $1,000. For about four in 10 (42 percent) households receiving a refund, the amount would fall in that range.\n\nA relatively small share of households had final incomes greater than or equal to 400 percent of the poverty level ($45,960 for an individual). These households would owe the highest amounts because they would be required to repay the entire advance credit without a cap on the repayment. Repayment estimates for these households ranged from an average of $2,306 to $3,837, depending on the original income.\n\nThe estimates came from a model developed by Kaiser analysts using data from the U.S. Census\u2019 Survey of Income and Program Participation 2008 Panel, which follows survey respondents from 2009 to 2012.\n\nFollow ACA on Twitter @ACAIntl or Facebook for news and event updates.
