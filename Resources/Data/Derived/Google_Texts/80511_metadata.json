As reported last week in The Chronicle, the bill would create several new grant programs aimed at reducing college costs, crack down on for-profit colleges, and take steps to reduce student-loan defaults.\n\nNot to be outdone, Republicans in the House of Representatives issued a white paper outlining their priorities for reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, and promised legislation to that end later this week. Their plan calls for radically simplifying federal student-aid and loan-repayment programs, encouraging online and competency-based learning, and easing the regulatory burden on colleges.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Senate Democrats favor top-down accountability for colleges, while the House Republicans prefer a limited federal role. Their plan would block President Obama\u2019s planned college-rating system, while rolling back recent \"program integrity\" rules that expanded state oversight over colleges, defined the credit hour, and conditioned a college\u2019s receipt of student-loan funds on its graduates\u2019 \"gainful employment.\"\n\nThe Senate proposal also focuses more on consumer protection, with provisions that would standardize financial-aid-award letters, provide more upfront disclosures to borrowers, and restore the ability to discharge student loans in bankruptcy.\n\nBut there are some areas of agreement between the approaches. Both would streamline student-loan repayment plans, revamp teacher-preparation programs, and make Pell Grants available year-round. The lawmakers also agree on the need to improve students\u2019 financial literacy, slim down the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, and simplify the information provided to prospective students.\n\nEven so, the two chambers are taking opposite approaches to renewing the nation\u2019s largest higher-education bill, and they aren\u2019t likely to reach a compromise on it during an election year. Senate Democrats are offering a comprehensive bill; House Republicans are taking a piecemeal approach.\n\nIn a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Rep. John P. Kline Jr. of Minnesota, chairman of the House education committee, said Republicans felt they would have a better chance of passing their bills through the Senate with a \"step by step\" approach to reauthorization.\n\n\"We have a lot of difficulty in sometimes getting our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol to move legislation,\" he said. \"We\u2019re going to get at things where we think we can get bipartisan, bicameral support.\"\n\nBut House Democrats dismissed the Republican plan, saying it would do little to make college more affordable or student-loan repayment more manageable.\n\n\"The Republicans\u2019 small-potatoes \u2018priorities\u2019 clearly aren\u2019t a real effort to address real problems like skyrocketing tuitions or massive student-loan debt,\" said a spokeswoman for Democrats on the committee, \"and they won\u2019t make a significant difference in students\u2019 ability to get into, complete, or pay for their education.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans and Democrats each present plans to reauthorize the key law, with many similar goals but conflicting means to achieve them.", "og": {"site_name": "The Chronicle of Higher Education", "description": "Republicans and Democrats each present plans to reauthorize the key law, with many similar goals but conflicting means to achieve them.", "title": "House and Senate Offer Different Visions for Renewal of Higher Education Act", "url": "http://chronicle.com/article/HouseSenate-Offer/147347/", "image": "https://chronicle-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/5/public/theme/che2015/img/app-icons/ognameplate.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans and Democrats each present plans to reauthorize the key law, with many similar goals but conflicting means to achieve them.", "title": "House and Senate Offer Different Visions for Renewal of Higher Education Act", "url": "http://chronicle.com/article/HouseSenate-Offer/147347/", "image": {"src": "https://chronicle-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/5/public/theme/che2015/img/app-icons/ognameplate.png"}, "site": "@chronicle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Kelly Field,Obamas,John P.
