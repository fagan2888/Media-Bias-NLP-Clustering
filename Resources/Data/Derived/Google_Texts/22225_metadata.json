In fact, it\u2019s inspiring their reinvention. And at the heart of any hospital are its patient rooms.\n\n\u201cYou have your specialty suites, your diagnostic and treatment areas, etc. But the rest of it is where the patients, after all the treatment is done, are going to reside for the duration of their stay,\u201d says Walter Jones, senior vice president of campus transformation for The MetroHealth System (Cleveland) and former senior vice president of facilities planning and development for Parkland Health & Hospital System. Jones oversaw construction of the new Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, of which 1 million square feet of its 2 million total are dedicated to 865 patient rooms. \u201cFrom a capital standpoint, from a construction standpoint, [patient rooms] can be a huge component,\u201d he says.\n\nIn addition to the impressive percentage of square footage allocated to patient rooms in any given building, these spaces\u2014and their design\u2014must support a number of shifts taking place in healthcare today, leading providers across the country to reconsider approaches of the past.\n\n\u201cWhat clients are doing as a result [of the outpatient shift] is circling back and, with the ability to either streamline or decant some of their outpatient and nonclinical services and free up real estate, investing in improving the inpatient experience and environment,\u201d says John Rodenbeck, a principal at Perkins Eastman (New York).\n\nThere are plenty of reasons for it, too. For starters, market competition is pushing the need for wholesale adoption of private patient rooms, especially as patients have more choice in where they receive care. Private rooms also come with a number of other proven benefits, such as reducing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and increasing patient satisfaction\u2014factors that hold a lot of water today, as the Affordable Care Act ties both outcomes and HCAHPS scores to reimbursements. And while the outpatient transition will likely reduce future bed needs, it also translates to the expectation that patients who do require hospital admission in years to come will be much more acute than today\u2019s inpatients.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just what we know. As technology begins to play a larger role in care delivery and mobile health solutions continue to be adopted, patient rooms must be designed with adaptability in mind and an eye on a future that\u2019s anything but clear.\n\n\u201cThe patient room is where you need to get everything right,\u201d says Ana Pinto Alexander, principal, senior vice president, and director of healthcare interior architecture at HKS (Indianapolis).\n\n\n\nThe baseline\n\nThe starting point for almost all patient room designs is a single-occupancy space. \u201cI think we\u2019re making great progress,\u201d says Cyndi McCullough, evidence-based design director for HDR (Omaha, Neb.). \u201cEvery project I\u2019ve worked on involves either renovating some rooms to make private rooms, adding new, or a combination of both. It\u2019s at the top of the list for most everyone.\u201d\n\nWhile the transition isn\u2019t as easy for systems with tight urban sites, the majority of providers are better able to, for example, renovate a 200-bed double-occupancy facility into a 100-bed single-occupancy facility than they were prior to reform. \u201cWith more procedures going into the outpatient arena, it\u2019s offering more real estate within the hospital to either convert or build private rooms for a lot less expensive price tags. They\u2019re not going for higher-bedded facilities,\u201d Rodenbeck says.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "[page-title],[metatags-global-keywords-1],Remodel / Renovation,Architectural Design Ideas,Evidence-based Architecture,Facility Planning,Healthcare Reform,Infection Control,Patient Safety,Rooms: Patient/Exam", "revisit-after": "1 day", "description": "[site-name],[site-mission]"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9534\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFrom a capital standpoint, from a construction standpoint, [patient rooms] can be a huge component,\u201d he says.\n\u201cEvery project I\u2019ve worked on involves either renovating some rooms to make private rooms, adding new, or a combination of both.\nAnd at the heart of any hospital are its patient rooms.\nFor starters, market competition is pushing the need for wholesale adoption of private patient rooms, especially as patients have more choice in where they receive care.\n\u201cThe patient room is where you need to get everything right,\u201d says Ana Pinto Alexander, principal, senior vice president, and director of healthcare interior architecture at HKS (Indianapolis)."}
