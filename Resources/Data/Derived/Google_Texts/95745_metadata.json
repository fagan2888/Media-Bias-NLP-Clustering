Avs coach Patrick Roy previously suggested Iginla \u2014 whose 560 career goals rank 25th all time \u2014 would be a good fit with his two youngest forwards.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s early and I\u2019m not sure what the line combinations will be, and they have a lot of skilled guys who could mix and match, but if that\u2019s the case, yeah, I\u2019ll be thrilled,\u201d Iginla said before teeing off at Joe Sakic\u2019s 17th annual charity golf tournament at Sanctuary Golf Course. \u201cMacKinnon, watching his speed and how he can do everything at top speed, and how driven Landeskog is \u2014 his creativity to go with his strength and the power forward that he is \u2014 it will be exciting. I think that\u2019s a great combination.\u201d\n\nIginla, 37, has played right wing most of his Hall of Fame-worthy career. Former Avs defenseman Adam Foote said Iginla will add \u201c10 pounds\u201d to each of his linemates because of his toughness and respect throughout the league.\n\n\u201cHe will take care of his teammates,\u201d said Foote, now a defensive assistant coach for Colorado. \u201cJarome, when he steps foot on the ice, he still has a lot of respect from a lot of defensemen out there that are like, \u2018OK we better play within the rules or this guy will hold us accountable.\u2019 I think that will really put 10 pounds on every forward that he plays with, and that\u2019s important out here in the West.\u201d\n\nIginla, who signed a three-year, $16 million contract with the Avs, said he and his family are settled in the Denver area with his three young children set to begin the school year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been exciting, and nice to get out here early and get used to the altitude,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Avs\u2019 training camp for veterans begins the week of Sept. 15. Sakic, the team\u2019s vice president of hockey operations, has one more major move to make before camp, and that\u2019s to sign defenseman Tyson Barrie, a restricted free agent who was Colorado\u2019s best offensive defenseman last season.\n\n\u201cWe have four weeks,\u201d Sakic said. \u201cNot everything happens right away, and some things take time. I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll be here.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers @denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jarome Iginla \u201cthrilled\u201d on idea to play with Avs\u2019 Landeskog, MacKinnon", "title": "Jarome Iginla \u201cthrilled\u201d on idea to play with Avs\u2019 Landeskog, MacKinnon", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/21/jarome-iginla-thrilled-on-idea-to-play-with-avs-landeskog-mackinnon/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140821_013118_jarome-iginla.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140821_013118_jarome-iginla.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-21T13:32:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:38:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd102e\"", "article_summary": "I think that\u2019s a great combination.\u201dIginla, 37, has played right wing most of his Hall of Fame-worthy career.\nFormer Avs defenseman Adam Foote said Iginla will add \u201c10 pounds\u201d to each of his linemates because of his toughness and respect throughout the league.\nLeft wing Gabe Landeskog was named the NHL\u2019s rookie of the year in 2012, and center Nathan MacKinnon won the award in June.\nAvs coach Patrick Roy previously suggested Iginla \u2014 whose 560 career goals rank 25th all time \u2014 would be a good fit with his two youngest forwards.\nSEDALIA \u2014 During his first public comments since moving to Colorado after signing as a free agent with the Avalanche on July 1, Jarome Iginla\u2019s eyes brightened Thursday when asked about playing right wing on a line with two of the past three Calder Trophy winners."}
