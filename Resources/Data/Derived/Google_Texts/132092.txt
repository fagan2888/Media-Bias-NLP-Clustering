New York Times columnist Paul Krugman complained today of the media’s coverage of what he calls “fake alarms,” i.e. issues put before the American people that aren’t issues so much as excuses to strike a political pose.

Benghazi is the most prominent at the moment, he argued, but others loom large with the coming presidential election. Foremost among them, the federal debt and its impact on the American economy. “Remember all the dire warnings about what would happen if China stopped buying our debt, or worse yet, starting selling it?” he asked. “Remember how interest rates would soar and America would find itself in crisis?”

That happened — China stopped purchasing America’s debt and started selling it. “And what has happened is what serious economic analysis always told us would happen?” Krugman wrote.
