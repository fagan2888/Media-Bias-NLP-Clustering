Enrollment hit 22,000 last week, the corporation said, and it hopes to reach 40,000 by the end of 2014.\n\nCurrently, only 7 percent of the 1.4 million people treated by the city\u2019s public hospitals each year have private insurance, according to the Greater New York Hospital Association. Another 58 percent are on Medicaid or Medicare, and 35 percent are uninsured; half of those are illegal immigrants, who cannot get coverage under the new law.\n\nThat patient mix fosters a common belief that the public hospitals are a last resort, or as one Yelp reviewer described Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center in Brooklyn: \u201cIf you were writing for a TV drama about the downtrodden castoffs of society, you could not have conceived of a more appropriate place.\u201d\n\nIn the Medicare system\u2019s Hospital Compare ratings, the city\u2019s public hospitals typically score lower in patient satisfaction than private ones. But they compare well on medical measures, like whether they follow protocols for heart attack, pneumonia and surgery patients.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor years, the hospitals corporation has tried to polish its image by contracting with private hospitals and medical schools to staff the public hospitals; for example, many Bellevue doctors come from NYU Langone Medical Center next door. And by attracting more affluent and choosy customers, the corporation hopes, it can also attract doctors into the MetroPlus networks who would not normally associate with public hospitals.\n\nMetroPlus was created in 1985 as a managed-care plan for Medicaid recipients. While there is no guarantee that offering MetroPlus on the health exchange will be profitable, the corporation projects that the exchange plans will bring $120 million a year in revenue to a system now running a $250 million annual deficit.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy this week, 66 percent of its customers were enrolled in the silver plan, suggesting that they had low to moderate incomes and expected to qualify for subsidies. But 10 percent enrolled in gold and 18 percent in platinum, suggesting higher incomes, which surprised MetroPlus officials.\n\nAs Mr. Obolsky discovered, MetroPlus offers the lowest premiums on the New York exchange for the top three standardized plans: $359 a month for silver, $396 a month for gold and $443 a month for platinum.\n\nOne major reason for the low prices is that MetroPlus will cover patients only at the city\u2019s 11 public hospitals and four private ones \u2014 Beth Israel\u2019s two campuses in Manhattan and Brooklyn, St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt in Manhattan, and Lutheran in Brooklyn. Except in an emergency, plan members will not be covered at some of the more prestigious hospitals like Mount Sinai and NYU Langone.\n\nMr. Aviles said that to keep its premiums down, MetroPlus had to offer relatively low reimbursement rates for hospitals. Several hospitals said they were still negotiating with MetroPlus and might join the network.\n\nMr. Obolsky, 48, a consultant, said he was happy to hear that St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt was on the plan, because its campuses were near him on the Upper West Side.\n\nRobyn Chapman, an artist who pieces together a living making and selling comic books, working as a legal assistant and cat sitting, signed up for a silver MetroPlus plan. Her first bill was for $119.42 a month after tax credits.\n\nShe had not realized that MetroPlus was run by the city hospital system. But that would not have stopped her, she said, because she was looking mainly for price. She was familiar with one city hospital \u2014 Woodhull in Brooklyn \u2014 because she had used its clinics for routine medical care at $20 a visit. She said the waiting times there were very long, many patients seemed desperate and some nurses and doctors were \u201ca bit cold, maybe even a little rude.\u201d\n\nShe might try a different hospital, but otherwise she said: \u201cI can\u2019t complain. I\u2019m honestly very grateful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMark P. Scherzer, a consumer lawyer and counsel to New Yorkers for Accessible Health Coverage, said he expected MetroPlus would \u201cstill be sort of a poorer person\u2019s plan,\u201d with lower prices and lower quality.\n\nMr. Aviles conceded that for some people, public hospitals would never be acceptable, regardless of how well they delivered care.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a headwind in terms of how many hospitals there are in New York City and how many have designer labels,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the same way that if you\u2019re affluent and buying a pair of jeans, you may be willing to spend $200 for those jeans because they have a designer label.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140115182232, "twitter": {"description": "The health exchanges created under the
