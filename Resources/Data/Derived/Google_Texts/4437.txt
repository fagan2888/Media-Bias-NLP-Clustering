Cast Party, billed as the Lollapalooza of podcasts, is beaming live to a theater near you at 6 p.m. July 28. Music, comedy, dance, five podcasts and more are part of what the producer promises is “a live stage show simulcast to cinemas, celebrating the emergence of podcasting as a powerhouse medium with millions of obsessed fans.”

Anyone who’s ever enjoyed Radio Lab, Invisibilia, Reply All, the improv comedy show “With Special Guest Lauren Lapkus” (you may know her from “Orange is the New Black”) or The Truth — may want to ditch the private, intimate, earbud experience for a theater full of fellow pod-people.

Seth Lind, co-creator, host and producer, acknowledged this will be somewhat unlike the solo podcast experience, but said, “there’s nothing quite like being in a room full of people excited about the same thing. … It will be totally energetic, communal, live, public and loud,” he said.
