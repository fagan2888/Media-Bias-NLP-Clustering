(AP) - A New Mexico woman is suing a hospital and its parent company after hackers accessed personal information belonging to her and more than 4 million other patients, the Albuquerque Journal reported (http://bit.ly/1p3W3oh) Saturday.\n\nAttorneys for Briana Brito said they were seeking class-action status for the lawsuit.\n\nThe suit, which was filed Sept. 19, alleges Brito had personal data stolen while hospitalized at Alta Vista Regional Hospital in Las Vegas. According to Brito, the Franklin, Tennessee-based Community Health Systems, which owns the hospital, didn\u2019t notify patients in a timely manner. She \u201cnow faces a substantial increased risk of identity theft, if not actual identity theft,\u201d the suit said.\n\nThe suit is requesting a judge order the company pay restitution for any losses from identity theft, consumer credit protection and insurance.\n\nTomi Galin, company spokeswoman, declined to comment on Friday. In a written statement, Galin said the firm does not discuss pending litigation.\n\nCommunity Health Systems disclosed in August that the company had been the victim of a cyberattack that came from a group in China that used sophisticated malware and technology to obtain information. The company said the attack may have happened in April and June. No medical or credit card records were taken, the company said.\n\nHowever, hackers managed to bypass security systems to take patient names, addresses, birthdates and phone and Social Security numbers. Community Health has since removed the malware from its system and finalized \u201cother remediation efforts\u201d to prevent future attacks.\n\nThe information that was taken came from patients who were referred to or received care from doctors tied to the company over the past five years.\n\nCommunity Health owns, leases or operates 206 hospitals in 29 states. In New Mexico, the company oversees five other facilities.\n\nBrito\u2019s attorneys plan to join another lawsuit out of Texas.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Albuquerque Journal, http://www.abqjournal.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A New Mexico woman is suing a hospital and its parent company after hackers accessed personal information belonging to her and more than 4 million other patients, the Albuquerque Journal reported (http://bit.ly/1p3W3oh) Saturday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/12/new-mexico-hospital-sued-over-patient-data-breach/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A New Mexico woman is suing a hospital and its parent company after hackers accessed personal information belonging to her and more than 4 million other patients, the Albuquerque Journal reported (http://bit.ly/1p3W3oh) Saturday.", "title": "New Mexico hospital sued over patient data breach"}, "twitter": {"title": "New Mexico hospital sued over patient data breach", "description": "A New Mexico woman is suing a hospital and its parent company after hackers accessed personal information belonging to her and more than 4 million other patients, the Albuquerque Journal reported (htt", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03e2\"", "article_summary": "She \u201cnow faces a substantial increased risk of identity theft, if not actual identity theft,\u201d the suit said.\nAccording to Brito, the Franklin, Tennessee-based Community Health Systems, which owns the hospital, didn\u2019t notify patients in a timely manner.\nThe suit, which was filed Sept. 19, alleges Brito had personal data stolen while hospitalized at Alta Vista Regional Hospital in Las Vegas.\nThe suit is requesting a judge order the company pay restitution for any losses from identity theft, consumer credit protection and insurance.\nHowever, hackers managed to bypass security systems to take patient names, addresses, birthdates and phone and Social Security numbers."}
