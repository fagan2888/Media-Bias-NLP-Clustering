Serbia’s resigned Finance Minister Lazar Krstic Reuters

Serbian finance minister Lazar Krstic resigned on Saturday after Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic found his planned austerity measures too harsh.

On its way to eventually joining the European Union, Serbia needs heavy measures to rein in its budget deficit and carry out an overall social system overhaul.

Mr. Krstic wanted to push forward a program including severe public sector wage and pension cuts, layoffs and the adjustment of electricity prices to market levels, but Mr. Vucic thought these would hit citizens too hard now, state news agency Tanjug reported.

Acting Minister of Finance Dusan Vujovic, the successor of Mr. Krstic, on Monday said reducing public sector wages and pensions this year by 10% would be reasonable. Speaking on state television and cited by the finance ministry website, he said that it shouldn’t be just state employees and pensioners bearing the burden of fiscal consolidation targeted in 2017, but tax revenues should also be increased in areas now subject to tax evasion.

“The plan is to cut the budget deficit by about 60 billion dinars every year,” Mr. Vujovic said.

Serbia’s consolidated budget deficit was RSD178.7 billion ($2.09 billion) at the end of 2013 accounted for 4.8% of the country’s gross domestic product.
