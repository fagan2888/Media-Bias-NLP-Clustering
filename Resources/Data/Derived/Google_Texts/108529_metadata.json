Robert Seymour, Smith\u2019s pastor, told the crowd. \u201cBut this gathering was not for Dean. This gathering was for us. He didn\u2019t need it, but we needed it.\u201d\n\nSmith died two weeks ago at the age of 83. The family had held a private service last week, one attended by prominent names like Michael Jordan and Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nThe school estimated between 9,000 and 10,000 attended Sunday\u2019s program lasting more than two hours in the campus arena bearing Smith\u2019s name. It capped a slow goodbye that had included pregame moments of silence at venues where the Tar Heels weren\u2019t even playing, tributes from opponents in games they were and even UNC running Smith\u2019s famed \u201cFour Corners\u201d offense to open Saturday\u2019s game against Georgia Tech.\n\nSmith\u2019s pupil, current Tar Heels coach Roy Williams, said he hoped Sunday would bring closure to the mourning but not the memories.\n\n\u201cEverybody has negatives, everybody has pluses,\u201d Williams said. \u201cCoach Smith had more pluses than anybody I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d\n\nWilliams then had the crowd point upward, a nod to Smith\u2019s \u201cpoint to the passer\u201d tradition of acknowledging the player who set up a basket.\n\nSpeakers told stories about how Smith fought having the Smith Center named after him, how he took his team to practice at prisons as a humane gesture to inmates, even how he sent handwritten notes to letterwinners after the birth of their children long after they had ever played for him.\n\n\u201cHe coached you to be a better basketball player for four years,\u201d former 1970s walk-on Mickey Bell said. \u201cHe coached you to be a man for a lifetime.\u201d\n\nSmith had kept a low profile in recent years amid health issues that had affected his memory. But his presence is still felt strongly around the program and attracted lines stretching around the arena more than an hour before fans could enter \u2014 a scene former Smith player Serge Zwikker documented with photos before entering the building.\n\nFans were also able to sign guest books with their memories of Smith once inside, books that will be presented to Smith\u2019s family.\n\nMegan Porter, 24, drove in from West Virginia for the weekend and waited in line about 90 minutes to attend with her mother, sister and 5-year-old daughter Payton.\n\nGary Mattocks Jr., 31, of Raleigh, stopped to write about the memory of watching Smith\u2019s 1993 team win the NCAA championship and said it would have felt \u201cdisrespectful\u201d if he hadn\u2019t come.\n\n\u201cI think for most everyone it\u2019s not about seeing this on television, we all have some kind of special reason deep inside of us (to attend),\u201d said Greg Bullard, 39, a lawyer and UNC graduate who drove from Lumberton. \u201cDean is Carolina.\u201d\n\nOther speakers included former players Phil Ford, Brad Daugherty and Antawn Jamison, who played on Smith\u2019s final team before his October 1997 retirement as the winningest coach in men\u2019s Division I history with 879 victories.\n\nThe service attracted former UNC players and coaches such as Larry Brown, Kenny Smith and J.R. Reid, as well as longtime Smith assistant and successor Bill Guthridge.\n\nOther notable attendees included: Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner and former UNC athletic director John Swofford; former Texas and UNC football coach Mack Brown; North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory and U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican.\n\nFormer Georgetown coach John Thompson, an assistant to Smith on the gold medal-winning 1976 U.S. Olympic team, was to speak but was unable to attend due to illness. His son, current Hoyas coach John Thompson III, attended in his place.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Fans, former players attend public memorial for Dean Smith", "title": "Fans, former players attend public memorial for Dean Smith", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/22/fans-former-players-attend-public-memorial-for-dean-smith/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150222__464133790p1.jpg", "height": 447}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150222__464133790p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-22T13:56:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:28:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f69\"", "article_summary": "His son, current Hoyas coach John Thompson III, attended in his place.\nThe service attracted former UNC players and coaches such as Larry Brown, Kenny Smith and J.R.
