Police have recovered a black Toyota Corolla that was hijacked from a food delivery man at gunpoint Friday night, officials have confirmed.

The vehicle was found abandoned near a playground on Hearthstone Drive Monday afternoon, said Sgt. Kevin Doyle. The Ocean County Sheriff Department's K-9 unit was brought in to search the car for clues, however Doyle said police have no suspects in custody at this point.

The vehicle was stolen from Laurel Avenue when two male suspects — one black and one Hispanic — robbed a Chinese food delivery man with a gun sometime after 7 p.m. Friday, according to police.

The 31-year-old delivery man from Hackensack told police the black man placed him in a choke hold and pointed the gun at his side as he was trying to deliver food. The Hispanic man then told the delivery man to be quiet and took his food and money, police say.

The suspects then demanded the victim walk away from the area and the pair drove away in his black 2011 Toyota Corolla. They were last seen driving eastbound on Laurel Avenue.

Lakewood Detective Sgt. Greg Staffordsmith said it doesn't appear the two men were associated with the house the delivery man was taking food to.

"We don't know if they were originally intended to receive the food," Staffordsmith said.

Anyone with information is asked to call Staffordsmith at 732-363-0200 ext. 5318.
