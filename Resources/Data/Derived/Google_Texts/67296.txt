Saturday, hundreds of community members attended the 4th Annual 'Celebrate the Arts' event at Harley Davidson in Panama City Beach.

"We help them with electric bills, we help them with rent, we help them with trolley passes, we help them with dental," said Debi Knight, Development Director of Beach Care Services.

Those are some of the necessities Beach Care Services provides to members of the community that need help with financial stability.

"We're sometimes the last little stop before they are homeless, so it is the most precious amazing thing for us to give and for them to recieve, its priceless," said Karen Smith, Founder of the event.

The celebration is a large fundraiser to showcase 35 local artists and their work.

Ten percent of their sales at the fundraiser goes directly to the Beach Services Charity.

"Being able to do what I love and what I've done for almost 20 years and contribute back to the community with that, it makes me feel good. I really enjoy it," said Leah Matthews, Owner of Star Gallery Jewelry.

The live band is a hit every year, and over 10 local sponsors contributed to the event.

Marta Rose, Director of Marketing and Events for Harley Davidson came up with the creative idea to dress local celebrities up in Harley Davidson gear and auction them off for charity.

"They're going to be showcasing Harley's new summer line, so its really cool," said Rose.

She also says this event is something she looks forward to every year.

"They get very creative with the events they do to raise money and this is just one of them and Harley is just happy to have everybody here and to be working hand in hand with so many people from the community," said Rose.
