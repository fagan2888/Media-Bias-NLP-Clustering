But we\u2019re growing weary of the nonsense of the court proceedings.\n\nShenanigans based on the case\u2019s gag order have been over the top from Day One \u2014 ranging from keeping information private that has already been aired in court to the latest bizarre defense filings over the court spokesman\u2019s Twitter feed.\n\nOn Wednesday, the defense submitted a complaint about Rob McCallum, the public information officer for the Colorado judicial branch. The motion asked the court to crack down on McCallum for allegedly violating the judge\u2019s gag order and included a broad look at McCallum\u2019s Twitter feed \u2014 including who he follows, his \u201cjovial tweets\u201d with a prosecutor, exchanges with reporters, announcements about press conferences and responses to questions from non-news sources.\n\nThe 18-page filing provides clear evidence of one thing: McCallum is doing a great job. He is performing his duties exactly how they are written \u2014 helping the press do its job and responding to questions. At times, he is even funny.\n\nThe Holmes\u2019 case is one of the most intriguing in the country and is being watched internationally. McCallum has handled the crush of media interest with aplomb and has not endangered the case with his Twitter feed.\n\nLast year, McCallum was even awarded the Sue O\u2019Brien Award for Public Service by the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition. Yet, the defense believes his tweets are inappropriate and could be grounds for \u201cimmediate recusal and imposition of judicial discipline.\u201d\n\nAll this for \u2014 among other things \u2014 telling reporters when documents will be released and where to pick them up; retweeting a reporter\u2019s message about an important court date; and inserting the hashtag #JusticeForJessica after the 10-year-old\u2019s killer pleaded guilty to all charges.\n\nThe motion says McCallum has \u201cunderminded Mr. Holmes\u2019 right to a fair trial by an impartial jury.\u201d\n\nHolmes\u2019 rights for a fair trial have not been trampled. If anything, the public\u2019s right to know basic information about the horrific shooting has been undermined by the overreaching gag order.\n\nBecause of the demand for silence on the case, Aurora police officials have not been allowed to discuss the heroism that occurred July 20, 2012, when patrol officers loaded wounded victims into their cars because ambulances couldn\u2019t get close to the theater. Officers testified by the end of the shift, their cars were sloshing with victims\u2019 blood. But they can\u2019t talk about it outside of court.\n\nOther cities seeking to learn how Aurora managed its resources in response to the massacre have been denied information because of the gag order. The public could be served by allowing communities to discuss what went right and what went wrong.\n\nEven victims themselves have been rebuffed in the name of preserving the sanctity of a fair trial for Holmes. Victims suing the owners of the theater where the assault occurred have been denied access to transcripts and exhibits that were presented in open court during Holmes\u2019 preliminary hearing.\n\nAnd now this kvetch about McCallum\u2019s Twitter feed. This frivolous motion was a waste of taxpayer resources that pay for Holmes\u2019 public defenders, court personnel who process the complaint, and the judge who must read it and issue an order.\n\nFortunately, Judge Carlos Samour didn\u2019t find any violations to mute McCallum and merely issued an order reminding everyone a gag order on the case remains active.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t need to say that. We already were gagging.\n\nJeremy P.
