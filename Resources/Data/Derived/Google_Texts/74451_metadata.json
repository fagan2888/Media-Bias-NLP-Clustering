Steve Beshear (D), can choose insurance from seven different companies on Kynect, the state's health insurance exchange, during open enrollment from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31, 2016.\n\nThe co-op lost $50 million last year after selling 75% of the private insurance policies purchased on Kynect in its first year.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs previously reported by Healthcare Dive, 22 of the 23 state co-ops have struggled with costs (except Maine) and have had lower than expected enrollees. Two other co-ops have closed since August: New York and Nevada. Glenn Jennings, interim CEO of Kentucky Health Cooperative, said it lacked adequate federal funding to keep its doors open.\n\nLast week, the federal government said it would only provide 12.6% of funds required by insurance providers through the assistance program. Jennings said Kentucky hoped to receive $77 million but was given only $9.7 million.\n\nThe co-op is working with the Kentucky Department of Insurance and CMS to help ensure a \"smooth transaction,\" according to Kentucky.com.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nKentucky.com: Kentucky Health Cooperative going out of business; 51,000 insurance customers affected", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Nina Flanagan", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/9b/05/9b05858761b94c19dbec9cca0ace9eb5.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer,healthcare-finance", "news_keywords": "Payer,Finance", "category": "News Post", "title": "Kentucky Health Co-op closing due to financial hardships", "pub_date": "oct 13, 2015", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-13T21:32:11", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Tuesday, October 13, 2015, 09:32 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2025-09-30T21:32:11", "teaser": "<p>Close to 51,000 members will have to find other insurance by Dec. 31.&nbsp;</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2015-10-13", "sailthru.description": "Close to 51,000 members will have to find other insurance by Dec. 31.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "Close to 51,000 members will have to find other insurance by Dec. 31.", "title": "Kentucky Health Co-op closing due to financial hardships", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/kentucky-health-co-op-closing-due-to-financial-hardships/407188/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/Fotolia_52654662_Subscription_Monthly_M_KDQTf47.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/15/32/153291c1c4d4d1e2b32f344c4204b956.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Recommended ReadingKentucky.com: Kentucky Health Cooperative going out of business; 51,000 insurance customers affected\nGlenn Jennings, interim CEO of Kentucky Health Cooperative, said it lacked adequate federal funding to keep its doors open.\nDive Brief:Kentucky Health Cooperative announced it is going out of business and will end its 51,000 memberships on Dec. 31.\nSteve Beshear (D), can choose insurance from seven different companies on Kynect, the state's health insurance exchange, during open enrollment from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31, 2016.\nThe co-op is working with the Kentucky Department of Insurance and CMS to help ensure a \"smooth transaction,\" according to Kentucky.com."}
