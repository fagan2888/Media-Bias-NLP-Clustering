ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds ran for 117 of his 183 yards in the first half and the Midshipmen began their quest to reclaim the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy with a 33-11 victory over Air Force on Saturday.

Reynolds completed 4 of 10 passes for 117 yards with a touchdown on a wet, windy day. Chris Swain, a 6-foot-1, 245-pound fullback, had a pair of short-yardage scores for the Midshipmen (4-0).

It was Navy’s largest margin of victory in the series since 1978.

Air Force (2-2) committed a season-high four turnovers, all in Navy territory. Karson Roberts, who was just 5 for 12 for 73 yards with an interception, ran for his team’s lone touchdown in the fourth quarter.

Now in its 44th year, the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy is presented annually to the winner of the football games among the three major service academies — Army, Navy and Air Force. The Falcons won the trophy last season after beating Navy 30-21 and Army 23-6.
