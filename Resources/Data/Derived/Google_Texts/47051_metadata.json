I'll be able to do day-to-day things, go and see people, walk in the street, even go to any public areas.\u201d\n\nThe procedure, which was performed at Morrison Hospital in Swansea, is described by the medical team as the first of its kind. First, surgeons used a CT scan to develop a digital model of Power\u2019s skull. They then used a 3D printer to create the parts needed to restore symmetry to his face.\n\nDr. Adrian Sugar, a maxillofacial surgeon who led the procedure, said that the printing technology allowed the team to achieve an unprecedented level of accuracy and detail. \"Without this advanced technology, it's freehand. You have to guess where everything goes,\" he explained. \"The technology allows us to be far more precise and get a better result for the patient.\"\n\nThe reconstructive procedure was first announced last year as a collaborative effort between Morrison and the Centre for Applied Reconstructive Technologies in Surgery \u2014a leading developer of innovative prosthetics and reconstruction methods. Power\u2019s transformation is currently featured at the London Science Museum as part of the exhibition \u201c3D: Printing the Future.\u201d\n\n)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "3d printed face, stephen power, adrian sugar, reconstructive surgery, printing the future", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Stephen Power has had his appearance restored through a groundbreaking reconstructive procedure using 3D printing technology.", "title": "Crash Victim Gets New Face, Thanks To 3D Printing [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/3d-printed-face-uk-crash-victim-gets-new-face-groundbreaking-procedure-271156", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/13/face.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stephen Power has had his appearance restored through a groundbreaking reconstructive procedure using 3D printing technology.", "title": "Crash Victim Gets New Face, Thanks To 3D Printing [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/3d-printed-face-uk-crash-victim-gets-new-face-groundbreaking-procedure-271156", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/13/face.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/13/face.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-03-13T10:23:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-13T10:23:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Stephen Power has had his appearance restored through a groundbreaking reconstructive procedure using 3D printing technology."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf20b\"", "article_summary": "A UK man who suffered severe facial damage in a motorcycle accident has had his appearance restored in a cutting-edge reconstructive procedure with 3D printing technology.\nPower\u2019s transformation is currently featured at the London Science Museum as part of the exhibition \u201c3D: Printing the Future.\u201d)\nDr. Adrian Sugar, a maxillofacial surgeon who led the procedure, said that the printing technology allowed the team to achieve an unprecedented level of accuracy and detail.\nThey then used a 3D printer to create the parts needed to restore symmetry to his face.\nThe reconstructive procedure was first announced last year as a collaborative effort between Morrison and the Centre for Applied Reconstructive Technologies in Surgery \u2014a leading developer of innovative prosthetics and reconstruction methods."}
