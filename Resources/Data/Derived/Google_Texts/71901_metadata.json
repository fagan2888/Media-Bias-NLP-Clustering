Now, after 34 years in the House, Wolf is retiring, and voters in Virginia\u2019s tenth district have the opportunity to elect Comstock, currently serving a third term in the Virginia House of Delegates, as his worthy replacement.\n\nRob Engstrom, senior vice president and national political director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \u2014 which endorsed Comstock in August \u2014 says the campaign to represent Virginia\u2019s tenth district will be \u201cone of three or four of the most watched races in America.\u201d As the Republican candidate in a district that went for Mitt Romney by just one point in 2012, Comstock was already in for a trying campaign \u2014 but local Democrats, including her opponent, attorney John Foust, are keen to make it a mudbath.\n\nIn August, Foust told a Leesburg audience, \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s even had a real job.\u201d This month, Comstock\u2019s campaign responded with an ad condemning Foust\u2019s comments as \u201csexist, bizarre, insensitive, ignorant.\u201d The tenth district\u2019s Democratic party replied by tweeting, \u201cIf @barbaracomstock were a man, she\u2019d be down 20 pts w women.

But voters assume . . . \u201d\n\nIt is hardly surprising that the only war on women in sight is being waged by Democrats \u2014 but Virginia voters should not be fooled. Comstock is a woman of accomplishment, and more than capable of fighting back.\n\nA Massachusetts native who migrated south in the early 1980s, Comstock is an attorney who has worked in the private and public sectors, in positions at the state and national levels. As a two-term senior aide for Wolf \u2014 who endorsed her in a web ad in early September \u2014 Comstock worked on issues ranging from health care and appropriations to tax administration. From 2002 to 2003, she headed the public-affairs branch of President George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department, coordinating DOJ communications on terrorism investigations, the D.C. sniper case, judicial confirmations, and a host of other issues. After three years as a senior partner at law firm Blank Rome\u2019s D.C.-based government-relations affiliate, she co-founded her own public-policy and government-relations firm, Corallo Comstock. In 2008, drawing on her experience as a lead researcher for George W. Bush\u2019s 2000 presidential campaign, she served as a consultant to Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign. (She also is a former board member of the National Review Institute.)\n\nHer opponents have fixated on her work as chief investigative counsel and senior counsel for the House Committee on Government Reform from 1995 to 1999, in the so-called Clinton Wars of the nineties. Former Clinton adviser Paul Begala has accused Comstock, who worked on the \u201cTravelgate\u201d and \u201cFilegate\u201d investigations, of a \u201creally almost sick, sort of stalker-like obsession with President Clinton.\u201d \u201cIf she wins,\u201d Begala says, \u201cshe will no doubt practice the same politics of personal destruction she and her ilk practiced in the Clinton days.\u201d This is Begala\u2019s way of saying that Comstock was a dogged investigator \u2014 with a lot to investigate.\n\nComstock should be proud of her work in the 1990s, but she has also proven herself a talented and creative legislator. She has worked tirelessly for conservative reform in her four years as a Virginia delegate, often winning bipartisan support for her initiatives. She has helped to secure tax credits for high-tech industries and telework, and extended the capital-gains tax exemption. She supported 2010 legislation that opened the Virginia coast to offshore drilling. As a proponent of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, Comstock has opposed the expansion of Virginia\u2019s Medicaid program while arguing for health-care savings accounts, interstate insurance, and other consumer-focused health-care solutions.\n\nComstock\u2019s strong conservative presence in Richmond has earned her high marks from, among others, the National Rifle Association, the Family Foundation of Virginia, and the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, which awarded her its 2012 Free Enterprise Award. She has also received the endorsement of pundits such as Mark Levin and Sean Hannity.\n\nBut she has also proven her ability to work with colleagues across the aisle. Comstock\u2019s much-touted legislation increasing penalties for human trafficking received near-unanimous support in the Virginia General Assembly, as did earlier legislation she co-sponsored that provided additional government assistance to trafficking victims.\n\nMention of Comstock\u2019s work to protect Virginia\u2019s vulnerable young women is conspicuously absent among Democrats eager to claim that she is not a \u201cwoman\u2019s candidate.\u201d Nor do they mention her Young Women\u2019s Leadership Program, which offers career-development assistance to junior-high and high-school girls by connecting them with professional leaders, such as Erin Egan, chief privacy officer for Facebook, and CNN political commentator Donna Brazile.\n\nDemocrats are desperate to keep Comstock out of Congress \u2014 thus the war against her, and against the women she is helping.
