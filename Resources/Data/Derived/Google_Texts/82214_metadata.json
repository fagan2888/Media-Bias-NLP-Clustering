And more than 86% of Americans now have health insurance, up from 82% in mid-2013.\n\nEven so, according to a new Gallup poll, a third of Americans say they aren\u2019t getting the medical care they need because of cost.\n\nIn fact, more Americans are putting off medical care than ever before in the 14-year history of the poll.\n\nSource: Gallup\n\nUninsured Americans aren\u2019t the only ones delaying medical treatment. Some 34% of Americans with private health insurance say they\u2019ve skipped out on care because it was too expensive, up from 25% last year. Additionally, 28% of households that earn $75,000 or more report that family members have delayed care, up from just 17% last year.\n\nOne likely culprit? Rising out-of-pocket costs. Americans who get healthcare coverage through their employers have seen deductibles more than double in the past eight years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s part of a movement towards what\u2019s come to be termed \u201cconsumer-driven health care.\u201d\n\nThe thinking is, when patients are more aware of healthcare costs and more discerning about what care they really need, they will also be more discerning in their usage\u2014which in theory would lower costs for everyone involved. Two-thirds of large employers think consumer-driven healthcare is one of the most effective tactics to reduce costs, according to the National Business Group on Health.\n\nBut Gallup found that more Americans are skimping on care that they think they really do need. According to the survey, 22% of Americans say they\u2019ve put off treatment for a serious condition, vs. 19% last year. The percentage of Americans who say they put off care for a non-serious condition stayed flat at 11%.\n\nPrevious studies have found that when consumers are asked to share more of the costs, they put off both necessary and unnecessary care.\n\nFor example, one study found that people on high-deductible plans are less likely to buy expensive, brand-name drugs (which may be sensible), but they\u2019re also less likely to buy generic drugs they need to treat chronic conditions (likely not sensible).\n\nWhen forced to pay more out-of-pocket, men in particular are more likely to skip care for serious problems like irregular heartbeats and kidney stones.\n\nWhat\u2019s especially frightening about these findings is that delaying needed care to save money in the short term may result in more costly complications and more difficult-to- treat health issues in the longer term. Skipping the cholesterol screening now, for example, could mean racking up a $100,000 tab for a heart attack later.\n\nAre you avoiding treatment you need because you\u2019re afraid of the bill? Try these strategies to get the same healthcare for a quarter of the price. If you\u2019re on a high-deductible plan, use your Health Savings Account to budget for your expected\u2014and unexpected\u2014costs.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "More insured Americans are skipping out on health treatments that they need because of cost, a new Gallup poll finds.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "More insured Americans are skipping out on getting care they need because of cost, a new Gallup poll finds.", "title": "Why 1 in 3 Americans is Scared to Go to the Doctor", "url": "http://time.com/money/3611885/healthcare-costs-insurance-delaying-care/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/141201_ff_scareddoctor.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/141201_ff_scareddoctor.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Why 1 in 3 Americans is Scared to Go to the Doctor", "description": "More insured Americans are skipping out on getting care they need because of cost, a new Gallup poll finds.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "MONEY"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "keywords": ", affordable care act, deductibles, gallup, health, health care, health insurance, healthcare, healthcare costs, high deductible, high deductible health plan, insurance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, deductibles, gallup, health, health care, health insurance, healthcare, healthcare costs, high deductible, high deductible health plan, insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfed4\"", "article_summary": "In fact, more Americans are putting off medical care than ever before in the 14-year history of the poll.\nEven so, according to a new Gallup poll, a third of Americans say they aren\u2019t getting the medical care they need because of cost.\nThe percentage of Americans who say they put off care for a non-serious condition stayed flat at 11%.\nAccording to the survey, 22% of Americans say they\u2019ve put off treatment for a serious condition, vs. 19% last year.\nSome 34% of Americans with private health insurance say they\u2019ve skipped out on care because it was too expensive, up from 25% last year."}
