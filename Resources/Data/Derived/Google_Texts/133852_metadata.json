Decision Resources's \u201cTaking the Pulse Nurses 2014,\u201d found that the majority of NPs (79%) and PAs (69%) \u201cprovide or recommend patient support resources for patients.\u201d\n\nThis presents an opportunity for industry, says Matthew Arnold, principal analyst for Manhattan Research, a company owned by Decision Resources. According to Arnold, \u201cIt was clear in these results that NPs and PAs are taking a key role for providing those patient resources from pharma.\u201d\n\nThat prominent role is largely due to the surge of insured Americans following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Arnold pointed out. In this new healthcare landscape, NPs, PAs and RNs have all been pushed to the fore of primary care.\n\nThe results of the study\u2014which involved a poll of 700 US nurses, NPs and PAs in second-quarter 2014\u2014suggest this group is becoming more engaged with patients: 47% of PAs and 43% of NPs said the amount of time they've spent on patient education has increased over the past two years. That's even as their EHR use increased from 2013 to 2014: PAs spend 4.4 hours per day on EHRs, and NPs spend the most time at 4.7 hours, vs. an average time for physicians of 2.8 hours per day.\n\nAnd nurses aren't just looking for any kind of education. Researchers detected a strong preference for digital resources among the study cohort.\u201cWe saw substantial demand for more pharma digital resources that nurses could share with patients,\u201d noted Arnold.\n\nNor is this prescribing segment simply looking for another brand.com. \u201cThey're interested in resources that are tailored to their specific profession, specialty and patient population,\u201d said Arnold, adding that 42% of NPs indicated they would be \u201cinclined to engage digital resources more often if they were tailored to patient populations of interest.\u201d\n\nWhat they want can best be summed up in one word: value. \u201cWe found that RNs, NPs and PAs rate pharma websites and pharma reps very low in terms of influence on clinical decision,\u201d said Arnold. \u201cIt comes down to the value proposition; there's tremendous demand among healthcare professionals for patient education and support resources that will help them in their practice, as HCPs are increasingly under pressure to produce better outcomes and adherence.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,eventsforce.net,media.mmm-online.com,mmm-online.com", "description": "Recent research suggests nurse practitioners and physicians assistants have a growing appetite for digital patient resources from industry.", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "MM&M", "description": "Recent research suggests nurse practitioners and physicians assistants have a growing appetite for digital patient resources from industry.", "title": "PAs, NPs eager for pharma-backed patient resources: study", "url": "http://www.mmm-online.com/education/pas-nps-eager-for-pharma-backed-patient-resources-study/article/375681/", "image": "http://media.mmm-online.com/images/2014/10/06/bloodpressure_667437_667438.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@MMMnews", "image": {"src": "http://media.mmm-online.com/images/2014/10/06/bloodpressure_667437_667438.jpg"}, "description": "Recent research suggests nurse practitioners and physicians assistants have a growing appetite for digital patient resources from industry.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "PAs, NPs eager for pharma-backed patient resources: study"}, "fb": {"app_id": 191077067582624}, "google-site-verification": "Dl9DD3nj4BcHgvbuCyxCNqTLogZAIWVDk-mZ8pujUP0", "article": {"section": "Education", "published_time": "2014-10-06T16:59:10", "modified_time": "2014-10-06T17:36:19"}, "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "PAs, NPs eager for pharma-backed patient resources: studyShare this article:linkedingoogleEmailPrintPAs, NPs eager for pharma-backed patient resources: studyPhysician assistants and nurse practitioners are hungry for relevant pharma support material, a recent survey indicates.\nIn this new healthcare landscape, NPs, PAs and RNs have all been pushed to the fore of primary care.\n\u201cWe found that RNs, NPs and PAs rate pharma websites and pharma reps very low in terms of influence on clinical decision,\u201d said Arnold.\nResearchers detected a strong preference for digital resources among the study cohort.\u201cWe saw substantial demand for more pharma digital resources that nurses could share with patients,\u201d noted Arnold.\nDecision Resources's \u201cTaking the Pulse Nurses 2014,\u201d found that the majority of NPs (79%) and PAs (69%) \u201cprovide or recommend patient support resources for patients.\u201dThis presents an opportunity for industry, says Matthew Arnold, principal analyst for Manhattan Research, a company owned by Decision Resources."}
