Medicaid enrollment will increase an average of 13.2 percent across the country through the end of the 2015 fiscal year, according to new analysis, and even more in states that expand the program under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Kaiser Family Foundation said that the 28 states, including the District of Columbia, implementing the Medicaid expansion expect to see the largest enrollment and spending growth â€” an 18 percent increase in enrollment and an 18.3 percent increase in total Medicaid spending.
