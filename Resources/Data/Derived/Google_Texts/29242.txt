Kansans are getting another round of winter weather.

Friday night into Saturday morning did not bring much snowfall to the Wichita area. Still, the city streets were prepared.

Crews from McPherson to Harper and many other areas of the state were out as early as Thursday salting and preparing the streets for winter weather.

In addition to city and states road crews working, local hardware shops were selling snow shovels and ice melt.

Indian Hills Ace Hardware general manager Wayne Butterfield had a display of shovels and winter weather related items located prominently at the front of the store.

"The suggestion I would have for everyone is of course pay attention to the weather and plan ahead, don't wait until it snows until you get your snow shovel or ice melt because safety is really important and you want to be prepared," Butterfield said.

Many cities across Kansas have ordinances that state it is the homeowners responsibility to clear their sidewalks of snow so it is important to have the proper tools to do the job.
