High Road Takes Over Cali Bamboo

This is the firm's third purchase in 2015 after Ariad and Wallcoverings

High Road Capital Partners has purchased Cali Bamboo LLC, marking the firmÂ’s fifth platform out of its second fund. The deal was completed just days after High Road bought Ariad Communications as part of an add-on acquisition with portfolio company Bluespire Marketing.

Terms of the Cali Bamboo transaction were not disclosed, but High Road tends to invest in companies with revenues of up to $100 million and Ebitda of $3 to $10 million. Cali Bamboo, based in San Diego, manufactures flooring and sustainable building products, such as composite decking, bamboo plywood, eucalyptus flooring, bamboo fencing and cork tiles.

High Road has been active thus far in 2015. Aside from buying Ariad, the company picked up York, Pennsylvania-based York Wallcoverings Inc. in March and sold All Current Electrical Sales Inc. in February.

The New York-based private equity firm is currently investing out of its second fund, which raised $320 million in total commitments by the time it closed in late 2013. Since then, we have seen more building products deals as a result of the gradual recovery of the U.S. housing market.

BDI Insulation was sold for $36 million in March while Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. LP (NYSE: KKR) bought garage door business CHI Overhead Doors from FFL Partners in June. Before that, Altus Capital Partners picked up a window installation-equipment maker, GED Integrated Solutions Inc., also in June.
