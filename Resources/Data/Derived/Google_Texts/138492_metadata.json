However, some students still helped maintain the Heritage Garden outside of the Northern Suites Wednesday.\n\nThe predominant campus-wide demonstrations in support of Earth Day at IUP have been hosted by ECO Club for the past several years. The club has hosted the event while inviting other on-campus and off-campus organizations to come and participate as well.\n\nThese include various organizations such as the Strategies for Ecology, Education, Diversity, and Sustainability Club, the Geology Club and Indiana Community Gardens.\n\nThe unpredictable Indiana weather has caused difficulties for Earth Day celebrations in the past.\n\nLast year, the actual day of the event saw unseasonably cold temperatures and a light rain that did not cause a cancellation but did have a negative impact on attendance from both the vendors and the students.\n\nThis year\u2019s planned events, along with those from past years, have included activities and displays like a bike that generates electricity, a book swap, free seed samples, free food, a yoga demonstration, music and creating a sustainability wall.\n\nAlthough the events did not go as planned, Cassandra Leso (sophomore, nursing), the ECO Club president, explained the importance of the holiday and why people should celebrate Earth Day.\n\n\u201cWe [all] live on this Earth,\u201d Leso said. \u201cWe should celebrate it, and that\u2019s what Earth Day does for us.\n\n\u201cWe get to be thankful for what it gives us and enjoy a day outside learning about important issues to be aware of to better take care of it, and overall just have a great day,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of the important environmental issues that people should be thinking about this upcoming Earth Day include \u201cthe spreading of pesticides, GMOs, pollution and recycling more,\u201d Leso said.\n\nWhile these are important environmental issues, they are only a few of the large number of concerns facing our planet today.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Penn", "description": "Although the Indiana University of Pennsylvania\u2019s ECO Club\u2019s 2015 Earth Day celebrations got cancelled due to weather Wednesday, the holiday was still recognized internationally.
