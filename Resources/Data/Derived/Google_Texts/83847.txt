Every year for the last seven years, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) team of nutritionists, dieticians, and doctors scours the menus and nutritional information served at the top 200 restaurant chains in America. This year's “Xtreme Eating 2015” awards were given to the top nine unhealthiest dinners, drinks, and desserts that a customer could possibly order.

Most of the orders were loaded with different types of fats, sugars, sodium, and accumulated to more than 2,000 calories. If the average adult were to eat the recommended 2,000 to 3,000 calories per day, the breakdowns would go well beyond a person’s daily intake in one sitting, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

It’s important to watch for the nutritional breakdowns of each meal you order when dining out at restaurants, whether it’s a chain or the mom-and-pop shop down the road, for the sake of your long-term dietary health. Using CSPI's list of tips for ordering foods with a healthful, careful, and educated eye, you'll learn to automatically order from the "light" menu, choose thin crusts for pizza, and skip the beef, burgers, and fried foods.
