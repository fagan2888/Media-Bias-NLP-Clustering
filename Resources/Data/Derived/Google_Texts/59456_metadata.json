Andrew Cuomo\u2019s new budget includes a nearly $69 million tax on health-insurance policies to pay for the administrative costs of continuing New York\u2019s ObamaCare health exchange, The Post has learned.\n\nThe levy is intended to make up for federal funds no longer available to the states as of this year. Adding up to about $25 per person insured under the plan, the cost is almost certainly going to be passed on to consumers.\n\nThe tax is being called a bait-and-switch by opponents of Cuomo\u2019s decision to start a state-run ObamaCare health exchange in New York. Had he not done so, they argue, there would have been no need for the tax.\n\n\u201cThere was no indication that there would be a new tax to pay for this. We had plenty of debate on ObamaCare. I never heard this mentioned,\u201d said Assemblyman Steve McLaughlin (R-Troy).\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires that state-based health benefit exchanges be self-sustainable beginning this year after they got federal seed money to launch.\n\nCuomo created NY State of Health, an online marketplace to shop for health plans, in 2013.\n\nThe move was controversial, as Cuomo made it by executive order rather than with legislation.\n\nA majority of states \u2014 almost all with Republican governors \u2014 refused to set up exchanges because they opposed ObamaCare. The federal government runs the program in those states.\n\nNew York is one of 16 states that set up their own Web-based exchange, believing they could manage the health-insurance program better than the feds. Now only the states that implemented their own exchanges will be responsible for raising funds to manage them.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with federal law, the executive budget proposed a modest change in health insurance premiums \u2014 averaging less than $25 annually \u2014 to provide a dedicated and sustainable revenue source to support the continued operations of the Exchange,\u201d said Cuomo budget spokesman Morris Peters.\n\nDespite the increase, the Cuomo administration said New York\u2019s implementation of ObamaCare has been a success.\n\n\u201cThe health plans offered through NY State of Health are, on average, 50 percent less expensive than those available in 2013 prior to the creation of the marketplace, and over 1.9 million New Yorkers have enrolled in coverage,\u201d Peters said.\n\nPeters called the per-person tax on health plans \u201cmodest.\u201d\n\nBut the lobbying arm for health insurers insisted it would lead to more costly premiums.\n\n\u201cThe governor proposes to add a new tax on premiums to pay for New York\u2019s health exchange, making health insurance less affordable for New Yorkers,\u2019\u2019 said Paul Macielak, CEO of the New York Health Plan Association.\n\n\u201cIf affordable health-care coverage is the goal here in New York, the new \u2018exchange tax\u2019 should be dropped and the existing state taxes on health insurance, which today total more than $5 billion and amounted to 5 percent of premiums, should be reduced.\u201d\n\nThere are nearly 1 million newly insured New Yorkers.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Gov.
