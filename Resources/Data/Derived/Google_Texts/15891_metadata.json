There were also limits to its ability to carry out checks, it said in a statement.\n\n\"As we are not a government institution, a thorough screening of customers and transactions is not possible,\" said Raiffeisen, which according to ORF and Falter performed similar transactions involving Linquist and other offshore firms.\n\nORF said Hypo Landesbank Vorarlberg -- majority-owned by the province of Vorarlberg, which borders Liechtenstein and Switzerland -- was connected to offshore firms through trustees in Liechtenstein and much of the money trail led to Russia.\n\n\"At no point have we violated money-laundering stipulations or sanctions, as legal stipulations are taken very seriously and followed very fastidiously in our company,\" Hypo Vorarlberg said in a statement.\n\nThe criminal investigations bureau, a branch of the Interior Ministry, and the Austrian prosecutors' office in charge of economic crimes and corruption said they had taken no action so far as there was not enough concrete information.\n\n(Editing by Keith Weir)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian regulators are investigating whether two banks named in an", "title": "Austrian watchdog investigates two banks after Panama Papers leak", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/04/Austrian-watchdog-investigates-two-banks-after-Panama-Papers-leak", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/panama-tax-austria_4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/04/Austrian-watchdog-investigates-two-banks-after-Panama-Papers-leak", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/panama-tax-austria_4.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian regulators are investigating whether two banks named in an", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"At no point have we violated money-laundering stipulations or sanctions, as legal stipulations are taken very seriously and followed very fastidiously in our company,\" Hypo Vorarlberg said in a statement.\nThe leaked \"Panama Papers\" cover a period over almost 40 years, from 1977 until last December, and allegedly show that some companies domiciled in tax havens were being used for suspected money laundering, arms and drug deals and tax evasion.\nRaiffeisen said it had complied with legal provisions on the prevention of money laundering but could not comment on specific cases because of banking secrecy rules.\nVIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian regulators are investigating whether two banks named in an international data leak followed procedures to prevent money laundering, one of the firms having attracted attention for its lending to a confectionery company owned by Ukraine's president.\nThe Austrian news organizations involved in the investigation, broadcaster ORF and weekly newspaper Falter, reported a connection between Raiffeisen and the Roshen company owned by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko."}
