But those findings didn\u2019t hurt Swiss-based Novartis, which makes the blood-pressure drugs Exforge, Diovan and Tekturna, as the company\u2019s shares were up more than 1% to $78.57.\n\nFurther, late news of the recall \u2014 which included those blood-pressure treatments as well as Lescol cholesterol tablets and Parkinson\u2019s disease medication Stalevo \u2014 that came after the close didn\u2019t seem to impact the drug-making giant\u2019s shares much in post-session trades. Shares were down marginally to $78.35, not enough to wipe regular session gains.\n\nMost of the recall centered around Exforge, which accounted for 4.7 million of the 5.3 million bottles recalled. Ink on the sleeves of the bottles apparently had contaminated some of the medicines, though the company said it didn\u2019t pose a safety risk to patients.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nYour hospital is likely to join an ACO very soon\n\nInsurers extending Obamacare payments to Jan. 10\n\nPoll: Did you save money by using Obamacare?", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-12-19T17:46:37-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Novartis AG is recalling several million free samples of blood-pressure treatments and other medications over concerns that a chemical used to package the drugs may have contaminated them.", "title": "Novartis recalls millions of sample drugs over contamination worries", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/12/19/novartis-recalls-millions-of-sample-drugs-over-contamination-worries/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BR103_prescr_MG_20131217105733.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "blood-pressure medication,Novartis AG,Product recall", "article.headline": "Novartis recalls millions of sample drugs over contamination worries", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "description": "Novartis AG is recalling several million free samples of blood-pressure treatments and other medications over concerns that a chemical used to package the drugs may have contaminated them.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "news_keywords": "blood-pressure medication,Novartis AG,Product recall", "article.published": "2013-12-19T17:46:37-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/12/19/novartis-recalls-millions-of-sample-drugs-over-contamination-worries/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Novartis AG is recalling several million free samples of blood-pressure treatments and other medications over concerns that a chemical used to package the drugs may have contaminated them.", "title": "Novartis recalls millions of sample drugs over contamination worries", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/12/19/novartis-recalls-millions-of-sample-drugs-over-contamination-worries/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BR103_prescr_MG_20131217105733.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1766", "article.updated": "2013-12-19T17:46:37-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf1f6\"", "article_summary": "Some breaking news from the Wall Street Journal\u2026Novartis AG /quotes/zigman/171707/delayed /quotes/nls/nvs NVS is recalling several million free samples of blood-pressure treatments and other medications over concerns a chemical used to package the drugs may have contaminated them.\nBut those findings didn\u2019t hurt Swiss-based Novartis, which makes the blood-pressure drugs Exforge, Diovan and Tekturna, as the company\u2019s shares were up more than 1% to $78.57.\nMost of the recall centered around Exforge, which accounted for 4.7 million of the 5.3 million bottles recalled.\nShutterstockThe news comes a day after the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that some patients aged 60 and over may not need blood-pressure medication as higher readings may be normal for people in that age group.\nShares were down marginally to $78.35, not enough to wipe regular session gains."}
