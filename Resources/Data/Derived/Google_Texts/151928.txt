Like so many Senate Democrats running for reelection this year, Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR) is feverishly working to distance himself from President Barack Obama and his unpopular policies. In fact, Pryor is trying so hard to avoid being tied to the White House that he wouldn’t answer a Politico reporter’s question about whether he would vote for Obamacare again if he had to do it all over:

“There are a lot of things about the president that I don’t approve of — in terms of his policies,” Pryor said, adding he’s worked with presidents of both parties. Similarly, asked in a follow-up email if he would vote for Obamacare again if he had the chance, Pryor didn’t answer directly. He said the law “isn’t perfect” and he’d “work to make it better,” but “something needed to be done” to rein in the insurance industry.

Well, Pryor has already answered that question.

During an April appearance on KARK-TV, the Arkansas Democrat was asked virtually the same question, to which he replied, “You know, I would have. Of course I would want to see some changes back then,” said Pryor. “But I think on something like this, it’s big, it’s complicated, it’s difficult. If you get 80 percent of this right, you’ve really done something.”

Obamacare has become a central issue in Senate races in which vulnerable Democrats incumbents are running, including Arkansas, where 60 percent of voters hold an unfavorable view of the law.
