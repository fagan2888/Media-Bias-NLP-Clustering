The agency has an annual budget of more than $10 billion, which runs to fund more than 9,000 sites nationwide.\n\nIn a staff-wide letter sent Thursday, HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell praised Wakefield\u2019s ability to lead \u201cthrough a time of marked transformation.\"\n\n\u201cShe has improved access to health for millions of patients, strengthening America\u2019s health care workforce, and modernized HRSA\u2019s organizational infrastructure,\u201d Burwell wrote.\n\nA trained nurse, Wakefield will also bring more than a decade of Capitol Hill experience. She is the previous chief of staff to Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.)\n\nDuring her tenure at HRSA, she oversaw growth of its community health centers. The centers now serve 22 million patients a year, about 5 million more than when she took the helm. She has also helped grow programs like the National Health Service Corps, which has more than doubled its number of clinicians to 9,200.\n\nCommunity health \u2014 particularly in hard-to-reach, rural areas \u2014 has been a top focus for Burwell, who was raised in West Virginia.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Mary Wakefield will be the department's acting deputy secretary.", "description": "Mary Wakefield will be the department's acting deputy secretary.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Mary Wakefield will be the department's acting deputy secretary.", "title": "Rural health advocate to assume No. 2 post at HHS", "url": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/235524-rural-health-advocate-to-assume-no-2-post-at-hhs", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/235524-rural-health-advocate-to-assume-no-2-post-at-hhs", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-12T15:25-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-12T15:25:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/235524-rural-health-advocate-to-assume-no-2-post-at-hhs", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Mary Wakefield will be the department's acting deputy secretary.", "card": "summary", "title": "Rural health advocate to assume No. 2 post at HHS"}, "dcterms.title": "Rural health advocate to assume No. 2 post at HHS"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d72\"", "article_summary": "One of the country\u2019s leading rural health advocate will assume the No.\n2 position at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\nIn a staff-wide letter sent Thursday, HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell praised Wakefield\u2019s ability to lead \u201cthrough a time of marked transformation.\"\nCommunity health \u2014 particularly in hard-to-reach, rural areas \u2014 has been a top focus for Burwell, who was raised in West Virginia.\n\u201cShe has improved access to health for millions of patients, strengthening America\u2019s health care workforce, and modernized HRSA\u2019s organizational infrastructure,\u201d Burwell wrote."}
