The analysis, released on Monday, highlights the disparity between neighborhoods across the city when it comes to the rates of insurance coverage.\n\nOn average, slightly more than 10 percent of Brooklynites lack health insurance. The citywide average is 11.4 percent, or 962,000 residents.\n\nBut in some sections of Brooklyn and Queens, the rate of uninsured New Yorkers can soar to as high as 22 percent, Stringer\u2019s analysis showed.\n\nWhile only 5.7 percent of Park Slope residents lack health insurance, the rate is 22 percent in Bushwick, where more than 30,000 people lack insurance.\n\nSunset Park, with 16.3 percent of residents (24,503) lacking insurance, is another Brooklyn neighborhood that concerns Stringer.\n\nIn the combined District 2 neighborhoods of Brooklyn Heights and Fort Greene, 9.5 (13,074) percent lack insurance.\n\nStringer published his analysis on this date to coincide with the beginning of the Affordable Care Act open enrollment period, which runs from Nov. 1 through Dec. 15 for coverage to begin on Jan. 1, 2016. (Enrollment will remain open through Jan. 31, 2015 for coverage to begin March 1, 2016.)\n\n\"Close to one million New York City residents lack even the most basic health coverage,\u201d Stringer said in a statement. \u201cThe situation is particularly dire in neighborhoods with large immigrant and younger populations like Jackson Heights, Corona and Bushwick, where close to one in four New Yorkers don\u2019t have health insurance.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe want to get the word out: with the Affordable Care Act in place, getting health insurance is easier and more affordable than ever.\u201d\n\nThe Queens districts with the highest rates of uninsured residents include Sunnyside/Woodside, Jackson Heights, Elmhurst/Corona, Flushing and Astoria.\n\nIn the Bronx, Mott Haven/Hunts Point, University Heights and Concourse/High Bridge had high levels of uninsured residents.\n\nAll community district information can be found at http://comptroller.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Poverty-and-Uninsu...\n\n______________\n\nBrooklyn Uninsured by District/Neighborhood\n\nBrownsville (BK 16): 12.3 percent uninsured\n\nCrown Heights North (BK 08): 12.2 percent uninsured\n\nFlatbush/Midwood (BK 14): 11.8 percent uninsured\n\nCrown Heights South (BK 09): 11.8 percent uninsured\n\nEast Flatbush (BK 17): 11.2 percent\n\nBensonhurst (BK 11): 11.2 percent uninsured\n\nBay Ridge (BK 10): 10.4 percent uninsured\n\nSheepshead Bay: 10 percent uninsured\n\nConey Island (BK 13): 9.8 percent\n\nWilliamsburg/Greenpoint (BK 01): 9.6 percent\n\nFort Greene/Brooklyn Heights (Bk 02): 9.5 percent uninsured\n\nBorough Park (BK 12): 9 percent\n\nBedford-Stuyvesant (Bk 03): 8.9 percent\n\nEast New York (Bk 05): 8.8 percent\n\nCanarsie (BK 18): 8.7 percent\n\nPark Slope (BK 06): 5.7 percent uninsured", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stringer: Many in areas of Brooklyn and Queens lack health insurance", "rights": "Copyright 2015 | Everything Brooklyn Media", "og": {"image": "http://www.brooklyneagle.com/sites/default/files/pages/uninsured-brooklyn-residents.jpg"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "robots": "follow, index, noarchive", "keywords": "Scott Stringer, Health Insurance, Brooklyn, Queens, NYC", "abstract": "Stringer: Many in areas of Brooklyn and Queens lack health insurance", "news_keywords": "Scott Stringer, Health Insurance, Brooklyn, Queens, NYC"}, "article_summary": "While only 5.7 percent of Park Slope residents lack health insurance, the rate is 22 percent in Bushwick, where more than 30,000 people lack insurance.\nIn some New York City neighborhoods, almost a quarter of residents lack health insurance.\n\"Close to one million New York City residents lack even the most basic health coverage,\u201d Stringer said in a statement.\nOn average, slightly more than 10 percent of Brooklynites lack health insurance.\nThat was one of the unsettling details uncovered in a district-by-district analysis by New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer."}
