He also was convicted of performing abortions beyond Pennsylvania\u2019s 24-week limit.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, McElhinney said they decided to write the book because \u201cthere are so many stories that deserve to be heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d McElhinney said. \u201cThe movie can\u2019t cover all of the detail.\u201d\n\nShe said Gosnell is \u201cAmerica\u2019s biggest serial killer,\u201d but no one knows who he is.\n\n\u201cCountless babies were born alive and then murdered,\u201d McElhinney said. \u201cHe is much worse than a psychopath. He\u2019s a greedy opportunist who found his opportunity in the abortion industry.\u201d\n\nMcElhinney is adamant Gosnell \u201cis not an outlier,\u201d despite claims to the contrary by abortion supporters.\n\n\u201cLots and lots and lots of people knew,\u201d McElhinney said. \u201cThere\u2019s such a web of protection for the abortion industry. It\u2019s beyond rationality to say that you have to take a hands-off approach to protect women\u2019s choice. This is what happens.\u201d\n\nGosnell\u2019s illegal abortion practice was stopped only after he was discovered selling oxycodone for cash.\n\n\u201cHow did this happen? How was this allowed to go on?\u201d McElhinney said. \u201cThere are so many questions.\u201d\n\nShe said that the book will \u201cdig deep into what the abortion industry is all about.\u201d\n\nMuch of Gosnell\u2019s murder trial, she said, was devoted to explain what actually constitutes a legal abortion to the jury.\n\n\u201cNone of them knew the law in Pennsylvania,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have an abortion up to six months.\u201d\n\nGosnell murdered infants born alive by severing their spinal cords with scissors\u2014a practice he referred to as \u201csnipping.\u201d\n\nThe severed remains of his victims were found in jars, buckets and bags in his unsanitary clinic.\n\nMcElhinney said the book will examine the \u201cmedia blackout\u201d that surrounded the case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary, without social media, nobody outside of Philadelphia would have ever heard about it,\u201d McElhinney said. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong, something rotten when journalists don\u2019t report the news.\u201d\n\nMcElhinney praised USA Today columnist Kirsten Powers for \u201cbreaking through the blackout.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe says \u2018I just did my job.\u2019\u201d McElhinney said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re the only one doing it, in my view that\u2019s heroic.\u201d\n\nShe promised the book won\u2019t be only about the \u201creally dark world\u201d inside Gosnell\u2019s clinic, but also will highlight heroes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very shocking, but there are also such wonderful heroes,\u201d McElhinney said. \u201cReally marvelous people who did everything in their power to stop this.\u201d\n\nMcElhinney and McAleer have studied the convicted killer for several years. Last month, they spoke with him in an exclusive prison interview.\n\nShe hopes the book will coincide with the release of the film and provide \u201csupplementary\u201d information about the case.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The producers of the movie 'Gosnell' now also will write a book about notorious Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell -- timed for release with the movie.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The producers of the movie 'Gosnell' now also will write a book about notorious Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell -- timed for release with the movie.", "title": "'Gosnell' Producers to Write Book for Release With Movie", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141203_GosnellMovie_Scanlon-FEATURE.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-15T14:59:09+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Fd5rfU"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The producers of the movie 'Gosnell' now also will write a book about notorious Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell -- timed for release with the movie.", "title": "'Gosnell' Producers to Write Book for Release With Movie", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141203_GosnellMovie_Scanlon-FEATURE.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-06-14T11:05:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-15T14:59:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Gosnell, Phelim McAleer, Anne McElhinney, Philadelphia, Kirsten Powers, USA Today, abortion,"}, "article_summary": "This is what happens.\u201dGosnell\u2019s illegal abortion practice was stopped only after he was discovered selling oxycodone for cash.\nAnn McElhinney and Phelim McAleer, the producers of the movie \u201cGosnell,\u201d have signed a deal with Regnery Publishing to publish a book about the subject of their film, the late-term abortionist Kermit Gosnell.\n\u201cThe movie can\u2019t cover all of the detail.\u201dShe said Gosnell is \u201cAmerica\u2019s biggest serial killer,\u201d but no one knows who he is.\nShe hopes the book will coincide with the release of the film and provide \u201csupplementary\u201d information about the case.\nIn 2013, Gosnell was convicted on three counts of the first-degree murder of infants born alive and for the involuntary manslaughter of an adult patient named Karnamaya Mongar."}
