But Obama is certain to find a less appreciative crowd in Congress than the one he left behind at the Summit of the Americas in Panama.\n\nTo complete a nuclear agreement with Iran, Obama must deal with resistance in Congress and the unpredictability of the Iranian leadership, which has a distinctly different interpretation of what the sides have settled on so far.\n\nCuba and Iran offer Obama, whose term ends in early 2017, the potential for legacy-crowning achievements. Iran may prove a greater challenge than Cuba, but together they are subjecting Obama\u2019s foreign policy to the kind of scrutiny that most international issues, short of war, rarely draw.\n\nObama made clear in a closing news conference late Saturday in Panama City that he believes he can handle the twin trials. The American public is on his side on Cuba, the president said, and he had tough words for Republicans defying him on Iran.\n\nBoth have their roots in decades of grievances. Both have had constituencies in the U.S. deeply mistrustful of the governments with which Obama is dealing. Pro-Israel Americans cannot fathom a deal with an Iran that will not recognize Israel\u2019s existence. And for long, Cuban-Americans who escaped Fidel Castro\u2019s revolution could not imagine a U.S. government not committed to ousting the Havana government.\n\nOn the flip side, Cuba is hardly the threat Iran could be. Public opinion no longer demonizes Cuba. In the end, Obama\u2019s efforts to re-establish normal relations looks like the lesser burden.\n\nWhen it comes to Cuba, \u201cthe American people don\u2019t need to be persuaded,\u201d Obama said.\n\nStill, there are signs that not all the barriers are falling.\n\nCastro, a lengthy speech at the summit, recited a litany of objections to past U.S. policies. The room where Obama and Castro met displayed no flags, as is traditional in bilateral meetings, and offered a stark reminder of the absence of diplomatic relations.\n\nObama\u2019s next step is removing Cuba from the United States\u2019 list of state sponsors of terrorism. Such a decision, recommended by the State Department, could come in days. Obama would have to notify Congress. Lawmakers do not have to ratify the decision, but they have 45 days to disapprove it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "First Iran, now Cuba: Breakthroughs and hard sells for Obama", "title": "First Iran, now Cuba: Breakthroughs and hard sells for Obama", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "First Iran, now Cuba: Breakthroughs and hard sells for Obama", "title": "First Iran, now Cuba: Breakthroughs and hard sells for Obama", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/12/first_iran_now_cuba_breakthroughs_and_hard_sells_for_obama/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/mideast-iran.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "First Iran, now Cuba: Breakthroughs and hard sells for Obama", "title": "First Iran, now Cuba: Breakthroughs and hard sells for Obama", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/mideast-iran.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jim Kuhnhenn", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce42\"", "article_summary": "Cuba and Iran offer Obama, whose term ends in early 2017, the potential for legacy-crowning achievements.\nTopics: From the Wires, News, Politics NewsWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 After triumphs abroad, President Barack Obama is finding stern challenges at home to his foreign policy breakthroughs, facing hard sells to skeptics over U.S. shifts, first on Iran and now Cuba.\nThe American public is on his side on Cuba, the president said, and he had tough words for Republicans defying him on Iran.\nTo complete a nuclear agreement with Iran, Obama must deal with resistance in Congress and the unpredictability of the Iranian leadership, which has a distinctly different interpretation of what the sides have settled on so far.\nWhen it comes to Cuba, \u201cthe American people don\u2019t need to be persuaded,\u201d Obama said."}
