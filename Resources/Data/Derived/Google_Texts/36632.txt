BOULDER — Turnover ratio is a focus of Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre and apparently always will be.

“(Getting turnovers) is a huge ability to make up ground,” MacIntyre said Tuesday following a morning practice. “That’s an area we need to see an increase in.”

In 2013, Colorado ranked ninth in the Pac-12 in turnover margin with minus-3. That reflected the difference of 21 turnovers gained and 24 lost.

For the two previous years under coach Jon Embree, Colorado ranked 12th (last) among Pac-12 teams in turnover margin in 2012 with minus-19 and was eighth in the Pac-12 in 2011 with minus-4.

“It’s something we work on every day,” MacIntyre said. “I feel that we’re better at trying to cause turnovers. I think we’re better at taking care of the ball.”

Practices are now closed to the public, including the media. MacIntyre said he was impressed with Tuesday’s session.

“I really thought today’s practice went better than (on Monday),” MacIntyre said. “They had a little more pep in their step.

“It’s funny that way,” he added. “You get a day off (Sunday) and then you’re not as good. It’s like running — you take a day off and it’s two or three days later when you’re supposed to be tired but you run better. I thought the guys did a good job today.”
