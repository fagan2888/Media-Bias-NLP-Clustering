And this year, potential attendees will for the first time be able to buy Helldorado Days tickets online.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to venture out so we can capture more people online,\u201d Butts said. \u201cAt least we\u2019ll get a good count of what we\u2019re selling and how many butts are sitting in that arena. We\u2019ve never done that before.\u201d\n\nThe 2014 event is scheduled May 14-18, downtown on Grand Central Parkway near The Smith Center.\n\nButts has been active with the Elks for years, serving on its board since 1994. For more than 20 years he was the Helldorado Days arena crew manager.\n\nAnd it all started over beer.\n\nWhile sitting at the Elks Lodge bar sipping a beer, Butts noticed a party going on around him. The lodge officers were hosting a fundraiser, something that interested him and inspired him to get more involved in the organization.\n\nButts, a consummate cowboy, was a competitive team roper and in his free time volunteered for cattle drives.\n\n\u201cWhen you get out in the middle of nowhere and that horse puts you on top of a mountain, wow,\u201d Butts said.\n\nHelldorado Days attracts a mix of locals and visitors, with a strong contingent of international tourists, including several Russians one year who arrived wearing pink cowboy hats, rimmed with fringe.\n\n\u201cThey had such a ball in the rodeo beer tent,\u201d Butts said. \u201cIt was just great.\u201d\n\nButts\u2019 rodeo is fast and furious, with entertainment acts running quick \u2014 an eight-minute show is a bit of a stretch.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any slack time,\u201d Butts said.\n\nIt takes 12 guys and a $600,000 budget to put on the Helldorado Days rodeo. Any money made on the event goes back to the Elks Lodge charities, which support as many as 20 local organizations.\n\nIn April, Butts will take over as president of the Elks\u2019 state organization. In that position, Butts will visit all 15 Nevada lodges and attend regional conventions. His goal for the state organization, similar to Helldorado Days, is to get all reports online this year.\n\n\u201cI want the state to be electronic everything,\u201d Butts said. \u201cIt will be so much easier.\u201d\n\nOther changes for 2014 Helldorado Days: Expanded rodeo grounds behind The Smith Center, and have an additional rodeo day featuring Fiesta Del Charro, a traditional Mexican horseman event. The event is growing from 9 acres to 20.\n\n\u201cWith the Fiesta del Charro, we\u2019re hoping that\u2019s going to open it up to a whole different group of people,\u201d Butts said. \u201cWe know they like to party and we know they\u2019re a very family-oriented group.\u201d\n\nBesides his Elks affiliation, Butts is a 10-year member and three-year president of the Red Riderz Motorcycle Club and has been riding motorcycles since he can remember.\n\nQuestion: How did you get into working with horses?\n\nAnswer: I grew up in Ontario where there were a couple small dairies. I worked there in my teens and me and some of the guys, we\u2019d ride the cows. Then we\u2019d mess around and start throwing ropes around them. A friend of mine\u2019s dad had a horse and we\u2019d ride him all the time.\n\nQuestion: When did you start riding Harleys?\n\nAnswer: I\u2019ve always ridden a motorcycle. My first form of transportation was a motorcycle. But the horse is always my passion. A friend of mine and I have probably been on top of every mountain in this valley.\n\nQuestion: How is taking the ticket operation online going?\n\nAnswer: It\u2019s a lot. We\u2019re working with TicketForce. It\u2019s a full day of paperwork. Previously we sold in bulk. You could come here and pick them up or we had them at different venues in town like Western stores and boot barns. We\u2019re hoping this will be better. As long as it stays in budget I\u2019ll be happy.\n\nQuestion: Is there a passion in this community for this event?\n\nAnswer: There is. We\u2019ve had some of our sponsors forever, and that\u2019s their passion. I was sitting down this week with Ahern (Rentals) going over the demographics \u2026 and they donate so much of the stuff to us, \u2026 we use so many generators and lights that we don\u2019t have enough in the valley. They have to send them from Texas and North Carolina. We\u2019re using about 17 generators.\n\nQuestion: Who is the target demographic for the event?\n\nAnswer: Right now everybody. I think adding the Fiesta del Charro put us to everybody. Before, it was just Western people or Western heritage people or the curious. Some people walk in there and they have no clue. They\u2019ve seen a horse on television or at the zoo or something like that but they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in there, so it\u2019s an education program that we have to do.\n\nQuestion:: Have you seen more of an interest in the event because of social media?\n\nAnswer: Slowly. This town has so many other venues going on when we\u2019re going on. One year we looked out and there were 12 other events going on along with ours. So, pick and choose where you want to go. A lot of people don\u2019t want to schedule something, because they\u2019re waiting for something else.\n\nQuestion: What\u2019s the split between locals and tourists?\n\nAnswer: Seventy-five percent of the attendees are locals. We get a lot of tourists though. I just received a call from Germany. We get them from Denmark, Russia. We also know they\u2019re walk-in tickets. Somebody\u2019s coming from Australia and getting married over here. They want to come here on Saturday night.\n\nContact reporter Laura Carroll at lcarroll@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4588.
