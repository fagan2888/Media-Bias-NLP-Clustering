It\u2019s why a new study from the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) says that limiting the use of smartphones and other electronics at night is critical.\n\nRelated: 6 Smart Ways to Pay Down Your Sleep Debt\n\nThe NSF\u2019s 2014 Sleep in America poll asked more than 1,000 parents to estimate how much shut-eye their kids usually get on school nights. The parents estimated 8.9 hours for kids ages 6 to 10; 8.2 hours for kids ages 11 and 12; 7.7 hours for 13- and 14-year-olds; and 7.1 hours for teens ages 15 through 17.\n\nExperts recommend far more, however. The NSF recommends 10 to 11 hours of sleep for kids ages 6 to 10 and 8.5 to 9.5 hours per night for kids in the other three age groups.\n\nThe findings are intriguing because more than 9 in 10 parents believe sleep is \u201cextremely or very important\u201d for their children\u2019s performance in school as well as their health, mood and behavior the next day. Yet when parents were asked how much sleep their children need to \u201cbe at their best,\u201d 26 percent said that number is at least one hour more than their children are currently getting on school nights.\n\nRelated: 10 Ways Sleep Is Now Big Business\n\nParents also reported, not incidentally, that nearly 75 percent of children ages 6 to 17 have at least one electronic device in their bedroom, with many using those devices right before bedtime.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo ensure a better night\u2019s sleep for their children, parents may want to limit their [children\u2019s use of] technology in the bedroom near or during bedtime,\u201d said Orfeu Buxton, PhD, of Harvard Medical School and a member of the poll\u2019s task force, in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe found that when parents take action to protect their children\u2019s sleep, their children sleep better,\u201d added Kristen L. Knutson, PhD, of the University of Chicago.\n\nAmong the foundation\u2019s tips:\n\nMake sleep a priority in the family\u2019s busy schedule.\n\nSet \u2013 and keep \u2013 consistent bedtimes for your children and yourself.\n\nMonitor your children\u2019s use of electronics in their bedroom. Set boundaries.\n\nCreate a \u201csleep-supportive\u201d environment by dimming the lights before bedtime and controlling the room temperature (temps above 75 degrees and below 54 tend to interfere with sleep).\n\nEncourage activities such as reading or listening to music before bedtime \u2013 instead of TV, video games, or surfing the web.\n\nThe study also found that kids whose parents have healthy sleep environments have healthier sleep environments themselves. Nearly two thirds of kids (65 percent) whose parents had one or more electronic devices in the bedrooms also had at least one device in their own bedroom.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It happens to the best of us:\u00a0 We check our smartphones or tablets one last time befor", "title": "Sleep Problems Plague Device-Dependent Children", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/03/Sleep-Problems-Plague-Device-Dependent-Children", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03212012_Teenager_iPad_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/03/Sleep-Problems-Plague-Device-Dependent-Children", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03212012_Teenager_iPad_article.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It happens to the best of us:\u00a0 We check our smartphones or tablets one last time befor", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f19\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe found that when parents take action to protect their children\u2019s sleep, their children sleep better,\u201d added Kristen L.
