Pundits on both sides like to repeat the observation that the two-party system is more polarized today than it\u2019s ever been. That\u2019s not the case and never will be again, considering we live in a country where political parties have gone to war with each other and before that used to settle disagreements with gun duels.\n\nThe critique is not far off however; this country has certainly never seen political animosity this strident in the past several decades.\n\nOne of the principal reasons things have deteriorated to this point is that the Democratic Party that you once knew has been slowly dying over the last 15 years. The party that brought us monumental figures like Tip O\u2019Neill, Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton, whose liberalism embodied the same religious fervor as the pope\u2019s relationship with Catholicism but yet still allowed them the ability to work across the aisle to accomplish what the American people wanted.\n\nThey would not even recognize liberals today.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen overnight.\n\nThe Democratic Party has been slowly succumbing to an infection inflicted by the radical fringe of the party and, rather than correct itself and shift back to the center as all parties have done throughout American history, the left made the conscious decision to throw their hands up and see what happens.\n\nThe decline started in the late 1990s toward the end of the Clinton administration. Republicans and Democrats had just gone through one of the most productive periods of their relational history in terms of the amount of bi-partisan legislation that was passed by Congress.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy and it got extremely ugly at times, culminating in a government shut-down that no one came away from looking good.\n\nHowever, Republican leadership led by Newt Gingrich was able to work with Bill Clinton and the Democrats to push through some substantial accomplishments like a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform.\n\nThey didn\u2019t always get along, but there was real respect for each other even to this day.\n\nIn October 1999, Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer stood on the Senate floor and during an argument with Republican Sen. Rick Santorum, said that a child is not protected by the Constitution until it leaves the hospital.\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoTjb9rzyEo]\n\nIt was truly a shocking exchange that essentially served as Boxer\u2019s official coming-out as a fringe figure in the party.\n\nHer statements weren\u2019t taken too seriously as most fair-minded people agreed that surely society wouldn\u2019t condone a position like that. And society didn\u2019t.\n\nFast forward to today and you find that Boxer\u2019s position is now essentially the party platform. The head of the Democratic Party, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, absolutely supports a woman\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to have an abortion at any point in a pregnancy even after the child has been born.\n\nStill not convinced? Look no further than Bernie Sanders. In 1995, a self-avowed socialist, with no real accomplishments in Washington, with a strange habit of writing essays about gang rape in college would have been laughed off a presidential stage.\n\nIn 2015, he is filling arenas in Los Angeles with 20,000 frenzied young people. The left would have you think that\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d and \u201cprogressive\u201d but in reality it\u2019s simply the result of the Democratic Party giving up on trying to appeal to mainstream Americans.\n\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz couldn\u2019t even bring herself to come up with one way that today\u2019s Democrats are different from socialists. Seriously. When Chris Matthews lobbed that softball question at her on MSNBC, she could barely muster a word other than to try to spin the question into an attack on Republicans. Her lack of an answer spoke volumes about the shape of the party today.\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBYUINS7Vi4]\n\nThe reality is there is no difference.\n\nLook at two of the top political issues in the news today, immigration and abortion.\n\nThe \u201cradical\u201d Republican position on immigration is enforcing our laws and securing our borders. The position from the Democrats is that anyone who disagrees with them is a racist and that illegal aliens in this country should be granted citizenship with no border security.\n\nAs a party, they have banded together and are determined to secure themselves a subservient voting bloc that will win them elections for years to come.\n\nOn abortion, the Democrats believe taxpayer money should fund not only abortions, but partial birth and late-term abortions (which the majority of Americans don\u2019t support); they argue for the sale and distribution to the highest bidder of the body parts from those abortions. If you disagree with that, you are anti-woman.\n\nRepublicans, aren\u2019t calling for the repeal of Roe v. Wade or trying to outlaw birth control, as Democrats accuse. They simply believe life starts when DNA is formed, or when the heart is beating and that those lives deserve protection.\n\nWho\u2019s the radical here?\n\nTake the Democratic leadership today; another example. The mainstream media complains about McConnell and Boehner all day and night, which isn\u2019t at all fair, but it can be justified as long as it is about policy.\n\nThe complaints about Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders goes far beyond policy.\n\nRegarding Obamacare, which has been a financial disaster, Nancy Pelosi told us that we needed to pass the bill so we could find out what was in it.\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIVqInMfghA]\n\nHarry Reid took to the Senate floor and lied when he claimed Mitt Romney hasn\u2019t paid taxes in 10 years.\n\nDuring the recent midterms, Democrats were behind ads that blamed Republicans for the death of Trayvon Martin and passed out flyers in Georgia claiming a vote for Republicans would cause another Ferguson-type police killing.\n\nHarry Reid\u2019s super PAC financed the Trayvon Martin radio spot.\n\nMany of us remember the embarrassing ad Democrats ran against Paul Ryan after he pushed for Medicare reform, claiming he wants to throw senior citizens off a cliff.\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGnE83A1Z4U]\n\nWhen have you ever seen a Republican ad that outrageous? You haven\u2019t. If methodically using racism to sway an election isn\u2019t wrong, then what is?\n\nThat\u2019s what today\u2019s Democrats do.\n\nThey get personal, they lie, they do whatever it takes to harm the reputation of their opponents. Basically, they play dirty with a completely different set of rules.\n\nThat\u2019s what radicals do.\n\nIf moderate Democrats still existed as a meaningful force in the party, Hillary Clinton would not be the presidential front-runner being threatened by a self-avowed socialist. There is not a single moderate Democrat with any shot in this race. Every candidate the left has gotten excited about has been a fringe candidate. Elizabeth Warren is about as far left as it gets and the Democratic base has been clamoring for her.\n\nThat speaks volumes.\n\nIn conclusion, Hillary Clinton stood in front of a crowd in Cleveland yesterday and claimed that pro-life Republicans are the same as terrorists. It was a shocking line that one would think would bring great criticism from both sides of the aisles, right? The thought that Muslim extremists who are raping and murdering women left and right in the name of God can be discussed in the same conversation as those who oppose taxpayer-funded partial birth abortion and the profit from the sale of the resulting body parts is surely a bridge too far.\n\nNot for today\u2019s Democrats.\n\nAs I got ready for work this morning, I heard a Democratic strategist being interviewed on television who said Hillary\u2019s remarks weren\u2019t outrageous and that she had a point to compare Republicans to terrorists.\n\nThe radicals have officially become the main stream.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democratic Party has been slowly succumbing to an infection inflicted by the radical fringe of the party - without self correction", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Andrew Mark Miller", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "The Democratic Party has been slowly succumbing to an infection inflicted by the radical fringe of the party", "title": "Impossible to ignore: Democrats now led by Radical Fringe", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/politics-2/impossible-to-ignore-democrats-now-led-by-radical-fringe-47553/", "image": {"width": 1160, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/150430_bernie_sanders_gty_629.jpg", "height": 629}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Democratic Party has been slowly succumbing to an infection inflicted by the radical fringe of the party - without self correction", "title": "Impossible to ignore: Democrats now led by Radical Fringe", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/150430_bernie_sanders_gty_629-435x375.jpg", "creator": "@commdiginews", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "democrats,bernie sanders,democratic party,liberals", "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-29T03:37:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-29T05:23:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Democratic Party, democrats, liberals"}, "article_summary": "The \u201cradical\u201d Republican position on immigration is enforcing our laws and securing our borders.\nThe Democratic Party has been slowly succumbing to an infection inflicted by the radical fringe of the party - without self correctionWASHINGTON, August 29, 2015 \u2013 Looking across the political landscape today, it\u2019s impossible to ignore the divisiveness.\nHer lack of an answer spoke volumes about the shape of the party today.\nOne of the principal reasons things have deteriorated to this point is that the Democratic Party that you once knew has been slowly dying over the last 15 years.\nThe head of the Democratic Party, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, absolutely supports a woman\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to have an abortion at any point in a pregnancy even after the child has been born."}
