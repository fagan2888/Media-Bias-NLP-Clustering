A professional bee keeper is on the scene after a semi truck carrying the insects rolled on U.S. 6 over Loveland Pass Sunday, according to the Colorado State Patrol.

The driver was injured in the crash.

Some of the honey bees, which were riding in boxes, escaped from the truck, but most are contained, said Trooper Tim Sutherland. “Some of the boxes got opened and the bees got out. They are mad.”

A bee expert is monitoring the bugs’ condition. “We have a professional out there to make sure they will be all right overnight until the owner can get there from South Dakota,” Sutherland said.

All lanes were reopened around 3:30 p.m.
