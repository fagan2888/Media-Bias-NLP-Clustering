But she made the case on Sunday for a candidacy that is based, she says, on her concern for the future of democracy.\n\n\u201cAre we prepared to see our democracy dismantled by the influence of money in politics?\u201d she asked at the home of Nancy Moonves, an event hosted by Marcia Cross and Frances Fisher and packed with Hollywood figures like writer Diane English and composer Diane Warren.\n\nAlso read: \u2018Saturday Night Live': Kerry Washington Is Every Black Woman (Video)\n\n\u201cI have a problem that so many are poor,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cThat we are tilting the resources of the public purse in the direction of those who already have. It\u2019s immoral, unethical and unsustainable.\u201d\n\nWilliamson became a best-selling author in the \u201980s and \u201990s with a spiritual message of self-improvement and became a favorite of the media and Hollywood then. I asked her why she decided to run for Congress at a time when that body seems particularly ineffective.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running because like a lot of people I feel our country has swerved away from some of its most important foundational principles,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt the only way we will course correct is if a lot of people, unfiltered, speak up. And we have to do more than speak, we have to run.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Kamala Harris on Overcoming Perceptions on the Road to Attorney General\n\nBut Williamson has chosen to run against a popular incumbent. Waxman (no relation to this writer) has had his seat in the 33rd District for 38 years.\n\nWilliamson said she has nothing against Waxman. \u201cHe\u2019s done a good job. But we need fresh ideas,\u201d citing her concern over corruption of the food supply, the overcrowding in prisons and her opposition to nuclear energy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been fighting the good fight against the greedy bastards. But this is about a much bigger conversation that I hope this will inspire. \u201c\n\nMarcia Cross said it was time for more women candidates. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new point of view that\u2019s not about power or money,\u201d she told TheWrap. \u201cShe speaks to that and embraces that and can begin that change from start to finish.\u201d\n\nNancy Moonves agreed. \u201cMarianne has inspired me since I met her six years ago as a friend and activist,\u201d she told TheWrap. \u201cWe need feminine energy, we need a kind voice in our politics.\u201d\n\nSaid Williamson: \u201cNo one enters a political campaign with a guarantee to win. This is a calling of my heart to do this. I feel this campaign is already successful.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WILLIAMSON-618-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Sharon Waxman", "description": "The best-selling author is going after Henry Waxman's seat to fight against the scourge of money in politics, she tells TheWrap", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "The best-selling author is going after Henry Waxman's seat to fight against the scourge of money in politics, she tells TheWrap", "title": "Marianne Williamson, Spiritual Guru, Runs for Congress to 'Represent Your Consciousness' (Exclusive)", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 618, "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WILLIAMSON-618.jpg", "height": 412}, "updated_time": "2014-07-10T20:25:06+00:00", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/marianne-williamson-spiritual-guru-runs-congress-represent-consciousness-exclusive/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The best-selling author is going after Henry Waxman&#8217;s seat to fight against the scourge of money in politics, she tells TheWrap", "title": "Marianne Williamson, Spiritual Guru, Runs for Congress to \u2018Represent Your Consciousness\u2019 (Exclusive)", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/marianne-williamson-spiritual-guru-runs-congress-represent-consciousness-exclusive/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WILLIAMSON-618-340x300.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WILLIAMSON-618-340x300.jpg"}, "creator": "@sharonwaxman", "site": "@thewrap", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-04T02:40:00+00:00", "sailthru.title": "Marianne Williamson, Spiritual Guru, Runs for Congress to \u2018Represent Your Consciousness\u2019 (Exclusive)", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WILLIAMSON-618.jpg", "wp-parsely_version": "1.6", "fb": {"app_id": 228236404181023}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "section": "Media", "tag": "Marcia Cross", "published_time": "2013-11-03T18:40:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-10T20:25:06+00:00"}, "sailthru.tags": "marcia cross", "google-site-verification": "-PpFSIrGHybVDxbndrL6MCngw3j6BXdy0xDVBVVOacI", "sailthru.category": "media,waxword", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Marianne Williamson, Spiritual Guru, Runs for Congress to \u2018Represent Your Consciousness\u2019 (Exclusive)\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/marianne-williamson-spiritual-guru-runs-congress-represent-consciousness-exclusive\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/11\\/WILLIAMSON-618-150x150.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"176099\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-04T02:40:00Z\",\"section\":\"Media\",\"author\":\"Sharon Waxman\",\"tags\":[\"marcia cross\"]}", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced16\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMarianne has inspired me since I met her six years ago as a friend and activist,\u201d she told TheWrap.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for a new point of view that\u2019s not about power or money,\u201d she told TheWrap.\n\u201cWe need feminine energy, we need a kind voice in our politics.\u201dSaid Williamson: \u201cNo one enters a political campaign with a guarantee to win.\nI asked her why she decided to run for Congress at a time when that body seems particularly ineffective.\nWilliamson, 61, announced two weeks ago that she is running as an independent for what is arguably already the most liberal seat in the House."}
