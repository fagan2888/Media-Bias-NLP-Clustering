Halloween is creeping up, and you still don't have a costume? Never fear. Our fashion expert, Aimee Heckel, offers up two last-minute paths to take. (All clothes and accessories from Theatrical Costumes Etc. in Boulder.)

You can do a lot with accessories and clothes from your closet (and save a lot of money).

For example, instead of buying the pre-packaged mime costume that you can wear only once, wear a black-and-white striped shirt and a black skirt or pants. Duh.
