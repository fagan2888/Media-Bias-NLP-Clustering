At the end, it hasn\u2019t been a very good week for the Obama administration \u2014 but then again perhaps in the words of someone else who wants to be president, \u201cwhat difference at this point does it make?\u201d Could it be the real focus of the Obama administration is yet another \u201clegacy\u201d liberal progressive endeavor \u2013 a la Obamacare? The TAA/TPA is in trouble, which leads to the possibility of the TPP failure \u2014 I know, confusing huh? Well, that is Obamatrade.\n\nNow it seems we must contend with Obamahood \u2014 yes, President Barack Obama is now in the neighborhood social reengineering business \u2014 after all he is a community organizer.\n\nBy the way, back in 2012, I was vilified by liberals for speculating that a large percentage \u2014 if not all \u2014 of the Congressional Progressive Caucus members were essentially communists in terms of their beliefs and the agenda they pursue. Leftists always explode in outrage when their true foundation is unmasked.\n\nWell, read about this new outrageous plan to \u201cdiversify\u201d wealthy neighborhoods and then try to tell me I\u2019m wrong.\n\nAs reported by The Hill, \u201cThe Obama administration is moving forward with regulations designed to help diversify America\u2019s wealthier neighborhoods, drawing fire from critics who decry the proposal as executive overreach in search of an \u201cunrealistic utopia.\u201d A final Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) rule due out this month is aimed at ending decades of deep-rooted segregation around the country. The regulations would apply to roughly 1,250 local governments.\n\nThey would use grant money as an incentive for communities to build affordable housing in more affluent areas while also taking steps to upgrade poorer areas with better schools, parks, libraries, grocery stores and transportation routes as part of a gentrification of those communities.\n\n\u201cHUD is working with communities across the country to fulfill the promise of equal opportunity for all,\u201d a HUD spokeswoman said. \u201cThe proposed policy seeks to break down barriers to access to opportunity in communities supported by HUD funds.\u201d Civil rights advocates, meanwhile, are praising the plan, arguing that it is needed to break through decades-old barriers that keep poor and minority families trapped in hardscrabble neighborhoods. \u201cWe have a history of putting affordable housing in poor communities,\u201d said Debby Goldberg, vice president at the National Fair Housing Alliance.\u201d\n\n\n\nFirst of all, here we go again with the expansive, intrusive and invasive reach of the administrative bureaucratic state is creating rules that mandate our society. This is how liberal progressive socialists operate, because they cannot advance their policies by way of the legislative agenda. Therefore by way of coercion and intimidation, they mandate their way. And know it\u2019s YOUR taxpayer dollars going towards this equality of outcomes scheme. I find it ironic that these same liberal progressives will NEVER discuss how we can expand opportunities by way of better education, entrepreneurship, and two parent families.\n\nThe study of progressive socialism uncovers a governing philosophy centered on five points; redistribution of wealth, creation and expansion of the welfare nanny-state, nationalization of production, creation of a social utopia, and advancing a secular state.\n\nI could easily point to each of these points and draw a correlation to some agenda in the Obama administration. I know, you detractors would try and challenge me on the secular state item \u2014 but shall I say Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters of the Poor? As well, recently Hillary Clinton delivered a speech where she spoke of \u2014 and I paraphrase \u2014 \u201crejecting some long held religious beliefs.\u201d However, this new Obamahood adventure is certainly part of a misguided concept of social utopianism.\n\nWhat it ends up being is the soft bigotry of low expectations. What the message ends up being is that you cannot ever achieve residence in certain neighborhoods \u2014 so we the progressives shall grant you the ability.\n\nThis is not about \u201cfair housing,\u201d it is about forced social egalitarianism. And the fact that the Obama administration \u2014 and lets be specific \u2014 HUD Director Julian Castro, former Mayor of San Antonio, is using the \u201chook\u201d of federal grants in order to advance this inane socialist agenda is ludicrous.\n\nIt\u2019s simple, the T-HUD appropriations bill can just be cut to preclude this foolishness. That is how the system of checks and balances between the executive and legislative branch works. And one need only research the background of Castro \u2014 and his mother especially \u2014 to find the associations with radical Hispanic groups such as La Raza and LULAC. There can be no doubt that the long ball part of this is to position Castro to be the vice presidential in 2016, or if Hillary Clinton falters, perhaps president himself. And he can tout his progressive socialist credentials in advancing this idea.\n\nI want you all to consider something. The results of the King v Burwell case should be released by the end of this month and could result in millions of Americans losing their government health insurance subsidy \u2014 Obama has no plan. ISIS is growing all over the Middle East and into Libya \u2014 Obama has no plan. But when it comes to forced community integration \u2013 diversity \u2014 they certainly have a plan because it fits their mantra, their political philosophy.\n\nThis is what the progressive socialist left believes. \u201cThe agency is also looking to root out more subtle forms of discrimination that take shape in local government policies that unintentionally harm minority communities, known as \u201cdisparate impact.\u201d \u201cThis rule is not about forcing anyone to live anywhere they don\u2019t want to,\u201d said Margery Turner, senior vice president at the left-leaning Urban Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s really about addressing long-standing practices that prevent people from living where they want to.\u201d \u201cIn our country, decades of public policies and institutional practices have built deeply segregated and unequal neighborhoods,\u201d Turner said. Children growing up in poor communities have less of a chance of succeeding in life, because they face greater exposure to violence and crime, and less access to quality education and health facilities, Turner suggested. \u201cSegregation is clearly a problem that is blocking upward mobility for children growing up today,\u201d she said. To qualify for certain funds under the regulations, cities would be required to examine patterns of segregation in neighborhoods and develop plans to address it. Those that don\u2019t could see the funds they use to improve blighted neighborhoods disappear, critics of the rule say.\u201d\n\nThe hypocrisy is that the liberal progressive mind doesn\u2019t want to \u201croot out\u201d the policies of the left that have intentionally done harm to minority communities, resulting in the consequences of disparate impact.\n\nWhy can\u2019t we talk to the liberal progressives about school choice in the inner cities? Why doesn\u2019t the Obama administration assess the composition of achievements of inner city school boards and independent school districts? Why isn\u2019t the left looking at reconstituting the traditional two-parent household? The last time we had the deliberate attempt by the left to socially engineer society was fifty years ago with Lyndon Johnson\u2019s \u201cGreat Society\u201d \u2014 out of wedlock birth rates in America then were around 6 percent. Today in America, out of wedlock birth rates are close to 43 percent \u2013 75 percent in the black community, close to 57 percent in the Hispanic community. Why not reverse the consequences of the Great Society? Instead the next generation of progressive socialists led by Obama and Castro are looking at engineering another venture into the failed society.\n\nClose to home, the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs is facing accusations that it makes low-income housing funds more readily available in minority neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods. This promotes segregation, critics argue, by encouraging minorities to continue living in poor communities where government assistance is available.\n\nLook, I grew up in an inner city neighborhood \u2014 low middle to low income. It was a burning desire instilled in me by my parents to succeed. It was through the sense of equality of opportunity enabling me to attend good schools and set goals and objectives. It simply came down to what I wanted in MY life \u2014 same with my wife Angela. That is how you break the cycle of dependency and poverty. What Obama and Castro believe is that certain people are relegated to a certain state in life \u2014 and that ONLY government can remedy their circumstances. And this is what their policies and rules seek to do \u2014 create their own version of utopia, instead of believing we as capable human beings, as Americans, can achieve ourselves.\n\nHmm, the policy of forced social egalitarianism, communal living, and social engineering, sounds \u2014 dare I say it \u2014 like communism to me. Maybe now y\u2019all are beginning to understand why I said what I did back in 2012.\n\nWritten By Allen B.
