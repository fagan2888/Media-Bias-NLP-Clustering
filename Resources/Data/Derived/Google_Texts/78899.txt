Police say a man with a handgun walked into the Golf Headquarters on Thursday afternoon, and walked out with some cash.

It happened just before 1 p.m. at the store at 848 North Webb Road. Employees and customers were in the store, when the suspect walked in and demanded cash. He was wearing what witnesses describe as an ill-fitting woman's brown wig.

After taking the money, the man ran out of the store. The wig and a hat were found later outside the store.

No one was injured. Police are checking surveillance video for a better look at the suspect.
