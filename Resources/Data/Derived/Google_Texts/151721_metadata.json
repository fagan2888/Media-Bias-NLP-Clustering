The public is not losing anything on the deal if the numbers just won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nLesesne and Josh Martin of Turnberry Consulting met with residents in four neighborhoods surrounding the park Wednesday and will make their case to City Council next week.\n\nHampton Park is the largest of the peninsula\u2019s parks, and its history is arguably the richest, said Kevin Eberle, who lives nearby and wrote a book on its storied past.\n\nIts 63 acres have served as a plantation, a horse-racing track, a Confederate prison, a world exposition, a zoo and the vast, passive park there today.\n\n\u201cI say that it\u2019s the most historic park in the city. It certainly has the most complicated and interesting history with the most interlocking stories of any park in Charleston,\u201d he said.\n\nEberle said he is encouraged by the planned changes. \u201cWhen you end up with buildings like the superintendent\u2019s house and the stables that are vacant for years and years on end, that doesn\u2019t help anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nThe superintendent\u2019s house \u2014 former home of the city\u2019s Recreation Department \u2014 is particularly historic, seeing as it is the sole survivor of the city\u2019s 1901-02 West Indian Exposition.\n\nMost of the exposition\u2019s other buildings were built only for temporary use and were broken apart and sold for scrap, and while the superintendent\u2019s house survives, it lacks a good foundation and could be expensive to repair, city parks director Jerry Ebeling said.\n\nThe goals of the plan are to promote public recreation, improve the connectivity within the park, create more indoor space and emphasize the park\u2019s history. Lesesne said the rules as far as noise and hours would not change, and parking for the event space could be handled by a surface lot that the city\u2019s Parks Department now uses for mulch and trucks.\n\nThe park\u2019s small cafe was built in the early 1980s near the park\u2019s man-made pond, and the idea was that the city would find a vendor to operate it. However, Ebeling said repeated attempts have not been successful.\n\nLesesne said the new cafe would be allowed to sell beer and wine, subject to local permitting, and there could be a new patio area for customers closer to the pond. But any such changes \u2014 as well as changes to the horse stables and superintendent\u2019s house \u2014 would be subject to the city\u2019s design review processes.\n\nHe also said he would like to see any renovation of the house and stables be functional, flexible and not \u201cgold-plated,\u201d so they can be affordable for more people to rent.\n\nMuch of this property today feels off limits, blocked by some fencing or gates. Under the plan, those would go away.\n\n\u201cIt will feel like the rest of the park,\u201d Lesesne said. \u201cThat\u2019s the intent.\u201d\n\nThe conservancy, founded eight years ago with a $10 million gift from businesswoman Darla Moore, has worked to renovate 25 city parks. Its most ambitious project so far, refurbishing Colonial Lake, is currently under way at the other end of Rutledge and Ashley avenues from Hampton Park.\n\nReach Robert Behre at 937-5771.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Plan emerges to revitalize Hampton Park\u2019s fringe for weddings, wine, other uses, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston Parks Conservancy,Hampton Park,Harry Lesesne,history,Jerry Ebeling,Kevin Eberle,Washington Race Course,wedding venue", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Revitalizing the vacant cafe, horse stables and deteriorating superintendent\u2019s house in Hampton Park could give people reason to visit \u2014 and even get married there \u2014 while providing income to freshen up all of Charleston\u2019s", "title": "Plan emerges to revitalize Hampton Park\u2019s fringe for weddings, wine, other uses", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150523/150529674/plan-emerges-to-revitalize-hampton-park-x2019-s-fringe-for-weddings-wine-other-uses", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC16/150529674/AR/0/AR-150529674.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC16/150529674/AR/0/AR-150529674.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Revitalizing the vacant cafe, horse stables and deteriorating superintendent\u2019s house in Hampton Park could give people reason to visit \u2014 and even get married there \u2014 while providing income to freshen up all of Charleston\u2019s", "title": "Plan emerges to revitalize Hampton Park\u2019s fringe for weddings, wine, other uses", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC16/150529674/AR/0/AR-150529674.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150529674}}, "keywords": "Plan emerges to revitalize Hampton Park\u2019s fringe for weddings, wine, other uses , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston Parks Conservancy,Hampton Park,Harry Lesesne,history,Jerry Ebeling,Kevin Eberle,Washington Race Course,wedding venue", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-23T00:01:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-22T18:35:00Z", "author": "Robert Behre"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Revitalizing the vacant cafe, horse stables and deteriorating superintendent\u2019s house in Hampton Park could give people reason to visit \u2014 and even get married there \u2014 while providing income to freshen up all of Charleston\u2019s"}, "article_summary": "This rendering shows how Hampton Park\u2019s cafe might look under a Charleston Parks Conservancy plan to invigorate some of the park\u2019s underused spaces.\nAt least that\u2019s the hope of the Charleston Parks Conservancy, which plans to lease those properties at minimal cost from the city.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the intent.\u201dThe conservancy, founded eight years ago with a $10 million gift from businesswoman Darla Moore, has worked to renovate 25 city parks.\nLesesne said the rules as far as noise and hours would not change, and parking for the event space could be handled by a surface lot that the city\u2019s Parks Department now uses for mulch and trucks.\nBut any such changes \u2014 as well as changes to the horse stables and superintendent\u2019s house \u2014 would be subject to the city\u2019s design review processes."}
