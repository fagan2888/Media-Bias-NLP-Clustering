Here are a few of the lowlights:\n\nMike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas and current host of Huckabee: \"When the government says it can't keep people out of the US, it means it won't keep people out. And why should we be surprised? We've seen our borders routinely ignored, so if someone with Ebola really wants to come to the US, just get to Mexico, and walk right in.\"\n\nBill O'Reilly, host, The O'Reilly Factor: \"Thinking ahead, and taking precautions is simply responsible policy. Time and again, the Obama administration has failed to do that...There is no reason on earth, on this earth, that right now we should be accepting anyone in this country with a West African passport.\"\n\nDonald Trump, conservative gadfly: \"Let's not kid ourselves. I mean with the five billion dollar website for Obamacare, which is still not working, frankly, and it's a disaster. And so many other things: Benghazi, wars...IRS.\"\n\nRush Limbaugh, host, The Rush Limbaugh Show: \"The people in Liberia only went there because they had to get out of here 'cause they were slaves...Therefore if Ebola ends up here, it's only payback, folks...Unfortunately we have elected people in positions of leadership who think this way. The president is one of them.\"\n\nMark Levin, host, The Mark Levin Show: \"Of course we should profile! It doesn't have to be based on race or anything of that sort. We have a right as a people in this country\u2014 it's our right...our country! We have a right to say 'No' temporarily\u2014 or permanently\u2014 to people coming into this country from certain parts of the world, so that our families, our children, our grandchildren, our society, isn't at risk. That's just natural...and yet the opposite goes on here.\"\n\nMichael Savage, host, Savage Nation: \"There is not a sane reason to bring infected children into a nation other than to infect the nation. There is not a sane reason to take three or four thousand troops into a hot Ebola zone, without expecting at least one of them to come back with Ebola, unless you want to infect the nation with Ebola.... This actually exceeds any level of treason that I've ever seen.\"\n\nMichelle Malkin, syndicated columnist: \"In the wake of the Ebola scare (not to mention renewed jihadi threats from abroad), worried Americans are heading to the drugstore to stock up on face masks, hand sanitizer, and gloves. New vaccines are in the works for emerging global contagions. Unfortunately, there is no antidote for our government\u2019s blind and deadly diversity worship. Political correctness is a plague on us all.\"\n\nGlenn Beck, host, The Glenn Beck Program: \"You want a reason to have food storage? You want a reason to have gold? You want a reason to have guns? You want a reason to have God? It's called 'Ebola.'\"", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "From immigration to Benghazi, conservative commentators insist Ebola is actually about something else", "title": "Here are all the dumb ways conservatives are freaking out about Ebola in the US", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/10/here-are-all-dumb-ways-conservatives-are-tying-obama-ebola", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/ebola-huckabee.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/10/here-are-all-dumb-ways-conservatives-are-tying-obama-ebola", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/ebola-huckabee.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/ebola-huckabee.jpg"}, "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Here are all the dumb ways conservatives are freaking out about Ebola in the US"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Health,The+Right,Top+Stories", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "Michael Savage, host, Savage Nation: \"There is not a sane reason to bring infected children into a nation other than to infect the nation.\nBill O'Reilly, host, The O'Reilly Factor: \"Thinking ahead, and taking precautions is simply responsible policy.\nThere is not a sane reason to take three or four thousand troops into a hot Ebola zone, without expecting at least one of them to come back with Ebola, unless you want to infect the nation with Ebola....\nWe've seen our borders routinely ignored, so if someone with Ebola really wants to come to the US, just get to Mexico, and walk right in.\"\nI mean with the five billion dollar website for Obamacare, which is still not working, frankly, and it's a disaster."}
