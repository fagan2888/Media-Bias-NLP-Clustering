Part of what the continuum does is approve applications for funding requests in the county to assist in the coordination and development of services and housing for homeless and low-income persons with housing needs.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re giving funds to an organization, you want to make sure it\u2019s being put to the best possible use,\u201d Mach said. \u201cNow that we have a plan, we\u2019ll be able to organize it more effectively.\u201d\n\nFunding for the creation of the plan came from the McHenry County Mental Health Board and McHenry County Department of Planning and Development Community Development Division, Mach said. He said the total cost was about $27,000.\n\nTerpstra said Heartland Alliance created a three-year plan that is action-oriented.\n\nShe said McHenry County has great service providers in the community who know what they\u2019re doing, and the plan can help get more players in the community involved.\n\n\u201cI think the plan is all about getting them to work together, really being pointed in the same direction, working toward the same common goals,\u201d Terpstra said.\n\nShe said the plan addresses three areas. The first is making sure the county has enough affordable housing. The plan recommends exploring the idea of having a year-round fixed-site shelter in the county.\n\nThe next section suggests addressing factors that help create homelessness in the first place, such as not having enough high-paying jobs, she said.\n\nInternal structure and governance of the continuum of care is another area the plan suggests is looked at. Terpstra said the plan suggests putting more formal structure and policy in place for the continuum.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 Northwest Herald", "og": {"url": "http://www.nwherald.com/2015/12/31/mchenry-county-group-to-finalize-strategic-plan-to-end-homelessness-in-county/asi1a56/", "image": "http://www.nwherald.com/images/avatar-facebook.png", "site_name": "Northwest Herald", "description": "Amy Terpstra said the McHenry County Continuum of Care to End Homelessness\u2019s vision for its new strategic plan could be summarized in one statement: \u201cTo make McHenry County a place where homelessness is rare, homelessness is brief and homelessness is nonrecurring.\u201d", "title": "McHenry County group to finalize strategic plan to end homelessness in county"}, "twitter": {"site": "@nwherald", "image": "http://www.nwherald.com/images/avatar-twitter.png", "description": "Amy Terpstra said the McHenry County Continuum of Care to End Homelessness\u2019s vision for its new strategic plan could be summarized in one statement: \u201cTo make McHenry County a place where homelessness is rare, homelessness is brief and homelessness is nonrecurring.\u201d", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "McHenry County group to finalize strategic plan to end homelessness in county"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1071875123", "fb": {"pages": 13044672572}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "4dfc84cd-39bf-4932-a5db-0ca7c8c81d67"}}, "keywords": "#McHenry County, mchenrey county", "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Amy Terpstra said the McHenry County Continuum of Care to End Homelessness\u2019s vision for its new strategic plan could be summarized in one statement: \u201cTo make McHenry County a place where homelessness is rare, homelessness is brief and homelessness is nonrecurring.\u201dTerpstra, director of research with Heartland Alliance, the social service agency based in Chicago that made the report, has been working for the past year on a strategic plan to end homelessness in McHenry County.\nInternal structure and governance of the continuum of care is another area the plan suggests is looked at.\nTerpstra said the plan suggests putting more formal structure and policy in place for the continuum.\n\u201cNow that we have a plan, we\u2019ll be able to organize it more effectively.\u201dFunding for the creation of the plan came from the McHenry County Mental Health Board and McHenry County Department of Planning and Development Community Development Division, Mach said.\nShe said McHenry County has great service providers in the community who know what they\u2019re doing, and the plan can help get more players in the community involved."}
