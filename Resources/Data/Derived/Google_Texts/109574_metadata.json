It will start shipping on Sept. 30.\n\n\"There's one part of the tablet (market) that's growing right now, and ... that's sub-$100 tablets,\" said Dave Limp, senior vice president of Amazon devices. The company's $99 Fire HD was Amazon's best-selling tablet last year, he added.\n\nAnalysts said there were few comparable tablets that cost as little as the new Fire. Amazon will also sell the tablets in a six-pack for less than $250.\n\n\"The lesson we learned from consumer electronics is that when the market matures, consumers go cheaper,\" said Forrester principal analyst James McQuivey. \"If you're Amazon and you know this is going to happen, you might as well join in.\"\n\nHe called the $50 tablet a \"gateway drug\" for Amazon to attract new customers to Prime, a $99-a-year shopping program estimated to have about 40 million members.\n\nShares of Amazon were up 1.9 percent at $537.15.\n\nThe potential to draw more customers may appease investors but could prove costly if Amazon fails to sell large volumes, analysts said.\n\nAmazon took a $170 million write-down in the third quarter last year after it struggled to sell its inventory of $200 Fire smartphones. The company has said it does not plan to profit from devices but wants to use them to draw more customers to its services.\n\n\"They're out of the phone business,\" said Tim Bajarin, president of San Jose-based tech research firm Creative Strategies. \"To be fair that was a true mistake. The $50 tablet is far more strategic to their business.\"\n\nAlso on Thursday, Amazon also introduced a line of new, 8-inch and 10-inch Fire HD tablets and revamped Fire TV gadgets.\n\nThe $99.99 Fire TV set-top box integrates Amazon's cloud-based virtual assistant Alexa, allowing viewers to check the weather, look up sports scores and play music.\n\nAmazon said viewers could soon control home appliances through Fire TV, a function available on Echo, the company's personal aide gadget that can regulate thermostats and lights.\n\n(Reporting by Mari Saito; Editing by Miral Fahmy and Lisa Von Ahn)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Thursday introduced a $50 tablet, a price", "title": "Amazon announces low-cost tablet, new Fire TV", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/17/Amazon-rolls-out-4999-mass-market-tablet-new-Fire-TV", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/amazon-com-products_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/17/Amazon-rolls-out-4999-mass-market-tablet-new-Fire-TV", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/amazon-com-products_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Thursday introduced a $50 tablet, a price", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1137\"", "article_summary": "\"There's one part of the tablet (market) that's growing right now, and ... that's sub-$100 tablets,\" said Dave Limp, senior vice president of Amazon devices.\nThe $50 tablet is far more strategic to their business.\"\nHe called the $50 tablet a \"gateway drug\" for Amazon to attract new customers to Prime, a $99-a-year shopping program estimated to have about 40 million members.\nAlso on Thursday, Amazon also introduced a line of new, 8-inch and 10-inch Fire HD tablets and revamped Fire TV gadgets.\nThe new Fire tablet, one of several new and upgraded devices from Amazon, comes with a screen that measures 7 inches (17 cm) diagonally and a front-and-back camera."}
