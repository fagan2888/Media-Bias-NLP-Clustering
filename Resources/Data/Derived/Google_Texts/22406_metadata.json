Where do they get the authority to expand a program that was supposed to be for landline phones, transmogrified into cell phone [access], and yesterday transmogrified to broadband Internet access?\n\n\u201cIt was supposed to be for emergency landline phone lines, for the event that people in rural areas needed to call 911,\u201d Motley said. \u201cHow does that come within a million miles of broadband Internet access?\u201d\n\nErnest Istook, president of Americans for Less Regulation, says USF-funded entitlement spending has spiraled out of control.\n\n\u201cIt has metastasized,\u201d Istook said. \u201cThe program when Ronald Reagan was president was one-tenth the size of what it is now, with the number of people and the costs.\u201d\n\nIstook says entitlement spending at FCC is no different from other government agencies\u2019 distribution of entitlements, continually growing once established.\n\n\u201cThe people who are supposedly in need when they create a program are just a small number of people, but once they start giving things away, more people want it, and the program keeps growing,\u201d Istook said. \u201cIt\u2019s buying votes, it\u2019s buying offices, it\u2019s buying power.\u201d\n\nRudy Takala (rudytakala@yahoo.com) writes from Washington, DC.\n\nInternet Info:\n\nJerry Hausman, \u201cEfficiency Effects On The U.S. Economy From Wireless Taxation,\u201d National Bureau of Economic Research: https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/efficiency-effects-us-economy-wireless-taxation/", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd957c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhen did Congress have a vote and pass a law that said LifeLine will now apply to broadband?\u201d Motley said.\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has decided to expand the LifeLine telephone subsidy program, funded by the Universal Service Fund (USF) fee, which is collected from taxpayers\u2019 telephone bills, to include broadband Internet service for lower-income people.\nSeton Motley, president of Less Government, says FCC\u2019s LifeLine program and other programs funded by the Universal Service Fund create new entitlements at taxpayers\u2019 expense.\n\u201cHow does that come within a million miles of broadband Internet access?\u201dErnest Istook, president of Americans for Less Regulation, says USF-funded entitlement spending has spiraled out of control.\nWhere do they get the authority to expand a program that was supposed to be for landline phones, transmogrified into cell phone [access], and yesterday transmogrified to broadband Internet access?"}
