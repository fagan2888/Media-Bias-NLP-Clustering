The White House’s bowling lanes, which can be used only by staffers and their guests, are getting an upgrade with “green” materials.

The General Services Administration is looking to rebuild the two lanes located in the Eisenhower office building adjacent to the West Wing, according to an online posting for contractors Wednesday. No cost estimate has been given yet for the work.

GSA said the objective “is to replace the current, damaged and out dated lanes, approaches, pin setter platform (or pin deck) and gutters with new and modern products.”

“Specifically for the lanes, approach and pin deck, installing phenolic synthetic (or “green”) material,” GSA said. “Any and all replacement items will meet industry standard specifications, including variance tolerance set forth by the USBC (United States Bowling Congress). Contractor shall ensure proper repairs are made to the sub structure (as needed to meet USBC specifications), if any are found.”

The government said it’s been 15 years since the lanes “have had any professional, industry standard maintenance, modifications, repairs or attention.”

“They are now irreparable,” GSA said.

The White House has had bowling lanes since the 1940s, when Harry S Truman was president. The lanes were moved to the Eisenhower complex in the 1950s.
