A dog lover, Oscar volunteered at the group's events between his treatments at Procure Proton Therapy Center in Oklahoma City.\n\n\u201cHe may be feeling just terrible that day and he'd spend time with the dogs and you wouldn't even know that he was hurting,\u201d said Bush.\n\nHowever, one dog, Alexa, a Boston terrier cross breed caught his eye.\n\n\u201cOscar would regularly sit beside her and visit with her and take her out for a walk,\u201d said Sarah Hawthorne, Oscar\u2019s mother. \u201cOver time they bonded.\u201d\n\nWith each event, dogs were adopted but Alexa always remained in the back of her crate, in hindsight maybe for a reason.\n\n\u201cShe would see him and light up and he would see her and just sit there and talk to her and by the end of the time they'd be all feeling better,\u201d said Bush.\n\nAfter Oscar finished his treatments at Integris Procure this month, he made sure he didn't leave without a piece of Oklahoma with him. He adopted Alexa. Now home in the United Kingdom, Oscar's family says she's already settling in as the newest member of the family.\n\n\u201cYou'd never believe she traveled across an ocean to be with him,\u201d Bush said. \u201cShe's fitting in so great it was like that is where she was meant to be.\u201d\n\nThe family renamed Alexa \"Tips\" after an English tea. As far as Oscar's treatments, he still has many procedures and possibly surgery ahead to try and remove that tumor, but he'll have his family and dogs there every step of the way.\n\nClick here if you would like to follow Oscar\u2019s journey .", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A young cancer patient from the United Kingdom spent several months undergoing treatments here in Oklahoma.", "author": "Deanne Stein", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30929605/young-uk-cancer-patient-finishes-treatments-in-okc-adopts-dog", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9203377_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A young cancer patient from the United Kingdom spent several months undergoing treatments here in Oklahoma.", "title": "Young UK Cancer Patient Finishes Treatments In OKC, Adopts Dog"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9203377_G.jpg", "description": "A young cancer patient from the United Kingdom spent several months undergoing treatments here in Oklahoma.", "card": "summary", "title": "Young UK Cancer Patient Finishes Treatments In OKC, Adopts Dog"}, "wnreadableurl": "young-uk-cancer-patient-finishes-treatments-in-okc-adopts-dog", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/01/10", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,Cancer, Fight Against Cancer, Dog, Child", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS29", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,Cancer, Fight Against Cancer, Dog, Child"}, "article_summary": "During his time here in Oklahoma, Oscar believed a therapy dog, Indy.\nNow home in the United Kingdom, Oscar's family says she's already settling in as the newest member of the family.\nA dog lover, Oscar volunteered at the group's events between his treatments at Procure Proton Therapy Center in Oklahoma City.\nHowever, one dog, Alexa, a Boston terrier cross breed caught his eye.\nA young cancer patient from the United Kingdom spent several months undergoing treatments here in Oklahoma."}
