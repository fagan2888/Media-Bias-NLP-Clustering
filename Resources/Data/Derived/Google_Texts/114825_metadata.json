They didn\u2019t worry about a shot clock. Beard raced against closing time.\n\n\u201cI played basketball all the time. I loved it. It was my life,\u201d said Beard, now the first-year coach at Arkansas-Little Rock, the darling of Denver\u2019s portion of the Midwest Regional. \u201cAs a kid, I always remember wanting to play one more game. The center would close at 10. But sometimes the lady at the front desk, she would let us stay. She\u2019d say, \u2018Hey, guys, play one more game. I have to clean up the rec room.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat was the best news in the world \u2014 we got to play one more game.\u201d\n\nArkansas-Little Rock will play at least one more game in the NCAA Tournament. The 12th-seeded Trojans will be underdogs again when they meet No. 4 seed Iowa State at the Pepsi Center on Saturday. After that, maybe another game. And they\u2019re loving every minute.\n\n\u201cThis team, we\u2019ve got a lot of fight to us. We just keep coming,\u201d said senior guard Josh Hagins. \u201cWe just play together. That\u2019s really hard to find in college basketball.\u201d\n\nHagins propelled the Trojans (30-4) on Thursday to an 85-83, double-overtime upset of No. 5 Purdue, one of the biggest teams in the country. His 3-pointer from 30 feet with only five seconds remaining helped erase a 14-point deficit in the final four minutes of regulation and force overtime.\n\nThe Trojans have enjoyed every minute since that stunner. Their locker room after Thursday\u2019s game was a crack-up. Lis Shoshi, a 6-foot-11 junior center from Kosovo, couldn\u2019t believe his shooting touch. His step-back corner 3-pointer in the final minute brought UALR within one point of Purdue.\n\n\u201cI shot 15 shots, bro!\u201d he said to anybody who would listen. \u201cI haven\u2019t shot 15 shots in the past three games!\u201d\n\nAfter practice Friday at the Pepsi Center, Hagins and Shoshi held court like Key and Peele at a news conference. Shoshi explained that the Trojans would defer to their coach about a game plan.\n\n\u201cGood answer. I like that,\u201d Hagins said to laughter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting good at this,\u201d Shoshi said.\n\nAnd when Shoshi couldn\u2019t quite explain how fellow European centers at Gonzaga and Utah have played so well in Denver this week, Hagins came back again.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t so good an answer,\u201d Hagins said.\n\n\u201cThat was a hard question!\u201d Shoshi said.\n\nThe Trojans may be the loosest, most fun-loving team left in the NCAA Tournament. But the Sun Belt Conference champs have a difficult task. They shut down Purdue by fronting the Boildermakers\u2019 frontcourt players, keeping them out of the paint. Iowa State, though, is a fast-break team. The Cyclones can run opponents to exhaustion.\n\nBut even after Purdue dominated for 30 minutes Thursday, the final 10 minutes in regulation were enough for the Trojans to rally.\n\n\u201cThose kids believe they are going to win,\u201d said Iowa State coach Steve Prohm. \u201cThey kept coming and they kept coming. Then Hagins made kind of a \u2018March shot,\u2019 I call them. Where you go, \u2018How did that one go in?\u2019 He rose to the moment.\u201d\n\nThe madness of March basketball always finds a rooting favorite \u2014 a longshot band of mavericks for the country to rally around. If the Trojans leave Denver this weekend to play in the Sweet 16, they may be living in bubble, delightfully unaware.\n\n\u201cI turned my phone off yesterday at 11 a.m. before the game,\u201d Beard said. \u201cI turned it back on at about 8 because I wanted to check on my youngest daughter. And my phone had completely blown up. I mean, like, just destroyed. I have no idea who contacted me.\n\n\u201cSo, if any of my friends or family or recruits are out there, I\u2019m not getting a big head. I\u2019m not turning into somebody else. My phone\u2019s not working. But I hope you\u2019ll text me again, so I can thank you.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Arkansas-Little Rock, the darlings of Denver, playing like mavericks", "title": "Arkansas-Little Rock, the darlings of Denver, playing like mavericks", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/arkansas-little-rock-the-darlings-of-denver-playing-like-mavericks/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__BN20160319_B1_BNSP19BKCLITTLEROCKp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__BN20160319_B1_BNSP19BKCLITTLEROCKp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T17:14:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:25:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2fad\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI turned my phone off yesterday at 11 a.m. before the game,\u201d Beard said.\nIt was my life,\u201d said Beard, now the first-year coach at Arkansas-Little Rock, the darling of Denver\u2019s portion of the Midwest Regional.\nIf the Trojans leave Denver this weekend to play in the Sweet 16, they may be living in bubble, delightfully unaware.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t shot 15 shots in the past three games!\u201dAfter practice Friday at the Pepsi Center, Hagins and Shoshi held court like Key and Peele at a news conference.\n\u201cSo, if any of my friends or family or recruits are out there, I\u2019m not getting a big head."}
