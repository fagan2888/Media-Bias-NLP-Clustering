EBOLA IN NYC -- Capital’s Dan Goldberg and Sally Goldenberg: “The first person diagnosed with Ebola in New York City is being treated in isolation at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, where he was taken Thursday morning after reporting a fever and gastrointestinal problems, city and state officials said in a late-night press conference at the hospital.

-- Calming the city: “The officials at Thursday night's press conference, including Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo, repeatedly emphasized that Ebola is only contracted through shared bodily fluids and that patients are not contagious until they show symptoms. The officials assured New Yorkers the patient was not on the subway or in public once he had a fever. ‘I would get on the subway tomorrow and ride the subway,’ acting state health commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said.” http://bit.ly/1toeBox

-- Obama spoke by phone with Cuomo and also de Blasio. The White House read out: “The President offered the Governor and Mayor any additional federal support necessary to provide the highest standard of patient care, maintain the strictest safety protocols for healthcare workers, and to identify and, as necessary.”

-- AP’s Jonathan Lemire and Colleen Long: “The doctor, Craig Spencer, a member of Doctors Without Borders who had been working in Guinea, returned six days ago and reported Thursday morning coming down with a 103-degree fever and diarrhea. … days before Spencer fell ill, he went on a 3-mile jog, went to the High Line park, rode the subway and, on Wednesday night, got a taxi to a Brooklyn bowling alley. Bassett said he felt fatigued Wednesday but not feverish until Thursday morning.” http://bit.ly/ZPuRDs

-- NY Post: “Hipster bowling hot spot The Gutter was closed last night due to ‘unforeseen circumstances.’ … An army of emergency vehicles swarmed Spencer’s block around noon and completely shut the street down. … FDNY specialists in hazmat suits sealed off his fifth-floor apartment, sources said.” http://bit.ly/1wvtMNI

-- Daily News: “FDNY hazardous materials specialists sealed-off Spencer’s apartment on W. 147th St. and took the doctor out on a stretcher. … the super in Spencer’s building, said firefighters took the doctor’s door off its hinges when they took him out of the apartment.” http://nydn.us/1ys8QGN

CLINTON ENDORSES CUOMO, WHO ALMOST RECIPROCATES—Capital’s Dana Rubinstein: Cuomo told a crowd of Democrats Thursday that he had very high hopes for Hillary Clinton. “Hillary Clinton is so good that whatever she does she’s going to be an overwhelming success,” the governor said at an event with the former New York senator and secretary of state to promote his campaign and his Women's Equality Party.Once the applause died down, Cuomo continued: “And I hope she does something really, really, really big. This wasn't Cuomo pledging his support to a Democratic leader who has foreclosed the possibility of him running for national office, and for that matter, this wasn't an endorsement at all. After all, as the governor told reporters in a post-event scrum, “Hillary Clinton can’t be endorsed because Hillary Clinton hasn’t said she’s running for anything.” http://bit.ly/1tPv0Vd

RUPERT-ZUCKERMAN -- Tabloid union? -- Capital’s Joe Pompeo: “What if New York City's two tabloids, those famously bloody newsstand warriors, joined forces? Recently, the age-old rivals were considering just that … The New York Post and the Daily News have been, by popular definition, locked in a tabloid war for decades. But within the past year or so, even as they waged their vituperative battle in public, they were talking about a number of potential business deals that would have made unlikely bedfellows of enemy combatants—had they not broken down, according to several sources familiar with the matter. …

--Out of Print: “Within tabloid circles, chatter is rampant that the News is already considering a plan to go digital-only sometime in the next few years. A source close to News management corroborated that such conversations are taking place. ‘The discussions are not about if, they're about when,’ the source told Capital.” http://goo.gl/ruZkti

RIVERS AFTERMATH -- “Melissa [Rivers] has 'no choice' but to sue'”– TMZ: “Melissa Rivers will sue the medical center where Joan died and the doctors as well because it's the only way she can find out what really happened to her mom.

EAT BEAT – “This Is What Happens When You Eat 15 Slices Of NYC Pizza In One Day,” by BuzzFeed’s Norberto Briceño: “THE RULES, YO: 1. Pizza parlors MUST serve slices. So New York favorites like Grimaldi’s, Lombardi’s, or Patsy’s are out of the running.2. The pizza parlors must come from all five New York City boroughs (Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, The Bronx, and Staten Island).3. I can only get around using NYC public transportation.4. I will order whatever I want.5. Go big or go home (I have to finish every slice. Leaving out the crust is OK, though).6. Do not, under any circumstances, die.” http://bzfd.it/1wo47ph

BILL RIFF – “The de Blasio Diaries, Chapter 2: Highline and Dry” on VanityFair.com: “Dear Diary, I have a confession to make. Last night, I went to the Highline. I know, I know. I know. The Highline. Basically as bad as getting tea with Gwyneth at the St. Regis. I told some reporter I had never been, and it became a whole thing, and talking so much about how I had never been . . . well, it made me want to see it. … But I couldn’t go and be photographed and give the Post headlines for a week (‘Highline and Not So Mighty!’). So, I put on a tracksuit and told Chirlane I was going out on a Citi Bike, but instead I took a cab (I don’t know what’s happening to me) to the Highline. I put on one of those blue wigs Chiara used to wear in high school, and took Dante’s giant headphones.” http://vnty.fr/1pGRxwh

DONOR CAMPAIGN -- “Disgraced hotel magnate uses powerful friends in bid to lessen prison sentence,” by Post’s Selim Algar: “Disgraced hotel magnate and Clinton family pal Sant Chatwal Singh has submitted hundreds of letters of support from high-powered pals including self-helper Deepak Chopra, media honcho Robert Johnson and restaurant titan Geoffrey Zakarian in his bid to impress a judge before his sentencing … Chatwal pleaded guilty in April to illegally using straw donors to raise more than $180,000 for three political campaigns — including Hillary Clinton’s failed 2008 presidential bid — and faces up to six years in prison. From powerful politicians to prominent surgeons to former New York City Police Commissioner Lee Brown, Chatwal appears to have retained a slew of friends in high places despite his fall from grace earlier this year.” http://bit.ly/1tp0qiX

NO CAPITAL FOR YOU -- “M.T.A. Told It Must Focus on Repairs, Not Growth,” by Times’ Patrick McGeehan: “The Metropolitan Transportation Authority should concentrate on improving the condition of its existing transit systems before plowing ahead with the second phase of the Second Avenue subway and other expansion projects, a watchdog agency said on Thursday. In a report that called the authority’s priorities ‘misplaced,’ the Citizens Budget Commission called for more emphasis on safety and increasing the capacity of the New York City subway system. The subways have been carrying heavier and heavier loads, exceeding six million riders on four separate days last month.” http://nyti.ms/ZKU7dK

BOOSTING OBAMACARE -- Capital’s Gloria Pazmino: The City Council plans to work with community organizations to make sure Affordable Care Act enrollment numbers increase during the program’s upcoming enrollment period.

POST-MORELAND REFORMS FALL FLAT—New York World’s Harry Stevens: If the 2014 elections are anything to go by, the package of campaign finance reforms enacted this year by Cuomo and the state Legislature will have little, if any, impact on the business of campaigning in New York. http://bit.ly/1D4d4oC

MOBILE NYPD -- ‘Fewer arrests’ -- Capital’s Azi Paybarah: A new "mobility initiative" will equip city police officers with smart phones and tablets, and allow officials to instantly communicate with every officer in the field. The $160 million initiative will provide for 35,000 smart phones, one for each officer, and 6,000 tablets, one for each police car, over the next three years.

-- Technology upgrade: “You can literally, with this technology, take a fingerprint on a street corner in New York City," de Blasio said. "A police officer can take a fingerprint, process it immediately, [and see] whether someone has a warrant out, confirm an identity. This is going to speed the work of law enforcement. It’s also going to allow us to not have to bring as many people into the station houses. It’s going to allow us to more summonses and fewer arrests, where appropriate.” Bratton said the new technology may also lead to improved relations between officers and local residents, since the police will be able to easily display pictures of suspects in order to say: “Here is who I am looking for.” http://bit.ly/1wvoPVc

REAL ESTATE -- “Amtrak weighing development of massive Queens rail yard,” by Capital’s Ryan Hutchins: “Amtrak is considering developing Sunnyside Yards in Queens as part of a nationwide evaluation of its real estate portfolio and could turn to investors as early as next spring to find partners willing to explore potential uses for those properties … The Sunnyside Yards is one [of] the largest undeveloped parcels in New York City and holds virtually limitless potential to developers willing to build a platform above the tracks. Planners have long dreamed about what could be built on the property, which remains an active rail yard used by several train companies.” http://bit.ly/1rsqcxu

--Condé Nast move to World Trade Center starts next weekend, by Capital’s Ryan Hutchins: Condé Nast executives will move into 1 World Trade Center next week, beginning a months-long process to migrate thousands of employees from Midtown to its 24 floors in the gleaming new skyscraper, according to Mary Ann Tighe, the chief executive of CBRE New York. The company plans to start with its top employees as well as its attorneys from the law firm Sabin, Bermant & Gould LLP. “They’re stacking from the top rolling down in the space,” Tighe said. Durst Organization confirmed to The New York Times that the shuffle to Lower Manhattan would start on Nov. 1, next Saturday. Capital reported several weeks ago that an opening was planned by early November.

Still unclear, however, is when an opening ceremony will be held. The Port Authority and Durst had looked at several days next week as possible targets but that has not come to fruition. The Wall Street Journal, which cited sources saying Condé employees would start work at Tower One on Nov. 3, said the delay comes after staffers for New York and New Jersey’s governors spent weeks haggling over the date. An opening will happen at some point after Election Day.

--“Brooklyn’s Gangster Graveyard,” by The Daily Beast’s Nina Strochlic: “On a sprawling, idyllic cluster of rolling hills in an otherwise industrial section of New York City, history’s finest and most notorious have been laid to rest.Green-Wood Cemetery should have its own ZIP code. Covering nearly 500 acres in the middle of Brooklyn, the land of the dead feels a world away from the skyscrapers of Manhattan, visible in the distance from the hilltops.Visitors are greeted by a looming gothic gate, the kind used to signify that important residents lie behind its spires. The cemetery is home to 560,000 dead.” http://thebea.st/1vWKcyt
