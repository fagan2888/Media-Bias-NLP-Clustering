Straight from Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s state visit, Obama is now scheduled to meet Vladimir Putin at the U.N. Monday. Count Pope Francis and our 44th chief executive will have convened with three of the world\u2019s most powerful people in the course of a couple of weeks.\n\nThe encounter with Putin and the \u201cfruitful and constructive summit\u201d with Xi , as Xinhua News Agency called it, look altogether weird. Obama is suddenly talking about mutual interests and cooperation with leaders of the two nations with which Washington is most directly in competition. What\u2019s going on here?\n\nRelated: In First U.S. Visit, Xi Arrives Dragging a Diminished Economy\n\nIntentionally or otherwise\u2014and it\u2019s hard to tell intent from accident with this president\u2014Obama is delivering a message. Like it or not, and plenty of us don\u2019t, we\u2019ve entered an era of interdependence that looks very like our 21st century destiny.\n\nWhether or not you went along with Bush\u2019s stance in foreign policy, it had the virtue of clarity. Obama\u2019s doesn\u2019t.\n\nTo put the point another way, the unilateralism that defined policy during the administration of George W. Bush is only a few years behind us, but think for a minute how distant it already seems.\n\nWhether or not you went along with Bush\u2019s stance in foreign policy, it had the virtue of clarity. Obama\u2019s doesn\u2019t: It\u2019s all over the place, a sea of confusion. The question is how to read all the false starts, reversals, half steps, and advances quickly followed by retreats.\n\nPutting the conclusion first, the current state of U.S. foreign policy is symptomatic not so much of a bumbling president as a nation whose place in the world has entered a period of profound transition. Obama\u2019s a novice on the foreign side\u2014Democratic presidents often are\u2014but it\u2019s questionable whether a chief executive of any other stripe or conviction would have compiled a more coherent record.\n\nRelated: The Pope Was a Breeze for Obama\u2026President Xi Is Another Story\n\nI see a pattern in this administration\u2019s relations with Beijing and Moscow, beginning with Obama\u2019s inheritance. He assumed adversarial positions vis-\u00e0-vis China and Russia when he took office in 2009, and tensions heightened in both cases. Six years later, it looks as if we\u2019re watching a fundamental turn.\n\nGood. It\u2019s exactly what\u2019s needed.\n\nChina\u2019s emergence as a global power is inevitable, but it doesn\u2019t follow that confrontation rather than cooperation is the logical course.\n\nWashington\u2019s China policy has been shaped for years by the assumption that this is \u201cthe Pacific Century.\u201d The idea is that China will achieve primacy in East Asia\u2014eclipsing America\u2019s post-1945 dominance and turning longtime allies such as Japan and South Korea into modern variants of the Middle Kingdom\u2019s tributary states.\n\nChina\u2019s rise as a Pacific power, therefore, must be resisted. It\u2019s a zero-sum game in this line of thinking: Beijing\u2019s gain is Washington\u2019s loss. If you study this even briefly, it\u2019s little more than a reiteration of Cold War rhetoric in the Asian context.\n\nThe Pacific Century is a Pacific myth, as two seasoned Asia hands, James Clad and Robert Manning, have insisted for years. China\u2019s emergence\u2014as a global power, indeed\u2014is inevitable, but it simply doesn\u2019t follow that confrontation rather than cooperation and partnership is the logical course.\n\nRelated: Obama Announces \u2018Understanding with Xi on Cyber Theft\n\nIn my read, Obama reached the end of his rope when Treasury, State, and National Security Adviser Susan Rice more or less railroaded him into that ridiculous effort to undermine the Beijing-sponsored Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank when it was launched last March. If I\u2019m correct, Xi\u2019s state visit represents a turn away from the orthodoxy for the simple reason it just proved so embarrassingly wrong.\n\nXi\u2019s message was plain even before he reached Washington. By stopping in Seattle to consult with American executives and announce a $38 billion order for 300 planes from Boeing, the Chinese leader said in effect, \u201cLook, the world\u2019s two largest economies are interdependent. Let\u2019s stay steady and explore the common ground.\u201d\n\nAfter placing a $38 billion order for 300 planes from Boeing, Xi\u2019s message was, \u201cLet\u2019s stay steady and explore common ground.\u201d\n\nFair enough, the agreements on carbon emissions and cybercrime that emerged in Washington may be hard to enforce. But does this mean they\u2019re somehow not worth pursuing? As recently as last week, the expectation was for a \u201cclash\u201d on the cyberattack question.\n\nWe\u2019ve been told little as to what Obama and Xi said about maritime security in the South China Sea. But I\u2019ll eat my hat if the topic didn\u2019t come up. I take the public silence on this question to reflect a mutual determination to reach an accommodation without embarrassing either side. Net-positive.\n\nRelated: Now We Know What Putin Is Up to In Syria\n\nAs to the scheduled session with Putin at the U.N., it simply reinforces the contacts Secretary of State Kerry has cultivated in recent weeks with Sergei Lavrov, his Russian counterpart. As a much-noted opinion piece in The New York Times asserted last week, \u201cThere can be no peace in Syria without Russia.\u201d\n\nThis column argued last week accepting Russia\u2019s role in Syria would prove open-ended. And then Kerry began a week of diplomacy at the U.N. Saturday by signaling that Iran, too, will be part of a multi-sided solution. \u201cI view this week as a major opportunity for any number of countries to play an important role,\u201d Kerry said in New York.\n\nThis leaves Pope Francis. I don\u2019t see his visit to Washington last week as simply a pause for momentary moralizing. He has no desire to be that kind of pontiff, plainly.\n\nWhat was he in his meeting with Obama and his plea for world unity in his speech to Congress if not the Greek chorus behind these major players? The message was simple: We need to think thoughts we\u2019ve yet to think and do things we\u2019ve left undone.\n\nThis can\u2019t be stored away as Christian idealism any longer: Considering the state of the world it\u2019s realism in its purest form. Francis will approve, surely, of Obama\u2019s new demarches to its two most prominent antagonists.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s September agenda will need a glass case all its own when his preside", "title": "With Xi and Putin, Obama Sets the U.S. on a Course of Confusion", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/09/28/Xi-and-Putin-Obama-Sets-US-Course-Confusion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-nuclear-obama_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/09/28/Xi-and-Putin-Obama-Sets-US-Course-Confusion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-nuclear-obama_1.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "President Obama\u2019s September agenda will need a glass case all its own when his preside", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe030c\"", "article_summary": "Straight from Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s state visit, Obama is now scheduled to meet Vladimir Putin at the U.N.
