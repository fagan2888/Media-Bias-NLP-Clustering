And the calisthenics over the past few weeks on the highway bill attests to his thesis.\n\n\u201cRepublicans don\u2019t know how to get a transportation bill done,\u201d charged House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra, California, a few weeks ago.\n\nFederal highway dollars expired at the end of July, and Congress again rushed to plug the dyke. For starters, the House approved a five-month bill to keep federal transportation programs afloat in mid-July. Then the Senate crashed through a six-year, bipartisan bill authored by Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., and the top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Barbara Boxer, California.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., championed the effort, scheduling a rare Sunday session to help expeditiously complete the legislation before sending it to the House just before the start of the lengthy August recess.\n\nBut other issues intruded. Major bills often assume the mantle of \u201cChristmas trees\u201d right before major congressional recesses. That\u2019s because lawmakers attempt to adorn those bills with every possible legislative bauble and ornament available. That\u2019s where de funding Planned Parenthood came in. There was sanctuary cities tinsel. Export-Import Bank bubble lights and garlands for the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nCall it Christmas in July.\n\nBut McConnell knew better than to be distracted by the shiny objects if he was going to wrap up his longer-term bill. He permitted but two decorations on this tree: one important to Democrats and one crucial for Republicans.\n\nOne amendment would reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, which helps American firms conduct business abroad and that expired in June. The other would repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNeither has anything to do with funding highway construction programs. But sometimes that\u2019s the cost of doing business in the United States Senate. And, the spare ornamentation might actually help senators complete the bill and not find other distractions.\n\nConservatives such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, immediately flayed McConnell.\n\nHe decried the ObamaCare de-funding effort as a \u201cshow vote\u201d -- particularly since stripping dollars for the health care program didn\u2019t have the support to clear a procedural hurdle let alone become part of the highway bill.\n\nMeantime, it was clear from the outset that the Ex-Im Bank commanded enough yeas to clear the procedural threshold and be attached to the legislation.\n\nThe Senate approved the bill -- wishing the House might entertain it before its members fled the Capitol for August. But House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., promptly squelched those hopes.\n\n\u201cWe are not taking the Senate bill,\u201d declared McCarthy, fretting about dumping a 1,000-page bill on his members just days before escaping the Beltway.\n\nAt that point, the House had already approved an interim highway bill stretching through mid-December. But the House GOP brain trust then rolled out a three-month patch through late October. The House was slated to depart Washington on July 30. But the House quickly approved the three-month measure, and McCarthy cut everyone loose a day early on July 29.\n\nIronically, even though the House was out of session on July 30, dozens of House members were spotted walking around the Capitol complex that day. Many had important meetings scheduled and didn\u2019t want to cancel them.\n\nStill, McCarthy\u2019s opportune departure gambit achieved four objectives:\n\nFirst, it jammed the Senate with the House\u2019s short-term highway bills. It was a take-it-or-leave it proposition. Either the Senate would swallow hard-to-pass stopgap plans or highway programs would go belly-up at the end of July. It would be the Senate\u2019s fault and nobody could hang the responsibility on the House.\n\nSecondly, the maneuver absolved the House of having to immediately consider the Senate\u2019s version of the highway measure. Members of Congress from both sides seemed all right with that, despite the bipartisan structure of the Senate legislation. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., noted his opposition of the Senate package and echoed McCarthy\u2019s calendar concerns.\n\n\u201cIn the short time that we have available, it would be not possible to consider that bill in any depth,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly the Senate doesn't expect us to take a 1,000-page bill and just, you know, no questions asked and pass it and send it to the president.\u201d\n\nThird, the House\u2019s decision to skip town on the Senate and its highway measure also protected its members from a nasty political skirmish.\n\nRemember the Ex-Im Bank? Eliminating the institution is a cause celebre for the Republican right. Both the House and Senate let its charter expire at the end of June -- even though there\u2019s sufficient, bipartisan support to renew the institution in both bodies of Congress.\n\nThe procedural vote on Ex-Im in the Senate scored a whopping 67 yeas. The vote in favor of the actual amendment racked up 64 ayes. But there\u2019s a conservative, Tea Party-aligned core of House members who are repulsed at the prospect of reauthorizing the bank. They would have immediately balked at the Senate highway bill on those grounds alone. Any potential changes to the Senate\u2019s bill -- including stripping out Ex-Im -- could have protracted the process and prompted the House to send an altered bill back to the Senate.\n\nFourth, this effort preserves a conservative policy goal. Ex-Im remains mothballed. That empowers House conservatives to return to their districts during the August recess and affirm that the Export-Import Bank is dead.\n\nFor now.\n\nBoehner\u2019s long expected the Senate to include a provision to reauthorize the bank in a \u201cmust-pass\u201d piece of legislation. A long-term highway bill could constitute such a vehicle.\n\nAnd even though highway programs are on life support now through late October, the onus is now on the House to author a bona fide highway measure, pass it and huddle in a House/Senate conference committee this autumn to arrive at a final, merged bill to send to President Obama.\n\nStill, even some House Republicans want to salvage the Ex-Im Bank.\n\nThe House Rules Committee is the final gateway to the floor for most pieces of legislation. An effort to renew the bank surfaced on a rather obscure, but noteworthy vote on the night of July 28 as the GOP prepped its three-month highway measure for debate the next day.\n\nRep. Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn., backs the Export-Import Bank and drew up an amendment to extend its life through the fall of 2019. The Rules committee rejected the inclusion of Fincher\u2019s amendment in debate on the emergency highway bill, but only by 7-to-6 vote.\n\nThat vote is important because members of the committee serve at the pleasure of the House speaker. The committee is set up in a way to always favor the leadership -- which for now isn\u2019t willing to reauthorize Ex-Im.\n\nAnd on the vote to include the Fincher amendment, GOP Reps. Steve Stivers, Ohio, Dan Newhouse, Washington, bucked the rest of the R epublicans on the panel.\n\nThey voted yes along with all Democrats, which triggered the close vote in the Rules committee. It\u2019s been years since the committee has experienced such a tight tally on a major issue -- and significant that not one but two GOPers voted against their fellow Republicans.\n\nAt his final press conference before the August respite, Boehner was asked by reporters about a final resolution to the highway bill when lawmakers reconvene in September.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident as we get into this fall we\u2019re going to have pretty smooth sailing,\u201d chirped Boehner with a smirk, drawing laughter from the press corps.\n\nPerhaps the \u201csmooth sailing\u201d refers to solving actual highway policy issues. Settling all of the ancillary topics are the real challenge -- because it\u2019s obvious the debate so far about the highway bill hasn\u2019t been about the highway bill.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/Legislation,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/Leadership", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-09 11:51:24 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "The effort in Congress to pass a long-term transportation bill has less to do with the legislation and more to do with ObamaCare, the Export-Import Bank and other pressing concerns.", "twitter": {"description": "The effort in Congress to pass a long-term transportation bill has less to do with the legislation and more to do with ObamaCare, the Export-Import Bank and other pressing concerns.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/09/congress-faced-with-passing-long-term-transportation-bill-after-august-recess.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/07/30/0/0/073015_dotcom_boehner_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Congress faced with passing a long term Transportation bill after August recess", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/Legislation\",\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/Leadership\"],\"author\":\"Chad Pergram\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Congress faced with passing a long term Transportation bill after August recess\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/07/30/0/0/073015_dotcom_boehner_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-09T15:32:24Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/09/congress-faced-with-passing-long-term-transportation-bill-after-august-recess.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"defdc496-33fb-4888-9cc9-3f4d269f2612\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "The effort in Congress to pass a long-term transportation bill has less to do with the legislation and more to do with ObamaCare, the Export-Import Bank and other pressing concerns.", "dc.identifier": "defdc496-33fb-4888-9cc9-3f4d269f2612", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "legislation,leadership", "description": "The effort in Congress to pass a long-term transportation bill has less to do with the legislation and more to do with ObamaCare, the Export-Import Bank and other pressing concerns.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Congress Faced With Passing A Long Term Transportation Bill After August Recess", "dcterms.created": "2015-08-09 11:51:24 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "The effort in Congress to pass a long-term transportation bill has less to do with the legislation and more to do with ObamaCare, the Export-Import Bank and other pressing concerns.", "title": "Congress faced with passing a long term Transportation bill after August recess | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/09/congress-faced-with-passing-long-term-transportation-bill-after-august-recess.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/07/30/0/0/073015_dotcom_boehner_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2015-08-09", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/Legislation\",\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/Leadership\"],\"author\":\"Chad Pergram\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Congress faced with passing a long term Transportation bill after August recess\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/07/30/0/0/073015_dotcom_boehner_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-09T15:32:24Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/09/congress-faced-with-passing-long-term-transportation-bill-after-august-recess.html\",\"post_id\":\"defdc496-33fb-4888-9cc9-3f4d269f2612\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "dc.creator": "Chad Pergram"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce50d\"", "article_summary": "When is a highway bill not about a highway bill?\nSettling all of the ancillary topics are the real challenge -- because it\u2019s obvious the debate so far about the highway bill hasn\u2019t been about the highway bill.\nThey would have immediately balked at the Senate highway bill on those grounds alone.\nAnd the calisthenics over the past few weeks on the highway bill attests to his thesis.\n\u201cWe are not taking the Senate bill,\u201d declared McCarthy, fretting about dumping a 1,000-page bill on his members just days before escaping the Beltway."}
