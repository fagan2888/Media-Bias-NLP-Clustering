Some of these stocks may have even become oversold. Independent research firm Argus has reviews of three of health care picks from its own Focus List in which it still sees significant upside ahead.\n\nArgus still has an Overweight rating on health care stocks in general. With a weighting of just over 15% of the S&P 500, the recent selling pressure may be an opportunity for more nimble investors who don\u2019t get caught up in quick rounds of pressure.\n\nArgus thinks that the group can continue to benefit from its perceived insulation from economic turbulence. The larger pool of insured people under the Affordable Care Act should support further gains.\n\nTuesday\u2019s report for the health care sector sees what was a prior outperformance continuing ahead. Argus sees health care fundamentals being reasonable, with general sector debt ratios being low.\n\nAmgen\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN) was shown to have solid growth prospects, and the company was said to be doing a good job of launching its next generation of blockbuster drugs: Krypolis, Prolia, XGEVA and now Corlanor.\n\nAnother boost is that Amgen\u2019s pipeline appears promising via drugs for high cholesterol and multiple myeloma. Even after the dividend was raised by 30%, Argus thinks more dividend hikes are in store. Amazingly, it has a $194 price target \u2014 almost $60 higher than now and almost $10 higher than the consensus target.\n\nALSO READ: 5 Analyst Stock Picks Called to Rise 100% to 200%\n\nAmgen shares were last seen up 3% at $136.00, with a consensus price target of almost $186 and a 52-week trading range of $127.67 to $181.81. Amgen\u2019s market cap is still just over $100 billion, even after the big pullback.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "biotech,Value Investing, Amgen, Inc.
