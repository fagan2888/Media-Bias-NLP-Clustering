Senate leaders may have considered dropping language defunding Planned Parenthood from an upcoming Obamacare repeal package, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters Tuesday that he expects both measures will be in an upcoming budget reconciliation bill. Power Post has more:\n\n\u201cIt will contain a defund of Planned Parenthood in the Obamacare repeal bill,\u201d McConnell said at a weekly press conference. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving to that after Thanksgiving.\u201d Reconciliation bills cannot be filibustered and need just 51 votes for passage. But with some Senate conservatives threatening to vote against the legislation because it would not fully repeal the Affordable Care Act, GOP leaders reportedly considered dropping the Planned Parenthood language in order to attract the votes of moderates who are uneasy with cutting off all funds to the women\u2019s health group.\n\nDEMOCRATS WARN AGAIN ABOUT POISON PILL RIDERS. Democrats have been warning since the day the budget deal was announced that they will not accept any \u201cpoison pill\u201d policies to be attached to the upcoming omnibus spending bill. That trend hasn\u2019t changed as the Dec. 11 deadline for funding the government draws closer. The Hill has a rundown of the top Democrats reiterating that message.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to stand firm on the riders and the president\u2019s going to stand firm with us,\u201d Rep. Nita Lowey (N.Y.), senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said Tuesday. Rep. Steny Hoyer (Md.), the chamber\u2019s Democratic whip, sounded a similar warning. \u201cWe are unified as Democrats in opposing any riders which would be rightfully referred to as \u2018poison pills,\u2019 \u201d Hoyer told reporters in the Capitol. The comments raise the stakes in what\u2019s certain to be a fierce \u2014 and fiercely partisan \u2014 debate over a sweeping spending package less than a month before government funding is scheduled to expire.\n\nGOP BUDGET VET PICKS WINNERS AND LOSERS IN UPCOMING OMNIBUS.
