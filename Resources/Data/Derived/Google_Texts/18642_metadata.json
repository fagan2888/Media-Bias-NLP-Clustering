Lee Trevi\u00f1o will be Komedix\u2019s first El Paso location and its third in Texas.\n\nKomedix also has plans for a clinic in Northeast El Paso.\n\nThe company is stepping into a competitive market with more than 40 walk-in clinics operating in El Paso, some offering specialty services.\n\nKomedix\u2019s specialty is its general primary care, says CEO David Komet.\n\nKomet said he picked El Paso because of the unmet demand for primary care physicians and services, both of which will grow as more people sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cEl Paso as a community has less than half of the primary care physicians it needs for population health,\u201d he said. \u201cUrgent care centers are a great way to get seen quickly. The downside is continuity of care.\n\n\u201cIf you talk to the physicians that staff those clinics, they\u2019re great with the sprains, cuts and the incidental care. But when it comes to long-term care of chronic conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease, that\u2019s not the role they play.\u201d\n\nKomet said there is another difference in the Komedix model, which is to take the administrative load off staff physicians so they can spend more time with patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a physicians-driven solution to this new era of complexity and compliance,\u201d he said. \u201cPracticing medicine has become extremely complex, with all the requirements for keeping electronic records.\n\n\u201cPhysicians become physicians to help people. They\u2019re scientists and healers and don\u2019t want to be running IT solutions, doing quality outcome measures and dealing with billings and collections.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the whole realm of insurance, where the process of getting credentialed by just one health plan is, he said, mind numbing.\n\n\u201cIf everyone knew how hard it is for physicians to get paid for the services they provide, they might have a little more sympathy for them as a professional class,\u201d Komet said. \u201cWe hand them a laptop or iPad and say, \u2018Go take care of patients.\u2019\u201d\n\nDr. Hector Lopez, Komedix\u2019s clinical director in El Paso, has been in practice for 30 years and is the kind of experienced physician Komedix tends to attract, Komet said, because they know what running an office is like and want to try something different.\n\nPromotional materials on the Komedix website include a pie chart showing that its doctors spend 67 percent of their time on patient care, while typical doctors spend only 20 percent of their time with patients.\n\nPrimary care is the key to health in a community, he said, because that\u2019s where diseases and other medical problems can be discovered before they become terribly costly to treat or life threatening.\n\nHaving to wait weeks for an appointment with a primary care doctor is the most obvious evidence that there aren\u2019t enough primary care doctors to meet the need in El Paso, he said, adding that Obamacare will make the problem worse before it gets better.\n\nObamacare impact\n\n\u201cYou can hear the political conversation around Obamacare from every angle,\u201d Komet said. \u201cBut the bottom line is more people are insured, which means more people have access to physicians.\n\n\u201cIt may be an imperfect law and an imperfect system, but it\u2019s something that probably needs to be worked on and refined.\u201d\n\nKomet said he and his company are banking on demand to grow the company. The clinic will accept Medicare and insurance plans including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, TRICARE and Humana.\n\n\u201cInsurers thought this year was a big year for enrollment, but next year will be really big because the penalties for not having health insurance are increasing,\u201d he said.\n\nPeople who filed a 2015 income tax return and had to pay the penalty for themselves or a family member who didn\u2019t have health insurance know what he\u2019s talking about.\n\nEmail El Paso Inc. reporter David Crowder at dcrowder@elpasoinc.com or call (915) 534-4422, ext. 122 and (915) 630-6622.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "east side,clinics,david crowder,el paso inc,komedix,local_news,editors_pick", "og": {"site_name": "El Paso Inc.", "description": "New medical clinics open all the time in El Paso, but the company behind the Komedix Healthcare clinic opening May 5 on Lee Trevino says it is different from the rest.For one, it\u2019s owned by a crowd-funded company based in New Braunfels in Central Texas, with no connections to a larger health care provider.", "title": "Primary care clinic opening on Eastside", "url": "http://www.elpasoinc.com/news/local_news/article_23b2af5a-107d-11e6-bd88-e308e38363cf.html", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/elpasoinc.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/5c/75c802c2-107d-11e6-9069-9f4b9e4a41d4/5727770b6c8cd.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C373", "height": 373}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 172555339466240}, "keywords": "east side,clinics,david crowder,el paso inc,komedix,local_news,editors_pick", "description": "New medical clinics open all the time in El Paso, but the company behind the Komedix Healthcare clinic opening May 5 on Lee Trevino says it is different from the rest.For one, it\u2019s owned by a crowd-funded company based in New Braunfels in Central Texas, with no connections to a larger health care provider."}, "article_summary": "For another, its aim is to establish a loyal base of return patients \u2013 adults and seniors seeking primary care and same-day appointments \u2013 versus the urgent care clinics competing with hospital emergency rooms.\n\u201cEl Paso as a community has less than half of the primary care physicians it needs for population health,\u201d he said.\nThe clinic at 3130 N.
