It was 13 years ago that Eminem became the first hip hop act to be nominated and win Oscar for Best Original Song with his hit \"Lose Yourself\" from \"8 Mile.\"\n\n\n\nAt the 2003 Academy Awards, hip hop wasn't featured in the category but it wouldn't take long for it to make its return as Three 6 Mafia were nominated in 2005 for \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp\" from \"Hustle & Flow.\"\n\n\n\nJust like Eminem did in 2002, the rap group became the second hip hop act to win Best Original Song, but the Memphis group took it one step further and also became the hip hop at to perform at the ceremony.\n\n\n\nSince Three 6 Mafia's historic night in 2005, hip hop has remained scarce at the awards show. British rapper M.I.A. was featured on the 2009 nomination \"O... Saya\" from \"Slumdog Millionaire,\" while Pharrell Williams was nominated in 2013 for \"Happy\" from \"Despicable Me.\"\n\n\n\nTune in to the 87th Academy Awards on Feb. 22 to see if Common and John Legend can add theirselves to hip hop history.\n\n\n\nSIGN UP TO RECEIVE THE LATEST NEWS FROM FASHION&STYLE\n\n\u00a9 2015 Fashion & Style.com All rights reserved.
