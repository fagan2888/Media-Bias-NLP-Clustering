Ann Kirkpatrick and her Republican opponent, state Speaker Andy Tobin, have to build in an extra hour.\n\nWhy? A befuddled cellphone won\u2019t pick up on it, but the Navajo Nation observes Daylight Saving Time. The rest of the Grand Canyon State, brandishing its contrarian streak, never changes its clocks.\n\nSo to ensure Kirkpatrick was in line for the Western Navajo Nation here at 9 a.m. DST on Oct. 18, the usual 90-minute ride from Flagstaff became a two-and-a-half hour journey.\n\nTobin had to factor in the same math on a visit he made here the day before the parade, as the Western Navajo Nation Fair was getting underway.\n\nOn the flip side, when heading somewhere else in the district from the Navajo Nation, even to the Hopi Nation, which is completely surrounded by Navajo land, one gets that hour back. Surrounded by Navajo land, you're back to the past, or at least, back in the rest of the state's time zone.\n\nConfused? That\u2019s just the start of the logistics involved in a campaign here.\n\nAt 55,039 square miles, Arizona\u2019s 1st District is one of the largest in the country that is not an at-large seat, such as Alaska or Montana. Along with the tribes, it\u2019s spread out among 11 counties. Adding to the otherworldly feel of the place, the area around Tuba City has been used as a training ground for Mars roving vehicles, owing to its similar terrain.\n\nThe vast majority of the land is rural, though pop-up suburbs are changing that, particularly north of Tucson, in the southern part of the state. It\u2019s roughly 50 percent minority, with Native Americans at about 25 percent, Hispanics at 20 percent and other races at 5 percent.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Mitt Romney won the district with 50 percent in 2012, ahead of Kirkpatrick\u2019s 49 percent victory as she reclaimed the seat she lost in the 2010 GOP wave. Redistricting created a friendlier seat for Democrats than before, and the Republican who ousted her in 2010, Rep. Paul Gosar, ran in the adjoining 4th District, providing her an opening to return to Congress.\n\nDespite a Democratic tilt in registration, many parts of the district are culturally conservative, and Kirkpatrick and her team see outreach to the tribes as key to victory.\n\n\"It\u2019s just getting them to vote. So you heard a lot on the campaign trail and on the parade route, we\u2019re telling people, \u2018Vote. Be sure to vote Nov. 4. Be sure and vote early,'\u201d she told CQ Roll Call, decked out in a turquoise leather jacket and traditional Navajo jewelry, after the parade.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it a great day to be a Democrat?\u201d campaign worker Ron Lee, who manned the Kirkpatrick float\u2019s microphone, asked repeatedly during the route. \u201cLet\u2019s re-elect Ann Kirkpatrick. You can vote early at the Tuba City Public Library, Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\"\n\nLee switched back and forth with the same message in Navajo and English as Kirkpatrick worked the crowd along Edgewater Drive and Indian Route 101.\n\nThe outreach is also why \u201cYa\u2019at\u2019eeh shi\u2019ke shi\u2019dine,\u201d a traditional Navajo greeting that translates roughly as \u201cHello, my relatives and the people,\u201d has become part of Kirkpatrick\u2019s stump vocabulary. She has also cut an ad in which she speaks Navajo.\n\nHer use of the Navajo language, even in small doses, is no small thing. The language of the Din\u00e9, as the Navajos call themselves, is an integral part of their culture.\n\nThe Navajo Code Talkers, who developed a code during World War II that stumped the Japanese Imperial Army, are revered here.\n\nRetired Sgt. Major Dan Akee, a 93-year-old whose float was featured in a prominent place toward the beginning of the parade, was greeted with some of the loudest cheers at the parade.\n\nLanguage is also at the center of the Navajo Nation\u2019s hotly contested race for tribal president. Chris Deschene is fighting a legal battle that ended up before the Navajo Supreme Court to stay on the ballot against his opponent, former President Joe Shirley. The issue? Deschene is accused of not being fluent in Navajo, a requirement of the office.\n\nDemocrats see the interest in the president\u2019s race, which has dominated tribal media coverage, as helpful to their turnout efforts.\n\nTobin\u2019s team acknowledges Kirkpatrick has an advantage in tribal areas, and while he has ventured to those regions for campaign events, his outreach there doesn't match Kirkpatrick's. But they believe their own turnout efforts, particularly in suburban Pinal and Pima counties, and dissatisfaction with President Barack Obama, give the state lawmaker the edge.\n\n\u201cThis is a referendum on Barack Obama. This is a referendum on her job performance and the policies she\u2019s stood behind,\u201d said Tobin campaign manager Bill Cortese.\n\n\u201cThe intensity on our side is much higher,\u201d Cortese said, adding that he didn\u2019t think the top of the Democratic ticket would help the congresswoman.\n\nThat\u2019s a point Democrats dispute. Their gubernatorial nominee, Fred DuVal, has run a quality campaign that has attracted cross-over endorsements, such as former state Attorney General Grant Woods. Their standard-bearers for secretary of state and superintendent of education, Terry Goddard and David Garcia, respectively, have better-than-even odds to win.\n\nNeither Kirkpatrick nor Tobin should suffer from a lack of name identification.\n\nAlthough Tobin\u2019s fundraising has lagged behind Kirkpatrick\u2019s, both sides are getting air cover from their respective campaign committees and outside groups.\n\nThe district only touches the border areas of Arizona\u2019s two largest cities, Phoenix and Tucson, but the campaigns and their allies are blanketing state airwaves with broadcast ads throughout the Phoenix market, which reaches into the district\u2019s Southern, Eastern and Northern areas.\n\nNational strategists expect it to be one of the most expensive House races.\n\nKirkpatrick\u2019s appeal to voters focuses on her district connections.\n\n\u201cMy family, both my mother\u2019s family and my dad\u2019s family, go back almost a hundred years in this district, so I have deep roots. I\u2019m well known from the day of birth practically, in this district, and they know that my heart is with them, and I care about them,\u201d she said.\n\nTobin, whose home of Paulden was placed into the 4th District in redistricting, has pledged to move into the district should he win. His old legislative district overlaps with the current congressional district, particularly in vote-rich Flagstaff and Sedona. His appeal to voters is focused on Obama and Kirkpatrick\u2019s link to his policies, such as her vote for the Affordable Care Act, which she has defended vigorously on the trail.\n\nWhichever strategy comes out on top is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a blowout either way,\u201d Cortese said.\n\nCorrection 5:45 p.m. An earlier version of this post misidentified the 1st District as the largest geographically that is not an at-large seat.
