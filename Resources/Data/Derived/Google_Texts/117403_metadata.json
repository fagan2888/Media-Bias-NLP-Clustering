As Santel explains, he didn\u2019t get into competitive eating to hurt himself.\n\nHowever, by consuming one meal a day that consists of more than 7,000 calories, that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing. To help preserve his health, Santel has taken appropriate steps, including an adequate amount of exercise and fiber supplements to make sure he\u2019s getting essential vitamins.\n\n\u201cWe follow Randy Santel \u2014 world-class professional eater and proud owner of FoodChallenges.com \u2014 during his month-long European tour where he takes on a new food challenge every day,\u201d the Munchies video description reads. \u201cIn London, Randy dominates Meat Liquor\u2019s Triple Chilli Challenge in a matter of minutes; then, he travels to seaside town Portsmouth to devour the Wicked Waffle challenge. But behind the gastro glory and YouTube fame, the life of a pro eater can be a lonely one.\u201d\n\nAlthough most nutritionists actually recommend a cheat meal once in a while, competitive eaters like Santel take the idea of a cheat meal to the extreme. Not only is he consuming upward of 8,000 calories from fried foods loaded with sugar and salt, but he\u2019s also doing so in one sitting at his fastest pace.\n\nTime will only tell if Santel\u2019s profession is causing any long-term health side effects.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "world, class, professional, eater, randy, santel, able, stay, fit, despite, rather, unhealthy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "World class competitive eater Randy Santel makes up for his unhealthy profession with constant exercise and nutrient supplementation.", "title": "Professional Eater Stays Fit While Consuming Stacks Of Junk Food [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/world-class-professional-eater-randy-santel-able-stay-fit-despite-rather-unhealthy-328462", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/08/randy-santel.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "World class competitive eater Randy Santel makes up for his unhealthy profession with constant exercise and nutrient supplementation.", "title": "Professional Eater Stays Fit While Consuming Stacks Of Junk Food [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/world-class-professional-eater-randy-santel-able-stay-fit-despite-rather-unhealthy-328462", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/08/randy-santel.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/randy-santel.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-08T11:42:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-08T11:42:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "World class competitive eater Randy Santel makes up for his unhealthy profession with constant exercise and nutrient supplementation."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd46e8\"", "article_summary": "World class professional eater Randy Santel knew exactly what he was getting into when he decided on his career path: a lot of calories from unhealthy food sources.\nTo help preserve his health, Santel has taken appropriate steps, including an adequate amount of exercise and fiber supplements to make sure he\u2019s getting essential vitamins.\n\u201cWe follow Randy Santel \u2014 world-class professional eater and proud owner of FoodChallenges.com \u2014 during his month-long European tour where he takes on a new food challenge every day,\u201d the Munchies video description reads.\nHowever, by consuming one meal a day that consists of more than 7,000 calories, that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing.\n\u201cIn London, Randy dominates Meat Liquor\u2019s Triple Chilli Challenge in a matter of minutes; then, he travels to seaside town Portsmouth to devour the Wicked Waffle challenge."}
