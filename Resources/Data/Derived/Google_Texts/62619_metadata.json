While more than 20 states allow the medical use of marijuana, only 10 states and Guam authorize doctors to prescribe it as treatment for PTSD.\n\n\u201cPost-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury can be more damaging and harmful than injuries that are visible from the outside,\u201d Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), a co-sponsor of the bill, told the Associated Press. Other co-sponsors include Reps. Sam Farr (D-CA), Jared Polis (D-CO), Justin Amash (R-MI), and Tom Reed (R-NY).\n\n\u201cAnd they can have a devastating effect on a veteran\u2019s family. We should be allowing these wounded veterans access to the medicine that will help them survive and thrive, including medical marijuana \u2014 not treating them like criminals and forcing them into the shadows. It\u2019s shameful,\u201d Blumenauer said.\n\nIf left untreated, PTSD can lead to substance abuse, anger management issues, and severe depression. In a 2014 national survey of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans, more than 60 percent of members of the Army, Marines, Air Force, and Navy said they have been diagnosed with PTSD or traumatic brain injuries. More than 30 percent of respondents also said that they have thought about taking their own life since joining the military.\n\nWhile mental health practitioners have hailed traditional medication as an effective means of providing relief to PTSD patients, many brands have been found to induce dependence, trigger diabetic symptoms, and intensify psychotic thoughts. Additionally, those who support alternative treatment options for PTSD have increasingly described the cocktail of pills given to patients as a panacea for the prevalent mental health issue, especially when not implemented in tandem with counseling.\n\nThis school of thought didn\u2019t develop by happenstance. In 2007, a panel of scientists commissioned by the federal government concluded that many Food and Drug Administration-approved PTSD medications \u2014 including Paxil and Zoloft \u2014 didn\u2019t treat the underlying causes of the mental disorder, primarily patients\u2019 exposure to traumatic events. In its report, the panel determined that exposure therapy \u2014 a technique that calls on patients to revisit traumatic events in their mind to help it lose its potency \u2014 proved more effective in helping military veterans deal with their mental anguish.\n\n\u201cIf a treatment that is not shown to be efficacious is nevertheless delivered to veterans, and if the treatment is relatively inert, even if it does not harm the veterans, it may demoralize the veteran,\u201d Richard McNally, a Harvard University psychologist and PTSD expert, told the Washington Post in 2007. \u201cProviding treatments that do not have a good basis in evidence can result in people not improving, therefore getting demoralized and therefore not seeking treatment that can actually help them.\u201d\n\nAlthough some anecdotal evidence suggests medical marijuana could mitigate symptoms of PTSD \u2014 including anxiety, nightmares, flashbacks, nausea, and muscle tension \u2014 little, if any, rigorous research has been conducted to determine the role the plant could play in helping those afflicted by the disorder.\n\nFederal restrictions on marijuana research, validated by the plant\u2019s designation as a Schedule I drug, have stunted researchers\u2019 efforts to legally study its effects on the human mind. Even with studies in other countries affirming marijuana\u2019s medical benefits, scientists contend that side effects of prolonged cannabis use \u2014 including short-term memory loss, impaired motor skills \u2014 further complicate the issue.\n\nHowever, a solution may be on the horizon. In March 2014, the federal government authorized the study of medical marijuana as a treatment option for those suffering from PTSD. Months after, a New Mexico study found that patients reported a 75 percent reduction in PTSD symptoms after using marijuana. In September of that year, Colorado and Minnesota started the process of setting up research programs that test cannabis\u2019 efficacy. These series of events have renewed hope among medical marijuana proponents that lawmakers will recognize its healing power, especially when it comes to military veterans.\n\n\u201cThe men and women who served in Iraq and Afghanistan have made tremendous sacrifices for our country,\u201d Dan Riffle, director of federal policies for Marijuana Policy Project, told the Associated Press. \u201cThey deserve every option available to treat their wounds, both visible and hidden.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "In states that have legalized medical marijuana, doctors may soon be able to prescribe it to military veterans suffering from PTSD.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "In states that have legalized medical marijuana, doctors may soon be able to prescribe it to military veterans suffering from PTSD.", "title": "Congress Considers Expanding War Vets\u2019 Access To Medical Marijuana", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/02/04/3619138/medical-marijuana-and-military-vets/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/u.s.-iraq.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In states that have legalized medical marijuana, doctors may soon be able to prescribe it to military veterans suffering from PTSD.", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/u.s.-iraq-321x214.jpg", "title": "Congress Considers Expanding War Vets\u2019 Access To Medical Marijuana", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/u.s.-iraq.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/u.s.-iraq.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-04T10:42:10+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce7ee\"", "article_summary": "These series of events have renewed hope among medical marijuana proponents that lawmakers will recognize its healing power, especially when it comes to military veterans.\nHealth Congress Considers Expanding War Vets\u2019 Access To Medical Marijuana CREDIT: APIf a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers have their way, doctors in states that have legalized medical marijuana will soon be able to recommend the plant to military veterans who suffer from serious injuries and a host of chronic conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nThe Veterans Equal Access Act \u2014 reintroduced in the House of Representatives on Tuesday \u2014 would give doctors in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) leeway in recommending the use of medical marijuana to military veterans.\nIn March 2014, the federal government authorized the study of medical marijuana as a treatment option for those suffering from PTSD.\nWe should be allowing these wounded veterans access to the medicine that will help them survive and thrive, including medical marijuana \u2014 not treating them like criminals and forcing them into the shadows."}
