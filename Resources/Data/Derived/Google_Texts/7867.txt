Technical climbers will continue to assist the Colorado Department of Transportation Monday in rockslide mitigation work on the Western Slope.

Climbers with Rigging for Rescue will rig ropes from the top of a steep slope, in an area known as Ruby Walls, south of Ouray, down toward U.S. 550, according to a CDOT media release.

Mitigation work will include using a helicopter to drop netting onto a scree field, possibly on Tuesday. Large boulders above the roadway will be moved or removed as part of the safety project.

Red Mountain Pass will be closed this week because of the work and motorists will use alternate routes.
