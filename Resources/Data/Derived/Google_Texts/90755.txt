UnitedHealthcare has become the third insurer to announce plans to sell federally subsidized health insurance in North Carolina.

The News & Observer of Raleigh reports the health insurer notified the N.C. Department of Insurance that it intends to sell subsidized coverage in the state under the Affordable Care Act. It filed its plans just days ahead of a Friday deadline for insurers to submit plans for federal certification.

Blue Cross is one of just two insurers in North Carolina that offer subsidized policies this year. The other is Coventry Health Care of the Carolinas. Both have notified state insurance officials that they plan to participate in the federal insurance exchange in 2015.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, UnitedHealthcare currently offers subsidized individual policies in just four states.
