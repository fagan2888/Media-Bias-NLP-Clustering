We'll look at John's record and his score,\" Club for Growth President David McIntosh told The Hill during a Tuesday breakfast sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor.\n\nReps. David Schweikert David SchweikertSenate races heating up Tea Party class reassesses record Lawmakers to DOD: Reject 'no touch' policy sought by 9/11 plotter MORE (R-Ariz.) and Matt Salmon Matt SalmonA hearing brought to tears over Right to Try legislation Time for national Right to Try legislation Ryan moves to cool Trump tensions MORE (R-Ariz.) have both told The Hill they're considering a challenge to McCain. Both Tea Party-leaning congressmen have been supported in the past by the group, which has also been critical of McCain.\n\n\"We'll see if either of the two members, you're right, they're people the Club's supported and thinks well of in Congress, does one of them decide to enter the race,\" McIntosh continued. \"We'll do research including polling and determine, is there a path to victory and is the money well spent? And by a path to victory, some institutions only engage in things when they're 90 percent sure will lead to victory. The Club is willing to take greater risk. ... So that'll be an assessment we do in Arizona if the race materializes.\"\n\nThe Club has long been the biggest player on the right in GOP House and Senate primaries, and has helped elect a number of conservative Republican senators, including Marco Rubio Marco RubioSenate GOP ties Iran sanctions fight to defense bill Analysis: Pa. senator missed most Budget Committee hearings Susana Martinez fires back at Trump MORE (Fla.), Rand Paul Rand PaulOvernight Defense: VA chief 'deeply' regrets Disney remark; Senate fight brews over Gitmo Paul ties release of 9/11 docs to defense bill Will Ted Cruz let it go?

He has already slammed former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a longtime foe of the organization.\n\n\"If history repeats itself, we won't be endorsing a candidate for president,\" he said.\n\nThe group has also taken the blame for backing primary challengers who flamed out in the general election \u2014 the Club helped defeat Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) in a primary in 2012, only to have its endorsed candidate, Richard Mourdock, blow the race against now-Sen. Joe Donnelly Joe DonnellyThis week: GOP lawmakers reckon with Trump Democrats block energy spending bill over Iran amendment GOP blocks Obama sanctions czar MORE (D-Ind.).\n\nMcIntosh said some of the other Republicans facing reelection that don't align completely with the organization aren't likely to face their wrath this time around.\n\nHe said, \"nobody from Illinois has come to us\" about challenging Sen. Mark Kirk Mark KirkGOP senators propose sending ISIS fighters to Gitmo VA chief 'deeply' regrets if Disney comment offended vets Senate GOP gears up for fight over Gitmo transfers MORE (R-Ill.) and that the organization's primary objective is making sure it makes a \"good investment\" in backing someone who can win a general election, a sign it's unlikely to play in Democratic Illinois.\n\nMcIntosh, a former Indiana congressman, also described establishment-leaning Sen.

Brian Sandoval is the GOP candidate, the Club would stay on the sidelines. The likely front-runner, if he runs, has come under fire from conservatives for tax hikes he's pushed in the state.\n\n\"Everything I'm hearing is, if he decided to run, it'd clear the field,\" McIntosh said. \"Because of his record of raising taxes, he'd be someone the Club would not engage in supporting and use the resources for others.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Fiscally conservative group \"willing to take risk,\" new president David McIntosh says.", "description": "Fiscally conservative group \"willing to take risk,\" new president David McIntosh says.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Fiscally conservative group \"willing to take risk,\" new president David McIntosh says.", "title": "Club for Growth may back a McCain primary challenger", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/231573-club-for-growth-president-says-they-may-back-primary-against", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/2014-05-13-gn-mccain_john-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T04:47-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/231573-club-for-growth-president-says-they-may-back-primary-against", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-03T11:18-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cameron Joseph", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Cameron Joseph", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "John McCain, Club for Growth,David Schweikert, Joe Donnelly, John McCain, Matt Salmon, Marco Rubio, Harry Reid, Dan Coats, Mark Kirk, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-03T11:18:31-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/231573-club-for-growth-president-says-they-may-back-primary-against", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Fiscally conservative group \"willing to take risk,\" new president David McIntosh says.", "card": "summary", "title": "Club for Growth may back a McCain primary challenger"}, "dcterms.title": "Club for Growth may back a McCain primary challenger"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd00a4\"", "article_summary": "The group has also taken the blame for backing primary challengers who flamed out in the general election \u2014 the Club helped defeat Sen.
