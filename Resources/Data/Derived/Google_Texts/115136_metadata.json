In Pennsylvania, Highmark Health Insurance Co. is asking for a 30 percent increase.\n\nThe preliminary requests were announced as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on the validity of ObamaCare\u2019s tax credits to offset the cost of premiums for lower-income consumers in most states in the country.\n\nIndividual health insurance policies are a relatively small slice of the overall market. Many more people are insured through an employer. And it is not clear whether any of these preliminary rate hikes will stick.\n\nRegulators in many states have the power to reject price increases, and many who don't are expected to at least pressure insurers to soften their plans. Health insurance price hikes have been the subject of growing scrutiny for years.\n\nHealth insurance experts say it's tough to draw broad conclusions about prices from the requests released Monday. The health care law only requires insurers to report proposed hikes of 10 percent or more. That's only a partial picture of the market that tilts toward a worst-case scenario.\n\n\"It's hard to generalize, but that said, I think all signs are pointing to bigger premium increases than in 2015,\" Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation told the Associated Press.\n\nLevitt said part of the reason is that insurers will be basing their 2016 premiums on a full year's worth of cost or claims data. That's the first time that has happened for plans sold on the overhaul's public insurance exchanges, which started enrolling customers in the fall of 2013.\n\nRates for 2015, for instance, were set based on only a few months of data collected last spring. Insurers normally want to see a couple years of claims from a patient population before they set rates.\n\nHigher-than-expected costs were the main reason behind the hike sought by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, which was allowed to impose a 13.5 percent increase for this year. The insurer cited the costs of emergency room use, heart and cancer treatments and the cost of specialty drugs treating hepatitis C in its rate justification filed with federal regulators.\n\nSome insurers may be seeking what seems like a sizeable rate increase because they charged much less than the competition for this year, said Catherine Murphy-Barron, vice president of health with the American Academy of Actuaries.\n\n\"The increase is not the right thing to be looking at, it's the general level of the premiums of everyone in that market at that tier,\" she said.\n\nInsurers will spend the next several weeks talking to regulators about their premiums before rates are finalized later this summer. The companies will have better data to back up their request for hikes, but that might mean little if they are negotiating with a regulator determined to hold down prices, said Dave Axene of the Society of Actuaries.\n\n\"Even if you have all the evidence in the world, it's not a friendly environment at times,\" said Axene, an actuary who helped insurers in several states set prices for 2016.\n\nConsumers should start learning how rates may change for their specific plan by early October.\n\nThat will give them several weeks to shop for the best deal before Nov. 15, which is when people can start signing up for coverage.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nClick for more from The Wall Street Journal.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-06-02 03:18:21 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "Dozens of health insurers selling plans under ObamaCare have requested hefty premium increases for 2016, according to preliminary information published Monday by the White House.", "twitter": {"description": "Dozens of health insurers selling plans under ObamaCare have requested hefty premium increases for 2016, according to preliminary information published Monday by the White House.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/02/health-insurers-ask-for-big-premium-hikes-for-obamacare-plans-in-20160.html", "title": "Health insurers seek big premium hikes for ObamaCare plans in 2016", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Health insurers seek big premium hikes for ObamaCare plans in 2016\",\"image_url\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-06-02T07:02:04Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/02/health-insurers-ask-for-big-premium-hikes-for-obamacare-plans-in-20160.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"5bf6e51f-defb-4d32-8b15-8e42ac295db1\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "Dozens of health insurers selling plans under ObamaCare have requested hefty premium increases for 2016, according to preliminary information published Monday by the White House.", "dc.identifier": "5bf6e51f-defb-4d32-8b15-8e42ac295db1", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "healthcare", "description": "Dozens of health insurers selling plans under ObamaCare have requested hefty premium increases for 2016, according to preliminary information published Monday by the White House.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Health Insurers Seek Big Premium Hikes For Obamacare Plans In 2016", "dcterms.created": "2015-06-02 03:18:21 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Dozens of health insurers selling plans under ObamaCare have requested hefty premium increases for 2016, according to preliminary information published Monday by the White House.", "title": "Health insurers seek big premium hikes for ObamaCare plans in 2016 | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/02/health-insurers-ask-for-big-premium-hikes-for-obamacare-plans-in-20160.html", "image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2015-06-02", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Health insurers seek big premium hikes for ObamaCare plans in 2016\",\"image_url\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-06-02T07:02:04Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/02/health-insurers-ask-for-big-premium-hikes-for-obamacare-plans-in-20160.html\",\"post_id\":\"5bf6e51f-defb-4d32-8b15-8e42ac295db1\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ada\"", "article_summary": "Dozens of health insurers selling plans under ObamaCare have requested hefty premium increases for 2016, according to preliminary information published Monday by the White House.\nHealth insurance experts say it's tough to draw broad conclusions about prices from the requests released Monday.\nHealth insurance price hikes have been the subject of growing scrutiny for years.\nIn Pennsylvania, Highmark Health Insurance Co. is asking for a 30 percent increase.\nIndividual health insurance policies are a relatively small slice of the overall market."}
