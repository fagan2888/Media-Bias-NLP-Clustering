Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in my opinion.\n\nA national Reuters poll, released Friday, showed Trump\u2019s support has tumbled 12 percentage points since making controversial, indefensible remarks about the Nov. 13 Paris terrorist attacks.\n\nTrump suggested he would support a special database requiring Muslims to register with the government, a revolting idea to critics who likened it to registration of Jews in Nazi Germany.\n\nIt\u2019s been an embarrassing, if initially successful, campaign for Trump, the self-absorbed New York businessman who bullied his way past Republican candidates with performances based on little more than, \u201cI want to make our country great again.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s insults, designed to inflame right-wing passions, have started to weaken his candidacy. While he\u2019ll maintain a core of support, Republicans know they cannot nominate a fascist-leaning narcissist for president unless they want Hillary and Bill Clinton in the White House for another four years.\n\nThe novelty of Trump\u2019s sharp tongue was somewhat refreshing and entertaining to eager supporters when he first announced his candidacy. To separate himself from the field, he unleashed racial, sexual and religious insults that made everyone gasp. The severity of your reaction to his politically incorrect meltdowns depended on your politics and humanity.\n\nThe candidate best positioned to pick up Trump\u2019s pieces and win the nomination seems to be Cruz, the strongest remaining outsider in the jam-packed but weak Republican field.\n\nCruz qualifies as an outsider because he\u2019s been harshly critical of current GOP leadership, which has presided over a do-nothing Congress and failed to turn back mandates and legislation pushed by President Barack Obama such as Obamacare and illegal immigration.\n\nRepublican voters do not want an establishment candidate this time around.\n\nThat\u2019s why Ben Carson did well until falling apart on foreign policy and basic understanding of simple science. The retired brain surgeon turned out to be a head case.\n\nThat\u2019s why Trump caught fire until he started exaggerating stories about seeing victims leap to their deaths from the Twin Towers from his New York penthouse four miles away and watching as Muslims in New Jersey cheered the attacks. Most establishment Republicans admit they\u2019re afraid of nominating Trump, knowing such a decision would hand Clinton the keys to the Oval Office.\n\nIn reality, it\u2019s not going to happen for Trump.\n\nThere\u2019s going to be massive GOP campaigns to drive Trump\u2019s poll numbers down even further. He\u2019ll be flogged in attack ads leading up to the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primaries. He\u2019ll be decimated with gang tackles in debates by his remaining rivals.\n\nThe Reuters poll showed Trump dropping from 43 percent support on Nov. 22 to 31 percent on Nov. 27, a five-day nosedive reminiscent of fluctuating GOP fickleness in 2012. Back then, at least five candidates \u2014 Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain and Rick Santorum \u2014 led in polls before former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney pulled away.\n\nThat\u2019s why politicos will be looking for fast-rising stars between now and February. Gov. Jeb Bush, the establishment favorite, has fallen so low, he can\u2019t get up. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida does not have outsider appeal of Cruz. Others have no chance at this juncture.\n\nIt appears Cruz is ready for his closeup.\n\nCruz\u2019s famous, liberal Harvard lawyer professor, Alan Dershowitz, says Cruz was among the smartest students he ever taught. And Cruz has been biding his time before facing off with Trump. Cruz created a bromance with Trump early in the campaign while others faced withering assaults from the unpredictable billionaire.\n\nIf Cruz wins in Iowa, and polls seem to be shifting that way, other Republican candidates will rally around him. The stakes are too high if Trump gets the nomination.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe Donald is going to be the nominee, and I think, in time, the lion\u2019s share of his supporters end up with us,\u201d Cruz said in an interview with a New York talk show host.\n\nThe final question remains. What will Trump do in response to the personal attacks and his eventual crash? His history in business suggests he will fight back and exhaust every resource.\n\nIf he feels slighted, Trump might mount an independent campaign, despite an earlier promise not to bolt the party. A third-party candidacy would devastate Republicans and guarantee Clinton\u2019s election.\n\nI\u2019ve always maintained Trump was destined to be Ross Perot on steroids. Perot, a Texas billionaire, waged independent bids for the presidency in 1992 and 1996, actually leading in early 1992 polls until being exposed as somewhat of a crackpot.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump might accept a loss to Cruz, who holds views close to Trump on the economy and immigration. Cruz would be a better alternative to The Donald than Bush, Carson and Rubio, who have been obliterated by Trump in debates and his criticisms to media.\n\nA picture of Trump as a gracious loser has never been taken. He has trouble even admitting when he\u2019s wrong, as when he mocked a reporter for his disability and when he suggested a female Fox News reporter was menstruating for asking a tough question. Trump does not have the capacity to apologize.\n\nIf Trump were to listen to reason, he would moderate his bluster and stop insulting everyone who moves. He would spend every available resource proving he\u2019s not a monster, or fascist, emerging from under the bed.\n\nI can\u2019t think of another candidate who scared the electorate more. Thinking back, the only other major candidate would be Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. President Lyndon B. Johnson sailed to re-election then after Democrats portrayed Goldwater as having an itchy nuclear trigger finger during the height of the Cold War.\n\nTrump vs. Cruz will be the heavyweight fight in 2016 the Republicans have asked to see. They\u2019re two outsiders pushing their way into the conversation, one with the money to make it nasty and the other with a rising star, smarts and savvy to hold his ground.\n\n\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6\n\nJames Bennett is editor of The Daily Herald.
