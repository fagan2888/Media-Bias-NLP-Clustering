The GOP has held the seat since early 1981, and that likely won\u2019t change this November.\n\nThis year\u2019s Democratic challenger is hoping to make inroads by positioning herself as a moderate alternative on issues such as the economy and natural resources.\n\nThe state\u2019s 2nd Congressional District is a massive hunk of real estate covering the entire state east of the Cascades and curving to include the Interstate 5 corridor in the far south. The distances between people and places are wide \u2013 which is how you could describe Congressman Greg Walden\u2019s margin of victory in the past eight elections\n\n\u201cHe never takes an election for granted,\u201d says Wayne Vos, one of dozens of Walden supporters filling a small banquet hall recently at the Scottish Rite Center in Medford. \u201cHe\u2019s out there working. Problem solver. Just basically the kind of guy you\u2019d like living next door.\u201d\n\nAt the campaign event, Rep. Walden good-naturedly ribs Vos for wearing the opposing team\u2019s colors \u2013 a blue shirt and hat. Still, Vos walks out with a large yard sign supporting Walden, who has reached a level of prominence in the Republican controlled House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cThere are only eight members of the House who have passed more of their own bills than I have, and nearly every one of them is a full committee chair,\u201d Walden says.\n\nDavid Blanchard\n\nThis success in the House, Walden\u2019s experience and the fact that none of his challengers has ever received more than 35 percent of the vote has catapulted him into the high ranks of Republican Party leadership. Walden chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee. He\u2019s tasked with getting GOP candidates around the country elected to the House of Representatives \u2013 not something you can do if you need to run a tough campaign back home.\n\nNow enter challenger Aelea Christofferson of Bend, who\u2019s positioning herself as a middle-of-the-road Democrat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably the most centrist candidate this district has ever had,\u201d she says.\n\nChristofferson talks up her 23 years of business experience at a campaign stop with the Ashland Main Street Alliance, a progressive-leaning group of business owners.\n\ncampaign photo\n\nShe says the federal government can cause problems for small businesses. It\u2019s an issue fresh in her mind. The sale of her own company to another business had been delayed more than six months because of hold-ups at the Small Business Administration.\n\n\u201cA business that would have produced more jobs since February because of the combination of our two companies, instead we\u2019ve had an opening for a while, because I keep thinking I shouldn\u2019t fill this opening,\u201d Christofferson says. \u201cI should have the new owner do this hire.\u201d\n\nThis pro-business lens is something she shares with the incumbent, as well as the desire for more local control when it comes to Oregon\u2019s natural resources. Much of the economy of the 2nd District is directly linked to the land \u2013 industries like agriculture, ranching and forestry. Rep. Walden has co-sponsored legislation that would increase timber harvests and bring some federal lands under state control.\n\nWalden: \u201cI think we could show the country how to do it better than what we\u2019re seeing out of the Forest Service and the federal laws, that leave us with inaction. That leave us with overstocked, bug-infested, diseased stands of trees that are dying, and they just burn up and nothing happens after that.\u201d\n\nChristofferson: \u201cThere\u2019s probably not a huge amount of light between Walden and I on what we believe about that.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates also support the work of forest restoration collaboratives, models of local decision-making where communities have a stake in how their forests are used.\n\nBut Christofferson has worked to distinguish herself from Walden on social issues, civil rights and health care. She served as a board member of Cover Oregon, the state\u2019s troubled health insurance marketplace established under the Affordable Care Act. And she defends its achievements, something she\u2019s taken a lot of flack about on the campaign trail.\n\nWhile some would like to see Christofferson push further to the left, her centrist strategy and business connections have allowed her to raise more money than Libertarian candidate Sharon Durbin - for that matter, more money than any Democratic challenger in recent history. But it\u2019s still a paltry $110,000 to Walden\u2019s $3.2 million as of the end of September.\n\nDespite the money gap, Deschutes County Democratic Party Chair Laurie Gould says by making a strong showing now, Christofferson is forcing Walden to talk about issues affecting the 2nd District.\n\n\u201cTo have a credible, positive candidate like Aelea sort of opens the door to get more attention from the Democratic Congressional Committee so that they see she\u2019s viable, that she\u2019s got a chance at the seat,\u201d Gould says. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping she\u2019s viewing this as a long-term process and will challenge Walden again.\u201d\n\nIn a district where there are more independent and third party voters than there are registered Democrats, Gould says it would be a symbolic victory for Christofferson to pull 40 percent of the vote. But even that would mean convincing scores of independents to give up on the candidate they\u2019ve largely supported for the past eight terms.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.opb.org/news/article/democratic-businesswoman-faces-uphill-climb-in-oregons-republican-leaning-2nd-district/", "image": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,h_300,q_90,w_400/ORDistrict2-Credit-USGS_tzbeyq.jpg", "description": "Oregon\u2019s 2nd Congressional District is a Republican stronghold, but this year\u2019s Democratic challenger is hoping to make inroads.", "title": "Democratic Businesswoman Faces Uphill Climb In Oregon's Republican-Leaning 2nd District"}, "twitter": {"description": "<p>Oregon&rsquo;s 2nd Congressional District is a Republican stronghold.
