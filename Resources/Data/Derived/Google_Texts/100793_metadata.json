There were no injuries, for instance.\n\nIn fact, the Avs got some good news regarding one player\u2019s health. Tomas Vincour, who played his first game of the season for the Avs Saturday, spent his time after the contest getting X-rays on his left foot. He took a shot off the foot in the third period against Carolina and didn\u2019t return, but the film showed that things were fine, other than a bruise, and he practiced Sunday.\n\nOtherwise, it was an optional practice, and several players exercised their choice to sit it out.\n\nCoach Patrick Roy even took the practice off, and also the day from reporters. That left the question unanswered as to whom will start in goal for the Avs\u2019 next game, Tuesday in Arizona.\n\nWill it be rookie Calvin Pickard, who earned his first career victory in relief of Reto Berra against Carolina, or will Roy give Berra another chance despite allowing six goals on the last 36 shots faced?\n\nWe\u2019ll know definitively the answer to that question after practice Monday.\n\nAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or twitter.com/adater", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Will Calvin Pickard start Tuesday\u2019s game for the Colorado Avalanche?", "title": "Will Calvin Pickard start Tuesday\u2019s game for the Colorado Avalanche?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/23/will-calvin-pickard-start-tuesdays-game-for-the-colorado-avalanche/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141123__42d585ee0d0c342e660f6a7067004c43p1.jpg", "height": 441}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141123__42d585ee0d0c342e660f6a7067004c43p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-23T13:24:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:07:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd181e\"", "article_summary": "That left the question unanswered as to whom will start in goal for the Avs\u2019 next game, Tuesday in Arizona.\nTomas Vincour, who played his first game of the season for the Avs Saturday, spent his time after the contest getting X-rays on his left foot.\nCoach Patrick Roy even took the practice off, and also the day from reporters.\nIt was a quiet day at Avalanche practice, which was probably a good thing.\nWe\u2019ll know definitively the answer to that question after practice Monday."}
