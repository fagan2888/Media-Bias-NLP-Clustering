It’s a little like an election: Most people don’t focus on it until they prepare to vote. Now that the new health care exchanges are about to open, potential buyers of the new plans are trying to understand the law. Your Money columnist Tara Siegel Bernard has answers to some of the most perplexing questions and is standing by to answer more from readers. You can find her full column here.

Here are a few:

Q. How can I find out if my doctor accepts exchange-based insurance?

A. Many insurance providers’ networks of doctors and hospitals will be narrower than typically found in commercial insurance, as my colleague reported earlier this week. Just because your doctor accepts, say, a Blue Cross plan provided by your employer doesn’t necessarily mean the doctor will take the same carrier’s plan offered on the exchange.

The plans will be required to provide a directory of their providers, so inspect them carefully.

Q. How will I know if my drugs are covered by the plans?

A. The exchanges must include a summary of benefits and coverage for each plan, including information about co-payments for generic, brand-name and specialty drugs. There should also be a Web link to the plan’s list of covered drug.

Q. If I have employer-based coverage, can I go to the exchange for coverage?

A. You can, but you probably won’t want to. Your employer’s plan is usually a better deal. Many employers heavily subsidize your premiums and you can pay for your coverage using pretax dollars, something you can’t do if you buy coverage on the exchange.
