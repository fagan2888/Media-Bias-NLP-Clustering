He now has 652 delegates and needs 585 more to win the Republican nomination.\n\nIf you want to understand the upset that is occurring in American politics, you need to read Lawrence Lindsey\u2019s new book, \u201cConspiracies of the Ruling Class: How to Break Their Grip Forever,\u201d just out from Simon & Schuster. Lindsey and I served in the White House at the same time under both presidents Bush, and his was always a voice worth hearing and an opinion worth considering.\n\nLindsey uses the term \u201cruling class\u201d to describe the establishment that is generating so much anger among voters today. He provides a history of the ruling class from America\u2019s beginnings to the present. He does not mention Trump, Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders or other presidential candidates. But the anger he describes has resulted in Trump\u2019s unprecedented victories.\n\nPresident Obama has used executive action to modify Obamacare, at the same time that he has prevented Congress from making any changes.\n\nLindsey\u2019s book could not have come at a better time. Trump is distancing himself from the ruling class by his behavior and picking up angry voters in the process. He is trying to shock people by making statements that are foreign to normal politicians. Politicians don\u2019t belittle women or Sen. John McCain\u2019s heroism. Trump openly disregards the rules. The other non-politicians in the race, neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, behaved in a more normal fashion but did not garner sufficient support to stay in the race.\n\nEscape from the ruling class\n\nAmerica was born in anger against the British ruling class. The Founding Fathers suffered from British directives, such as the infamous Stamp Tax, and constructed a system of checks and balances with the goal of flattening power and broadly distributing it.\n\nJohn Adams criticized laws that were, according to Lindsey, \u201cso broad, so vague, and their enforcement so dominated by political correctness, that they mock the concept of the rule of law.\u201d History repeats itself. Obamacare, a prime example of such a law, has been changed over 40 times. The Environmental Protection Agency has broadened its jurisdiction over America\u2019s water far beyond the original navigable waters test in the Clean Water Act.\n\nJohn Hancock\u2019s wine, along with his boat, named \u201cLiberty,\u201d were seized because he was suspected of smuggling wine, even though none was ever found. That\u2019s similar to the asset seizure that goes on throughout the United States now, when, according to Lindsey, \u201cit seems that your money is theirs for the taking even if you are innocent.\u201d Lindsey cites the case of Lyndon McLellan, a convenience-store owner in Fairmont, N.C., whose life\u2019s savings, $107,000, were stolen by the Internal Revenue Service in 2014 even though he was charged with no crime. The IRS, facing intense pressure, ended up dismissing the case.\n\nThe Founding Fathers were so concerned about abuse of power that the first American government was not given enough central authority to operate. The second government was limited by the Constitution, which was written in plain English so everyone could read it.\n\nThe Constitution contained transparent rules by which the government operated. Its enumerated powers were designed to prevent abuse by the ruling classes. It limited what the government could do and gave states the power to act on their own. The end result was layers of defense against government becoming too big or powerful.\n\n\n\nThe end of limited government\n\nThat system worked for a while, but Lindsey shows how it has disintegrated. When the government limits competition, the executive branch exceeds its power and the judicial branch abandons the Constitution, the ruling class wins. The core ruling class principle is that normal people cannot manage their own lives; only government can do it for them.\n\nThe modern ruling class believes that \u201cthey are superior beings placed on earth to be its rulers.\u201d Now they call themselves \u201cprogressives.\u201d Their talk about \u201csocial justice\u201d is an attempt to manipulate people through coercion. They justify their control of most societal institutions through their alleged intellectual superiority. They believe in silencing their opponents, by not allowing them to speak on campuses, as happened to Somali-born American scholar Ayaan Hirsi Ali when she was invited to Yale University.\n\nToday, ruling class members Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, and Attorney General Loretta Lynch want to use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) to silence those who do not believe that climate change is man-made. Lynch has referred the case to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s criminal division.\n\nRuling class member President Obama has used executive action to modify Obamacare, at the same time that he has prevented Congress from making any changes. The program was not ready, so he changed the start date to 2015 from 2014. For some small businesses, he changed it to 2016. The president is taking his own road on immigration enforcement, even though he said in a Univision Town Hall in March 2011: \u201cWith respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that\u2019s just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed.\u201d\n\n\n\nVoters protest the ruling class\n\nLindsey points out that despite its power grab, the ruling class has not been that successful. That\u2019s one reason voters are angry. In the name of political correctness, it has ruined America\u2019s public school and higher education systems. Schools hire math teachers who have majored in education, not math teachers who have degrees in math. Despite attempts at redistribution, the ruling class has failed to reduce income inequality. It has mismanaged the country\u2019s finances, leaving young people with no hope of collecting Social Security.\n\nThe book could use an index, and some editor should have told Lindsey that \u201cruling class\u201d takes a singular verb, not a plural one. But those are minor quibbles.\n\n\u201cConspiracies of the Ruling Class\u201d is immensely valuable because it shows clearly why people are fed up with status quo and political correctness, and are rising up to throw off the establishment shackles, like the first Americans revolting against Britain. Time will tell if history will repeat itself and we will succeed.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiana Furchtgott-Roth is a senior fellow and director of Economics21 at the Manhattan Institute.
