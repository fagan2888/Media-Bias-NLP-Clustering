Ron is a thoughtful man of strong character and faith who has served our country in the military and who is dedicated to restoring America\u2019s founding principles,\u201d said Dr. Carson. \u201cIn the Senate, he will fight for the Constitution and for a strong national defense. He knows we must repeal ObamaCare, protect life and defend religious freedom. Floridians don\u2019t need to guess if Ron DeSantis will fight to change Washington \u2013 all you have to do is look at his proven conservative record. I urge all of my supporters in Florida to do everything they can to elect him. Ron DeSantis has my vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to receive the support of Dr. Carson, who has inspired millions of Americans with his incomparable life story and hopeful vision for America\u2019s future,\u201d said DeSantis. \u201cDr. Carson has been a clear and consistent voice regarding the need to repeal ObamaCare and restore the Constitution. Dr. Carson\u2019s support will magnify the fact that I\u2019m the only candidate in this race with a proven record of standing up to the permanent political class in Washington. In Congress, I declined a pension, fought for term limits, and rejected special treatment for members of Congress under ObamaCare. In the Senate, I\u2019ll continue to fight to make sure Washington lives under the same rules as everybody else.\u201d\n\nDeSantis, who faces a competitive primary to replace Marco Rubio against Carlos Lopez-Cantera, David Jolly, Carlos Beruff, and Todd Wilcox, has combined a strong fundraising operation, savvy political moves, and grassroots outreach to catapult to the first tier of the race for the GOP nomination.\n\nCarson, however, is an especially important endorsement.\n\nA March poll showed enthusiasm for a hypothetical Carson candidacy among a staggering 56 percent of Republican voters.\n\nCarson, however, has disclaimed interest in a Senate run. And Thursday\u2019s key endorsement shows that DeSantis aligns with his vision for the GOP.\n\nOf course, DeSantis\u2019 opponents have their own takes.\n\nThe Carson endorsement played into the ongoing back and forth between the Florida GOP Senate campaigns of Reps. David Jolly and DeSantis.\n\n\u201cDr. Ben Carson says \u2018Floridians don\u2019t need to guess if Ron DeSantis will fight to change Washington.\u2019 I\u2019m not so sure about that, Doctor,\u201d said Jolly\u2019s spokesperson, Max Goodman, who also sent along a Friends of David Jolly 41 second digital ad asserting that DeSantis is \u201cpart of the problem\u201c in Washington D.C.\n\nThe ad begins with the stentorian voice of DeSantis addressing supporters, saying that \u201cthe difference is when you get up there, are you going to do what you say you were going to do, or are you going to drink the Kool-Aid and start to become part of the problem.\u201d\n\nFrom there, DeSantis\u2019 voice cuts out, and a series of damning headlines that imply that the Ponte Vedra Republican has become part of the \u201cproblem.\u201d\n\nThe ad hits DeSantis for attending the Koch Brothers\u2019 \u201cbig money conclave in California,\u201d for having skipped House votes to \u201ccampaign in Vegas,\u201d for carrying the most debt in the Senate race, and for sometimes prioritizing fundraising over making votes.\n\nThe spot closes with a graphic promoting the Stop Act, authored by Jolly, which would preclude officeholders from fundraising. DeSantis, who has been the most active fundraiser on the Republican side, obviously diverges from Jolly\u2019s position.\n\nThe video is below:\n\nRelated\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ben carson, ron desantis", "generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 5.1.6 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface.", "og": {"site_name": "SaintPetersBlog", "description": "GOP Senate candidate\u00a0Ron DeSantis scored a major national endorsement Thursday, in the form of\u00a0Dr. Ben Carson, whose name was linked \u2026", "title": "Ben Carson endorses Ron DeSantis for U.S. Senate - SaintPetersBlog", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://saintpetersblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ben-carson-11_9-Large.jpg", "height": 1080}, "updated_time": "2016-04-14T13:58:11-04:00", "url": "http://saintpetersblog.com/ben-carson-endorses-ron-desantis-u-s-senate/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 2500, "app_id": 593344034036788}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SaintPetersblog", "tag": "Ron Desantis", "published_time": "2016-04-14T13:55:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T13:58:11-04:00"}, "theme-color": "#081341"}, "article_summary": "GOP Senate candidate Ron DeSantis scored a major national endorsement Thursday, in the form of Dr. Ben Carson, whose name was linked with a potential Senate run weeks back.\n\u201cI am pleased to endorse Ron DeSantis for U.S. Senate.\nRon DeSantis has my vote.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to receive the support of Dr. Carson, who has inspired millions of Americans with his incomparable life story and hopeful vision for America\u2019s future,\u201d said DeSantis.\nFloridians don\u2019t need to guess if Ron DeSantis will fight to change Washington \u2013 all you have to do is look at his proven conservative record.\nThe Carson endorsement played into the ongoing back and forth between the Florida GOP Senate campaigns of Reps.
