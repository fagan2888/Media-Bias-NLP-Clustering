It is necessary to cover \u201cmuch higher than expected medical costs for these members.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt HMSA, we understand the frustration of rising health care costs,\u201d HMSA President and CEO Michael Gold said in the statement. \u201cOur decision to ask for this premium increase was truly difficult.\u201d\n\nHMSA said it explored alternatives for a smaller premium but was determined it necessary to ask for the increase for the following reasons:\n\n- Almost everyone in Hawaii already has health insurance from their employer, Med-QUEST, or Medicare, and \u201cthe small number of people left without coverage often had serious health conditions. Many of these previously uninsured people purchased our ACA plans.\u201d\n\n- The plans began in 2014 and are still new. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve been able to price these plans using actual claims and health information from these members. We\u2019ve learned many of these members are using substantially more medical services and prescription drugs than we expected. Now we have a much clearer understanding of the true cost of caring for these members.\u201d\n\n- Several thousand members from the Compact of Free Association (COFA), originally on Medicaid, purchased individual ACA health plans from HMSA this year. \u201cThese members came to us from the state Med-QUEST program and we\u2019re honored to serve them. However, many of these members have conditions that will likely require intensive medical services and expensive prescription drugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ACA has helped thousands of Hawaii residents get health coverage. That\u2019s good for the well-being of our state,\u201d Gold said in the prepared statement. \u201cBut it comes with a price that we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe\u2019re not alone in asking for a large individual ACA plan rate increase. Other health plans around the country are reporting premium requests as high as 51 percent.\u201d\n\nState Insurance Commissioner Gordon Ito said the proposed increase for the individual plan is the highest ever requested by HMSA. He added the request will be closely scrutinized.\n\n\u201cThe Insurance Division will actively seek reductions to the proposed request, where possible, to ensure fairness to all parties involved,\u201d Ito said. \u201cIf medical expenditures paid out for healthcare services under the ACA individual plan are too high, the division\u2019s ability to drastically reduce this requested increase will be limited.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "State Wire,News, topnews,", "og": {"site_name": "West Hawaii Today", "description": "The Hawaii Medical Service Association is proposing to increase its rates by an average of 49.1 percent for individual Affordable Care Act health plans in 2016.", "title": "HMSA requests 49.1 percent rate hike for Affordable Care Act plans", "url": "http://westhawaiitoday.com/news/state-wire/hmsa-requests-491-percent-rate-hike-affordable-care-act-plans", "image": "http://westhawaiitoday.com/sites/westhawaiitoday.com/files/field/image/1822000_web1_HMSA-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Hawaii Medical Service Association is proposing to increase its rates by an average of 49.1 percent for individual Affordable Care Act health plans in 2016.", "viewport": "width=100%, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd22cc\"", "article_summary": "Many of these previously uninsured people purchased our ACA plans.\u201d- The plans began in 2014 and are still new.\nThe Hawaii Medical Service Association is proposing to increase its rates by an average of 49.1 percent for individual Affordable Care Act health plans in 2016.\nHMSA, the state\u2019s largest health insurer, in a statement released Monday said that the rate hike would affect about three percent of its membership.\n\u201cBut it comes with a price that we\u2019re seeing now.\u201dHe continued, \u201cWe\u2019re not alone in asking for a large individual ACA plan rate increase.\nWe\u2019ve learned many of these members are using substantially more medical services and prescription drugs than we expected."}
