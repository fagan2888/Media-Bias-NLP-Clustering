The concerned mother worries other families with tighter budgets may have made a fatal choice by postponing a simple blood test.\n\n\u201cThey told me she would have gotten so sick she wouldn't have been able to get out of bed. And at that point we would have brought her in and at that point it might have been too late,\u201d said Dyskant.\n\nAccording to Richard Gottfried, the health care system is better since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act, but it's still fatally flawed.\n\n\u201c\u2026and so we continue to see rising premiums, deductibles that are out of sight, co-payments, narrow, restricted provider networks.\u201d\n\nGottfried puts the blame square on the shoulders of insurance companies, who he'd like to see out of the state\u2019s health care process.\n\n\u201cNot so fast!\u201d warn opponents to universal health care.\n\nWhile Gottfried blames much of the bloated costs in the system on insurance overhead, Michael King, Principal at Century Benefits Group, argues the real costs are in the number of claims.\n\nOpponents say when everyone has easy access to health care, more people will use it. America\u2019s increasing life expectancy will result in more demand on health care says King.\n\n\u201cPeople want all the new technologies to keep them living longer. That does cost money.\u201d\n\nThe New York Health Act would pay for itself through a mix of federal dollars that currently fund programs like Medicaid and Medicare and a tax based on income.\n\nKing doubts the system would go far enough to cover the costs, and says the state government isn\u2019t equipped to take on the role as New York's only insurer.\n\n\u201cLarge government organizations are not efficient enough to handle a task of this size, especially in New York State,\u201d said King.\n\nOther opponents are concerned a larger system will create more potential fraud.\n\nStill, the majority of the testimony at the hearing centered on a desire to build a more equitable system that doesn\u2019t force consumers to juggle the concerns of cost and health.\n\nBarbara Dyskant daughter\u2019s leukemia is in remission, but continues to press for universal health care in New York State. She wants the reassurance that her daughter will have health coverage if her cancer returns, but Dyskant also worries for others in her same situation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them to have it any worse than her. I don\u2019t want people whose husbands\u2019 don\u2019t have jobs to have any less right to health than my girl,\u201d said Dyskant.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Barbara Dyskant joined 30 others who signed up to testify at a hearing in Rochester organized by Richard Gottfried, chair of the Assembly Health Committee.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wxxinews.org/post/supporters-universal-health-care-make-their-case-rochester", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wxxi/files/styles/medium/public/201412/SinglePayer.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Barbara Dyskant joined 30 others who signed up to testify at a hearing in Rochester organized by Richard Gottfried, chair of the Assembly Health Committee.", "title": "Supporters of Universal Health Care Make Their Case in Rochester"}, "story_id": 369415574, "twitter": {"site": "@wxxinews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@michereports"}, "author": "Michelle Faust", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Supporters of Universal Health Care Make Their Case in Rochester"}, "nid": 23832, "datePublished": "2014-12-08", "keywords": "understanding the affordable care act", "wordCount": 622, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29f6\"", "article_summary": "According to Richard Gottfried, the health care system is better since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act, but it's still fatally flawed.\n\u201cNot so fast!\u201d warn opponents to universal health care.\nBarbara Dyskant daughter\u2019s leukemia is in remission, but continues to press for universal health care in New York State.\nThe Assembly Member will use testimony from 6 hearings across the state to persuade his colleagues to support the New York Health Act, which would create universal health care all New York residents.\nOpponents say when everyone has easy access to health care, more people will use it."}
