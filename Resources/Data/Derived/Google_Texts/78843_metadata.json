Turnout appeared robust, with people waiting more than an hour to vote in a line that stretched longer than two city blocks on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThis is worse than getting a new iPhone,\u201d said Jeni Hansen, 38, who works in the tourism industry.\n\nVolunteers for Trump, Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Marco Rubio were handing out brochures and stickers, and support for Rubio \u2014 who has won just one primary and faces a crucial test Tuesday in his home state of Florida \u2014 appeared particularly strong. The District\u2019s 27,000 registered Republicans tend to be moderate and establishment-friendly, and some voters sported a sticker with the hashtag \u201c#NeverTrump.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump alternately scares and horrifies me,\u201d said Bryan Marra, a 39-year-old attorney who was running as a delegate for Rubio. \u201cHe scares off people we need to bring into the party \u2014 Latinos, young people, women.\u201d\n\nThe local GOP is heavy on what some would call \u201cBeltway elites\u201d \u2014 lawyers, lobbyists, political strategists and think-tank wonks. Candidates for delegate include former White House officials from the Reagan and both Bush administrations.\n\nDavid Eisen, 25, who owns an information-technology company and is running as a Trump delegate, said Washington Republicans who represent special-interest groups have a strong motivation to maintain the status quo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a shock that those people want to elect anyone else,\u201d Eisen said.\n\nSome voters said they didn\u2019t think Trump could beat Hillary Clinton if he wins the nomination. Others said they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for him. Christopher Gobbos, a 24-year-old Rubio supporter, said Trump is \u201cnot a conservative\u201d and that he would vote for a third-party or write-in candidate over Trump in November.\n\n\u201cAs a Christian person I can\u2019t choose between the lesser of two evils,\u201d Gobbos said. \u201cI can\u2019t vote for somebody that I think is going to radically change the country.\u201d\n\nResults were expected to be announced around 9 p.m., with Orthodox Jews getting a chance to vote after the polls close at 4 p.m. The District\u2019s 19 delegates will be allocated proportionally, unless one candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote, which would make it winner-take-all.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ben Nuckols on Twitter at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols .
