The three stages of the blacklegged tick - an adult female, a nymph and larvae - were compared to a penny at a lab at the U in St. Paul, Minn., on April 16, 2015. The blacklegged tick is commonly called a deer tick.

The Minnesota Department of Health is warning people to guard against tick-borne illnesses as summer activities begin. Mid-May to mid-July is the highest risk period to contract Lyme disease and other infections from ticks.

David Neitzel, a tick-borne disease specialist from the health department, said the best way to keep ticks away is to use a repellant containing up to 30 percent DEET. People who are frequently in the woods should consider pre-treating their clothing with permethrin, a different insect repellant.

"It's important for folks to know that they are going to be at risk if they venture out into the woods," said Neitzel. "Wooded habitats are where you find these ticks living. They are not going to be in open areas or even grassy fields. You have to really get into woods and brushy areas."

The ticks which carry Lyme disease are blacklegged ticks, commonly known as deer ticks. According to Neitzel, they are most prevalent in central, north-central and southeastern Minnesota.
