The mythology lived on and, combined with the hospital\u2019s very real development decisions, contributed to a persistent view of Hopkins as an imperious, menacing presence amid the largely poor and African-American neighborhoods surrounding it.\n\n\u201cHopkins was viewed with a great deal of suspicion and anger,\u201d said Miles, who graduated from the school in 1970 and is the bishop of Koinonia Baptist Church in northeast Baltimore.\n\nBut now, Miles says, that perception could be changing. Johns Hopkins University and the Hopkins hospital and health system have launched an ambitious initiative to fill many more jobs with residents from distressed Baltimore neighborhoods, boost the use of minority contractors and vendors from those areas, and require their partners to follow their lead.\n\nThe goal is to help alleviate the stubborn poverty laid bare in the spring, during the upheaval that followed the death of Freddie Gray, a young African-American man, while in police custody. And it comes at a time when other hospitals\u2014spurred in part by the tax code and a little-noticed provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires hospitals to help improve the health of their communities\u2014are tackling health, employment, education and housing problems in their neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cI think it is a confluence of the ACA requirements and a motivation to do good,\u201d said Erika Poethig, director of urban policy initiatives at the Urban Institute. \u201cThere has been building momentum and a healthy competition between hospital systems that are trying to develop pathways to employment or other kinds of community investment.\u201d\n\nThe Hopkins initiative, announced last month, had been in the works for some time, but officials say it took on increased urgency after the rioting. \u201cThe unrest in Baltimore shed light on the racial and economic disparities that challenge our city,\u201d Ronald Daniels, president of the university, wrote to faculty and staff last month. As a result, he said, the university and health system are redoubling their longstanding efforts, \u201cknowing that the health and well-being of Johns Hopkins are inextricably tied to the physical, social and economic well-being of Baltimore.\u201d\n\nOther hospitals across the country also have shown a greater inclination to address poverty in their communities in recent years.\n\n\u201cIn many places, hospitals give the impression that they are in a community but not of a community,\u201d said Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League. \u201cBut we are seeing more hospitals becoming more intentional about building bridges to these communities\u2014through employment, through education, through philanthropy.\u201d\n\nAddressing Poverty\n\nMost large hospitals operate health clinics in low-income communities. But more and more, in places as varied as Detroit, New York City and Waco, Texas, hospitals have instituted programs that are not strictly medical, but are instead intended to lift communities out of poverty.\n\nExamples abound. In 2015, the Cleveland Clinic raised the minimum wage for its employees to $12, well above Ohio\u2019s $8.10 minimum wage. It contributed $500,000 to the removal of abandoned homes. It runs a number of internship and education programs for low-income and minority students to introduce them to work in the health care field. (Nearly a third of the participants in one such program went on to graduate from two- or four-year colleges.) The hospital is also making up to $2 million available to help employees purchase or renovate homes in the neighborhood.\n\nThe Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania has enrolled about 100 West Philadelphia high schoolers in a two-year program in which they work in the hospital, receive job training in medical fields, and take community college courses. All of the program\u2019s 2015 graduates also graduated from high school (versus 70 percent for all Philadelphia public school students). The program recently expanded to include children from all four high school grades. Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston has a similar program.\n\nThe University of Chicago Medical Center and its parent, the University of Chicago, have steadily increased the number of employees from the low-income area where they are located. One-third of its employees now come from the mid-South Side, and they account for nearly 40 percent of salaries paid. Another Chicago hospital, Mount Sinai, runs an after-school program for middle school students, giving them a safe haven from the dangerous South Side streets.\n\nIn Boston, Mass General, Children\u2019s Hospital and others work with partners to find stable housing for low-income patients, including pregnant women. Boston Medical Center and Beth Israel Deaconess both have programs to make healthy foods available in low-income communities.\n\nReason to Act\n\nHospitals that have undertaken these efforts say they are motivated by a commitment to support their communities. But such programs are also an outgrowth of federal tax policy as well as the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn order to retain tax-exempt status, nonprofit hospitals are required to demonstrate charitable investment in their communities. In the past, they were largely able to fulfill that requirement by providing uncompensated medical care to uninsured patients.\n\nBut the ACA has greatly reduced the ranks of the uninsured. That shift will require hospitals to find other ways to demonstrate their good citizenship, said Neil Kleiman, an urban policy professor at New York University.\n\nThe ACA also includes a provision that requires hospitals to assess their community\u2019s health needs and formulate an action plan to meet them. The plans may involve conventional medical care in free clinics, but the requirement has also been interpreted to include other steps, such as the creation of green spaces, jobs programs, education and pipelines for getting healthy foods into areas that are not served by grocery stores.\n\nJanice Guhl, of the Cleveland Clinic, said a number of the hospital\u2019s programs predate the ACA requirements, and that it undertook the education and housing programs because the clinic believes strongly in supporting its surrounding communities. To meet the ACA rules, she said the hospital has initiated other programs that are more directly health-related.\n\nHospitals can be a crucial participant in anti-poverty efforts, Kleiman said. Often, they are one of the major employers in a community, particularly in urban areas that have experienced an exodus of employers. They also have a wide variety of jobs requiring different levels of skills and at different income levels, providing the possibility for advancement.\n\nA Force in Baltimore\n\nFew institutions bestride their communities the way Hopkins does. With 52,000 employees in the Baltimore area, and many satellite operations, the school and health system are by far the region\u2019s largest private employer. Over the last two decades, the hospital has launched various initiatives to help surrounding communities, including anti-violence programs and the hiring of ex-offenders, but it wasn\u2019t enough to alter the community\u2019s negative view of Hopkins.\n\nBut Miles and many others in Baltimore say Hopkins is now deepening its commitment to the city in a way that promises to have a farther reaching impact.\n\nIt has pledged to increase hiring in Baltimore\u2019s most distressed neighborhoods, from 26 to 40 percent of total employment, and to require the same of its vendors and contractors. It also plans to increase purchasing from Baltimore businesses by $6 million over three years, up from $56 million, and to increase the participation rate of minority contractors in construction projects and in purchasing.\n\nHopkins\u2019 commitment has reverberated widely in the city. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in my memory that a corporate institution in Baltimore has stepped up in such a major way,\u201d said Miles.\n\nFor much of its history, the hospital was viewed by Baltimore\u2019s black community as a neighborhood bully that uprooted residents from their homes to make way for hospital expansions, which it then surrounded with fortress-like walls. More recently, the 2010 best-selling book, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, revealed how tumor cells taken from an impoverished black woman by a Hopkins doctor in 1951 were used to develop medical treatments that generated hundreds of millions of dollars, none of which found their way back to Lacks or her descendants.\n\nBut now, people are more open to seeing Hopkins as a solution to the problems bedeviling Baltimore. \u201cThis is a true cultural shift,\u201d said Rob English, lead organizer for Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development, a nonprofit co-chaired by Bishop Miles that works to improve housing and boost employment in impoverished areas of the city. \u201cI\u2019m not sure most people at Hopkins even realize the enormity of this precedent yet.\u201d\n\nStateline.org originally published this article.
