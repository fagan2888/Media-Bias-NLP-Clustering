An attorney for Sater disputes that account, saying his client has been a \u201cmodel citizen.\u201d\n\nWhen he sued, Mr. Oberlander included leaked copies of Sater\u2019s pre-sentencing report and a copy cooperation deal for the 1998 case, which were under seal. The disclosure set off a fierce and contentious legal battle between federal prosecutors and Mr. Oberlander and his attorney, Richard Lerner, who both have faced a contempt investigation after the disclosure.\n\nEventually, more than a decade after his guilty plea, Sater was sentenced and fined $25,000 in a hearing that took place without notice to victims shortly before Ms. Lynch took over the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York, according to records.\n\nIn court papers, Mr. Oberlander and Mr. Lerner noted that Sater faced nearly 20 years in prison and a mandatory $40 million in restitution and $80 million forfeiture, but the sentencing judge imposed no restitution or confinement. And victims weren\u2019t at the hearing to object because they were never told about the sentencing in the first place, according to the attorneys\u2019 Supreme Court petition.\n\nMs. Lynch wasn\u2019t U.S. attorney during the sentencing hearing, but her office has since fought efforts to unseal records in the case.\n\nMr. Fallon also said many of the key developments in the case \u201coccurred outside of Ms. Lynch\u2019s stints as U.S. attorney,\u201d first in 1999 and again in 2010. Still, court records show numerous examples of Ms. Lynch\u2019s office pushing to keep details about the case from becoming public.\n\nThe government\u2019s arguments for keeping records sealed \u2014 many of them redacted or under seal \u2014 have been upheld in rulings by the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn and by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit despite arguments pushing for more transparency from victims\u2019 rights and press groups.\n\n\u2018Most serious matters of national security\u2019\n\nRobert Wolf, an attorney for Sater, said his client provided \u201cextraordinary cooperation\u201d after his 1998 guilty plea, including working on \u201cthe most serious matters of national security, battling our greatest enemies at tremendous risk to his own life and for the benefits of all citizens of our country.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Mr. Wolf called the $25,000 fine Sater was ordered to pay \u201cmore than merited\u201d and a \u201cmeasure of gratitude\u201d for unspecified cooperation that saved \u201cpotentially tens of thousands, if not millions, of our citizens\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nNeither Sater\u2019s lawyer nor the Justice Department would discuss the nature of his cooperation.\n\nMr. Wolf said Sater has gone on to build a business and has been a \u201cmodel citizen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom job creation to philanthropy, Mr. Sater has been clear of all legal allegations,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Wolf also discounted what he called \u201csham concerns\u201d about victims\u2019 rights, accusing the attorneys suing Sater of a \u201clegal shakedown\u201d aimed at using the threat of public disclosure to force a lucrative settlement deal.\n\nMr. Oberlander, however, said in an email that the case provides a troubling example of prosecutors evading federal forfeiture and restitution laws as a reward for cooperation.\n\n\u201cAnd Ms. Lynch\u2019s office refuses to notify crime victims of their restitution rights when restitution and notice to victims are mandatory under federal law,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Lerner said the Sater case was \u201cno mere aberration,\u201d charging that \u201cMs. Lynch\u2019s success as a prosecutor has been dependent upon her office\u2019s repudiation of constitutional and statutory law.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court petition filed by Mr. Lerner of behalf of Mr. Oberlander also details the involvement in the Sater case of two other Justice Department officials \u2014 Marshall Miller, principal deputy assistant attorney general in the criminal division, and Leslie Caldwell, assistant attorney general in the criminal division.\n\nMr. Miller was the victims\u2019 rights coordinator for the federal prosecutor\u2019s office in Brooklyn, while Ms. Caldwell, a former prosecutor in the office, later represented Sater at his sentencing.\n\nAt the sentencing hearing, Ms. Caldwell said Sater was \u201creally deserving of the full measure of leniency\u201d given the \u201cextraordinary circumstances of his cooperation,\u201d according to transcripts.\n\nOutside concerns\n\nWhile attorneys debate Sater\u2019s sentencing deal, two outside groups \u2014 the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press and the National Organization for Victim Assistance \u2014 have filed briefs in recent years pushing for more transparency in Sater\u2019s case and questioning whether the secrecy has limited public oversight and stifled the voice of victims.\n\nIn a May letter to judges on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, attorneys for the Reporters Committee said they first challenged the \u201csuper sealing\u201d of the Sater case in 2012.\n\nSome records were later unsealed in March 2013, but the district court left about 25 percent of the records under seal after secret \u201cex parte\u201d meetings closed to the press, public and the attorneys who were seeking to unseal the documents, according to the committee.\n\nMs. Lynch\u2019s office argued that Sater\u2019s safety was one consideration for sealing, but the Reporters Committee said the information about his case already was available and the subject of media reports, which undercut that argument.\n\n\u201cWhen the press and public have no way of holding courts accountable for giving informants special treatment, secret defendants can abuse the system and endanger the public,\u201d Bruce D. Brown, the committee\u2019s executive director, wrote in a letter in May.\n\nIn 2012, two years into Ms. Lynch\u2019s tenure at U.S. attorney, Mr. Cassell filed a separate brief on behalf of the National Organization for Victim Assistance. They argued that Ms. Lynch\u2019s office appeared intent on preventing the public from learning anything about how prosecutors treated crime victims in the case.\n\nThe victims\u2019 rights group said it had asked Ms. Lynch\u2019s office whether it followed through on restitution for crime victims as the law requires in the case. The group received no explanation other than a brief email to Mr. Cassell saying the office \u201ccomplied in all aspects of the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this point,\u201d the attorneys argued, \u201cthe government is using the alleged sealing orders it may (or may not) have obtained in this case not as a legitimate law enforcement tool but rather as an excuse for obscuring what happened.\u201d\n\nMr. Cassell a year later asked the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on the Constitution to inquire into the matter. But that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nIn a statement, the Judiciary Committee said it incorporated Mr. Cassell\u2019s concerns into legislation improving services for crime victims at all federal prosecutors\u2019 offices. But the House panel never contacted Ms. Lynch\u2019s office directly.\n\n\u201cThe committee takes such requests seriously, and the precedent is often to use alternate strategies other than a formal congressional inquiry,\u201d the committee said in an email statement \u2014 though the committee said it \u201cis also open to examining this issue further and has not ruled out sending an inquiry to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office regarding its handling of victims\u2019 rights.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than a year before President Obama nominated federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch to be attorney general, a former federal judge quietly called on Congress to investigate her U.S. attorney's office for trampling on victims' rights.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "More than a year before President Obama nominated federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch to be attorney general, a former federal judge quietly called on Congress to investigate her U.S. attorney\u2019s office for trampling on victims\u2019 rights.", "title": "Loretta Lynch questioned over secret deal depriving fraud victims of $40M", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/4/loretta-lynchs-office-cheated-stock-fraud-victims-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/09/119_2014_obama-attorney-general-2-88201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/09/119_2014_obama-attorney-general-2-88201.jpg", "description": "More than a year before President Obama nominated federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch to be attorney general, a former federal judge quietly called on Congress to investigate her U.S. attorney's office f", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Loretta Lynch questioned over secret deal depriving fraud victims of $"}, "Author": "Jim McElhatton", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Felix Sater, Paul G Cassell, Judiciary Committee, Frederick Oberlander"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb2ee\"", "article_summary": "But the House panel never contacted Ms. Lynch\u2019s office directly.\n\u201cAnd Ms. Lynch\u2019s office refuses to notify crime victims of their restitution rights when restitution and notice to victims are mandatory under federal law,\u201d he said.\nStill, court records show numerous examples of Ms. Lynch\u2019s office pushing to keep details about the case from becoming public.\nThe victims\u2019 rights group said it had asked Ms. Lynch\u2019s office whether it followed through on restitution for crime victims as the law requires in the case.\nThey argued that Ms. Lynch\u2019s office appeared intent on preventing the public from learning anything about how prosecutors treated crime victims in the case."}
