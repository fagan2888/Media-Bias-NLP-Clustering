Americans can blame for-profit insurance companies if healthcare premiums increase under Obamacare, former Rep. Dennis Kucinich said Wednesday."We're looking at another round of premium increases," the Ohio Democrat and former presidential contender told "Fox & Friends." "It's going to cost more because the American people are going to be charged more by the insurance companies."A longtime proponent of Obamacare, Kucinich said the insurance companies were going to "make out like bandits" because the healthcare law expanded their customer base."The insurance companies, they're in business to make a profit," Kucinich said. "Right now, they have more customers, thanks to this plan which compels people to have healthcare. And they're going to make more money. That's the nature of the game."The White House is expected to announce Wednesday another delay for the healthcare law, pushing back the deadline to enroll in Obamacare to mid-April, instead of March 31.Obamacare is on the right track, despite the many delays during its implementation, Kucinich maintained. He said the administration is still "moving in the right direction.""This is a massive program. And, there have obviously been some problems with it. They're still moving ahead," he said.Obamacare is a viable means for providing more people with healthcare coverage, Kucinich said,d adding that the newest delay is due to the administration "trying to get the benefits out to people who can't otherwise afford healthcare."
