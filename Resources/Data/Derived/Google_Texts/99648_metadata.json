It\u2019s breathtaking.\u201d\n\nThe 350,000-square-foot facility is home to more than 500 pieces of artwork, including 23 pieces created specifically for the hospital by Colorado artists.\n\nFloor-to-ceiling windows allow natural light to stream in and offer views of the Rocky Mountains. Wood floors, colorful wallpaper and natural stone make many areas feel more like a resort or a spa than a hospital.\n\n\u201cArt is very much a part of our healing and our happiness,\u201d said artist Mardie Rees, who is creating a 7-foot sculpture of St. Anthony to be placed in the atrium later this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just amazing,\u201d she said of the new facility.\n\n\u201cI love that they incorporated a lot of color, that there\u2019s different art in every section. And they\u2019ve done a good job of bringing the outdoors inside,\u201d she added, referencing the aspen groves in the atrium.\n\nThe new campus, sponsored by Catholic Health Initiatives, is part of regional health care network Centura Health.\n\nLocated at West 144th Avenue and Interstate 25, the $177 million facility houses 92 inpatient rooms, including a 20-room intensive care unit, a 12-room birthing center and a 24-hour emergency room.\n\nThe health campus also includes a pharmacy, wellness classes, drop-in child care and three gardens focused on community, healing and prayer.\n\n\u201cWhat sets our campus apart is a focus on the continuum of health and wellness,\u201d CEO Carole Peet said.\n\n\u201cWe want to take care of people across mind, body and spirit.\u201d\n\nIn addition to hospital services, the facility contains the Orchard Neighborhood Health Center, featuring more than 50 primary and specialty care medical practices. Touch-screen directories near the elevators allow patients to easily find their appointments, check out the cafeteria specials or take a virtual-art tour.\n\nOn Tuesday, hospital staff members will transport roughly 60 patients from the old St. Anthony North Hospital on West 84th Avenue to the new health campus. The 44-year-old hospital will remain open as the 84th Avenue Neighborhood Health Center with a 24-hour emergency room and outpatient services.\n\nAnna Gauldin: 303-954-1666, agauldin@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "New St. Anthony North Health Campus opens in Westminster", "title": "New St. Anthony North Health Campus opens in Westminster", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/28/new-st-anthony-north-health-campus-opens-in-westminster/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150228__20150228_STANTHONY_1CW4139xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150228__20150228_STANTHONY_1CW4139xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-28T14:28:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:19:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1652\"", "article_summary": "WESTMINSTER \u2014 The word of the day was \u201cbeautiful\u201d as thousands of people explored the new St. Anthony North Health Campus on Saturday.\nThe new campus, sponsored by Catholic Health Initiatives, is part of regional health care network Centura Health.\nOn Tuesday, hospital staff members will transport roughly 60 patients from the old St. Anthony North Hospital on West 84th Avenue to the new health campus.\nThe health campus also includes a pharmacy, wellness classes, drop-in child care and three gardens focused on community, healing and prayer.\nThe 44-year-old hospital will remain open as the 84th Avenue Neighborhood Health Center with a 24-hour emergency room and outpatient services."}
