Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2015\n\nBut Paul maintains he isn\u2019t going anywhere\u2014and may even outlast the reality television star turned nativist presidential candidate. According to CNN:\n\nSpeaking on CNN's \"New Day\" with Alisyn Camerota, the Kentucky senator responded to comments from Trump that Paul's campaign was sputtering out. \"I'll tell you this, I think we'll be around just as long as Trump, or longer,\" Paul said. \u2026 Paul said there's no truth to Trump's assertions that his campaign is having trouble fundraising. In fact, he said, his campaign is focused on organizing on the ground in key primary states and pleased with how that's going. \"Ultimately we're going to get to the truth, we're going to get to substance -- it takes a while,\" Paul said of the campaign. \"But by no means am I finished: I'm just getting started.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is making overtures to Paul\u2019s supporters:\n\nI hope when Rand Paul gets out of the race\u2014he is at 1%--his supporters come over to me. I will do a much better job for them. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2015\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine libertarians\u2014actual libertarians, who want the government to be smaller\u2014heading in droves to the campaign of a man who despises trade, uses the government to confiscate private property, and would seek vast new federal power to kick hard-working Americans out of the country.\n\nThat said, there is a Republican candidate who seems to be cutting into Paul\u2019s libertarian base with some success: Ted Cruz. Cruz has picked up a few key endorsements from libertarians who supported Ron Paul\u2019s presidential campaign, and former Libertarian Party presidential candidate Bob Barr is chairing a new \u201cLiberty Leaders for Cruz\u201d coalition, according to The Washington Post:\n\nAs Paul's campaign has floundered and Cruz remains in the middle of the pack, Cruz's campaign has made the case to Paul supporters that the Texas Republican can remain in the race for a long time -- and that while he does, he will espouse libertarian principles. At rallies this summer, Cruz has evoked the Fourth Amendment, railed against the Fed and talked about his efforts to end the bulk government collection of metadata. In the video, Cruz's supporters talk about how both Pauls endorsed Cruz's 2012 Senate run and said they believe he has held positions consistent with the liberty movement, including a reluctance to send boots on the ground to Syria and support for Rand Paul's bill calling for an audit of the Fed.\n\nWatch that video here (and below).\n\nCruz\u2019s relative success at courting Ron Paul activists suggests to me that the younger Paul has not done enough to shore up his libertarian base as he makes overtures to the more traditional, hawkish wing of the Republican Party. But he did a better job of this in the second debate, and the Iowa caucus is months away\u2014meaning it\u2019s still premature to assume that Paul\u2019s presidential ambitions are dead.\n\nReason TV interviewed Paul in June.
