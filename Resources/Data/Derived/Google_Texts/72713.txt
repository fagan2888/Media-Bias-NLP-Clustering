A boating accident Saturday afternoon in Newton County left one man dead.

Newton Fire Chief Steven Kelly says they received a call about 5:20 Saturday evening. Chief Kelly says witnesses told him that the boat was going across the water at an excessive speed when it flipped. Kelly says they called Philadelphia Fire Department for backup to assist in finding the boater.

Officials stayed out on the water till midnight and had to call off the search for safety concerns because it was so cold. The cold water even sent one diver to the hospital, who has since been treated and released from the hospital.

At about 9:00 Sunday morning the search party began again. Around 2:30 Sunday afternoon the body of 47-year old Theodore Earl Forte was recovered.

Newton County Coroner Danny Shoemaker says his body has been sent to Pearl for an autopsy to determine if the cause of death was from drowning or trauma.
