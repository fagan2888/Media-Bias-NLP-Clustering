According to the union, the grocer had previously proposed cutting pensions, increasing health care costs, and giving new employees fewer benefits. Stop & Shop said it had offered increased pay and would continue providing generous paid time off and affordable health care benefits. The company also said it was not seeking to cut contributions to the pension plan.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.3187310142", "eomportal-id": 542820, "description": "The deal was reached more than a month after the contract expired and a group of Massachusetts workers voted to authorize a strike.", "eomportal-instanceid": 15, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "The deal was reached more than a month after the contract expired and a group of Massachusetts workers voted to authorize a strike.", "title": "Stop & Shop workers reach tentative contract agreement - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/04/10/stop-shop-workers-reach-tentative-contract-agreement/b8phcypUxsCQlpHDHu9jDM/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/images/logo-bg-small-square.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Stop & Shop,contract,negotiations,agreement,New England,United Food and Commercial Workers, Royal Ahold NV,Royal Ahold NV|AHO|NYSE", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 20:24:14 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Stop & Shop,contract,negotiations,agreement,New England,United Food and Commercial Workers, Royal Ahold NV,Royal Ahold NV|AHO|NYSE", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "6609a094-ff38-11e5-946e-36f8d256f570"}, "article_summary": "Stop & Shop said it had offered increased pay and would continue providing generous paid time off and affordable health care benefits.\nStop & Shop workers have reached a tentative agreement with the grocery store company, more than a month after the contract expired for 35,000 employees in New England and a group of Massachusetts workers voted to authorize a strike if an acceptable deal wasn\u2019t reached.\nThe agreement must be approved by the members of five local United Food and Commercial Workers unions, which will hold votes in the coming weeks.\n\u201cOur goal was to work together, beat back the company\u2019s concessionary demands, and negotiate a better life for our incredible Stop & Shop members,\u201d the New England Council of the United Food and Commercial Workers said in a statement.\n\u201cWorking together, we have reached a tentative agreement that all sides can agree is fair and equitable.\u201dStop & Shop spokesman Philip Tracey said, \u201cWe are very pleased that we have reached tentative agreements with each of the five UFCW local unions that represent our store associates in New England stores.\u201dDetails of the agreement, reached Saturday, were not immediately released."}
