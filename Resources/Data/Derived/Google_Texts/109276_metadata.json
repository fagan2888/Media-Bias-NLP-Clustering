Pouring a bucket of ice water over one\u2019s head, quite frankly, is. That\u2019s why the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge has gone viral on social media, but it\u2019s also why the ALS Association has received more than $3 million more in donations in recent weeks than it did in the same period last year. Whether the challenge\u2019s fundraising method is good or bad or right or wrong is reasonably up for debate. It\u2019s also undoubtedly effective \u2014 so why not apply it to other worthy causes?\n\nThat\u2019s essentially what pro-choice activist Andrea Grimes was thinking when she started the Taco or Beer Challenge on Monday. Inspired by the proliferation of the #icebucketchallenge, Grimes, a senior political reporter at RH Reality Check, came up with one of the simplest, most pleasurable \u201cchallenges\u201d to incentivize donating to abortion funds. All a person has to do is eat a taco or drink a beer (or both), then donate to an abortion fund. It\u2019s that easy, Grimes explains:\n\nWhat do ice buckets have to do with ALS? I don\u2019t know. What do tacos and beer have to do with abortion? I don\u2019t know that either. What I do know is that eating tacos and drinking beer is more pleasurable than getting doused with ice water, and that lawmakers around the country are passing increasingly restrictive anti-abortion access laws. Which means abortion funds are now more necessary than ever as legal abortion becomes harder than ever to access \u2014 especially for those of us who don\u2019t live in major urban centers. \u2026 Eat a taco and/or drink a beer \u2014 or a margarita, or a glass of Franzia, or a ginger ale, or a refreshing mineral water, hell, I don\u2019t care what you drink, that\u2019s how easy the Taco or Beer Challenge is. The Taco or Beer Challenge is about doing what\u2019s right for your own taco and beverage needs, just like having an abortion \u2014 or not \u2014 is about doing what\u2019s right for yourself and your family.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics of the Ice Bucket Challenge note there are other good causes that need donations.
