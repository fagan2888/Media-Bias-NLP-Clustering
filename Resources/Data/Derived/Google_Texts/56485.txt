New York

A South Dakota company is installing a new, bigger video screen at the stadium where the New York Mets play. Daktronics of Brookings is making a high-definition display for Citi Field that is 62 percent larger than the original one.

The new 5,670 square foot display will debut on Opening Day, April 13.

The installation puts the Mets in the top 10 largest displays in professional baseball and makes Citi Field one of the few baseball venues to feature more than one video capable LED display in the seating bowl.

"Providing new displays for Citi Field is a great opportunity for Daktronics and we are proud to continue our partnership with the New York Mets," Daktronics Vice President of Live Events Jay Parker said.
