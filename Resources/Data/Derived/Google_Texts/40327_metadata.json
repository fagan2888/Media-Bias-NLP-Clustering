Chris Christie\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection said no changes have been formally proposed since the department held a June 17 invitation-only meeting when discussion on \u201clooking at these rules and considering ways to change and improve them\u2019\u2019 took place.\n\nThe Sierra Club\u2019s Jeff Tittel in a conference call with reporters Wednesday said the DEP wants to make changes for nitrate, total dissolved solids and chloride standards.\n\nOne of the changes under consideration, Tittel said, is switching from measuring nitrates at the point of discharge from a sewer point, and instead making the reading at the drinking water supply intake. That would allow for higher levels of nitrates and pollutants to be discharged, Tittel charged.\n\n\u201cThis is a sneak attack on our clean water and our drinking supplies,\u2019\u2019 Tittel said.\n\nDEP spokesman Larry Ragonese said, \"There is nothing negative or hidden about this process. It is being done openly and in concert with New Jersey stakeholders.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cThe overall goal is to increase protections in streams over current levels where there are existing or planned potable water intakes, and in streams where there are no potable water intakes,\u2019\u2019 Ragonese added.\n\nBob Jordan Statehouse Reporter: Bob Jordan has been writing about New Jersey politics and Gov.
