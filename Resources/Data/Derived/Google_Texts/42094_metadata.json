The agents had a search warrant for her husband\u2019s firearms. As they scoured the home, Hudson was read her Miranda rights.\n\nWhile inside Hudson\u2019s house, a U.S. Coast Guard agent confiscated documents that contained \u201cconfidential notes, draft articles, and other newsgathering materials\u201d that Hudson never intended for anyone else to see. The documents included the identities of whistleblowers at the Department of Homeland Security. The Coast Guard is part of Homeland Security.\n\nAt the time, Hudson was investigating and reporting on Homeland Security, specifically its Federal Air Marshal Service and the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until weeks later that Hudson discovered the documents were missing\u2014and even then only because a federal law-enforcement official told her she could pick up the files. Hudson notified the Washington Times, which took the government to court for violating the Privacy Protection Act.\n\nThis led to the settlement, which was first revealed by the Washington Times this week.\n\n\u201cThe important thing about this settlement is that we did not let the government\u2019s invasion of my privacy stand,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cWe defended the rights of journalists to protect their sources from discovery by government security agencies, and that\u2019s a victory for all journalists.\u201d\n\nThe settlement required Homeland Security to pay $50,000 to Hudson, return the seized documents, promise that no copies had been made and any notes about them would be destroyed. In addition, it provides $25,000 to the Washington Times for attorney\u2019s fees and requires the Coast Guard Investigative Service to initiate a review of and provide training on the federal Privacy Protection Act.\n\nHudson\u2019s attorney, Mark Grannis of Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP, hailed the settlement as a victory for press freedom.\n\n\u201cThe government has bent over backwards to assure us that the seizure of Ms. Hudson\u2019s notes was just an error of judgment, not part of any organized effort to identify her sources,\u201d Grannis said. \u201cWe hope that by bringing this claim we have helped to raise awareness within the government that reporters\u2019 notes are legally protected from seizure in all but the most exceptional cases.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A reporter whose private files were illegally seized during a raid on her home will receive $75,000 as part of a settlement with Homeland Security.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A reporter whose private files were illegally seized during a raid on her home will receive $75,000 as part of a settlement with Homeland Security.", "title": "Homeland Security Reaches Settlement After Raid on Reporter", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/upiphotostwo233260.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-02T14:17:24+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tkCGbK"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A reporter whose private files were illegally seized during a raid on her home will receive $75,000 as part of a settlement with Homeland Security.", "title": "Homeland Security Reaches Settlement After Raid on Reporter", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/upiphotostwo233260.jpg"}, "creator": "@RobertBluey", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "media", "published_time": "2014-10-02T14:03:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-02T14:17:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Audrey Hudson, Washington Times, Department of Homeland Security, Coast Guard, raid, firearms, confidential documents, government, settlement, press freedom"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9a4\"", "article_summary": "An investigative reporter whose private files were illegally seized during a raid on her home will receive $50,000 as part of a settlement with the Department of Homeland Security.\nAt the time, Hudson was investigating and reporting on Homeland Security, specifically its Federal Air Marshal Service and the Transportation Security Administration.\nThe documents included the identities of whistleblowers at the Department of Homeland Security.\nThe Coast Guard is part of Homeland Security.\nThis led to the settlement, which was first revealed by the Washington Times this week."}
