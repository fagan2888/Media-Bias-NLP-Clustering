Food demonstrations and art performances by Filipino artists will be hosted in the Gateway to Asia stage and nearby tents.\n\nFood is a huge part of the festival. This year there are two food tents on either side of the festival grounds that will host Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Indian, Hmong, Thai, Filipino and even American foods.\n\nNew to the food aspect this year is the Culinary Dojo event, which will run throughout the day on both days. Chefs will teach guests how to prepare, cook and serve various Asian dishes.\n\n\u201cSince our food is so popular, we thought, \u2018Let\u2019s take it a step further and engage the audience by teaching them how to cook some Asian dishes,\u2019 \u201d Yoshimura said.\n\nAnother very popular event is the band stage, which showcases Asian American bands and musicians who perform blues, jazz, rock n\u2019 roll, hip-hop and other familiar styles of music.\n\n\u201cOur emphasis hasn\u2019t always been on just traditional Asian culture, because we\u2019re not all about kimonos and doing traditional dances,\u201d Asakawa said.\n\n\u201cWe can do all this stuff, sing and play music that a lot of people might not expect. I love that aspect of the festival.\u201d\n\nJordan Gonzalez: 303-954-1395, jgonzalez@denverpost.com\n\nColorado Dragon Boat Festival\n\nThe festival is held at Sloan\u2019s Lake Park and runs from July 19-20.
