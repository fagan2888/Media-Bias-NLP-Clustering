Mitt Romney addresses a crowd of supporters while introducing New Hampshire Senate candidate Scott Brown at a farm in Stratham, N.H., on July 2. The Associated Press\n\nGood Tuesday morning, the 13th day of 2015 and the day after one person died and nearly 90 were hospitalized in a Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority subway accident, the worst loss of life since a derailment in June of 2009 killed nine. That crash triggered a multi-year, $6 billion overhaul, addressing years of federal underfunding; Congress passed a stopgap funding bill last fall but a permanent one is nowhere in sight. It\u2019s the second day of Senate debate over the Keystone XL pipeline, Job One on the new Republican-majority wish list \u2013 and probably President Barack Obama\u2019s first post-midterm veto. It\u2019s also the first meeting between the president and the GOP\u2019s congressional leaders since the 2014 midterms; the stated goal is finding common ground, but given mutual suspicions (see above), don\u2019t hold your breath for a breakthrough. Here\u2019s an abbreviated version of the Three-Minute Briefing:\n\nOne Down, One to Go: The Supreme Court has decided not to hear a broad-strokes challenge to Obamacare, one brought by a physicians\u2019 group that wants the law repealed. But don\u2019t think the court has suddenly embraced the law formerly known as the Affordable Care Act: The big enchilada\u2019s an upcoming technical challenge coming to the court, which could strip away tax subsidies for millions of health care subscribers.\n\n[READ: Americans Protest Obamacare by Refusing Health Insurance Subsidies]\n\nJust Like Hitler, But Worse: The president took some heat Monday for staying away from a big Paris unity rally in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre \u2013 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron were both there \u2013 but Rep. Randy Weber, a Texas Republican and tea partier who apparently didn\u2019t get the memo about GOP minority outreach, took the criticism to the next unfortunate level:\n\nEven Adolph Hitler thought it more important than Obama to get to Paris. (For all the wrong reasons.) Obama couldn't do it for right reasons \u2014 Randy Weber (@TXRandy14) January 13, 2015\n\nUnlike other pols who make unfortunate analogies, Weber\u2019s tweet remained on his account Monday morning, a sign he\u2019s standing by his remarks \u2013 which makes this image, a fave during the tea party rallies in 2009, particularly ironic.\n\nRight Where He Wants Them: The Charlie Hebdo massacres in Paris have taken Republicans\u2019 plan to slow-fund the Department of Homeland Security off the table, so they have to come up with a Plan B to fight Obama over his executive decision on immigration reform. But The Hill reports that coming up with a new strategy could further divide the GOP, making it harder for them to prove they\u2019ve got this \u201cgoverning\u201d thing figured out.\n\nBand Back Together: Now that he\u2019s \u201cserious\u201d about running for president in 2016, Mitt Romney has been frantically reassembling his losing 2012 campaign team \u2013 calling staffers, former aides and key donors, as well as the Republican candidates who challenged him in 2012. I\u2019m guessing a call to Jeb Bush wasn\u2019t on that to-do list.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Three-Minute Briefing: D.C.
