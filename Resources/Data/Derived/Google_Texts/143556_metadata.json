The company is one of the largest systems of insurance companies in the country.\n\nUnions have also asked for an exemption from the plan fee, a tax that employers must pay to go to the reinsurance fund.\n\n\u201cTheir efforts, along with growing support for repealing the risk corridor and reinsurance programs, could combine to create a perfect storm to, at a minimum, dissuade the Administration from modifying risk corridor program rules to provide increased funding in light of the recent \u2018transitional policy\u2019 allowing insurers to offer consumers the option to renew their 2013 health plans for 2014,\u201d Serota wrote.\n\nIn attached talking points, seemingly directed at Republican lawmakers opposed to risk corridors and reinsurance, BCBSA is asking members to argue that eliminating the risk corridors will lead to the eventual downfall of Obamacare and lead to a single-payer system: \u201cIt jeopardizes the entire private health insurance market and will ultimately lead to a single-payer system. Furthermore, it will close the door to pro-competitive health care reform alternatives.\u201d\n\nOne bolded talking point, \u201cuse with appropriate audiences only,\u201d charges that \u201celiminating these programs will result in massive premium increases and could cause private insurers to become insolvent.\u201d In Serota\u2019s email, however, this point is intended for Democrats only.\n\nInsurance companies are having an increasingly hard time finding sympathetic ears on the Hill as they work to comply with the law.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, the lead sponsor of the risk-corridor repeal bill in the Senate, previously told BuzzFeed that he was not anti-insurance company but simply anti-bailout.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think taxpayers should be bailing them out. It takes a taxpayer bailout to save Obamacare \u2014 that alone tells you it\u2019s not worth saving,\u201d he said.\n\nRead the full talking points below.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 2895324, "userid": 686094}, "description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield Association CEO Scott Serota asks members to lobby the Hill against repeal of the \"risk corridor and reinsurance...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
