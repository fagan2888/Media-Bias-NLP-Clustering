After all, both provide necessary nourishment. And as poet Tess Taylor told us last week, \"Food \u2014 'cultivation' \u2014 is the most basic part of 'culture,' the art of stability, the art of civilization.\" The whole process of growing and harvesting food, cooking it and savoring it has inspired generations of writers.\n\nSo, we asked you to share your favorite selections about farming and food \u2014 and we've gathered them up here.\n\n\n\nLots and lots of you recommended William Carlos Williams' sweet and short \"This Is Just To Say\":\n\n\n\nI have eaten\n\nthe plums\n\nthat were in\n\nthe icebox and which\n\nyou were probably\n\nsaving\n\nfor breakfast Forgive me\n\nthey were delicious\n\nso sweet\n\nand so cold\n\n\n\n\"Persimmons\" by Li-Young Lee is another lovely ode to fruit:\n\n\n\n... Ripe ones are soft and brown-spotted.\n\nSniff the bottoms. The sweet one\n\nwill be fragrant. How to eat:\n\nput the knife away, lay down newspaper.\n\nPeel the skin tenderly, not to tear the meat.\n\nChew the skin, suck it,\n\nand swallow. Now, eat\n\nthe meat of the fruit,\n\nso sweet,\n\nall of it, to the heart ...\n\n\n\nAs is Diane Ackerman's \"The Consolation of Apricots\":\n\n\n\n... Somewhere between a peach and a prayer,\n\nthey taste of well water\n\nand butterscotch and dried apples\n\nand desert simooms and lust. Sweet with a twang of spice,\n\na ripe apricot is small enough to devour\n\nas two hemispheres.\n\nAmbiguity is its hallmark ...\n\n\n\nAnd Matsuo Basho's haiku meditation on melons:\n\n\n\nCoolness of the melons\n\nflecked with mud\n\nin the morning dew.\n\n\n\nAnd Seamus Heaney's wistful \"Blackberry Picking,\" which begins:\n\n\n\nLate August, given heavy rain and sun\n\nFor a full week, the blackberries would ripen.\n\nAt first, just one, a glossy purple clot\n\nAmong others, red, green, hard as a knot.\n\nYou ate that first one and its flesh was sweet\n\nLike thickened wine: summer's blood was in it\n\nLeaving stains upon the tongue and lust for\n\nPicking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger\n\nSent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-pots\n\nWhere briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots ...\n\n\n\nFruits and veg are necessary for a balanced diet \u2014 and for a taste of the latter, The Salt's Maria Godoy loves Pablo Neruda's \"Ode To The Onion\":\n\n\n\nOnion, luminous flask,\n\nyour beauty formed\n\npetal by petal,\n\ncrystal scales expanded you\n\nand in the secrecy of the dark earth\n\nyour belly grew round with dew.\n\nUnder the earth\n\nthe miracle\n\nhappened\n\nand when your clumsy\n\ngreen stem appeared,\n\nand your leaves were born\n\nlike swords\n\nin the garden ...\n\n\n\nOf course, produce easily translates into sensual verse.\n\nBut sometimes we all crave something meatier. For that, we can turn to Maya Angelou \u2014 a woman who knew how to enjoy a good, hearty meal. (She even published a couple of cookbooks). Here's \"The Health-Food Diner\":\n\n\n\nNo sprouted wheat and soya shoots\n\nAnd Brussels in a cake,\n\nCarrot straw and spinach raw,\n\n(Today, I need a steak). Not thick brown rice and rice pilaw\n\nOr mushrooms creamed on toast,\n\nTurnips mashed and parsnips hashed,\n\n(I'm dreaming of a roast). Health-food folks around the world\n\nAre thinned by anxious zeal,\n\nThey look for help in seafood kelp\n\n(I count on breaded veal). No smoking signs, raw mustard greens,\n\nZucchini by the ton,\n\nUncooked kale and bodies frail\n\nAre sure to make me run to Loins of pork and chicken thighs\n\nAnd standing rib, so prime,\n\nPork chops brown and fresh ground round\n\n(I crave them all the time). Irish stews and boiled corned beef\n\nand hot dogs by the scores,\n\nor any place that saves a space\n\nFor smoking carnivores.\n\n\n\nIf that doesn't fill you up, here's Shel Silverstein's whimsical ditty on hotdogs.\n\nAnd Roger McGough's \"Vinegar\":\n\n\n\nsometimes\n\ni feel like a priest\n\nin a fish & chips queue\n\nquietly thinking\n\nas the vinegar runs through\n\nhow nice it would be\n\nto buy supper for two\n\n\n\nAs McGough so cleverly notes, food is the stuff that connects us \u2014 it carries emotion and memory. In that vein, here's an except from Robert Hass' \"Meditation at Lagunitas\":\n\n\n\n... But I remember so much, the way her hands dismantled bread,\n\nthe thing her father said that hurt her, what\n\nshe dreamed. There are moments when the body is as numinous\n\nas words, days that are the good flesh continuing.\n\nSuch tenderness, those afternoons and evenings,\n\nsaying blackberry, blackberry, blackberry.\n\n\n\nAnd here is D.H. Lawrence, who shows us the best way to enjoy an apple \u2014 or any food, for that matter \u2014 in his poem \"Mystic.\"\n\n\n\nThey call all experience of the senses mystic, when the experience is\n\nconsidered.\n\nSo an apple becomes mystic when I taste in it\n\nthe summer and the snows, the wild welter of earth\n\nand the insistence of the sun. All of which things I can surely taste in a good apple.\n\nThough some apples taste preponderantly of water, wet and sour\n\nand some of too much sun, brackish sweet\n\nlike lagoon water, that has been too much sunned. If I say I taste these things in an apple, I am called mystic, which\n\nmeans a liar.\n\nThe only way to eat an apple is to hog it down like a pig\n\nand taste nothing\n\nthat is real. But if I eat an apple, I like to eat it with all my senses awake.\n\nHogging it down I call the feeding of corpses.\n\n\n\nWe could go on, and on and on. But we won't \u2014 because honestly, all this food poetry is making us hungry.\n\nIf we missed any of your favorites, please do let is know in the comments, or on Twitter @NPRFood.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "This April marks the 20th anniversary of National Poetry Month, and here at The Salt, we wanted to celebrate with a selection of the sauciest, most", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/honor-nationalpoetrymonth-your-favorite-poems-about-food-and-farming", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201604/475000157.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "This April marks the 20th anniversary of National Poetry Month, and here at The Salt, we wanted to celebrate with a selection of the sauciest, most", "title": "In Honor Of #NationalPoetryMonth: Your Favorite Poems About Food And Farming"}, "story_id": 474405658, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wnpr"}, "author": "Maanvi Singh", "org_id": 1, "dc": {"title": "In Honor Of #NationalPoetryMonth: Your Favorite Poems About Food And Farming"}, "nid": 57654, "datePublished": "2016-04-24", "wordCount": 1412, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe12e3\"", "article_summary": "But we won't \u2014 because honestly, all this food poetry is making us hungry.\nSo, we asked you to share your favorite selections about farming and food \u2014 and we've gathered them up here.\nAll of which things I can surely taste in a good apple.\nThe whole process of growing and harvesting food, cooking it and savoring it has inspired generations of writers.\nBut if I eat an apple, I like to eat it with all my senses awake."}
