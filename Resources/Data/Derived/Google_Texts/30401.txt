What's becoming obvious to patients, physicians, and payers is that under current ACA regulations, there's a stark difference between "having insurance" and "having access to health care."

To get around caps on how much they can charge in premiums, insurers have imposed higher out-of-pocket costs for many specialty drugs. The absurdly high co-pays and co-insurance mean that, in practice, many patients with exchange plans can't afford their medicines.

Just look at silver plans (the most popular category). In five of 20 drug classes for conditions from cancer to HIV, at least 20 percent of plans require patients to pay 30 percent or more of the medicine's cost. Over half of silver plans place all multiple sclerosis medicines in the "specialty tier" with the highest level of cost-sharing.
