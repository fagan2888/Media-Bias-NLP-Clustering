(A spokesman for junior senator Kirsten Gillibrand said she would exercise her home state privilege and also submit a name to the White House.)\n\nSchumer has a standing judicial screening committee, which is responsible for vetting candidates for the state\u2019s four U.S. attorneys and its federal judgeships. The screening committee has been chaired since 1999 by Mark O'Donoghue, partner and co-general counsel at Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, where he practices international corporate transactions and arbitration. The committee, made up of more than ten lawyers, includes attorneys from across the state and legal spectrum. It includes David Barrett, a partner at Boies, Schiller, & Flexner; David Arroyo, senior vice president of legal affairs at Scripps Networks Interactive; Lois Carter Schlissel, managing attorney at Meyer, Suozzi, English & Klein; and Bettina Plevan, a partner at Proskauer.\n\nThe screening committee isn\u2019t exactly a secret, but it doesn\u2019t exactly advertise vacancies either. \u201cThere are plenty of people who are qualified for the job, but if you aren\u2019t connected with the right group of people, you aren\u2019t even going to be able to do this,\u201d said a source with knowledge of the process.\n\nThere is a belief among many of those interviewed that it\u2019s not just about someone actively seeking the position; it\u2019s also about who is actively being sought out. \u201cDid [U.S. Attorney] Preet [Bharara] go through the screening committee?\u201d asked one source with experience in the process. (Bharara, a former aide to Schumer, declined to comment through a spokesman.)\n\nThe committee meets with all the candidates who complete an application, and the process is similar to interviewing for a firm position or clerkship: there are questions about a candidate\u2019s general approach to the law and ideas about what direction to take the office. The handful who advance beyond the committee meet with the senator himself. Schumer then makes his recommendation to the president.\n\nTwo names in particular continually come up as leading contenders to replace Lynch: Marshall Miller, the deputy chief of the Department of Justice\u2019s criminal division, who served for years with her in the Eastern District before he headed to main justice last year; and Sung-Hee Suh, currently a deputy assistant attorney general at main justice, who served under Lynch during her first stint at U.S. attorney in Brooklyn during the Clinton administration in the late 1990s. Suh spent 15 years at Schulte Roth & Zabel before also joining main just last year.\n\nSHE\u2019S NOT CONFIRMED YET \u2014 Schumer and Patrick Leahy are protesting the long delay over Lynch\u2019s confirmation, and have begun circulating a letter to Mitch McConnell asking for a floor vote to come soon on her confirmation. \u201cNo one questions that Ms. Lynch is qualified and ready to serve, yet we are troubled that her nomination continues to languish on the Senate floor,\u201d Schumer and Leahy write in the letter, which has all 46 Democrats signed on, according to POLITICO. http://politi.co/1DYNwvM\n\nDemocrats currently have the narrowest of majorities for Lynch\u2019s confirmation at just 50 committed votes, with Vice President Joe Biden providing the tiebreaker. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has led a conservative wing pledging to block the confirmation.\n\n--Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) : \u201cLoretta Lynch is the longest pending Attorney General nominee in 4 decades. Another testament to Republicans\u2019 inability to govern.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NnGHcH\n\nHAPPY FRIDAY , and thank you for reading. Questions? Tips? Events?

Burwell...six Justices had tipped their hands. Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg all seemed like solid votes for the federal government, defending the subsidies, while the challengers could clearly count on the votes of Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito. Chief Justice John Roberts \u2013 who three years ago joined the Court\u2019s more liberal Justices to uphold another provision of the Affordable Care Act, requiring everyone to buy health insurance or pay a penalty (it\u2019s a tax!) \u2013 kept his cards close to his chest, asking only a few questions that gave no real hint as to how he might vote. But even if it ultimately doesn\u2019t get the Chief Justice\u2019s vote, the government could still win as long as it can pick up just one more vote. And that seemed like at least a possibility, because Justice Anthony Kennedy asked several questions which suggested that he might be leaning more toward the government than the challengers.\u201d http://bit.ly/1B3kvz9\n\n--Capital\u2019s Dan Goldberg on the New York effect: \u201cThe Urban Institute predicts that in states with the federal exchange, premiums would rise by 35 percent. For clues to what that would look like, New Yorkers need only look at their own state. New York, prior to the 2014 implementation of the Affordable Care Act, required insurers to cover almost everyone, but there were no individual mandates and no subsidies for consumers then. As a result, insurance on the private New York market was too expensive for most to purchase. When subsidies were put in place, premiums on the individual market were cut in half.\u201d http://capi.tl/1K8u7yT\n\nR.I.P. FRED KAPLAN, NYC Dept. of Probation \u2014 Kings County Criminal Bar Association: \u201cAs an integral part of the criminal justice system in Brooklyn for so long, every KCCBA member worked with and respected him.\u201d\n\nPREET\u2019S PREJUDICE \u2014 Slate\u2019s Bennett Gershman : \u201cBharara\u2019s prosecutorial accomplishments are impressive. \u2026 It is therefore surprising that he would risk ethical criticism and possible censure by making gratuitous, demeaning, and prejudicial comments that could manipulate public and media opinion and ultimately prejudice juries that will hear cases he brings. He could not make such comments in a courtroom; a judge would stop him. But there is no judge to check his extrajudicial statements.\u201d http://slate.me/1DLeOpn\n\n--Bharara responded on Thursday to Silver\u2019s request for a dismissal : \"The defendant\u2019s motion relies on distortions and omissions, disregards the law and is a transparent attempt to distract this Court and the public from the serious charges brought against the defendant. It should be denied.\u201d Capital\u2019s Laura Nahmias: http://capi.tl/1ERycTp\n\n--Scuttles scuba dreams -- Halloran given 10 years: Prosecutors in the Southern District won a lengthy 10-year sentence for Dan Halloran on Wednesday, after the former Republican city councilman was convicted last year in a scheme to place former Democratic state senator Malcolm Smith on the G.O.P.\u2019s ballot line in the 2013 mayoral race. Halloran\u2019s lawyer had asked the court to impose a \u201cconsiderably lower\u201d sentence than the guidelines of six-and-a-half to eight years, presumably so Halloran could pursue his passion for scuba instruction.\n\n--The harsh sentence doesn\u2019t bode well for Smith , who was convicted along with co-defendant Vincent Tabone in February and faces up to 45 years. Smith has the same judge as Halloran, Kenneth Karas, and his sentencing is scheduled for July 1.\n\nA.K.A. ETIQUETTE \u2014 William Easton of Easton Thompson Kasperek Shiffrin chastises prosecutors for misusing their \u201calso known as\u201d privileges: \u201cIn recent years our firm has noted the prosecution\u2019s increased use of monikers or \u2018a/k/a\u2019s in the captions of indictments, especially for those defendants charged federally with gang-associated offenses such as Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) crimes, CCE (Continued Criminal Enterprise) crimes, and defendants charged state-side with gang-related offenses.\n\n\u201cOddly, this firm has not detected a similar increase in our white collar practice, even in conspiracy cases involving multiple defendants. Thus, a defendant in a white collar case who is widely known as \u2018Chip,\u2019 \u2018the Chipster\u2019 or \u2018Biff\u2019 will usually be indicted under his or her own proper name, while a \u2018blue collar\u2019 defendant who has a nickname of \u2018Money,\u2019 \u2018Killer\u2019 or \u2018Smooth\u2019 will usually be indicted with his moniker included prominently in the caption of the indictment. This misuse of a nickname should be resisted by motion.\u201d http://bit.ly/1EsFn3Z\n\nWANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING?

Gould and Gilligan explained that they learned that the vast majority of life as a lawyer is not as glamorous as portrayed in television shows and films like Law & Order or A Few Good Men, a conclusion that is obvious to attorneys but is perhaps a surprise to television producers. Gilligan added that they planned to \u2018showing a different side\u2019 of life as a lawyer \u2018that you don\u2019t see in other TV shows and other movies.\u2019 Through both Jimmy and Kim, they have definitely succeeded so far. And, of course, the show has been equally successful in its depiction of cucumber water.\u201d http://bit.ly/1BUzuxG\n\nFROM THE FIRMS\n\nMoves\n\n--Dickstein Shapiro adds Victoria Zerjav (Kelley Drye & Warren) as partner to corporate and finance practice in Stamford, Conn.\n\n--Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson adds Jeffrey Lewis (Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler) as a partner in its intellectual property litigation practice based in New York City.\n\n--Hogan Lovells adds Cassie Waduge (Weil Gotshal & Manges) as counsel in its corporate practice, focusing on intellectual properties transactions, in the New York office.\n\nNews\n\n--DLA Piper announced its merger with Davis, a Canadian firm of 260 lawyers that\u2019s historically focused on energy and natural resource issues.\n\n--Touro Law Center will honor Meyer, Suozzi, English & Klein\u2019s Richard Eisenberg for his pro bono work at its 21st annual Public Interest Attorney of the Year reception on Wednesday, March 11.\n\n--Davis Polk announced a number of client advisory actions: Citigroup on the sale of its OneMain business to Springleaf Holdings, Inc. for total consideration of $4.25 billion; Temenos Group AG\u2019s \u20ac235 million acquisition of IGEFI Group s.\u00e0.r.l.

Palumbo\n\nCASE OF THE WEEK -- Stolowski v. 234 E. 178th St. LLC and City of New York, NY Appellate Division, First Department: The court ruled that a trial can begin in Bronx supreme court over the 2005 death of FDNY Lieutenant Curtis Meyran, who leapt from an apartment window while trying to battle a blaze in the Bronx. His family sued the city for failing to provide he and his colleagues with personal safety ropes or any other type of self-evacuation equipment. The city had moved to dismiss. Andrew J. Turro and Donnalynn Darling of law firm Meyer Suozzi, represent Jeanette Meyran and her husband\u2019s estate.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence, including testimony, and an investigative report, that the failure to issue personal ropes to firefighters contributed to the injuries and deaths suffered when the firefighters jumped from windows using either no safety device or a single rope that had been independently purchased by one of the firefighters,\u201d the appellate panel wrote in its decision. A spokesman from the city\u2019s law department said the city was reviewing the decision.

WOES CONTINUE \u2014 Rachel Goodman, City Councilman Brad Lander\u2019s chief of staff, has been indicted by a Staten Island grand jury as part of an ongoing investigation by special prosecutor Roger Adler into the 2009 campaign of Councilwoman Deborah Rose of Staten Island.\n\nThe New York Times Jim Dwyer: \u201cThere is something freakish about the existence of a special prosecutor, bringing criminal charges over one campaign whose mistakes \u2014 if any \u2014 were more or less the same as those of other campaigns. \u2026\n\n\u201cIn 2009, the same year Ms. Rose was elected, the board decided that 37 percent of all campaigns in the city, more than 200, had committed some sort of violation. No one was arrested.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1H3sMEd\n\nA BRIEF INTERVIEW WITH Matthew Brinckerhoff, founding partner at Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady\n\nBrinckerhoff is currently representing Public Advocate Letitia James in a lawsuit against Staten Island district attorney Daniel Donovan\u2019s office over the details of the grand jury proceedings in the death of Eric Garner. Capital caught up with Brinckerhoff to talk about handling the crowd of attorneys suing in the Garner case, his firm, and his family\u2019s role in founding Queens. Questions and answers have been edited.\n\nCAPITAL: What was the motivation behind starting your own firm, and have you been able to stick with it?\n\nBRINCKERHOFF: In 1995 I linked up with first two and then three of my law school classmates, and, along with Richard Emery, started the firm that I am still part of today. The basic idea was to support ourselves while doing work that we thought was socially productive. For me, for the most part, that means suing the government, institutions or people that have a disproportionate amount of power which frequently is wielded in an unfair or discriminatory manner.\n\nCAPITAL: How did you get involved with the Garner case?\n\nBRINCKERHOFF: Working on the Garner case is a natural extension of the firm's longstanding practice of representing people who've been victimized by police misconduct and abuse of authority. Beyond that, I spent many years representing tenants, homeowners and other property owners had the misfortune of living in and around the area targeted to become the Atlantic Yards project. One of the few elected officials who recognized the Atlantic Yards Project for the boondoggle it is was then-City Council Member Letitia James. Additionally, my co-counsel over the years of challenging the use of eminent domain at Atlantic Yards was Jennifer Levy, who is now the general counsel in charge of litigation for the Public Advocate. It was pretty natural that Ms. Levy and I would team up again in order to represent the Public Advocate on this extremely important issue that we all care about a lot.\n\nCAPITAL: A little research found articles about your family\u2019s roots in settling Queens and the fight to save the colonial Brinckerhoff Cemetery--were you involved at all?\n\nBRINCKERHOFF: My ancestors, specifically Joris Dircksen Brinckerhoff, did come to what is now New York City pretty early on. One of Joris' son's was killed by Native Americans on what is now Staten Island. How strange is that? I definitely thought about it when I was looking at those extremely unusual paintings in the Staten Island courtroom where the Garner hearings are held. One of my very great-grandmothers, Aeltie Brinckerhoff, is buried in the Queens cemetery that was recently land marked. I actually had no involvement in the effort to landmark what now looks like just a couple of empty lots, other than giving an interview saying that I supported landmarking and would prefer that a luxury condominium not be built on top of my grandmother's grave.\n\nLINKS:\n\n- \u201cNYCLA calls for year-long study of UBEs\u201d by Capital\u2019s Colby Hamilton http://bit.ly/1KvRnHb\n\n- \u201cAmerican Ballet Theater and Fired Worker to Go to Trial Over His Temper\u201d by the New York Times\u2019 Rachel Swarns http://nyti.ms/18W7flD\n\n- \u201cDebevoise Lawyer Tapped For NY Bankruptcy Judgeship\u201d by Law360\u2019s Cara Salvatore http://bit.ly/1DRrlVK\n\n- \u201cBrooklyn Federal Prosecutor Sarah Coyne Moves to Debevoise\u201d by the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Christopher Matthews http://on.wsj.com/1ANahOG\n\n- \u201cBank Regulators Watching NY's Money Laundering Crackdown\u201d by Law360\u2019s Evan Weinberger http://bit.ly/1GpqKRk\n\n- \u201cHedge Fund Suit Accusing U.S. of Misconduct Faces High Bar\u201d by the New York Times\u2019 Peter Henning http://nyti.ms/1B6ZJP9\n\n- \u201cFederal Jury Finds Abid Naseer Guilty of Conspiring with al Qaeda\u201d by the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Thomas MacMillan http://on.wsj.com/1G4Q5fR\n\n- \u201cCommunity College Not Immune From Suit, Circuit Rules\u201d by the New York Law Journal\u2019s Mark Hamblett http://bit.ly/1No8MR1\n\n- \u201cWestchester Jury Convicts Lacey Spears in Fatal Poisoning of Son\u201d from the AP http://nyti.ms/1KdaCVG", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/03/8563566/capital-public-law-report-how-schumer-screens-us-attorney-aka-epidemi", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/all/themes/capitalny/images/cap.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Capital Public Law Report: How Schumer screens for U.S. attorney; A.K.A. epidemic"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Welcome to Capital\u2019s Public Law Report, a weekly digest of news on courts and the law in New York."}, "article_summary": "Welcome to Capital\u2019s Public Law Report, a weekly digest of news on courts and the law in New York.\nAndrew J.
