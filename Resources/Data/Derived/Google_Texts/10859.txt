Energy is cheaper in Colorado than any other state, according to a WalletHub report released Monday.

WalletHub weighed the price of natural gas, electricity and vehicle fuel, and consumption rates for each, to rank the states.

Colorado ranked No. 1 with a total monthly energy cost of $301, followed by Washington state at $302, Montana at $305, and Rhode Island at $307.

The highest energy costs were in Hawaii, $451 per month, Mississippi, $414 per month, and Connecticut at $404 per month.

In the U.S., the average consumer spends about 7.1 percent of total income on fuel, natural gas and electricity.

Among the six categories, Colorado placed first in price of natural gas; 14th in electricity consumption per consumer; 19th in fuel consumption per driver; 26th in price of fuel; 29th in price of electricity and 33rd in natural gas consumption per consumer.

The report added a note of caution: low prices donâ€™t always translate to reduced spending, WalletHub said.

For example, in some parts of the South, where electricity might be cheaper, the hot summers may result in higher out-of the-pocket expenses related to air conditioning and fans than in energy-expensive Northern California, where summer temperatures are much cooler.
