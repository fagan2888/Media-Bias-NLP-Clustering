Would you mind?\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is asking Americans to celebrate the anniversary of our country\u2019s independence from a tyrannical government by reciting government-approved talking points about the wisdom of the president\u2019s healthcare policies. From the HHS website:\n\nThis Fourth of July, families across the nation will gather around hot dogs (or their favorite vegetarian alternative) and potato salad to spend some quality time together, watch fireworks and reflect on the holiday\u2019s meaning. But as much as we love our families \u2013 and we do, seriously \u2013we don\u2019t always agree when it comes to current events, like last week\u2019s Supreme Court decision upholding tax credits that help make insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) more affordable for millions of people.\n\nMisinformation about the ACA is everywhere, and there\u2019s been a lot of money spent to spread that misinformation \u2013 as much as half a billion dollars in ads, according to one 2014 estimate. Not surprisingly, many Americans still don\u2019t know how changes the law made to insurance and the health care system can help improve their lives.\n\nYou should be prepared when Aunt Janine says something like, \u201cObamacare hasn\u2019t helped anyone!\u201d So here are a few points to remember during this long holiday weekend.\n\nSituation: Uncle Ted claims Obamacare is a train wreck and has cost jobs.\n\nYou say: Uncle Ted, you\u2019ve gotten ahold of some old talking points. With greater access to affordable, quality health insurance, the Affordable Care Act is helping individuals and strengthening our economy!", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "HHS would really appreciate it.", "title": "Feds: Celebrate the Fourth By Reciting Obamacare Talking Points to Your Family", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/07/02/feds-celebrate-the-fourth-by-reciting-ob", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1435876848410.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "HHS would really appreciate it.", "title": "Feds: Celebrate the Fourth By Reciting Obamacare Talking Points to Your Family", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1435876848410.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Policy", "published_time": "2015-07-02T22:50:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Another holiday, another opportunity to explain to friends and family members why the Affordable Care Act is so great.\nWith greater access to affordable, quality health insurance, the Affordable Care Act is helping individuals and strengthening our economy!\nYou say: Uncle Ted, you\u2019ve gotten ahold of some old talking points.\nSituation: Uncle Ted claims Obamacare is a train wreck and has cost jobs.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is asking Americans to celebrate the anniversary of our country\u2019s independence from a tyrannical government by reciting government-approved talking points about the wisdom of the president\u2019s healthcare policies."}
