Nowhere are our views as immutable as on the issue of guns. From one perspective, guns are an enormous social harm that must be relegated to trained professionals and law enforcement. In this context, the stigmatization of guns is a wise one. A population that is comfortable around guns is a population that is comfortable using them\u2014and sometimes using them on innocent people. Therefore, the number of guns held by the general populace should be driven as low as possible (and, hopefully, eliminated entirely). Australia, Australia, Australia.\n\nThe other perspective is the complete opposite. Guns are what keep communities safe, either from criminals or (God forbid!) government overreach. Gun-free zones are invitations for madmen and terrorists to attack a population that is advertising its defenselessness. Guns are what freed this country from the British, have stopped many would-be assailants, and are a constitutionally protected right not up for discussion. Heller, Heller, Heller.\n\nIt would seem any consensus is impossible. Depending on one\u2019s perspective, \u201ccommon sense\u201d gun legislation is either virtually nothing or an effective ban. It looks as if the gun argument will therefore go on indefinitely. But that needn\u2019t actually be the case, for not all laws are created equal.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Steven Spielberg digitally edited guns out of E.T.\n\nWhen FDR shepherded Social Security through Congress, he knew very well that the program was there to stay. As he put it in 1941, \u201cWe put those pay roll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral and political right to collect their pensions and their unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program. Those taxes aren\u2019t a matter of economics, they\u2019re straight politics.\u201d By 1952, FDR\u2019s archenemy Herbert Hoover was opining in his memoirs that, \u201cThe broad objective in this act was meritorious.\u201d Part of Social Security\u2019s permanence is of course due to its popularity. But another aspect is due to its complexity and pervasiveness. Due to its structure, as FDR understood well, it would be almost impossible to undo.\n\nLet\u2019s contrast this with another law of the period: Prohibition. While enacting Social Security Act took only a simple act of Congress, repealing Prohibition faced a far greater hurdle. The Eighteenth Amendment took two-thirds of Congress and three-quarters of the states to ratify it to become law; repealing it would involve the same huge majorities. As Senator Sheppard famously put it at the time Prohibition was enacted, \u201cThere is as much chance of repealing the Eighteenth Amendment as there is for a humming-bird to fly to the planet Mars with the Washington Monument tied to its tail.\u201d Sheppard had a point; no Constitutional Amendment had ever been repealed. To undo Prohibition would be a legislative act literally unprecedented in American history. Yet fourteen years later that humming-bird reached Mars nonetheless, ending the Prohibition experiment.\n\nOne would think it would be far easier to repeal Social Security than to repeal Prohibition. An amendment is far more durable, in theory, than a simple law. But in practice, that\u2019s not how things work. A law\u2019s permanence is not merely a function of its popularity.The left understands this very well\u2014and the right is increasing coming to appreciate this as well.\n\nIn September 1993, President Clinton pressed Congress to make its most urgent priority the giving to every American of \u201chealth care that can never be taken away.\u201d We saw this again during the Iraq War. Despite the overwhelming public reaction against it, the Bush administration doubled-down and stayed the course. And of course the Republicans warned of instant permanence during the Obamacare debate. As Chris Cilliza put it last year, \u201cthe longer the law is, well, the law, the harder it becomes to drastically change it.\u201d In other words, a permanent law is one that can neither be repealed popularly nor practically.\n\nObamacare is the perfect model for Republicans to follow to settle the gun issue once and for all. Using the same legal reasoning as the Affordable Care Act, pro-gun legislators can win this war by pushing for an individual gun ownership mandate. Such a mandate can be from the top-down, a Federal mandate. Or, like Romneycare, it can be instituted on the state level first\u2014West Virginia, here\u2019s looking at you. We\u2019ve seen this happen recently with this very issue. At first, concealed carry laws were only allowed in certain states. Now, all fifty states allow for such licenses. A gun-ownership mandate could play out the same way.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Steven Spielberg digitally edited guns out of E.T. For \u201cgun safety\u201d advocates, the law is not enough. It\u2019s far better to stigmatize gun ownership and render it taboo, in one of the myriad ways that progressivism reveals itself to be domestic imperialism. \u201cThe White Man\u2019s Burden\u201d remains unchanged, but now it is those who are poorer and whiter who are in desperate need of civilizing. The gun-owner culture is allegedly primitive and dangerous, and it falls on \u201cright-thinking\u201d people to show them the error of their ways. As Charles Cooke pointed out, years ago rifle clubs in high schools were par for the course. Now, metal detectors promote the idea that having guns nearby is something every child should fear. The only way to permanently stop this is to create a nation where guns are as ubiquitous as Coke.\n\nConservatives have both the context and the pretext to pass such a law. Many of the early colonies mandated gun ownership, granting the historical basis for action that right-wingers love. The cost for voting for such a bill\u2014being labeled a \u201cgun nut\u201d\u2014has already been paid by any such politician. And with the rise of terrorism, one can easily make the case that a disarmed populace is a luxury we can no longer afford. Jesse Hughes, the lead singer of Eagles of Death Metal, made the case for wider gun ownership better than any NRA official ever could.\n\nThe process is flexible. States can offer subsidies for women (and men) who have been the victims of assaults, giving them a tax credit or voucher in order to purchase a gun and take a training course. In the same way that Obamacare prescribes a \u201ctax\u201d for not purchasing insurance, so too can those opposed to gun ownership simply pay a fine to keep their consciences clean. Cities would come under enormous pressure to liberalize their gun laws, lest all the citizens (overwhelmingly Democratic voters anyway) have to pay a stiff fine. The genie would be out of the bottle, and could never be put back in. In any case, it would not be very long before gun ownership is culturally the norm throughout the entire United States\u2014and it would become a norm \u201cthat can never be taken away.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Michael Malice", "sailthru.author": "Michael Malice", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-504166004.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-504166004.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "FDR, gun control, Gun-free zones, Herbert Hoover, obamacare, Prohibition, Social Security, Steven Spielberg, obsNews & Politics, obsPolitics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "fdr, gun control, gun-free zones, herbert hoover, obamacare, prohibition, social security, steven spielberg", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-504166004.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "%tags%", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Must Pack Heat: The Case for Mandating Gun Ownership", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "michael-malice", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-504166004.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "With the rise of terrorism, one can easily make the case that a disarmed populace is a luxury we can no longer afford.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/21734_10151091039461741_1763912060_n.jpg?quality=80&w=132", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "sailthru.byline_twitter": "michaelmalice", "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2016-03-14T13:10:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-14T13:10:46+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/michael-malice"}, "sailthru.description": "With the rise of terrorism, one can easily make the case that a disarmed populace is a luxury we can no longer afford.", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "With the rise of terrorism, one can easily make the case that a disarmed populace is a luxury we can no longer afford.", "title": "Must Pack Heat: The Case for Mandating Gun Ownership", "url": "http://observer.com/2016/03/must-pack-heat-the-case-for-mandating-gun-ownership/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-504166004.jpg?quality=80&w=1200", "height": 799}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Michael Malice is the author of Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim Jong Il.
