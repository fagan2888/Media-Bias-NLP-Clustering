At this rate, one can only assume that for the White House, credibility rates a distant second to ensuring the success of Obamacare.

Two weeks ago, White House deputy senior adviser David Simas said the number of people getting healthcare coverage as a result of Obamacare stood at 6 million, to include nearly 4 million eligible through Medicaid.

But a Real Clear Politics report shows “only 380,000 new Medicaid enrollees due to Obamacare, a far cry from 4 million,” Fox News’ Megyn Kelly reported Thursday night.

“The White House has been caught red-handed again, misleading the American people on the truth about Obamacare,” Kelly said.

To make matters worse, a Twitter account bearing President Obama’s name even touted the accomplishment:

“That was false,” Kelly said of the Medicaid claim. “That was untrue. That was grossly misleading.”

Kelly pointed out that the White House was “apparently taking credit for people who were renewing their preexisting Medicaid plans.”

The Washington Post “Fact Checker” even gave the White House assertion three “Pinocchio’s,” leading with a damning headline: “Warning: Ignore claims that 3.9 million people signed up for Medicaid because of Obamacare.”

Credibility, schmedibility.
