Vacant Home that was on fire on S. Clifton

A small fire in a vacant home caught the attention of South Clifton neighbors early Saturday morning.

Early morning Saturday around 11 a.m. a vacant home caught on fire in the 3000 block of South Clifton.

Two nearby neighbors Chavro Rodriguez and Artro Ratrovelazquez stated that they heard shouts and were worried that someone was alive inside the house; but once they got inside they did not see anyone. After exiting the inferno they called the fire department.

"We started running over there, breaking windows and doors so we could go in, that way we could see if somebody was in there", said Rodriguez, one of the concerned neighbors who went to check that nobody was inside the house.

Once crews were at the scene they put out the fire and the cause is still under investigation.

No injuries were reported.
