This last year may have seen another big increase in the number of health savings accounts. But it also saw a drop in the amount employers are contributing to those accounts.

Employees saw a 10 percent decrease in their average single HSA employer contribution from the previous year, according to new data from United Benefit Advisors. In 2013, employers contributed an average of $574 per employee but last year that dropped to $515, the report says.
