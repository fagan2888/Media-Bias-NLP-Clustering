But when the bill is not completely destroyed, he turns to another piece of equipment.\n\n\u201cWell we had some fun and knocked some holes in it,\u201d Brooke tells the camera, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t quite get the job done. Looks like we\u2019ll have to resort to more extreme measures to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with a market based solution.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when the Altec Whisper Chipper comes into play.\n\nBrooke, a business executive, is running in a crowded Republican primary in Alabama\u2019s 6th Congressional District race. The contest to fill the seat of retiring GOP Rep. Spencer Bachus.\n\n\u201cWe need to get rid of ObamaCare,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThen we need to replace it with a conservative, market-based solution. This ad shows that we can have fun with a serious subject, but for those who have already been hurt by the law here in Alabama, it\u2019s anything but funny. I will fight everyday to right the wrongs of ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nOther candidates have released similar videos: West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin used his rifle to shoot a Cap and Trade bill in a 2010 ad, for example.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO:\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "'We'll have to resort to more extreme measures to get rid of Obamacare'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "An Alabama congressional candidate uses a .40 Glock pistol, a .270 Cooper rifle and an AR-15 to destroy a copy of the Obamacare bill in a new video released by his campaign.
