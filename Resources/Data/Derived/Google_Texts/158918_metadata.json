The protest came a day after Kenyan Parliamentarians declared that Obama would be thrown out of their Parliamentary building if he dared broach the subject.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nProtestors chanted \u201cWe do not want Obama and Obama; we do not want Michelle and Michelle. We want Obama and Michelle and we want a child.\u201d as they marched through Kenya\u2019s capital city, the Times has reported.\n\nHomosexuality is still illegal in the African country, punishable by up to seven years in jail. In sharp contrast, the US\u2019s Supreme Court recently ruled to legalise gay marriage across all fifty US states. Consequently, discussion around gay marriage has dominated the agenda as Kenya prepares to welcome President Obama later this month.\n\nThe protesters also condemned a recent decision by Kenya\u2019s Supreme Court to allow registration of gay rights organisations. They presented a petition to Chief Justice Willy Mutunga protesting the judgment, saying \u201cGay practice is against our Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe protest comes the day after a number of local and national lawmakers addressed a church fundraiser in central Kenya, vowing to stand firm against any calls for gay marriage that President Obama may make.\n\nAccording to the Daily Nation, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi told the crowd: \u201cLiberal thoughts are being entertained in some countries under the guise of human rights. We must be vigilant and guard against it (gay marriages). We must lead an upright society and not allow obnoxious behaviour as we have a responsibility to protect our children.\u201d\n\nHe said that he had previously chastised a group of British MPs who wanted to raise the issue. But he said that his views were personal and not those of the National Assembly (Kenya\u2019s lower legislative house), adding that he would not block any motion in the National Assembly seeking to introduce legislation legalising gay unions.\n\nHis colleague Cecily Mbarire MP told the audience that the government would refuse any aid that was tied to same sex legislation, saying: \u201cThe Constitution is against same-sex marriage and nothing should change (when Obama comes). We are ready to decline any foreign aid if it is tied to gay marriages.\u201d\n\nAnd National Assembly member Charles Njagagua MP vowed to have Mr Obama ejected from the House if he lectured MPs on gay marriage.\n\nThe group praised Kenya\u2019s Deputy President William Ruto, who on Sunday told another church meeting: \u201cHomosexuality is against the plan of God, God did not create man and woman so that men would marry men and women marry women.\u201d\n\nHe urged both Kenya\u2019s Christian and Muslim communities to stand up for their faiths and values, and to resist attempts to legalise gay marriage in the country, saying: \u201cWe have heard that in the US they have allowed gay relations and other dirty things. I want to say as a Christian leader that we will defend our country Kenya, we will stand for our faith and our country.\n\n\u201cNo amount of persuasions, theories or philosophy will make us change our position. We believe in God, this is a God fearing nation and will continue to be so.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kenyans Tell Obama: 'We Don't Want Gay Marriage So Don't Come to Lecture Us'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Kenyans Tell Obama: 'We Don't Want Gay Marriage So Don't Come to Lecture Us'", "title": "Kenyans Tell Obama: 'We Don't Want Gay Marriage So Don't Come to Lecture Us' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3000, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/GettyImages-171865836.jpg", "height": 2000}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/07/08/kenyans-tell-obama-we-dont-want-gay-marriage-so-dont-come-to-lecture-us/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kenyans Tell Obama: 'We Don't Want Gay Marriage So Don't Come to Lecture Us'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/GettyImages-171865836.jpg", "title": "Kenyans Tell Obama: 'We Don't Want Gay Marriage So Don't Come to Lecture Us' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, Gay Marriage, Kenya,Breitbart London, Obama,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart London", "tag": "Kenya", "published_time": "2015-07-08T06:12:33-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart London,Obama"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Consequently, discussion around gay marriage has dominated the agenda as Kenya prepares to welcome President Obama later this month.\nIn sharp contrast, the US\u2019s Supreme Court recently ruled to legalise gay marriage across all fifty US states.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERProtestors chanted \u201cWe do not want Obama and Obama; we do not want Michelle and Michelle.\nI want to say as a Christian leader that we will defend our country Kenya, we will stand for our faith and our country.\nAccording to the Daily Nation, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi told the crowd: \u201cLiberal thoughts are being entertained in some countries under the guise of human rights."}
