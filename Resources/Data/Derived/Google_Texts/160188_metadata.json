When residents gathered, the fighters told them to carry out the sentence: stoning to death for the alleged adulteress.\n\nNone in the crowd stepped forward, said a witness to the event in a northern Syrian city. So the jihadi fighters, mostly foreign extremists, did it themselves, pelting Faddah Ahmad with stones until her body was dragged away.\n\n\u201cEven when she was hit with stones, she did not scream or move,\u201d said an opposition activist who said he witnessed the stoning near the football stadium and the Bajaa garden in the city of Raqqa, the main Syrian stronghold of the Islamic State group.\n\nThe July 18 stoning was the second in a span of 24 hours. A day earlier, 26-year-old Shamseh Abdullah was killed in a similar way in the nearby town of Tabqa by Islamic State fighters. Both were accused of having sex outside marriage.\n\nThe killings were the first of their kind in rebel-held northern Syria, where jihadis from the Islamic State group have seized large swaths of territory, terrorizing residents with their strict interpretation of Islamic law, including beheadings and cutting off the hands of thieves.\n\nThe jihadis recently tied a 14-year-old boy to a cross-like structure and left him for several hours in the scorching summer sun before bringing him down \u2014 punishment for not fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nThe stonings in Syria last month were not widely publicized at the time, but in the following days, three photographs appeared online that appeared to document the grisly spectacle and were consistent with other AP reporting.\n\nThe pictures posted on a newly created Twitter account showed dozens of people gathered in a square, a cleric reading a verdict through a loudspeaker and several bearded men with automatic rifles either carrying or collecting stones.\n\n\u201cA married woman being stoned in the presence of some believers,\u201d read the caption of the photographs on the Twitter account, which since has been suspended.\n\nAbu Ibrahim Raqqawi, the activist who witnessed Ahmad\u2019s stoning, said locals where angry to see foreign fighters impose their will on the community.\n\n\u201cPeople were shocked and couldn\u2019t understand what was going on,\u201d he said in an interview via Skype. \u201cMany were disturbed by the idea that Saudis and Tunisians were issuing (such) orders.\u201d\n\nAhmad, he said, appeared unconscious, and he had overheard that she was earlier taken to a hospital, where she was given anesthesia.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Syria, in a statement posted on its Twitter account, condemned the \u201cbarbaric stoning\u201d of a woman in Tabqa.\n\nInternational human rights groups did not report the stoning, and Human Rights Watch said it had no independent confirmation.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Two women stoned to death for alleged adultery in Syria", "title": "Two women stoned to death for alleged adultery in Syria", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/09/two-women-stoned-to-death-for-alleged-adultery-in-syria/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140809__20140810_A23_ND10SYRIAp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140809__20140810_A23_ND10SYRIAp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-09T18:59:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:40:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A day earlier, 26-year-old Shamseh Abdullah was killed in a similar way in the nearby town of Tabqa by Islamic State fighters.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Syria, in a statement posted on its Twitter account, condemned the \u201cbarbaric stoning\u201d of a woman in Tabqa.\nWhen residents gathered, the fighters told them to carry out the sentence: stoning to death for the alleged adulteress.\n\u201cA married woman being stoned in the presence of some believers,\u201d read the caption of the photographs on the Twitter account, which since has been suspended.\nJihadi fighters then brought in the woman, clad head to toe in black, and put her in a small hole in the ground."}
