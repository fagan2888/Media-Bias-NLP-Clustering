Here's a roundup of policy fights that emerged this weekend, heading into tonight's caucuses.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCRUZ HITS TRUMP ON HEALTH CARE \u2014 AND HE'S KIND OF RIGHT \u2014 Locked in a close battle in Iowa, Ted Cruz is turning to health care in an attempt to separate himself from rival Donald Trump. A brutal ad airing in Iowa links \"HillaryCare\" and \"ObamaCare\" with \"TrumpCare\" \u2014 and uses Trump's own words against him.\n\n\"Everybody's got to be covered, this is an un-Republican thing for me to say,\" the ad quotes Trump saying on 60 Minutes last fall. \"[And] the government's gonna pay for it.\"\n\nCruz pushed this message further on several Sunday shows. \"A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for ObamaCare,\" Cruz claimed on Meet The Press. \"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have the identical position on health care. Which is they want to put the government in charge of you and your doctor. Now my views are polar opposites.\"\n\n\u2014 TrumpCare remains vaguely defined. Trump called Cruz a \"total liar\" and declared, \"I am so against Obamacare.\" But the thing is, Trump has repeatedly reiterated his commitment to some form of universal coverage \u2014 just as Cruz suggests. However, we still don't know any specifics of a Trump health plan, or how he'd pay for it.\n\nPressed again on Sunday, he still refused to offer details. \"We'll work something out,\" Trump said on ABC's This Week. \"Nobody knows health care better than Donald Trump.\"\n\nBUT CRUZ CAN'T FIND ANSWERS OF HIS OWN \u2014 Cruz's vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act led him into an uncomfortable conversation with an Iowa voter who wanted to know \"what are you going to replace it with?\"\n\nThe voter said his brother-in-law hadn\u2019t seen a doctor for years and gained health coverage thanks to Obamacare \u2014 but it was too late to prevent his death last year from cancer. He persistently asked Cruz to explain his alternative to the ACA, but the Texas senator couldn't find his way to an answer.\n\nCruz's lack of a response may not matter much in the Republican primary, where the ACA remains unpopular, but expect this question to resurface \u2014 again and again \u2014 in the general election.\n\nSANDERS: VOTERS WILL BE HAPPY TO PAY TAXES FOR MY PLAN \u2014 Bernie Sanders continues to defend his Medicare-for-All proposal from charges that it's politically unrealistic and practically too expensive.\n\n\"My proposal will save middle-class families thousands of dollars a year on their health care costs,\" Sanders said on Meet the Press, in response to tough questions from Chuck Todd. \"Most people tell me, yes, they would be happy to pay $1,000 more in taxes if they're paying $5,000 less in health care premiums.\"\n\n\u2014 Would Sanders' plan prove taxing for fellow Democrats' chances? One reason why Sanders' plan has been taking flak: His fellow Democrats say they're worried it'll hurt their chances, too. \"You don't think you're going to be a problem for House Democrats who don't want to run on raising taxes?\" Todd asked.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton will be the problem,\" Sanders countered. \"[Our] campaign is the campaign that is generating excitement and energy that will result in a high voter turnout.\"\n\n\u2014 Democrats ramp up pharma fight. Although Clinton and Sanders don't agree on health coverage proposals, they're essentially united in their anti-Big Pharma stance and continued their attacks throughout the weekend. Health care and drug costs are a big part of what they are talking about on the trail.\n\nBUSH: BLOCKING MEDICAID EXPANSION WAS ONE OF MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS \u2014 Asked by a New Hampshire TV anchor about how his candidacy compares to fellow governors John Kasich and Chris Christie, Jeb Bush responded that \"my record of accomplishment goes up against theirs pretty well. When they were expanding Medicaid, I fought \u2026 to not expand Medicaid there, and most people credit my involvement as one reason why [Florida] didn't.\"\n\n\u2014 Some context. While partisan Republicans may oppose the ACA, most Floridians appear to actually favor expansion. Nearly 570,000 people fall into the Medicaid coverage gap in Florida, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nWELCOME TO MONDAY \u2014 There's really only one story in politics and policy today, and here's what you need to know to follow it.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses begin at 7 PM CT (8 PM ET). Ann Selzer, the dean of Iowa polling, projects Hillary Clinton at 45 percent and Bernie Sanders at 42 percent in the Democratic race. Selzer also projects Trump at 28 percent, Cruz at 23 percent, Rubio at 15 percent, and Carson at 10 percent on the Republican side. Of course, the caucuses are notoriously difficult to predict, and our in-house polling analyst Steve Shepherd identified six frequent problems with Iowa polling.\n\nWinning Iowa doesn't guarantee winning the nomination, as Mike Huckabee (2008) and other also-rans can attest. But the correlation is pretty strong.\n\nI'll be up late watching the returns roll in. Have tips, news, or notes? Let me know at ddiamond@politico.com or on Twitter at @ddiamond.\n\n** A message from PhRMA: In 2001, Jamie was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer and worried she wouldn\u2019t get to see her son grow up. But thanks to new targeted therapies developed by America\u2019s biopharmaceutical companies, Jamie continues her courageous fight. Each step brings us closer to a cure.

Your Pulse author paid several visits to his local enrollment center in downtown Washington and found it a virtual ghost town \u2014 although D.C. is hardly representative of nationwide trends, given the relatively low levels of uninsured in the nation's capital.\n\nStill, \"the end of open enrollment surge does seem to be smaller than what happened in December,\" Kaiser Family Foundation's Larry Levitt remarked on Twitter. That was the deadline for coverage starting Jan. 1.\n\nThere was no last-minute push from the president himself, other than last Thursday's round of local TV interviews, but online, there was a flurry of activity. Snapchat superstar DJ Khaled and other social media celebrities exhorted their followers to get covered. My POLITICO Pro pal Erin Mershon got eight different emails from HHS this weekend, all reminding her that Sunday was the drop-dead deadline.\n\n\u2014 D.C. extends enrollment by two days. D.C. Health Link announced that it's extended enrollment through Tuesday, citing \"increased demand\" (my experience aside) and the after-effects of the region's blizzard. Maryland already extended enrollment through Feb. 5 because of the snowstorm.\n\n\u2014 When will we know sign-up numbers? Prognosticator Charles Gaba predicts that total sign-ups will end up between 12.4 million and 12.9 million. But don't expect enrollment numbers until Thursday or Friday of this week, HHS sources say.\n\n\u2014 Secretary Burwell briefs Obama. The HHS head is scheduled to meet with the president in the Oval Office at 11:45 a.m. today.\n\nSANDERS SUPER PAC HAS SUPER YEAR \u2014 Bernie Sanders rails against super PACs, but the main super PAC supporting his presidential campaign brought in $2.3 million last year \u2014 its biggest off-year fundraising haul ever, POLITICO's Ken Vogel reports. The super PAC, National Nurses United for Patient Protection, is affiliated with the nation's largest union of registered nurses, National Nurses United, and its members have been a near-constant presence at Sanders' rallies.\n\nBIDEN 'MOON SHOT' PANEL LAUNCHES \u2014 The first meeting will be Monday, with representatives from every key federal agency in attendance, and the vice president says he's got a clear mission: \"Making sure we're all working from the same playbook,\" Biden writes on Medium.\n\nSTATE WEEK: ARKANSAS LOOKS TO EXTEND MEDICAID EXPANSION, IDAHO INVESTIGATES WHETHER TO START \u2014 Arkansas is plotting its path to extending Medicaid expansion, and Idaho's legislature takes up Medicaid this week, Rachana Pradhan reports in the new edition of State Week\n\nZIKA 101 \u2014 HHS will begin \u201can aggressive outreach effort to communicate with many different audiences\u201d about the unfamiliar and potentially frightening Zika virus, says Bill Hall, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs for Public Health. Health authorities expect any U.S. outbreaks to be far more limited than those in affected Latin American and Caribbean nations, and the risk is mostly to women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. But HHS will be working to educate the public via traditional and social media, as well as partnering with medical organizations and government officials. \u201cThe more information you have, the more that helps ameliorate fear and concern,\" he told us.\n\n\u2014 The Brazilian doctors who sounded the alarm on Zika. A family of doctors \u2014 sharing information between them \u2014 played a pivotal role in making the connection between Zika and microcephaly and subsequently warning the Brazilian government. Here's the Wall Street Journal story:http://on.wsj.com/1nyBcPs\n\nFLINT FIGHT CONTINUES \u2014 HHS and other federal agencies have deployed a slew of resources to tackle the water crisis in Flint, the agency announced on Sunday. Teams from the EPA, FEMA, and other branches of the federal government are on site to test the water and distribute necessary supplies. More details are available here: http://www.phe.gov/flint.\n\nALTARUM: PRICES GREW SLOWLY IN 2015 \u2014 The Altarum Institute's health sector trend report is full of interesting nuggets, including a detail on remarkably slow price growth. \"Health care prices grew by 1.1 percent in 2015, the slowest annual rate ever in our historical series going back to 1990,\" Altarum concludes. One major driver of that trend: Physician prices actually fell last year.\n\nON TAP: Academy Health's two-day National Health Policy Conference kicks off this morning; look for POLITICO reporters roaming the halls, including Health Care Editor Joanne Kenen, who speaks on the closing panel tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Bipartisan Policy Center at 1 p.m. will discuss its initial recommendations to improve long-term care, joined by Tommy Thompson and Tom Daschle. And the Generic Pharmaceutical Association hosts a 2:30 p.m. briefing in the Cannon building this afternoon on the savings from generic medicines; RSVPs to sarnoff@gphaonline.org are required.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING (or viewing)\n\nVermont Public Radio used Legos to explain how the Iowa Democratic Caucus works. http://bit.ly/1UBTfPv\n\nUniversity of Maryland is trying to put its chocolate milk scandal on ice, The Washington Post reports. http://wapo.st/1RUY0pC\n\nCalifornia may attempt to block Centene's $7 billion bid for Health Net, David Gorn writes. http://bit.ly/20hrH9f\n\nIn Modern Healthcare, Adam Rubenfire examines how hospitals are dealing with their increasingly complex supply chains. http://bit.ly/1PKRtHB\n\nThe focus on Bernie Sanders' health records unearthed one interesting nugget: He was a high school track star, Philip Bump reports in a fun profile.http://wapo.st/1SSBWfn\n\n** A message from PhRMA: At just 15 months, Rhys was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, but today at five years old, he is thriving thanks in large part to medicines developed by biopharmaceutical companies. With 180 medicines in development for diabetes, Rhys along with roughly 29 million other Americans living with this disease have hope for an even brighter future. Learn more at www.fromhopetocures.org **\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): While approximately 80 percent of prescription drugs dispensed are generic drugs, the reimbursement system for these medications is largely unregulated and a mystery to pharmacists and patients. The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
