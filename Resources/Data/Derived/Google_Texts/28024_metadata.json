Sure they're pretty confident that 8 years of Obama will be followed by Hillary, but it's still taking a big gamble on the biggest country in the country which despite forcing gay marriage and ObamaCare fines on everyone, hasn't exactly delivered their full agenda.\n\nSuppose Ted Cruz wins and ends up appointing someone to replace Ginsburg who makes Scalia look like a bleeding heart liberal.\n\nBut Ginsburg hasn't been willing to take one for the team.\n\nFeeding her colossal ego by calling her Notorious R.B.G. and other embarrassing behavior that only desperate lefties whose messiah is stuck in Ebolaland and Iraq are capable of has backfired. Gingsburg is now more reluctant to leave than ever.\n\nWhy should she? This is the first time she's been popular in... ever.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s rap name is the Notorious R.B.G. At least, that\u2019s what her fans on Tumblr call her. Ginsburg recently praised the Tumblr page and admitted she owns a few Notorious R.B.G. t-shirts. \u201cI think a law clerk told me about this Tumblr and also explained to me what Notorious R.B.G. was a parody on,\u201d Ginsburg said to NPR\u2019s Nina Totenberg. \u201cAnd now my grandchildren love it and I try to keep abreast of the latest that\u2019s on the Tumblr. I have \u2014 and in fact I think I gave you a Notorious R.B.G. [t-shirt]. \u2026 I have quite a large supply.\u201d\n\nDo I have to state the obvious? Bears don't leave if you keep feeding them. Political hacks whose knowledge of the law is somewhere below that of actual rap stars (with good reason) don't retire if you turn them into celebrities.\n\nGinsburg is so desperate for fame that she's collecting her meme-of-the-moment shirts because it's the closest she's ever come to being popular or relevant. She follows a Tumblr page dedicated to her.\n\nIt's pathetic, but her narcissism may help turn the Supreme Court further to the right. Then she'll really be notorious.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Bears don't leave if you keep feeding them.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "Bears don't leave if you keep feeding them.", "title": "If Liberals Keep Feeding Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Ego, She'll Never Leave", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/243488/if-liberals-keep-feeding-ruth-bader-ginsburgs-ego-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:43:26-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/243488/if-liberals-keep-feeding-ruth-bader-ginsburgs-ego-daniel-greenfield", "description": "Bears don't leave if you keep feeding them.", "card": "summary", "title": "If Liberals Keep Feeding Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Ego, She'll Never Leave"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-27T05:23:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:43:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4ef\"", "article_summary": "Feeding her colossal ego by calling her Notorious R.B.G.\nSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s rap name is the Notorious R.B.G.\n\u201cI think a law clerk told me about this Tumblr and also explained to me what Notorious R.B.G.\nI have \u2014 and in fact I think I gave you a Notorious R.B.G.\nRuth Bader Ginsburg was already full of herself."}
