Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., believes lawmakers have a unique tool to use on the issue of sanctuary cities. \u201cWhat we can do is use the power of the purse to hold this administration accountable, hold these cities accountable,\u201d he told The Daily Signal in an exclusive interview.\n\n\u201cFrankly, these are generally Democrat cities,\u201d Huelskamp added. \u201cThey get tons of money from Washington and that should be a requirement; that if you want federal money, you probably should follow our federal laws dealing with border control and immigration.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, Huelskamp also talked about his clash with GOP leadership.
