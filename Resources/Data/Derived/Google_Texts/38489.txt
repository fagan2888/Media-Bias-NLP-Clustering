The housing industry has experienced its share of ups and downs over the last few years. While many of the issues plaguing the industry were devastating for homeowners (record foreclosures, underwater mortgages, lender scandals), one bright spot has been affordable mortgage rates.

But low rates don’t automatically mean it’s worth it to refinance.

What does refinancing mean? Refinancing a home means replacing your current mortgage loan with a completely new one. You can do so with the same lender or a new one. Either way, it essentially means starting over with a brand-new loan term, which is why you don’t want to make the decision in haste simply because rates are low.

When should you refinance? Are you happy with your mortgage rate? If you purchased your home before the housing crisis, the current rate is likely at least 1 percentage point lower than yours. This could be a good reason to refinance.

Also, if you started with an adjustable rate mortgage and now want to get into a lower fixed mortgage rate, you might think it’s time to refinance.

Refinancing a home requires you to repeat much of the original steps followed when purchasing your home, including providing income and asset verification, as well as proof of a good credit report and score.

Many borrowers assume that because they’ve paid the closing costs with their original loan, there are no fees associated with refinancing. Unfortunately, you will have to pay closing costs on your new loan if you want to refinance.

If the money you save on your new mortgage can actually recoup the closing costs within 24 months or less, and you also plan to keep the home at least that long, it might be worth it. Otherwise, the effort and money that goes into the process is likely not worth your time.
