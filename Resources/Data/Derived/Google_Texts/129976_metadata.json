Asim Saleem Bajwa said in 2012 the men had been ordered by the head of the Pakistani Taliban, Mullah Fazlullah, to kill Yousafzai, who was 15 at the time.\n\nDespite serious head injuries, Yousafzai \u2014 who rose to prominence for her campaign against Taliban efforts to forcibly prevent girls from attending school \u2014 survived the attack.\n\n\"The entire gang involved in the murder attempt ... has been busted,\" Bajwa said.\n\nThe army said the detainees were from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. In addition to targeting Yousafzai, the group had also been instructed to kill other \"significant members\" of the local community, including members of an anti-Taliban \"peace committee,\" The Guardian quotes Bajwa as saying.\n\nAfter initially being treated in Pakistan, Yousafzai was transported to a hospital in the U.K., where she and her family now live.\n\nSince her recovery, Yousafzai has continued her activism. In July of last year, less than a year after the attack, she addressed the United Nations, telling the assembly that the Taliban \"thought that the bullets would silence us, but they failed.\n\n\"The terrorists thought that they would change my aims and stop my ambitions,\" she told delegates, \"but nothing changed in my life, except this: weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born.\"\n\nIn October, European lawmakers awarded her the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought.\n\nCopyright 2016 NPR.
