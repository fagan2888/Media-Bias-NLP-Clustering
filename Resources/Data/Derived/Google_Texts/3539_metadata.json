State Will Try To Execute Inmate For Second Time\n\nBy Casey Harper\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court ruled Wednesday the state could once again attempt to execute a convicted murderer and rapist after it botched the first attempt.\n\nThe court ruled 4-3 that Romell Broom, who was convicted of raping and murdering a 14-year-old girl, could again undergo lethal injection, Court News Ohio reports. The first execution was stopped prematurely in 2009 after two hours of trying to hook up the IV to get the lethal injection drugs into Broom\u2019s system. The execution team tried at least 18 insertions into both arms but could not get a stable connection to a vein.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for him to go. That\u2019s all I got to say,\u201d the girl\u2019s father told The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2009 before the first execution attempt. \u201cHe\u2019s got to go.\u201d\n\nBut that execution failed and sparked several more years of legal battles fighting to give Broom a chance to live. His lawyers argued that a second execution attempt would be double jeopardy and cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n\u201cIf the state cannot explain why the Broom execution went wrong, then the state cannot guarantee that the outcome will be different next time,\u201d Justice Judy French wrote in the dissent.\n\nBut the prosecution argued since the deadly drugs never actually entered Broom\u2019s body, there never was a first execution attempt, an argument the court agreed with in its opinion.\n\n\u201cBecause the lethal-injection drugs were never introduced into the IV lines, the execution was never commenced,\u201d the court said in its opinion. \u201cThe state also demonstrated in the executions that were conducted after September 2009 that it is committed to following the protocols as written. Because Broom\u2019s life was never at risk since the drugs were not introduced, and because the state is committed to carrying out executions in a constitutional manner, we do not believe that it would shock the public\u2019s conscience to allow the state to carry out Broom\u2019s execution.\u201d\n\nSend tips to casey@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.
