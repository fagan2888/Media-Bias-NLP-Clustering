Aetna and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia are collaborating on a new accountable care organization that represents the insurer's first pediatric ACO arrangement, the organizations announced Thursday.

Under the contract, the younger members of Aetna commercial plans in the five-county Philadelphia area and Burlington County, New Jersey, who receive care from The Children's Hospital physicians, became part of the program. This includes members up to the age of 19.

The agreement transitions more than 1,100 physicians from fee-for-service reimbursement to a value-based payment model. The physicians will be rewarded for meeting measures such as reducing potentially avoidable hospital admissions and emergency-room visits, and improving appropriate antibiotic usage.

"Aetna is engaging in hospital collaborations that promote coordinated, high-quality care, and an improved patient experience at lower costs," said Laurie Brubaker, president of Aetna's Pennsylvania operations.
