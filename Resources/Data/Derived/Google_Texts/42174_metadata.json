The parade began a half-hour earlier this year than last.\n\nBen Holmes, pipe major of Centennial State Pipes and Drums, was marching in the event for the 28th time. Holmes said the crowd appeared to be the same size as in recent years, but quieter and, he speculated, less inebriated.\n\n\u201cIt seemed that they were more interested and less boisterous,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cMaybe instead of being all drunk, they\u2019re all stoned.\u201d\n\nDrew Barker hoped so. Dressed in a camouflage kilt and armed with a peddler\u2019s license from the city and county of Denver, Barker sold glass pipes, rolling papers and lighters on the outskirts of the parade to people \u201csmoking up the green,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the first St. Patrick\u2019s Day since retail marijuana was legalized in the state of Colorado, Barker made steady sales.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a mobile head shop,\u201d Barker said.\n\nErnie Ambrose and Tony Robinson walked their 2-year-old kids to the parade to gawk at floats, grab some strands of green beads and show off flashy costumes.\n\nAmbrose was covered from neck to ankle in a lime-green velvet suit and talked through a faux mustache of the same color.\n\nPeople in similarly flashy outfits stood beside the mile-long parade route, set primarily on Wynkoop and Blake between 17th and 27th streets. It ran in the opposite direction from last year\u2019s event.\n\nIn nearly three decades of participating in the parade, Holmes said he has followed four different routes.\n\nOn Saturday, the parade rolled west past construction workers at Denver Union Station, where renovations and expansion projects began Dec. 3, 2012. Mirroring kids perched on parents\u2019 shoulders and light poles, adult bystanders climbed on chain-link fences and large orange cones at the construction site to catch a glimpse of the action.\n\nJose Uribe, a construction worker who managed the perimeter of Union Station on Saturday, found himself continually shooing people away from the safety hazards of the site.\n\nUribe described the parade as \u201cbusy and dirty,\u201d knowing that he\u2019d be picking up trash on the train station property when it was all over, just as he did after the National Western Stock Show parade in January.\n\nUribe\u2019s scowl faded as the crowd rose up in cheers for six convincing Vikings who, with a running start, rounded the corner in front of the station. The Fjellborg Vikings swung plastic axes and re-energized little kids who were beginning to realize how cold their fingers could get after two hours.\n\nAlison Noon: 303-954-1223, anoon@denverpost.com or twitter.com/alisonnoon", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Annual Denver St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade winds through LoDo", "title": "Annual Denver St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade winds through LoDo", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/15/annual-denver-st-patricks-day-parade-winds-through-lodo/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140315__BN20140313_Z00_BNCD16PARADEp1.jpg", "height": 430}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140315__BN20140313_Z00_BNCD16PARADEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-15T17:41:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:33:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb2ac\"", "article_summary": "In nearly three decades of participating in the parade, Holmes said he has followed four different routes.\nDenver\u2019s 52nd annual St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade got off to a quiet, sober start Saturday.\nOn Saturday, the parade rolled west past construction workers at Denver Union Station, where renovations and expansion projects began Dec. 3, 2012.\nOn the first St. Patrick\u2019s Day since retail marijuana was legalized in the state of Colorado, Barker made steady sales.\nJose Uribe, a construction worker who managed the perimeter of Union Station on Saturday, found himself continually shooing people away from the safety hazards of the site."}
