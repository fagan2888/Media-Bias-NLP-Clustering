Hensley collects.\n\nCityview\n\nNot much has been happening of late in Chris Godfrey\u2019s lawsuit against Gov. Terry Branstad and five other state officials named in the retaliation, defamation, extortion and discrimination proceeding.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the state officials\u2019 lawyers haven\u2019t been busy \u2014 busy billing, at least.\n\nThe LaMarca Law Group, which is representing the defendants for up to $325 an hour, submitted another bill to the state the other day. It\u2019s for $34,931.51, bringing the total paid by the taxpayers to date \u2014 by Cityview\u2019s calculations \u2014 to $907,015.97.\n\nThe four-year-old case, when you cut out the rhetoric, is really about $150,000 in pay cuts the state forced on Godfrey during what would have been the final 46 months of his fixed six-year term as head of the Iowa Workers\u2019 Compensation Board. Branstad tried to force Godfrey to resign early \u2014 it may or may not be relevant that Godfrey is a Democrat and is openly gay \u2014 and when Godfrey refused to go quietly the Governor cut the commissioner\u2019s salary by as much as the law allowed. Godfrey didn\u2019t take that well. He sued.\n\nThe suit, in Polk County District Court, has been on hold since last May, when one aspect of the case was sent to the Iowa Supreme Court for a ruling. The Supreme Court has not yet considered the issue \u2014 it\u2019s scheduled for the 2016-2017 term \u2014 and after it does the case will go back to district court. And whoever loses surely will appeal.\n\nIf the state loses, it could well be responsible not only for the million-plus in its own legal fees but for Godfrey\u2019s fees, which probably will be as much or more. He is represented by Roxanne Conlin, who is not known as a shy biller and who \u2014 just to add spice to the case \u2014 was the Democrat gubernatorial nominee who lost to Branstad in 1982.\n\nMeantime, every party except the Governor and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds has moved on. Chief of staff Jeff Boeyink, Legal Counsel Brenna Findley, Communications Director Tim Albrecht and Workforce Development Director Teresa Wahlert \u2014 all defendants \u2014 have left the Branstad administration. Godfrey himself now lives in Washington, where he is the chief judge and chairman of the Employees Compensation Appeals Board of the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nMembers of the Iowa Board of Regents rarely resign, so it was particularly odd that Mary Andringa quit the other day after just one year on the nine-member board. The chairwoman of the family-owned Vermeer Corp. in Pella said she just didn\u2019t have the time to devote to the board, and the Regents\u2019 press release noted she holds \u201cmultiple other board positions and national governmental relations roles.\u201d\n\nWhat it didn\u2019t note \u2014 and what Andringa\u2019s bio on the board site never noted and what her conflict-of-interest form didn\u2019t note until it was amended last week \u2014 was that one of those other board positions was at Herman Miller Inc., which the Iowa City Press-Citizen pointed out last week, and what it also didn\u2019t note was that Herman Miller just got a no-bid contract to supply furniture and fittings for the big new children\u2019s hospital at the university. And what it didn\u2019t note, either \u2014 and what no one seems to have noticed \u2014 was that Andringa was head of the hospital and clinics committee of the Board, which, in a way, is rather like being chairman of the board of the University of Iowa Hospitals \u2014 the hospital that gave the big, no-bid contract to the company on whose board she sits.\n\nAt last report, Andringa owned 47,467 shares of stock in Herman Miller, which is worth about $1.5 million and produces dividends of about $28,000 a year, though she does not list that stock on the amended disclosure form. According to the latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, she is paid $146,000 a year for her board services. She joined the board in 1999. In 2014, she also joined the board of Milliken and Co., a privately held company in Spartanburg, South Carolina.\n\nThe last regent to resign in mid-term was Nicole Carroll of Carroll, who moved out of state in 2014. Tom Bedell, once of Spirit Lake, resigned in the middle of his term in 2007 after he failed in a ham-handed power play on the board.\n\nMidwest Housing Equity Group filed its income tax form for 2014 the other day, and it shows that \u201cdirector and consultant\u201d Chris Hensley was paid $48,000 during the year and worked 20 hours a week for the Omaha-based company, which syndicates and sells tax credits from developers of low-income housing.\n\nNevertheless, the Des Moines City Council member didn\u2019t think the fees and directorship constituted a conflict of interest when she cast a tie-breaking vote last December to allow local developers to apply to the Iowa Finance Authority for low-income-housing tax credits. The vote raised eyebrows and hackles. And as it turned out, one of the winners of those credits uses Midwest Housing to market its credits. And that means a tidy profit for Midwest.\n\nPolk County Republicans ratified their platform the other day.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot in it about God and guns and abortion\u2014 the Republicans are for two out of three \u2014 and about gay marriage and the federal income tax, which the Republicans are against. The wide-ranging document comes out against traffic cameras \u2014 \u201cincluding red light and speed cameras\u201d \u2014 as a threat to Americans \u201cin a free society.\u201d\n\nThe county Republicans are for the death penalty, and they ungrammatically \u201csupport an individual\u2019s right to refuse vaccinations for themselves [sic] and for their [sic] children.\u201d They would eliminate the U.S. Department of Agriculture, defund the United Nations, prohibit collective bargaining on wages for public employees, repeal Obamacare, eliminate \u201cNo Child Left Behind,\u201d get rid of the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Homeland Security, \u201csignificantly narrow the scope of authority\u201d of the Environmental Protection Agency, require mandatory drug testing for welfare recipients, and defund Iowa Public Television and Iowa Public Radio.\n\nAmong other things.\n\nAn earlier version called for the elimination of direct election of United States Senators, instead going back to the days of having state legislators pick the Senators. Perhaps the county Republicans dropped that when someone pointed out to them that both U.S. Senators were Republicans \u2014 and that the Iowa Senate is controlled by Democrats.\n\nCirculation at The Des Moines Register is still slipping. Print and digital circulation of the daily Register averaged 84,012 in the fourth quarter of last year; the Sunday figure was 137,799, according to figures the newspaper submitted to the industry\u2019s Alliance for Audited Media. There\u2019s no exact year-to-year comparison, but six months earlier the averages were 141,146 for Sunday and 84,333 for weekdays.\n\nThe drops in recent years have been precipitous. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Sunday circulation averaged 215,881; daily circulation averaged 105,374.\n\nIn the four-county metro area \u2014 Polk, Story, Dallas and Warren counties, which the newspaper considers its home market \u2014 Sunday print circulation now averages 73,102, daily 44,382. The report doesn\u2019t break down digital sales by region because it\u2019s hard to know where a digital subscriber lives. As of six months ago \u2014 the latest figures available \u2014 the Sunday Register had circulation of 63,344 in Polk County, going into about a third of the households; the daily number stood at 40,854, covering less than a quarter of the households.\n\nThe two-year Cityview audit, by the Circulation Verification Council, also was released last week. It showed the print edition with an average net circulation of 26,411. Almost all of that is in Polk County. Cityview, which, of course, is free, has kept its circulation at that number for several years.\n\nAnd last week, too, Cityview owner and publisher Shane Goodman was named Publisher of the Year by the Association of Free Community Papers. That\u2019s a big deal.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Perhaps the county Republicans dropped that when someone pointed out to them that both U.S.\nGodfrey didn\u2019t take that well.\nMembers of the Iowa Board of Regents rarely resign, so it was particularly odd that Mary Andringa quit the other day after just one year on the nine-member board.\nPolk County Republicans ratified their platform the other day.\nIf the state loses, it could well be responsible not only for the million-plus in its own legal fees but for Godfrey\u2019s fees, which probably will be as much or more."}
