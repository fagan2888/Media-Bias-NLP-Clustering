Paz-Lobo, 29, was driving east on Interstate 80 south of Menlo in Adair County about 8:15 p.m. when the 2011 Chevrolet Camaro crossed the median and entered the westbound lanes, Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Bryan Michelsen said.\n\nThe car then rolled nearly a quarter of a mile into a field on the north side of the Interstate.\n\nThe passengers were Javier Martinez-Martin, 41; Denis Juvenal Sorto-Martinez, 25; Jose B. Martinez, 21; and Erick Rauda, 19.\n\nAll five were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nMartinez-Martin was the only one wearing a seat belt, but none of the men was ejected, Michelsen said.\n\nThe pavement was wet but not icy at the time of the accident. There is a curve in the Interstate at the site of the accident, and the car appears to have missed the curve, he said.\n\nThe Grand Island men were among 11 people who died in vehicle crashes and collisions on Iowa highways on Friday and Saturday. The Iowa State Patrol believes icy roads were a factor in most of the other accidents.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "High speed and alcohol use likely were behind a single-vehicle rollover crash on Interstate 80 in Iowa on Friday night in which five Grand Island, Neb., men died, authorities said.", "title": "5 Nebraska men killed in one-car Iowa rollover crash", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/nebraska-men-killed-in-one-car-iowa-rollover-crash/article_273138d2-b48b-56c7-81f3-30f97e0a9e77.html", "image": "http://omaha.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/og-image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "High speed and alcohol use likely were behind a single-vehicle rollover crash on Interstate 80 in Iowa on Friday night in which five Grand Island, Neb., men died, authorities said.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3acf\"", "article_summary": "The Iowa State Patrol believes icy roads were a factor in most of the other accidents.\nMENLO, Iowa \u2014 High speed and alcohol use likely were behind a single-vehicle rollover crash on Interstate 80 in Iowa on Friday night in which five Grand Island, Neb., men died, authorities said.\nThe Grand Island men were among 11 people who died in vehicle crashes and collisions on Iowa highways on Friday and Saturday.\nMartinez-Martin was the only one wearing a seat belt, but none of the men was ejected, Michelsen said.\nAlex J.
