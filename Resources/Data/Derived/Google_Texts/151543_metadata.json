Based on the forecast, it was pretty definitive we were going to have the day off,\u0094 said Brannick.\n\nWith the approval of the school\u0092s academic board, the principal last Wednesday morning informed the 900 students, as well their parents, faculty and staff via mass phone calls, e-mails, the school website and other social media outlets that the co-educational high school would have its first \u0093cyber day\u0094 of classes as an experiment for off-setting the increasing number of class days lost to severe winter weather. As of Feb. 12, the high school had had six snow days and needed to make up four to meet the Pennsylvania School Code for 180 instructional days by June 30.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u0093We\u0092re doing this as a pilot to really leverage the technology we have in place as a school to use efficiently in cases like this with inclement weather so we don\u0092t lose instructional days from the calendar,\u0094 said Brannick.\n\nAll students are already equipped by the school with computerized iPad Minis that they can take home with them. On a cyber day, they can use GradeConnect or My Big Campus computer web-based applications to receive assignments for that day from all of their teachers by 9 a.m. The cyber school day ends at about 5 p.m., noted the principal.\n\n\u0093We ask the teachers to have assignments be a little more in-depth, a higher-ordered thinking in approach. For example, it shouldn\u0092t be to just read an article and respond to five questions. It should require students to provide real world assessment to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the topic,\u0094 said Brannick.\n\nEach student is expected to have six or seven assignments to complete from home during the cyber school day.\n\n\u0093Many teachers were online Thursday reviewing work as it was submitted. Each teacher has 150 to 160 students over five classes, so they were pretty busy getting that number of assignments in a short time frame. Normally, they would be staggered throughout the week,\u0094 said Brannick.\n\nCyber \u0093office hours\u0094 are even provided from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. during which teachers answer students\u0092 questions via e-mail or chatting through the My Big Campus program. Students who are sick are expected to follow the school\u0092s normal call-out procedure and to make up the cyber assignments upon return to school.\n\nLoss of power due to icy and windy conditions is taken into consideration for both students and teachers, noted Brannick. Monday was the second cyber day, which was scheduled for then because the Catholic high school students would not have the public school buses for transportation due to the Presidents Day holiday. As it was in progress, Brannick was assessing feedback from last week\u0092s first cyber session, which he noted was positive overall.\n\n\u0093We still need to look at specific data for participation rate. The teachers have been very happy with the depth and quality of work students have produced and the parents have been very happy for the students to be engaged in school work on what would normally be a school day,\u0094 said Brannick.\n\nWith students, faculty and staff members traveling to the school from Delaware, Chester and Philadelphia counties, the cyber day enables them to avoid hazardous driving conditions, he noted.\n\nThe principal said the cyber day project is valuable not only as a way to complete classes from home when the weather creates dangerous travel conditions, it is a way to prepare students for the cybernetic world of computers in which they will have to learn to function for their jobs.\n\n\u0093We want to make sure we help them prepare for that world,\u0094 said the principal.\n\nHe can relate to the challenges of launching large cybernetic projects, such as the Affordable Care Act\u0092s Health Insurance Marketplace, just in the glitches he is trying to address with the cyber day of classes.\n\n\u0093We are learning as this goes on and we know it\u0092s not going to be perfect. We have a lot to work on,\u0094 said Brannick.\n\nThe principal said Bonner-Prendie is the first of the 17 high schools in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia to experiment with cyber days, which have also been tried at Catholic high schools in the Pittsburgh area.\n\n\u0093We received permission from the archdiocese to run this as a pilot. We will re-engage after we get feedback and data as to how the cyber days worked, determine as a system if a project like this is appropriate, then discuss it with the archdiocese and the state as to whether they count as instructional days,\u0094 said Brannick.\n\nHe noted that, judging from the latest weather prediction, Bonner-Prendie students may just get another chance to try attending classes from home via computer.\n\n\u0093Knowing Mother Nature, she has bigger plans for possibly the next one,\u0094 said the principal.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Educational technology, Educational technology news, Primos Educational technology news, PA Educational technology news, US Educational technology news, world Educational technology news.", "title": "Bonner-Prendie principal pleased with cyber day", "og": {"url": "http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20140217/NEWS/140219613", "image": {"width": "498px", "identifier": "http://www.delcotimes.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DC/20140217/NEWS/140219613/AR/0/AR-140219613.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "480px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Bonner-Prendie principal pleased with cyber day"}, "twitter": {"domain": "delcotimes.com", "description": "Cyber classes came early last week to the students of Monsignor Bonner and Archbishop Prendergast High School in the Drexel Hill section of Upper Darby.", "title": "Bonner-Prendie principal pleased with cyber day", "url": "http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20140217/NEWS/140219613", "image": {"src": "http://www.delcotimes.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DC/20140217/NEWS/140219613/AR/0/AR-140219613.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@delcotimes", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563336340", "iphone": "id508962453", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.thedelawarecountydailytime"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Educational technology, Educational technology news, Primos Educational technology news, PA Educational technology news, US Educational technology news, world Educational technology news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Cyber classes came early last week to the students of Monsignor Bonner and Archbishop Prendergast High School in the Drexel Hill section of Upper Darby."}, "article_summary": "\u0093As the nor\u0092easter developed a week ago, we began discussing internally as to whether to use Thursday as a cyber day, our first cyber day.\nThe cyber school day ends at about 5 p.m., noted the principal.\nEach student is expected to have six or seven assignments to complete from home during the cyber school day.\nMonday was the second cyber day, which was scheduled for then because the Catholic high school students would not have the public school buses for transportation due to the Presidents Day holiday.\nOn a cyber day, they can use GradeConnect or My Big Campus computer web-based applications to receive assignments for that day from all of their teachers by 9 a.m."}
