They\u2019ve dubbed it \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nNairobi City County Government insists most of these improvements are part of a strategic plan for the city created long before Obama\u2019s visit was announced. But Kenyans aren\u2019t buying it. Everything has clearly ramped up, exacerbating a long-held belief here that the government is rarely moved to action for Kenyans themselves, just visiting luminaries.\n\nThey\u2019re voicing much of their frustration on Ma3route, the popular mobile communication platform that collects and disseminates traffic information, in a mix of English, Swahili, and Sheng.\n\n@Ma3Route @POTUS @_mahungu why clean up our city for foreign guests. Do they pay taxes? We don\u2019t deserve decent standards? \u2014 Mulanja Nduu (@MulanjaNduu) July 6, 2015\n\nSoon after insisting all the beautification was pre-planned, Leah Oyake-Ombis, the chief officer for environment and forestry with Nairobi City County Government and one of the officials overseeing city improvements, says, \u201cFor sure you would not want the American president come to Nairobi and then where he is passing through, there is a pothole. That will not auger well for our government and therefore those areas become our priority.\u201d\n\nCatching on to where improvements are happening, Nairobi residents are sarcastically requesting that Obama work in a visit to their neighborhoods, too, so that the nearest nightmare road might get some cement poured.\n\nhe should take a tour on waiyaki way, that road really needs maitenance n expansion #KenyansMessageToObama via @itskaywinchestr \u2014 Ma3Route (@Ma3Route) July 6, 2015\n\nNow that Mombasa rd has been beautified, pls change ur mind and say u\u2019ll use Jogoo rd so~more \u21e2 http://t.co/kZqslFiZNr via @MagazetiniKenya \u2014 Ma3Route (@Ma3Route) July 6, 2015\n\n\u201cThe focus is on this corridor because that\u2019s the corridor the visiting president will use,\u201d says Oyake-Ombis, referring to Mombasa Road, Uhuru Highway, and Limuru Road, which together connect the international airport to the United Nations, where the Global Entrepreneurship Summit will be held July 25-26.\n\nResidents just want Nairobi to work\u2014for their sake, not Obama\u2019s. During the visit itself, taxi drivers may be among the hardest hit. In a city where \u201cSorry, I was stuck in a jam\u201d is an acceptable excuse any day of the week, at any time of day, things would have to be really bad for drivers to plan to stay home.\n\nBut many of them plan to do just that, says Evans Kathimbu, a taxi driver in Nairobi for six years. He says he\u2019ll either stay home or take jobs outside Nairobi, rather than spend all his time bumper to bumper on Uhuru Highway. \u201cPeople are proposing it be a public holiday,\u201d he says. Lately he\u2019s only been able to take two or three clients a day because of how long it takes to move around. When John Kerry, the US secretary of state, visited in May, a 25-minute trip took Kathimbu three hours, he says.\n\nThe GES2015 has made me make my morning runs more frequent @Ma3Route We may have to walk 2 work/home 4 the 3 days cause of traffic snarlup \u2014 Jazzy jeff (@njuguna254) July 8, 2015\n\nSurely: Obama is still days away and this is what commuters in Westlands have to put up with. Waiyaki way. @Kangemi pic.twitter.com/H444Fz6Taa \u2014 Prince Emro (@PrinceEmro) July 8, 2015\n\nThe frustration about the surface-level improvements is building. Kenyans suspect the roads, rushed as they are, will fall apart in months. They know Obama won\u2019t see neighborhoods like Eastleigh, the predominantly Somali neighborhood where trash collection sometimes doesn\u2019t happen for weeks.\n\nNo one ever bothered to plant the medians before. The airport road, recently fixed, wasn\u2019t touched in the past six years Kathimbu worked as a driver. He\u2019s seen enough roads fall apart to not get excited about the newly smooth major thoroughfares.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to cheat showing Kenya how it is,\u201d says Kathimbu, who lives near Eastleigh. \u201cThat\u2019s what they are trying to do.\u201d\n\nSign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief \u2014 the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Potholed, sidewalk-deficient Nairobi is getting an emergency facelift ahead of US president Barack Obama\u2019s visit later this month.
