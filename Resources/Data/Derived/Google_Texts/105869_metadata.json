Clearly, Jeb is the choice of liberal Democrats. Perhaps they inherently sense that Hillary Clinton would make short work of him in a general election.\n\nJennifer Senior writes for New York Magazine:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAnyone who\u2019s familiar with Jeb, though, doesn\u2019t seem nearly as fixated on this episode as members of the national press corps. They know that freestyling is his natural political mode. As governor, Jeb genuinely enjoyed mixing it up with local reporters, almost always fielding more queries than his staff would have liked. \u201cHe\u2019d do a five-minute gaggle\u201d \u2014 mediaspeak for a mini press conference \u2014 \u201cand you\u2019d get five stories,\u201d says Adam C. Smith, the political editor of the Tampa Bay Times. \u201cHe\u2019d think out loud, he liked to banter. Compared to Charlie Crist, who never said anything, he was fun to cover.\u201d But now, it seems, the very qualities that served Jeb well with the Florida press \u2014 spontaneity, authenticity \u2014 are serving him poorly on the national stage. Which is a shame, in its way: One of the pleasures of being around him, day to day, on the stump, is his enthusiasm for speaking off the cuff. (And I report this, it should be noted, as a person who agrees with exactly nothing the governor says.)\n\nIn fact, they want you to believe Jeb is a super-duper conservative, as if they even know what that means, let alone see it as a good thing: \u201cJeb Bush is more ruthless than he looks, more conservative than moderates like to believe, and possibly more appealing to Latinos than Marco,\u201d they tell us. Talk about a hard sell.\n\nYet, in the article you\u2019ll find this:\n\n\u2026 During the past eight years, while Jeb\u2019s been absent from politics, a whole movement \u2014 the tea party \u2014 began to bloom. Yet rather than pandering to it, or even being mindful of it, the governor is running in outright defiance of the movement\u2019s aesthetics and (in some very notable cases) intellectual preferences, as if it didn\u2019t exist at all. This could be the biggest challenge Jeb faces, and it\u2019s one entirely of his own making. When asked if Loretta Lynch, Obama\u2019s nominee for attorney general, should be confirmed, he answered that, yes, she should: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t always be partisan.\u201d He has steadfastly refused to sign Grover Norquist\u2019s pledge not to raise taxes. He has only slightly modified his views on Common Core, which the tea party despises \u2014 an irony given how many conservatives originally supported it, and how incensed the teachers unions were by Jeb\u2019s radical education reforms. He talks passionately about legalizing the status of undocumented immigrants, which likely infuriates the tea party even more. Asked if he tips at Chipotle, where Hillary did not, he simply replies that he likes to make his own Mexican food. He leaves red meat on the table. And he seldom tosses it to audiences.\n\nWhat Democrats see in Jeb is more likely a pliable Republican, the kind they know would be little different than a Democrat were he to win the White House. And that\u2019s precisely what the current GOP base is tired of, perhaps explaining why NY Mag\u2018s favorite Republican is struggling among genuine conservatives\u2014as opposed to liberal writers based in New York.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's hard to tell that the New York Magazine piece on Jeb Bush was written by someone who \"agrees with exactly nothing the governor says.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "It's hard to tell that the New York Magazine piece on Jeb Bush was written by someone who \"agrees with exactly nothing the governor says.\"", "title": "Jeb Bush: The GOP Candidate Democrats Want - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Jeb-Bush-Michael-Bloomberg-education-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/07/jeb-bush-the-gop-candidate-democrats-want/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's hard to tell that the New York Magazine piece on Jeb Bush was written by someone who \"agrees with exactly nothing the governor says.\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Jeb-Bush-Michael-Bloomberg-education-AP.jpg", "title": "Jeb Bush: The GOP Candidate Democrats Want - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Common Core, democrats, Education, immigration, Jeb Bush, New York Magazine, Tea Party,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Hillary Clinton,jeb bush", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Tea Party", "published_time": "2015-06-07T16:32:26-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0adc\"", "article_summary": "As governor, Jeb genuinely enjoyed mixing it up with local reporters, almost always fielding more queries than his staff would have liked.\nHe talks passionately about legalizing the status of undocumented immigrants, which likely infuriates the tea party even more.\nYet, in the article you\u2019ll find this:\u2026 During the past eight years, while Jeb\u2019s been absent from politics, a whole movement \u2014 the tea party \u2014 began to bloom.\nWhat Democrats see in Jeb is more likely a pliable Republican, the kind they know would be little different than a Democrat were he to win the White House.\nClearly, Jeb is the choice of liberal Democrats."}
