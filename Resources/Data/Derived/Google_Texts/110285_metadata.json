YouTube\n\nHugo Cornellier claims he was \u201ctaking selfies before it was mainstream\u201d on his YouTube page.\n\nThe teenager has brought together art and selfies in a time lapse video that documents him aging over the course of seven years \u2014 and now his video has gone viral. Cornellier shows how selfies aren\u2019t always a form of narcissism or simply a new \u201ctrend\u201d of the younger generation, but can be made into a form of documentation, self-portrait, and even a personal history of sorts.\n\nCornellier began taking selfies when he was 12, and continued to do so every day \u2014 in varying outfits, positions, and rooms, often joined by random visiting friends \u2014 until he was 19. In just over a minute, you can see what life looks like in fast forward \u2014 and watch the subtle facial changes that occur bit by bit every day.\n\nCornellier isn\u2019t the first to undertake this type of project. One Boston College photography professor, Karl Baden, decided to complete an art project that involved taking black and white photos of himself every day for 24 years, eight months, and 11 days \u2014 back in 1987. Baden\u2019s portraits were assembled into a two-minute video in which you can visualize his wrinkles growing.\n\nAging is a gradual process that occurs every day, and these videos are a reminder of how fleeting youth can be.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "aging, selfies, selfie every day", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "This is what it looks like to take a selfie every day for seven years.", "title": "Teen Takes Selfies Every Day For 7 Years [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/selfie-every-day-7-years-teen-makes-video-showing-changes-over-time-297952", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/13/time-lapse.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This is what it looks like to take a selfie every day for seven years.", "title": "Teen Takes Selfies Every Day For 7 Years [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/selfie-every-day-7-years-teen-makes-video-showing-changes-over-time-297952", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/13/time-lapse.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/13/time-lapse.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-13T14:47:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-13T14:47:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This is what it looks like to take a selfie every day for seven years."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd28d4\"", "article_summary": "Hugo Cornellier took \"selfies\" every day for seven years, then compiled it into a short time lapse video.\nThe teenager has brought together art and selfies in a time lapse video that documents him aging over the course of seven years \u2014 and now his video has gone viral.\nYouTubeHugo Cornellier claims he was \u201ctaking selfies before it was mainstream\u201d on his YouTube page.\nBaden\u2019s portraits were assembled into a two-minute video in which you can visualize his wrinkles growing.\nAging is a gradual process that occurs every day, and these videos are a reminder of how fleeting youth can be."}
