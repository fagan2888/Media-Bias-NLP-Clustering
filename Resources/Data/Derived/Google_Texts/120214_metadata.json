The new five-story building will house U.S. Steel\u2019s 800 headquarters employees for at least 18 years, with an option to extend the lease beyond that.\n\nThe plan solves several interlocking problems for U.S. Steel, the Penguins and Pittsburgh.\n\nThe steel giant sold its skyscraping headquarters building for $250 million to a New York investment firm in April 2011 and a year later, U.S. Steel announced it would likely move out of the building.\n\nWhat concerned Pittsburghers is whether U.S. Steel would follow Alcoa out of town or greatly reduce its presence, as happened when ketchup-maker H.J. Heinz Co. moved production out of the city years before being sold to Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital last year. Heinz headquarters remain in Pittsburgh.\n\nWhen he took office earlier this year, Mayor Bill Peduto met Longhi and said, \u201cI will not be the mayor that lost U.S. Steel.\u201d\n\nEnter the Penguins, who have been trying to redevelop the former Civic Arena site a few hundred yards up the hill from U.S. Steel\u2019s downtown headquarters, but a world away economically.\n\nThe Penguins didn\u2019t exist when the arena was built in 1961, but the team, which moved into the building as an expansion franchise in 1967, has borne the negative legacy of that development. Some 8,000 black residents were relocated to build the arena, which effectively cut off the rest of the predominantly black Hill District from the city\u2019s downtown economic engine. The resulting blight became the sad inspiration for the TV drama \u201cHill Street Blues.\u201d\n\nThe Penguins finally reached a deal in the fall on a $440 redevelopment plan that will include retail shops, housing and office space on the former arena site. The development will be partially funded by more than $30 million in state grants and a local tax incentive program that will funnel some development revenue to infrastructure improvements, job training and other programs to benefit the Hill District. A fixed percentage of the new housing spawned by the development will be affordable, too.\n\n\u201cDevelopment of the former Civic Arena site is truly a transformational opportunity for U.S. Steel, the city of Pittsburgh, the Hill District and the Pittsburgh Penguins,\u201d Longhi said.\n\n\u201cWe usually say it\u2019s a great day for hockey,\u201d Penguins president and CEO David Morehouse said, referring to one of the team\u2019s marketing slogans, \u201cbut today I want to say it\u2019s a great day for Pittsburgh.\u201d\n\nLonghi and the others won\u2019t say how much the new headquarters will cost, but it will occupy 250,000 square feet in a 268,000 square-foot building, the rest being retail shops, Morehouse said. The site will also include a steel museum, to chronicle the company and city\u2019s role in the industry worldwide.\n\nJames Craft, a business professor at the University of Pittsburgh, said U.S. Steel\u2019s decision is a \u201cvery excellent statement\u201d as the city continues its transition from a manufacturing giant to a medical, high-tech and service-oriented economy.\n\n\u201cIt gives a statement of where we were and remain in part now,\u201d Craft said. \u201cAnd it shows Pittsburgh has an ability to serve a large, international corporation even as we\u2019re emerging in this new economy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "United States Steel Corp. announced Monday it will build its new world headquarters in Pittsburgh as part of the ongoing redevelopment of the former Civic Arena site by the NHL's Penguins.", "Author": "JOE MANDAK", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "United States Steel Corp. announced Monday it will build its new world headquarters in Pittsburgh as part of the ongoing redevelopment of the former Civic Arena site by the NHL\u2019s Penguins.", "title": "US Steel to build new headquarters in Pittsburgh", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/24/us-steel-plans-major-announcement-with-penguins/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/24/bb6afa4334275b2e660f6a7067003e4b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/24/bb6afa4334275b2e660f6a7067003e4b.jpg", "title": "US Steel to build new headquarters in Pittsburgh", "description": "United States Steel Corp. announced Monday it will build its new world headquarters in Pittsburgh as part of the ongoing redevelopment of the former Civic Arena site by the NHL's Penguins.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf051\"", "article_summary": "PITTSBURGH (AP) - United States Steel Corp. announced Monday it will build its new world headquarters in Pittsburgh as part of the ongoing redevelopment of the former Civic Arena site by the NHL\u2019s Penguins.\n\u201cDevelopment of the former Civic Arena site is truly a transformational opportunity for U.S. Steel, the city of Pittsburgh, the Hill District and the Pittsburgh Penguins,\u201d Longhi said.\nThe steel giant sold its skyscraping headquarters building for $250 million to a New York investment firm in April 2011 and a year later, U.S. Steel announced it would likely move out of the building.\nThe plan solves several interlocking problems for U.S. Steel, the Penguins and Pittsburgh.\nU.S. Steel Chief Executive Officer Mario Longhi said the new headquarters will open by September 2017, by which time the company\u2019s 50-year lease will expire at the 64-story U.S. Steel Tower downtown, the city\u2019s tallest building."}
