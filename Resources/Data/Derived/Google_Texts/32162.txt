The various terms used to describe the epochal shift in healthcare – population-driven healthcare, value-based healthcare, consumer-directed healthcare, to name just a few – have one thing in common: everybody's expectations about more efficient care are higher.

Policy initiatives under the Affordable Care Act, such as higher out-of-pocket costs to consumers, as well as the emergence of mobile, social and cloud technologies, are compelling consumers and payers to demand more efficiency in the underpinnings of the healthcare market. For provider organizations that are unprepared, there are many pain points. For those that are prepared, new avenues of possibility for streamlining their operations are emerging.
