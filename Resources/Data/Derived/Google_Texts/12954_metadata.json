(WOLO) \u2013 Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson addressed a full gymnasium at Brookland Baptist Church in West Columbia Monday night.\n\nThe town hall was hosted by South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, in conjunction with the Conservative Leadership Project.\n\nA.G. Wilson threw a variety of questions Carson\u2019s way, asking for specific answers to how he\u2019d solve the border crisis, the Affordable Care Act and President Obama\u2019s executive orders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a polished politician,\u201d Carson said to media after the event. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna have these nice crisp, debate-type answers, because I really feel like the issues are much bigger.\u201d\n\nDr. Carson is a former neurosurgeon and best-selling author. In the latest CNN Poll of Polls average in Iowa, he ranks in fourth behind Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and Marco Rubio. Carson has 10% of the votes, while Cruz has 27%. Iowa\u2019s caucus is two weeks from today.\n\nCarson says our youngest generation faces a future, more grim than ever before.\n\n\u201cI also hope that the people understand that where we are right now is very serious,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at the precipice, and we\u2019re about to go over the precipice. If we go over it, I do not think that we will be able to return.\u201d\n\nCarson says he trusts Americans to do the right thing, but he warns, be weary of listening to the media to help guide your decision.
