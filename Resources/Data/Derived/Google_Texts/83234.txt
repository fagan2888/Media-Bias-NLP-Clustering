LOWER LAKE–

A man suspected of arson was arrested Sunday evening by Cal Fire investigators in Lake County, the state firefighting agency announced Monday morning.

Juan Ramos Silva, 49, was booked into jail on the charge of unlawfully causing fire to forest land.

Cal Fire was quick to note that the fire Silva is accused of starting is not related to the massive Rocky Fire or the fast-growing Jerusalem Fire. The cause of those two fires is still under investigation, Cal Fire information officer Amy Head wrote.

“This is the fifth arrest our officers have made in just the past two weeks,” Cal Fire Director Ken Pimlott said in a news release.

Pimlott did not specify if those five arrests were state-wide or within a certain area.
