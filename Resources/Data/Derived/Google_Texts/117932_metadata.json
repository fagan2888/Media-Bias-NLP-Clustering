That had never happened before at a presidential press conference, and the reaction from most corners was one of approval \u2013 political journalism has long had a backslappy aura of \u201cboys club\u201d bullshit attached to it, and anything that helps break down that nonsense can\u2019t be anything but positive.\n\nNot everyone was on board with the program, however. Howard Kurtz, opining from his perch of professional exile at Fox News, thought Obama got off too easy at the press conference, and wrote a fantastically dumb column laying out his objections.\n\nObama skated in a year-end news conference, easily handling questions that were bland, tentative or rambling. This is not unrelated to the fact that he skipped the front-row TV correspondents\u2014Jonathan Karl, Ed Henry, Major Garrett\u2014who tend to ask more confrontational and, yes, theatrical questions. And it most decidedly had nothing to do with the president\u2019s unusual move of fielding questions only from female reporters. It\u2019s not how the queries were delivered, it\u2019s how they were framed.\n\nLook, Kurtz is not \u2013 repeat: NOT \u2013 arguing that the poor quality of the questions had something to do with the fact that Obama only called on women. He\u2019s observing that the questions would have been better if Obama had called on some of the seasoned bros in attendance. He\u2019s not saying it has something to do with gender; he\u2019s just saying the three men he mentioned would have done it better than the eight women who were called on. So don\u2019t call it \u201csexism.\u201d Call it some other word with the same exact definition.\n\nWhile it was nice for Kurtz to bang the drum on behalf of his gender, he really didn\u2019t need to. After the press conference, Ed Henry of Fox News \u2013 one of the bros so cruelly snubbed \u2013 took it on his own initiative to complain that the questions weren\u2019t up to his professional standard. \u201cThe questions were trailing off. The president was almost like, let me remember what you asked because it was so unmemorable. He\u2019s the president of the United States!\u201d Come on, ladies! Start taking this seriously. This is THE PRESIDENT. He\u2019s not going to ask himself about Benghazi.\n\nAnyway, let\u2019s get back to Kurtz and the specific beefs he had with what was asked of the president on Friday. \u201cYou would have no idea from watching that presser that Obama had taken hugely controversial unilateral action on Cuba, immigration and climate change,\u201d Kurtz wrote. Zero idea! None at all. Well, let\u2019s go to the transcript and take a look at this question from the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Colleen McCain Nelson:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Howard Kurtz explains to female reporters how to do their jobs right, with insider tricks like \"quote Republicans\"", "title": "Howie Kurtz mansplains the news: Fox\u2019s media reporter has some advice for lady journalists", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Howard Kurtz explains to female reporters how to do their jobs right, with insider tricks like \"quote Republicans\"", "title": "Howie Kurtz mansplains the news: Fox\u2019s media reporter has some advice for lady journalists", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/23/howie_kurtz_mansplains_the_news_foxs_media_reporter_has_some_advice_for_lady_journalists/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/howard_kurtz2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Howard Kurtz explains to female reporters how to do their jobs right, with insider tricks like \"quote Republicans\"", "title": "Howie Kurtz mansplains the news: Fox\u2019s media reporter has some advice for lady journalists", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/howard_kurtz2.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, conservative media, Fox News, Howard Kurtz, Media Criticism, Sexism, white house press corps", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1fc3\"", "article_summary": "Anyway, let\u2019s get back to Kurtz and the specific beefs he had with what was asked of the president on Friday.\nWhile it was nice for Kurtz to bang the drum on behalf of his gender, he really didn\u2019t need to.\nHoward Kurtz, opining from his perch of professional exile at Fox News, thought Obama got off too easy at the press conference, and wrote a fantastically dumb column laying out his objections.\nObama skated in a year-end news conference, easily handling questions that were bland, tentative or rambling.\nHe\u2019s observing that the questions would have been better if Obama had called on some of the seasoned bros in attendance."}
