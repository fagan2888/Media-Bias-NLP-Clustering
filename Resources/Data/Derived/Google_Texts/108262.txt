Jimmy Kimmel has come a long way from giving away Ben Stein’s money and having girls jump on trampolines. He’s transitioned from overweight basic cable shock jock to the best late night host working today. Dating Sarah Silverman will do that to a fella.

And Kimmel has upgraded again. This time, he gets to enjoy the company of a bevy of swimsuit models as they reveal the cover for this year’s Sports Illustrared Swimsuit Issue, an honor that has been humbly bestowed upon David Letterman for the previous six issues.

Fortunately for Kimmel, his hours haven’t been cut due to Obamacare. This week he’s the only show in town.

And after last year’s Late Show “Top Ten,” I think we can all say that it’s for the best Kimmel has first crack at a pride of swim smokes.

In his 2009 interview of cover model Bar Refaeli, Letterman came off more like an inquisitive father than witty late night host, asking more questions about her relationship with then-boyfriend Leonardo DiCaprio than how she prepared for the grueling days enduring 75 degree temperatures in San Pedro.

Kimmel would have produced a viral video to help find Bar a husband.

In 2011, Irina Shayk came off more as a Bond femme fatale than an inspiring success story of the United States immigration system.



Kimmel was pretty harsh on the amenities of Sochi at the Olympics. For Irina, though, Sochi ain’t so bad.

Letterman gave Kate a hard time about how, even though she posed in a swimsuit issue, she didn’t actually wear a swimsuit. Petty details, Dave, petty details!

I got your back, Kate.

We could perhaps witness an unprecedented three-peat if Kate Upton wrangles a third-straight SI cover, which needless to say would be delightful.

But if SI wanted make 7 percent of its annual revenue on a single issue this year by using a fresh face, my pick is Hannah Davis.

If New Jersey and Chris Christie can make a 2014 comeback, Hannah Davis can too.
