You can\u2019t solve our foreign policy problems until you understand that the military\u2019s purpose is to defend lives and property on the homeland \u2014 not fight international villainy. You can\u2019t solve the immigration problem unless you understand that people, like goods and services, should be allowed maximum freedom of movement. (Mr. Paul, like other Republicans, instead wants to strengthen the borders.) You can\u2019t make criminal justice truly just until you limit the reasons government fines and imprisons us to true crimes against persons or property, not minor \u201cquality of life\u201d infractions or life choices (like drug use) that the government simply disapproves of.....\n\nDo libertarian ideals sound heady, even ridiculous, to many Americans? Sure. That\u2019s precisely why we need a candidate who will articulate them. Who else will challenge both parties\u2019 complacent assumptions \u2014 and their shared devotion to ever-increasing spending on problems that exceed the proper scope of government? Since Ronald Reagan, Republicans have been as bad as Democrats in defining what government is for \u2014 what it can and can\u2019t rightly do.\n\nCalling for some limits on government intrusion here, and some spending cuts there, isn\u2019t enough. America needs a political champion willing to stretch beyond the merely practical. It\u2019s a tricky position for anyone running for president to try to move the majority in your direction. But if liberty is your highest value, it\u2019s essential.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "I appear in this morning's New York Times discussing the extent and depth of how Rand Paul has argued as a libertarian as a presidential candidate, and", "title": "Brian Doherty in The New York Times On Rand Paul and the Need for Hardcore Libertarianism in Presidential Politics", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/04/21/brian-doherty-in-the-new-york-times-on-r", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14296045199988.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14296045199988.jpg", "title": "Brian Doherty in <em>The New York Times</em> On Rand Paul and the Need for Hardcore Libertarianism in Presidential Politics", "description": "I appear in this morning's New York Times discussing the extent and depth of how Rand Paul has argued as a libertarian as a presidential candidate, and why libertarians crave, and America needs, a more hardcore libertarian champion in president", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@reason"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-04-21T08:30:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/brian-doherty"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "You can\u2019t solve the immigration problem unless you understand that people, like goods and services, should be allowed maximum freedom of movement.\nI appear in this morning's New York Times discussing the extent and depth of how Rand Paul has argued as a libertarian as a presidential candidate, and why libertarians crave, and America needs, a more hardcore libertarian champion in presidential politics.\nThe conclusion:Libertarianism\u2019s relevance to the problems that bedevil the Republican Party, and America, goes beyond spending.\nYou can\u2019t solve our foreign policy problems until you understand that the military\u2019s purpose is to defend lives and property on the homeland \u2014 not fight international villainy.\nWho else will challenge both parties\u2019 complacent assumptions \u2014 and their shared devotion to ever-increasing spending on problems that exceed the proper scope of government?"}
