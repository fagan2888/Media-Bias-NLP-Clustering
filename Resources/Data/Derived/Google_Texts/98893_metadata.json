Do the secret handshake. And kiss the ring.\n\nOtherwise, forget having green activists attach their environmental seal of approval to the wood products harvested from your forest.\n\nThat\u2019s essentially the message organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace will be in a position to transmit if the U.S. timber industry submits to a monopoly in forest certification, free market economists argue.\n\nThe \u201cBig Green\u201d lobby\u2014mainly the organizations listed above plus the World Wildlife Fund, Rainforest Action Network and a few others\u2014wants a relatively new player to assume monopoly control of the market.\n\nPay your protection money. Do the secret handshake. And kiss the ring.\n\nToday, three share the action: the Sustainable Forest Initiative, seen as the closest to the forest industry of the three, the American Tree Farm System and the new guys \u2014 the Forest Stewardship Council.\n\nThe concept of forest certification initially gained traction during the 1992 United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, when it was adopted as part of a \u201csmart growth\u201d strategy known as \u201csustainable development.\u201d\n\nIf the Forest Stewardship Council takes over all forest certifications, it would mean higher prices, more jobs lost, and reduced economic output, according to a study last year from George Mason University\u2019s EconoSTATS program.\n\nThe report compared Forest Stewardship Council standards with those of the two other leading competitors. Since the Forest Stewardship Council uses two different standards\u2014one for naturally formed forests and another for man-made plantations common in the South\u2014the study took into account four methods.\n\nThe authors concentrated their case studies on forests in Arkansas, which accounts for about 14 percent of private forest lands in the South, and Oregon, which accounts for about 10 percent of those in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nThe study found the Forest Stewardship Council imposed far higher costs than did the Sustainable Forest Initiative or the American Tree Forest System.\n\nIn Oregon, it would result in the loss of more than 31,000 jobs and reduce annual severance taxes by more than $6 million. In Arkansas, it would reduce forest industry employment by up to 10,000 jobs and reduce annual severance taxes by more than $600,000.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem with the FSC is that it takes more property off the market so that it can\u2019t be harvested,\u201d Wayne Winegarden, an economist and contributing editor to EconoSTATS, said of the Forest Stewardship Council adding:\n\nFSC is more restrictive than the other standards. This is why it\u2019s always better to have a competitive regulatory scheme. If consumers decide that higher costs that come with the FSC are worthwhile, then that\u2019s the direction they will go. But if not, then we have other alternative standards that can balance economic and environmental concerns.\n\nDiscrediting Competitors\n\nEnvironmentalists devised forest certification to fight forest depletion in developing countries. The process, they say, assures consumers that wood products originate in \u201csustainably managed\u201d forests. The three competing certifiers apply their \u201cindependent\u201d standards to assess whether a company\u2019s forest-management practices are worthy of certification.\n\nThe non-binding agreement that grew out of the 1992 UN Earth Summit, known as Agenda 21, promoted ecologically responsible methods of harvesting that were supposed to allow for economic development but avoid harmful levels of deforestation.\n\nMore than 31,000 jobs are at stake in Oregon and another 10,000 in Arkansas.\n\nWhen the summit failed to produce any legally binding agreement on forest management, environmental groups stepped in to form a non-profit organization called the Forest Stewardship Council. The German-based organization, founded in 1993, now boasts more than 800 members.\n\nGreen groups with close ties to the Forest Stewardship Council have moved aggressively to discredit its competitors, especially the Sustainable Forest Initiative. The Dogwood Alliance, for example, organized campaigns against businesses that used SFI standards, including OfficeMax, Office Depot, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Staples.\n\nDanna Smith, Dogwood\u2019s executive director, holds a seat on the Forest Stewardship Council\u2019s 15-member board of directors.\n\nIn 2009, a non-profit group called ForestEthics increased the stakes by filing complaints against the Sustainable Forest Initiative with the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Trade Commission. In the FTC complaint filed last year, ForestEthics accused SFI of violating the agency\u2019s guidelines by \u201cgreenwashing\u201d destructive forest practices.\n\nWinegarden, who co-wrote the foreword to the EconoSTATS report, said:\n\nThe criticism of SFI is that it is too close to industry, and it is fine to make that argument. But the environmental groups that favor the FSC certification standard are closely tied in with the FSC and many are members. This is why it\u2019s best not to have a monopoly in one direction or another. Let them compete with one another.\n\nDespite pressure from environmentalists, the U.S. Forest Service has declined to endorse the standards of the Forest Stewardship Council over those of the Sustainable Forest Initiative and the American Tree Farm System.\n\nWhat Consumers Demand\n\nCorey Brinkema, president of the Forest Stewardship Council, told The Daily Signal that George Mason University\u2019s EconoSTATS study is \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d\n\nThe FSCl, Brinkema said, is \u201ca voluntary approach that is designed to use the market as a way to help forests, wildlife and the people who depend on them for their livelihoods.\u201d\n\nHe said interest groups that typically oppose government regulation now call on government to regulate green construction:\n\nConsumers are demanding higher levels of environmental and social performance from business, and leading companies are responding.\n\nFSC has another issue. It implements 38 standards around the world, many of them \u201cinterim\u201d and not fully developed. U.S. timber companies would face far more stringent requirements than those of Brazil, Russia and other nations.\n\nWeingarden said this creates an incentive for U.S. customers to shop for timber abroad, where lower environmental standards mean lower costs:\n\nThe consumer who cares about the environment doesn\u2019t know they are getting an inferior product from say, Russia, that also contributes to environmental degradation.\n\nIdeally, suppliers should have the opportunity to substitute the Sustainable Forest Initiative\u2019s standards, or those of the American Tree Farm System.\n\nBut the EconoSTATS study warns environmental groups are trying to get into a position where they can block access to green markets by green building certification program such as LEED, which stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.\n\nMaking the Connection\n\nThe Sierra Club, Greenpeace and the Earth Island Institute formed a joint initiative in April called Greenwash Action to promote LEED standards for building energy efficiency and to attack Green Globes, which offers an alternative assessment program.\n\nThe U.S. Green Building Council, a non-profit based in Washington, D.C., developed the rating system used by LEED as a way to advance \u201csustainability\u201d in building projects.\n\nThe Green Building Council counts more than 4,000 LEED-certified government buildings and another 8,000 registered projects. LEED has been accused of offering green points in exchange for accommodating design adjustments that do little to protect the environment. Builders can secure LEED approval \u201cthrough simple purchasing decisions\u201d that \u201csidestep labor-intensive options,\u201d a report in USA Today said.\n\nGreen activists are connected to LEED as well as to the Forest Stewardship Council.\n\nFor starters, Greenwash Action Executive Director Jason Grant is identified as an accredited LEED professional. His company, Jason Grant Consulting, promotes Forest Stewardship Council products in the green building market, according to the Green Building Council.\n\nAnother well-connected figure is Denis Hayes, CEO of the Bullitt Foundation and chairman of Earth Day Network.\n\n\u201cGreenwashing is a major impediment to environmental progress on climate, forests, toxics and many other problem areas,\u201d Hayes has said. \u201cI have been tracking Greenwash Action since its conception, and I believe this is the right initiative at the right time.\u201d\n\nThe Bullitt Foundation has made grants to the Forest Stewardship Council since 1993, Hayes said in media interviews.\n\nSo far, though, the Forest Service hasn\u2019t given a nod to the standards of the Forest Stewardship Council and brushed off those of the Sustainable Forest Initiative and the American Tree Farm System.\n\nUrging Awareness\n\nTimothy H. Lee, senior vice president of legal and public affairs at the Center for Individual Freedom, hopes it stays that way.\n\nLee told The Daily Signal that Greenwash Action has demonstrated a \u201cwillingness to misinform environmental stakeholders and the general public\u201d in pursuit of an \u201cextremist agenda.\u201d\n\nGreenwash Action may present itself as a disinterested party, he said, but the facts show the organization is an advocate for LEED and a monopoly for Forest Stewardship Council wood products.\n\nHe said Grant, executive director of Greenwash Action, \u201chas made a living providing consulting services for businesses attempting to get FSC and LEED certification.\u201d\n\nThe participation of other building certification programs would mean \u201cmore competition for certified wood, and in turn a smaller market share for FSC timber and LEED projects,\u201d Lee said:\n\nThat would obviously run contrary to the interest of his clients, so it\u2019s unsurprising to witness him promoting the mission of Greenwash Action.\n\nOther board members of Greenwash Action hold, or have held, official positions with LEED and the Green Building Council, Lee said, and that does not inspire confidence:", "article_metadata": {"description": "If a favored green group takes over forest certification in the timber industry, it will mean higher prices and lost jobs, free market economists warn.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "If a favored green group takes over forest certification in the timber industry, it will mean higher prices and lost jobs, free market economists warn.", "title": "'Big Green' Lobby Wants to Cut 2 of 3 Forestry Branches", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140812_ForestCertification_Mooney.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-19T15:03:14+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tgEbKt"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "If a favored green group takes over forest certification in the timber industry, it will mean higher prices and lost jobs, free market economists warn.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140812_ForestCertification_Mooney.jpg"}, "title": "'Big Green' Lobby Wants to Cut 2 of 3 Forestry Branches", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism,economic freedom", "published_time": "2014-08-19T03:01:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-19T15:03:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "green lobby, Forest Stewardship Council,  FSC, EconoSTATS, United Nations Earth Summit,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff01\"", "article_summary": "His company, Jason Grant Consulting, promotes Forest Stewardship Council products in the green building market, according to the Green Building Council.\nThe study found the Forest Stewardship Council imposed far higher costs than did the Sustainable Forest Initiative or the American Tree Forest System.\nThe report compared Forest Stewardship Council standards with those of the two other leading competitors.\nThe Green Building Council counts more than 4,000 LEED-certified government buildings and another 8,000 registered projects.\nGreen groups with close ties to the Forest Stewardship Council have moved aggressively to discredit its competitors, especially the Sustainable Forest Initiative."}
