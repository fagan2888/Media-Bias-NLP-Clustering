A man suffered critical injuries early Sunday morning when he was accused inappropriately touching an 11-year-old girl and assaulted.

The incident happened around 3:30 a.m. at a home near 27th Street South and Seneca. Police said they responded to a "man down" call and found the 42-year-old victim with injuries to his head and face.

Police determined he had gotten in an argument with an acquaintance who accused the man of touching his 11-year-old daughter in an inappropriate manner.

The 44-year-old acquaintance was booked for aggravated battery.

Police are still investigating the validity of the claims of inappropriate touching.
