Panama City Beach Police Department hosted their 24th annual Cops N' Kids event.

All Bay County law enforcement agencies came out to teach kids about their line of work. The event was more than just educating children.

Swat members are not only teaching these kids how their equipment works, but they are building positive relationships and trust with residents and local law enforcement.

"We create that bond with them because we don't want them to be afraid of us," said Panama City Beach Police Department Lt. Jamey Wright.

"I think it's important to start them off young and let them know that we're the good guys, usually kids tend to grow up and find out that they get scared of the police from other friends and hanging out with the wrong crowds, and we want to get them on the right path early," said 325th Security Forces Air Force Staff Sergeant Justin Paczesny.

A message not only for the kids, but parents too. "They love coming out seeing the demonstrations, the dogs, the equipment, and help building that relationship with their child because they're like us they're wanting them to build that trust," said Wright.

"The kids really love to see the dogs and run and get to bite the bad guy and I think they enjoy it because I think they know what we are capable of and it's awesome," said Paczensy.

From trying out the horns to hopping in the Special Forces Humvee, kids came out to not only have fun seeing all the cool equipment, but were able to feel comfortable approaching our local officers.

Cops N' Kids is a free event and Panama City Beach Police Department continues to see great support from the community with a huge turn out each year.
