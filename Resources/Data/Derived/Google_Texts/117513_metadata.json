The spacecraft that's been keeping so many Planetary Society engineers on their toes recently is a prototype, destined for a short mission that will help sort out the bugs before a longer mission scheduled for next year.\n\nSolar sailing is one of those technologies that's been around forever in theory but proven somewhat tricky in practice. The basic idea is simple: build a large, thin kite made out of reflective material that can literally use the gentle push of sunlight for propulsion.\n\nThe appeal is that, even though sunlight only provides a tiny bit of force, it provides it all the time. That means solar sails can keep moving fast and faster indefinitely without having to carry fuel or propellant. Some scientists think they're humanity's best chance to ever send a spacecraft to another solar system. (Video via NASA)\n\nBut the history of solar sail technology is one of repeated failures and sheer bad luck.\n\nThe Planetary Society saw two of its earlier spacecraft lost to rocket malfunctions. NASA also lost a solar sail prototype to a rocket failure and saw another one cancelled at the last minute. Its NanoSail-D2 is its only truly successful test, and it was limited to low Earth orbit.\n\nJapan's space agency seems to have had the most luck with solar sail technology. The IKAROS spacecraft has been going strong for five years, and was the first solar sail spacecraft to make the trip to another planet.\n\nBut despite a history that a writer for Motherboard once described as \"borderline cursed,\" The Planetary Society is going full speed ahead with solar sail technology. It has three more missions in the works after this month's successful test flight.\n\nThe organization's CEO, Bill Nye the Science Guy, said in a statement, \"We've learned a lot about perseverance on this test mission. Although it's in inertial space, LightSail has had me on a rollercoaster. I want to thank the engineering team; they've done fantastic work.\"\n\nThis video includes images from The Planetary Society, NASA, Luke Duncan / CC BY NC 2.0 and Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Planetary Society's LightSail, a solar sail that moves using sunlight, finally deployed Sunday after weeks of glitches and setbacks.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "The Planetary Society's LightSail, a solar sail that moves using sunlight, finally deployed Sunday after weeks of glitches and setbacks.", "title": "LightSail Spacecraft Has Glitchy But Successful Test Mission", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/lightsail-spacecraft-has-glitchy-but-successful-test-mission/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1433730403.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Planetary Society's LightSail, a solar sail that moves using sunlight, finally deployed Sunday after weeks of glitches and setbacks.", "title": "LightSail Spacecraft Has Glitchy But Successful Test Mission", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/lightsail-spacecraft-has-glitchy-but-successful-test-mission/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1433730403.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=ZibG9qdTp_3ZFUWyxS9Kid19yU-xa3Ze&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://48044", "iphone": "newsy://48044", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://48044", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "lightsail,planetary society,solar sail,lightsail mission,lightsail deploy,planetary society solar sail,bill nye lightsail,solar sail test,ikaros solar sail,nasa solar sail,space news,newsy science", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1433730403.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd353d\"", "article_summary": "The IKAROS spacecraft has been going strong for five years, and was the first solar sail spacecraft to make the trip to another planet.\n(Video via NASA)But the history of solar sail technology is one of repeated failures and sheer bad luck.\nThe organization's CEO, Bill Nye the Science Guy, said in a statement, \"We've learned a lot about perseverance on this test mission.\nThis video includes images from The Planetary Society, NASA, Luke Duncan / CC BY NC 2.0 and Getty Images.\nNASA also lost a solar sail prototype to a rocket failure and saw another one cancelled at the last minute."}
