Things aren\u2019t great there right now.\n\nDowntown Perry, Georgia is the sort of place you could roll a ball through with one pitch. The coffee shop on the corner is called \u201cThe Coffee Shop.\u201d A few doors down, Jack West, the local barber, has been cutting locals\u2019 hair for 64 years. The rest of Perry, with its population of around 15,000, is ringed by churches, pecan groves, and cotton fields.\n\nBut the little town in middle Georgia is now at the center of this year\u2019s increasingly ugly Senate race, pitting one longtime Perry family against another as Democrat Michelle Nunn, the only daughter of Perry\u2019s most famous product, former Senator Sam Nunn, faces off against Republican David Perdue, a Perry native whose cousin, former Georgia governor Sonny Perdue, still lives there, along with a contingent of Perdue cousins, children, and extended family.\n\nThe contest between two of the town\u2019s most respected families has recently transformed from a polite affair into an all-out brawl as more than $15 million of outside money has poured into the state and as razor-thin poll numbers have ratcheted up the pressure on both campaigns. The result has been a storm of leaked documents, oppo dumps, whisper campaigns, of the campaign, particularly Perdue\u2019s attacks on Nunn.\n\nThe most controversial of those attacks has been one stating that Nunn \u201cfunded organizations linked to terrorists\u201d as the CEO of President George H.W. Bush\u2019s Points of Light Foundation. The charge quotes a Nunn campaign document, a kind of self-oppo-research paper that referred to Points of Light\u2019s funding of an Islamic relief group. But the document merely warned of the possibility of such an attack; it did not say the attack would be accurate. Neal Bush, the former president\u2019s son, has called the ad shameful, while Michelle Nunn called it \u201ca terrible lie.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Nunn has run a series of ads featuring women who worked at two of Perdue\u2019s former companies, including one woman wearing an oxygen mask struggling to breathe. Another ad asks, \u201cCan the women of Georgia trust David Perdue?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not the sort of thing you expect from those two families,\u201d said a Perry woman in front of Ashley Marie\u2019s Boutique, who didn\u2019t want to use her name talking about anyone else in town. \u201cI saw the debate and it was horrifying.\u201d\n\nThe debate she spoke of had taken place earlier in the week at the Georgia National State Fair in Perry, down the road from Sam Nunn Boulevard and David Perdue Elementary School. Sandwiched on the fairgrounds between the sheep rodeo and Robinson\u2019s pig races, Nunn and Perdue squared off in front of a crowd so raucous the event seemed more like \u201cThe Jerry Springer Show\u201d than an off-year Senate debate.\n\nPerdue kicked off the debate with a greeting. His \u201cWelcome to Perdue country!\u201d was a reference to both the large Perdue family presence in the area and to the fact that although Michelle Nunn was born in Perry, her family moved to Washington when her father was elected to the Senate in 1972 to represent Georgia. Nunn has lived and worked in Atlanta for more than 25 years since then, but the \u201ccarpetbagger\u201d accusation persists from Republicans.\n\nNunn spent much of her time that night, and throughout the general election, painting Perdue as a greedy, callous corporate boss, and hitting Perdue for his own time outside of Georgia\u2014 decades as a top executive around the globe, including time at firms that either outsourced or ended American operations.\n\n\u201cDavid\u2026talked about all these countries, Thailand and Singapore and India and Pakistan, but not once did he talk about creating jobs in the United States,\u201d Nunn said in the debate.\n\nPerdue dismissed Nunn\u2019s attacks as \u201cdesperate,\u201d asked if Nunn\u2019s campaign wasn\u2019t \u201ca well-funded attempt to deceive Georgia voters.\u201d He also repeatedly tied her to President Obama, whose approval ratings in the state hover in the 30s. \u201cHe hand-picked her. He funded her,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cDo you really think she\u2019s not going to support him once she\u2019s there?\u201d\n\nOutside of the debate arena, the themes on voters\u2019 minds were the same as those on the debate stage. Kat Smith-Tice and Leslie Davis drove to Perry from Atlanta with David Perdue signs in hand. Both women work with their husbands\u2019 small businesses and pointed to health-care reform as their primary reason for supporting Perdue.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest thing that\u2019s slowed the economy down is Obamacare,\u201d said Smith-Tice.\n\nDavis agreed: \u201cObamacare is a mess. We all know our health-care system wasn\u2019t working but (Congress) needed to sit down and figure it out instead of shoving this piece of crap down our throats.\u201d\n\nTeresa Vance went to the debate from Atlanta to cheer on Nunn. \u201cI think she has the same integrity as her father. She has a mind of her own, she\u2019s not a parrot,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Congress can\u2019t start compromising, we can\u2019t have change.\u201d\n\nVance said she found the rowdy Perry debate \u201cthrilling,\u201d but the bare-knuckled brawl wasn\u2019t as welcome in Perdue and Nunn\u2019s shared hometown.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "1patriciamurphy"}, "keywords": "Georgia,United States, 2014 Midterms, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201410100945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/world", "news_keywords": "Georgia United States, 2014 Midterms, US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Nunn-Perdue: The Devil Went Down to Perry, Georgia", "tags": "entity:provinceorstate/georgia_united_states,entity:event/2014_midterms,topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Both candidates in the extremely bitter Georgia Senate race are from the same small town.
