He\u2019s been around a long time. He\u2019s studied players. He understands Cover 1s, Cover 2s. He understands the little nuances that we try to disguise and try to trick him with.\u201d\n\nAdams, 33, has the dubious distinction of being part of the makeshift defense that lost in the Super Bowl to Seattle \u2014 to be fair, Rahim Moore\u2019s replacement was also part of the defense that won the AFC championship game. But while the likes of Adams and Paris Lenon and others have been replaced, Adams worked his way onto a formidable roster \u2014 and a team that beat Denver last season.\n\n\u201cThey really whooped us,\u201d he said of the Broncos\u2019 39-33 loss at Indianapolis on Oct. 20, 2013. Adams was asked about the mentality of his former Broncos teammates, heading into their first meaningful game since the Super Bowl loss.\n\n\u201cI anticipate them coming out hyped as ever,\u201d he said.\n\nShow goes on. Colts owner Jim Irsay spent his first full day Wednesday away from Colts headquarters, after Tuesday\u2019s NFL suspension. He must stay away for six games, after pleading guilty to driving while intoxicated in March.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change our preparation in a sense,\u201d Colts quarterback Andrew Luck said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously not ideal, but for us, it\u2019s business as usual. I don\u2019t think it will have any negative impact on preparation, games and anything. When he comes back, it\u2019ll be great.\u201d\n\nWhen Colts coach Chuck Pagano was asked about Irsay, Pagano was at first contrite, saying \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d to answer the first two media questions. But then he opened up, notably when talking about how Irsay was by his side during the coach\u2019s 2012 fight against leukemia.\n\n\u201cMr. Irsay is family,\u201d Pagano said. \u201cWe\u2019re all family. I\u2019ve been on record as saying the first time I shook his hand, the three words out of his mouth, first three words when I came on an interview even before I got offered the job, \u2018Faith, family and football,\u2019 is what he lived by. He\u2019s not a guy that just talks it, he walks it. He\u2019s family and we have his back. I certainly have his back, my family has his back. Again, I will never be able to repay the Irsay family, Jim and his daughters and Meg, everybody, for what he did for me during my circumstances and the things that I had to deal with.\u201d\n\nHomecoming. Pagano grew up in Boulder and played football at Fairview High School. He\u2019s coming home \u2014 well, a half-hour-down-36 home \u2014 for Sunday\u2019s game at Denver. Talking about his childhood, Pagano was asked who his favorite Broncos player was.\u201dHe wore number 57. Heard of him?\u201d Pagano said, grinning nostalgically. \u201cFirst name, Tommy. Last name, Jackson. Sideline to sideline. I had a bunch. Barney Chavous, Lyle Alzado, Rick Upchurch. There\u2019s a bunch, a lot of good players.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Peyton Manning is ready to face former teammate Mike Adams", "title": "Peyton Manning is ready to face former teammate Mike Adams", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/03/peyton-manning-is-ready-to-face-former-teammate-mike-adams/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140903__peyton-manningp1.jpg", "height": 506}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140903__peyton-manningp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-03T17:44:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:52:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e90\"", "article_summary": "Mike Adams will have to face his former teammate in a game, with the former Broncos safety now nestled in the Colts\u2019 secondary.\n\u201cI know he knows little things about me and little things about defenses that he\u2019ll try to exploit,\u201d Adams said Wednesday.\nHe\u2019s family and we have his back.\nIrsay is family,\u201d Pagano said.\nAdams was asked about the mentality of his former Broncos teammates, heading into their first meaningful game since the Super Bowl loss."}
