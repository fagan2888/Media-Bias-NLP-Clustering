Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has been bashing Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts all summer for upholding Obamacare, but Wednesday he took his disdain for the Roberts Court one step further. Cruz said he regretted his support of Roberts at the time of his nomination, which came under President George W. Bush's administration.

"It is true that after George W. Bush nominated John Roberts I supported his confirmation. That was a mistake and I regret that," Cruz said. "I wouldn't have nominated John Roberts and indeed Governor [Jeb] Bush pointed out why. It wasn't that President Bush wanted to appoint a liberal to the court. It is that it was the easier choice."
