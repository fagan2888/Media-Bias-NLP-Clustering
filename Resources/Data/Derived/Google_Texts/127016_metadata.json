Given the history of Notre Dame and the backyard aspect playing for the Buffaloes offered, Kemp said it made his mind go \"a million different ways\" but that Michigan brought everything together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Michigan kind of felt like home, as well. Ann Arbor was a lot like Boulder, just close, tight-knit,\" Kemp said. \"It's hard to say no to Notre Dame, it was hard to say no to CU, but at the end of the day it's what's best for me, where I fit and can thrive, and first of all get a great education.\n\n\"Where I also have an opportunity to play (early) was a lot better at Michigan.\"\n\nFairview High School's Carlo Kemp talks on the phone with University of Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh Sunday afternoon proclaiming his intention to sign a scholarship offer with the Wolverines.

A basketball player as a freshman and sophomore, he said there were no extraneous activities on his plate between now and when he follows that road to the Big House.\n\nAfter everything was said and done Sunday, however, he was ready to sit down with his family and watch his uncle Chuck Pagano's Indianapolis Colts take on the Denver Broncos.\n\nAdam Dunivan: dunivana@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/AdamDunivan24", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-11-08T15:55:17-0700", "modificationDate": "2015-11-08T15:58:45-0700", "byline": "By Adam Dunivan", "sailthru.author": "By Adam Dunivan  BoCoPreps.com Writer", "description": "The football path for Fairview's Carlo Kemp has been officially paved in maize and blue.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:29089657:view"}, "og": {"image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site54/2015/1108/20151108__09PRKEMPw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The football path for Fairview's Carlo Kemp has been officially paved in maize and blue.", "title": "Football: Fairview's Kemp picks Michigan"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "The football path for Fairview's Carlo Kemp has been officially paved in maize and blue.", "title": "Football: Fairview's Kemp picks Michigan", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site54/2015/1108/20151108__09PRKEMPw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-08T15:55:17-0700", "sailthru.title": "Football: Fairview's Kemp picks Michigan", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2015-11-08T16:00:20-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont, TimesCall, Colorado, news, sports, features, schools, education, jobs, homes, real estate, lifestyles"}, "article_summary": "Knight senior LB was Colorado's top 2016 recruitBOULDER \u2014 The football path for Fairview's Carlo Kemp has been officially paved in maize and blue.\n\"He told me he did a cartwheel,\" Kemp said of Harbaugh's reaction, which gave Michigan a 10th four-star recruit from the 2016 class.\nAmong the schools he was considering were Notre Dame, Colorado and UCLA.\nA defensive end/linebacker that has been a blip on the radar screen nationally since he was a sophomore, Kemp was purely relieved when he was able to finally able to let his decision be known.\nGiven the history of Notre Dame and the backyard aspect playing for the Buffaloes offered, Kemp said it made his mind go \"a million different ways\" but that Michigan brought everything together."}
