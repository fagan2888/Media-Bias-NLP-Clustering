Rick Santorum\u2019s unparalleled ability to connect social issues in a way that makes very little logical sense but sounds very, very scary, regardless of one\u2019s political views! Unfortunately, this game does not include any references to Santorum\u2019s proclivity for wearing sweater vests, as we do not want anyone to have to drink so much they need to be hospitalized.\n\nSantorum actually seems to be in on our game already, indicated by the whopper of bingo bait he gave a crowd of anti-choice advocates at the National Right to Life Committee\u2019s annual convention on Friday. Affirming that he\u2019ll continue to oppose same-sex marriage despite the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling to extend the right to people in all 50 states, the GOP presidential hopeful explained that the decision is actually the result of \u201ca cancer that is infecting the body of America\u201d \u2014 a \u201ccancer\u201d otherwise known as Roe v. Wade.\n\nThat\u2019s right, marriage equality (a bad thing) is legal only because abortion (an even worse thing) is legal, and Santorum is the only guy who seems to understand that this situation is going to destroy the world. Everybody take a shot.\n\nAnd, since it\u2019s almost the weekend, let\u2019s take a few more shots at Santorum\u2026and his favorite oratory topics. Have a bottle of tequila at the ready, but first grab yourself a beer. If you lean to the right, consider cracking open a Guinness, just like ole Rick; more progressive players might want to sip a \u201ctoo bitter\u201d IPA.
