President Barack Obama caught a pregnant woman as she fainted during his speech on the troubled Obamacare website on Monday.

He reassuringly said to her: "You're ok. I'm right here. I got you."

Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, is never one to shy away from daredevil feats, and took to the skies when wildfires were raging through the Ryazan region of Russia in August 2010.

Mr Putin took the co-pilots seat, and personally aimed the water-laden plane at the fire - driving the flames back before more damage could be done.

Prince Harry

Perhaps the ultimate knight in shining armour, Prince Harry made women all over the world swoon when he came to the rescue of a member of his opposing team during a polo game.

In 2012 the Prince was competing in Brazil when a collision between players led to businessman Bash Kazi being knocked unconscious.

Harry rushed to his aid and performed first aid - putting him in the recovery position and doing what he could to ensure Mr Bash could breathe. Mr Bash said after the event that the Prince was “a fabulous person” and “such a gentleman”.

Arnold Schwarzenegger

Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Governor of California is used to playing the role of an action hero. But in 2004 Mr Schwarzenegger put his skills to the test when, on a family holiday in Maui, he spotted a man struggling to swim and to breathe in the water.

The 56-year-old swam out to him, only to discover the man had cramps all over his body and was unable to swim to shore. Mr Schwarzenegger helped the man to cling on to his boogie board and then swam the man back to shore, where he stayed with him to ensure he was not in danger.

Ed Milliband

Admitting that he is rarely cast as a muscled ‘superhero’ type, Ed Miliband “mysteriously appeared out of nowhere, a bit like an action hero” to help cyclist Ella Philips after she fell off her bike in London.

Miss Phillips said she will “definitely be voting for him now”.
