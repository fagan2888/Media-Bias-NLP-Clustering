I mean, is that looking out for the little guy when 21 percent of Texans didn\u2019t have health insurance?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf how you keep score is how many people you force to buy insurance, well, then I would say that\u2019s how you keep score,\u201d Perry opined. \u201cWe make access to health care the real issue, we passed the most sweeping tort reform in the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand that, sir, but don\u2019t you \u2014 you were the governor for 14 years \u2014 don\u2019t you feel some responsibility when 21 percent of the people in your state didn\u2019t have health insurance?\u201d Wallace pressed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how we keep score,\u201d Perry insisted. \u201cI think it\u2019s a fallacy to say access to health care is all about insurance. What we happen to say in the state of Texas is we\u2019re going to try to make accessible as we can good quality health care.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below from Fox News\u2019 Fox News Sunday, broadcast June 21, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fox_fns_perry_healthcare_150621a-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Rick Perry: Texans without health insurance don\u2019t matter because \u2018that\u2019s not how we keep score\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e52\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat\u2019s not how we keep score,\u201d Perry insisted.\n\u201cMore than 1 in 5 Texans didn\u2019t have health coverage,\u201d Wallace noted.\nI mean, is that looking out for the little guy when 21 percent of Texans didn\u2019t have health insurance?\u201d\u201cIf how you keep score is how many people you force to buy insurance, well, then I would say that\u2019s how you keep score,\u201d Perry opined.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a fallacy to say access to health care is all about insurance.\n\u201cWe make access to health care the real issue, we passed the most sweeping tort reform in the nation.\u201d\u201cI understand that, sir, but don\u2019t you \u2014 you were the governor for 14 years \u2014 don\u2019t you feel some responsibility when 21 percent of the people in your state didn\u2019t have health insurance?\u201d Wallace pressed."}
