But Republican Party Chairman Rob Montilla believes a wide swath of central Macomb is up for grabs in the final days of the campaign.\n\n\u0093Our goal is to get a majority on the Board of Commissioners. Anything between 14 Mile Road and Hall Road is in play,\u0094 Montilla said, referring to an area with five commissioner districts.\n\nDemocratic officials scoff at the prospect of the opposition reversing their 9-4 edge but they also concede that they are playing defense at this point, with little hope of adding any seats to their majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Republicans cut their minority status on the board to a 7-6 margin following the GOP wave in the 2010 election \u0096 and managed to place Republican Commissioner Kathy Vosburg of Chesterfield Township as the board chair \u0096 but that momentum crumbled in the 2012 vote.\n\nIn the 2014 campaign, the Republicans have focused on two races where Democratic commissioners lost in 2010 and made a comeback two years later: the 10th District (St. Clair Shores and Harrison Township) where the incumbent is Democrat Michael Boyle; and the 5th District (northern Sterling Heights), tossup territory where incumbent Democrat Rob Mijac is trying to preserve re-election.\n\nBoyle is a former St. Clair Shores councilman and a bus mechanic for the SMART transit system. Mijac is a small business owner.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mijac faces Republican Maria Grot of Sterling Heights; Boyle is head-to-head with the GOP\u0092s Steve Marino of Harrison Township.\n\nThe GOP\u0092s campaign strategy is to tag Democratic commissioners with Obamacare and taxes.\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act is clearly a federal issue, a resolution passed by the board in April calling for state approval of the Medicaid expansion plan associated with the ACA provided the GOP with a political opening, Montilla said.\n\n\u0093By passing that resolution, they were indicating their support for Obamacare,\u0094 he said.\n\nIn campaign literature criticizing Boyle and Mijac, the county GOP also asserts that Democrats on the part-time county board should have pushed for a new policy, with the commissioners casting aside their county-paid health care coverage in favor of insurance purchased on the ACA exchange.\n\nEd Bruley, chairman of the Macomb Democrats, countered that the GOP is out of step with the realities of health care reform.\n\n\u0093They\u0092re criticizing Democrats for supporting what the Republican governor and the Republican Legislature approved,\u0094 Bruley said, referring to the expanded Medicaid program known as Healthy Michigan. \u0093I would say that\u0092s a pretty dysfunctional party.\u0094\n\nAs for the prospect of the commissioners switching from county health care to the private insurance policies offered on healthcare.gov, the Democratic chairman said that argument makes little sense.\n\n\u0093The Affordable Care Act was meant to help those who could not get insurance,\u0094 he said. \u0093It was not meant to displace what people already have.\u0094\n\nAs for the tax issue, Republicans point out that a Democratic majority on the board in 2009 passed a 9 percent increase in the county property tax at a time when the commissioners were struggling with budget deficits.\n\nThat millage hike of five years ago remains in place. For a typical Macomb County family with a $100,000 house, the increase means an extra $29 per year.\n\nMontilla also questions the board\u0092s tentative decision to sell millions of dollars of bonds to repair and upgrade county buildings. Perhaps the most controversial GOP stand on the issues references a recent pay hike for county employees.\n\nAfter enduring several years of wage and benefit concessions, the unionized workers recently received a negotiated $1,000 lump-sum payment several months ahead of schedule as the county\u0092s accumulated budget surplus mounted. Montilla said those payments amounted to $2.4 million in \u0093bonuses.\u0094\n\nA first-time candidate, Grot is the sister of Shelby Township Clerk Stan Grot, who unsuccessfully waged an expensive and aggressive race for state House in the August GOP primary. She has invested minimally into her campaign, relying instead on the party to make her case.\n\nMarino, a campaign finance consultant, has put forth a far more aggressive campaign, which has been complimented by the GOP\u0092s efforts. The young challenger has outspent the incumbent by a massive margin, $48,000 to $3,700, with nearly $44,000 in his war chest coming from his own pocket.\n\nBut the Democrats have responded with some heavy ammunition. Voting records indicate that, since Marino first registered to vote while living in St. Clair Shores in 2008, he has voted in just three of 13 elections \u0096 a 23 percent turnout rate.\n\nAmong the elections he missed was the August primary and November general election during the presidential year of 2008; the November 2009 vote on the Macomb County charter; the August and November elections of 2010; and the presidential primary election of 2012.\n\nHe stated the missed votes came while he was a student at Michigan State University, which he said he attended from 2007-12.\n\nIn addition, Marino\u0092s specialty is aiding political candidates with filing their campaign\u0092s financial paperwork, yet county records indicate he filed his latest campaign finance report five days late and paid the county a $75 fine.\n\nMarino responded: \u0093A mailing error was noticed and the Clerk\u0092s office was notified in advance.\u0094\n\nIn the new world of county government under a home rule charter \u0096 essentially a county constitution -- basic changes materialized: an elected executive oversees county departments, the executive branch, on a day-to-day basis; and the Board of Commissioners, the legislative branch, was cut in half from 26 to 13 members and put in charge of the \u0093purse strings,\u0094 granting final approval to budget matters and county contracts.\n\nHackel, a Macomb Township Democrat who tries to maintain a bipartisan stance, has played no role in the commissioner campaigns as he focuses on his own re-election.\n\nOther incumbent commissioners facing re-election are: Marv Sauger, D-Center Line; Veronica Klineflet, D-Eastpointe; board Chair Dave Flynn, D-Sterling Heights; Jim Carabelli, R-Shelby Township; Don Brown, R-Washington Township; Fred Miller, D-Mount Clemens; Kathy Tocco, D-Fraser; Bob Smith, D-Clinton Township; Joe Sabatini, R-Macomb Township; and former board chair Vosburg.\n\nIn the one open seat, in western Warren\u0092s District 1, former Democratic commissioner Andrey Duzyj faces Republican Joseph Kozar.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Politics, Politics news, Macomb Politics news, MI Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "title": "GOP hits Dems on taxes, Obamacare in county board races", "og": {"url": "http://www.macombdaily.com/article/MD/20141029/NEWS/141029548", "image": {"width": "788px", "identifier": "http://www.macombdaily.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MD/20141029/NEWS/141029548/AR/0/AR-141029548.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1000px"}, "type": "article", "title": "GOP hits Dems on taxes, Obamacare in county board races"}, "twitter": {"domain": "macombdaily.com", "description": "Macomb Republicans hope to gain seats on the county Board of Commissioners, perhaps even attaining a first-ever majority, as Tuesday\u0092s election approaches.", "title": "GOP hits Dems on taxes, Obamacare in county board races", "url": "http://www.macombdaily.com/article/MD/20141029/NEWS/141029548", "image": {"src": "http://www.macombdaily.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MD/20141029/NEWS/141029548/AR/0/AR-141029548.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@macombdaily", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551763849", "iphone": "id520209090", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.macombdaily"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Politics, Politics news, Macomb Politics news, MI Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Macomb Republicans hope to gain seats on the county Board of Commissioners, perhaps even attaining a first-ever majority, as Tuesday\u0092s election approaches."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1dc7\"", "article_summary": "Mike BoyleMacomb Republicans hope to gain seats on the county Board of Commissioners, perhaps even attaining a first-ever majority, as Tuesday\u0092s election approaches.\nFor a typical Macomb County family with a $100,000 house, the increase means an extra $29 per year.\nWhile Democratic County Executive Mark Hackel holds the upper hand in the newly reformed county government, the GOP currently holds just four seats on the county board \u0096 the legislative branch -- compared to nine for the Democrats.\nThe GOP\u0092s campaign strategy is to tag Democratic commissioners with Obamacare and taxes.\nEd Bruley, chairman of the Macomb Democrats, countered that the GOP is out of step with the realities of health care reform."}
