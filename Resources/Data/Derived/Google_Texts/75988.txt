Trans­par­ency trumps tra­di­tion.

That’s the mes­sage of a newly christened co­hort of me­dia and leg­al groups that are de­mand­ing the Su­preme Court tele­vise its pro­ceed­ings.

“The Su­preme Court’s de­cisions im­pact the lives of Amer­ic­ans every­where,” the Co­ali­tion for Court Trans­par­ency warns in a new 30-second tele­vi­sion ad that the group says will run about 300 times in the Wash­ing­ton metro area on cable news chan­nels. “But only a priv­ileged few get to wit­ness his­tory and see justice in ac­tion.”

Those “priv­ileged few” add up to about 250 people who are al­lowed in­to the courtroom dur­ing of­fi­cial pro­ceed­ings. Get­ting a tick­et to watch a high-pro­file case is com­par­able to pur­chas­ing a new iPhone mod­el on re­lease day, and people have been known to wait in line for days to catch the ju­di­cial branch’s greatest dis­play of demo­cracy in ac­tion.

Lack­ing entry in­to the justices’ ex­clus­ive quar­ters, most Court-watch­ers must wait hours be­fore a tran­script be­comes avail­able or, worse, days for au­dio re­cord­ings of or­al ar­gu­ments are pos­ted on­line. (Hot-but­ton cases, such as the 2012 re­view of the Af­ford­able Care Act, are in­cen­di­ary enough to war­rant same-day au­dio re­leases.)

So, what’s stop­ping the na­tion’s highest court from get­ting with the times?

Noth­ing oth­er than the justices’ own un­will­ing­ness, the co­ali­tion says, ar­guing that the Court could ad­opt cam­er­as the mo­ment it wanted to.

Some see a big­ger threat: Fo­cus­ing cam­er­as on the Su­preme Court will mean that the Su­preme Court plays to the cam­era, chan­ging the ten­or of the na­tion’s highest-stakes ju­di­cial de­lib­er­a­tions.

The Su­premes are “wor­ried that if you put cam­er­as in there, every­body will start play­ing to the cam­er­as,” Justice Elena Kagan ad­mit­ted in 2011i. And Justice Ant­on­in Scalia told C-SPAN in 2012:

I am against [cam­er­as in the Court] be­cause I do not be­lieve, as the pro­ponents of tele­vi­sion in the Court as­sert, that the pur­pose of tele­vis­ing our hear­ings would be to edu­cate the Amer­ic­an people.”¦ Your out­fit would carry it all, to be sure, but what most of Amer­ic­ans would see would be 30-second, 15-second takeouts from our ar­gu­ment, and those would not be char­ac­ter­ist­ic of what we do, they would be un­char­ac­ter­ist­ic.

Oth­er justices have like­wise ex­pressed doubt about cam­er­as’ place on their turf.

And, all things con­sidered, the Su­preme Court is do­ing a re­l­at­ively de­cent job of ad­ju­dic­at­ing, if opin­ion polling is any in­dic­a­tion. Al­though ap­prov­al has fallen migh­tily in the past few years, from 61 per­cent in 2009 to 46 per­cent now, ac­cord­ing to Gal­lup track­ing, the Court is still wildly more pop­u­lar than Con­gress, whose ap­prov­al rat­ing dropped down to single di­gits last year.

The sour views of Con­gress per­sists des­pite gavel-to-gavel cov­er­age of the Cap­it­ol’s daily pro­ceed­ings, cour­tesy of the Cable-Satel­lite Pub­lic Af­fairs Net­work, which fans and de­tract­ors alike know bet­ter as C-SPAN. The tele­vi­sion chan­nel was cre­ated in 1979 as a pub­lic ser­vice by the cable in­dustry, but some won­der wheth­er hav­ing cam­er­as on 24/7 has con­trib­uted to polit­ic­al dis­cord.

“After C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy at­mo­sphere that en­cour­aged both de­lib­er­a­tion and back­room deals began to yield to trans­par­ency and, with it, pos­tur­ing,” George Pack­er wrote in a 2010 New York­er es­say ex­plor­ing the many mal­func­tions of the Sen­ate.

Polit­ic­al theat­er has al­ways ex­is­ted in Con­gress, but it’s hard to ima­gine that Sen. Ted Cruz would have waged a 21-hour fake fili­buster ahead of Oc­to­ber’s gov­ern­ment shut­down had the cam­er­as lights not been on.

Un­ques­tion­ably, the Su­preme Court has as­sumed heightened cul­tur­al in­terest in re­cent years, as land­mark rul­ings on cam­paign fin­ance, health care re­form, vot­ing rights, im­mig­ra­tion, and gay mar­riage cap­tiv­ated mil­lions of people who, lack­ing any bet­ter op­tion, mostly turned to SCOTUS­b­log (or re­lied on some­times in­ac­cur­ate cable news re­port­ing) to learn about a de­cision.

And oth­er courts are warm­ing to the di­git­al world. The U.S. Court of Ap­peals for the 9th Cir­cuit began al­low­ing live au­dio stream­ing of its pro­ceed­ings this year, after be­com­ing the first fed­er­al Ap­pel­late Court to provide live video cov­er­age of or­al ar­gu­ments.

As the co­ali­tion notes, all 50 state su­preme courts al­low elec­tron­ic re­cord­ing equip­ment to dif­fer­ing de­grees, and the Ju­di­cial Con­fer­ence of the United States has put cam­er­as in 14 fed­er­al courts as part of a “three-year, mul­tidistrict pi­lot pro­gram to study the ef­fect of broad­cast­ing fed­er­al court pro­ceed­ings.”

But al­though watch­ing clips of Justice Scalia com­par­ing broc­coli to the na­tion’s health care mar­ket or ac­cus­ing his col­leagues of deem­ing gay-mar­riage op­pon­ents “en­emies of the hu­man race” might sound like an ob­vi­ous so­ci­et­al gain, pro-cam­era ad­voc­ates face an up­hill battle. The highest court is no­tori­ous for drag­ging its feet when it comes to chan­ging its pro­tocol, and the justices ap­pear to en­joy per­petu­at­ing the an­ti­quated rel­ics of benches past.
