She was 19, running from a domestic altercation, and breathed a little easier when three blue-and-white Memphis police cruisers pulled up.\n\nShe was safe \u2014 or so she thought.\n\n\u201cHe was going to take me to a safe place,\u2019\u2019 she later told investigators, contending that one of the officers took her to a secluded apartment complex clubhouse and raped her.\n\n\u201cHe had the gun in his hand \u2026 He said this was between two consenting adults and he didn\u2019t want to hear nothing else about it.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhat happened that warm July night in 2001 raises questions not only about Memphis\u2019 huge backlog of untested rape kits but about the actions and supervision of then-patrolman Bridges Randle, who was charged last week in a separate cold-case rape allegedly committed in June 2000.\n\nIn announcing the arrest of Randle, now 40, officials told how they nabbed him when a DNA profile from connected to the 2000 case was finally uploaded last August into CODIS, the national FBI database. Randle is accused of raping a 23-year-old woman who had called police on June 24, 2000 after her car was vandalized.\n\nRandle maintains his innocence.\n\nWhat authorities didn\u2019t reveal is that Randle was investigated for a second on-the-job rape allegedly committed 13 months later, on July 18, 2001. In fact, following a 14-month investigation in that case, he was indicted in September 2002 on charges of rape and official oppression after his DNA was matched to the crime scene, an investigation by The Commercial Appeal found.\n\nBut in a plea bargain with then-District Attorney Bill Gibbons\u2019 office, he received a year of probation. Contacted by a reporter last week, Marie Finney, spokeswoman for the Shelby County Criminal Court Clerk\u2019s Office, said the case file has been expunged, but later called back and said simply, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist.\u2019\u2019 However, surviving records on the court\u2019s online electronic docketing system show Randle pleaded guilty on June 21, 2004 to a single count of official oppression and received a one-year suspended sentence. One docket entry, \u201cSet Diver,\u2019\u2019 indicates he may have received diversion, a legal process in which a defendant\u2019s charge is dismissed and his record is wiped clean.\n\nPolice records show MPD\u2019s internal affairs bureau opened an investigation on July 23, 2001, five days after the alleged assault, when a woman called the East Precinct. \u201cThe female refused to identify herself, stating she feared for her safety,\u2019\u2019 a report said. However, she later began cooperating. Soon, investigators uncovered a disturbing series of events:\n\nRandle and two other patrol officers had responded on July 18, 2001 to a domestic disturbance call placed by a 19-year-old woman from a phone at a Mapco Express service station in Hickory Hill.\n\nRecords show Randle later offered to drive the woman to a safe house, but instead took her to an apartment complex, then known as the Gleneagles Apartments, abutting The Links at Fox Meadows golf course. There, in the clubhouse, around 3 a.m., Randle allegedly assaulted the woman.\n\n\u201cHe sat on the couch near me and he got up and sat closer to me to where his legs were touching me,\u2019\u2019 the woman told internal affairs investigators. It is the policy of The Commercial Appeal to not identify alleged victims of sexual assault.\n\n\u201cHe turned my face with (his) hand and I was face to face with him and he was going on and on about how soft my skin and my legs were,\u2019\u2019 the woman said.\n\n\u201cI said stop. This is not what I want.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe woman picked Randle out of a photo lineup and police recovered two cushion covers from the sofa containing semen stains. A Nov. 27, 2001 Tennessee Bureau of Investigation crime lab report says the DNA profile taken from the cushion covers matches blood drawn from Randle.\n\nBy then, Randle had resigned.\n\n\u201cI regretfully submit this letter of resignation due to the fact that I will be teaching school this fall,\u2019\u2019 he wrote in a resignation letter, asking that he be shifted from active duty to reserve officer status. Records indicate Randle might have served as a reserve officer until December 2001.\n\nRandle was interviewed by internal affairs on Sept. 25, 2001. Investigators read him his Miranda rights, and the interview ended quickly.\n\n\u201cNo, I do not wish to give a statement,\u2019\u2019 Randle told investigators.\n\nLast week, District Attorney Amy Weirich\u2019s office announced Randle\u2019s indictment for aggravated rape involving a 2000 incident in which he allegedly forced a female crime victim at gunpoint into a bedroom in her apartment at Knight Arnold and Mendenhall and raped her. Police arrested Randle, who was living in Atlanta under the name Ajamu Abiola Banjoko, after DNA work was finally completed in the now 14-year-old case. Authorities have not spelled out the details so it could not be determined if police waited more than a decade to test a rape kit collected in the 2000 case, making it one of some 12,000 kits stretching back to the 1980s that went untested in Memphis.\n\nA spokesman for Weirich said Saturday details on the prosecution of the 2001 case were unavailable, but prosecutors expect to have answers Monday when they can access files. MPD spokesman Karen Rudolph, too, said police would have to wait until Monday to provide additional information.\n\nRandle posted a $250,000 bond last week and was released from the Shelby County Jail. He faces an Oct. 9 hearing.\n\nA man identifying himself as Earl Randle, Bridges\u2019 uncle, said in a brief phone interview Saturday that his nephew maintains his innocence. \u201cHe has a lot to tell you,\u2019\u2019 the man said, telling a reporter he would have his nephew call back. The uncle later called back and in a voice-mail message said, \u201cHe has been instructed not to talk about it at all.\u2019\u2019\n\nBridges Randle\u2019s attorney, Leslie Ballin, said any DNA matches to his client do not prove he committed any crimes. \u201cTo conclude without knowing anything else that it was rape I don\u2019t think is fair.\u2019\u2019 Ballin didn\u2019t represent Randle in the 2001 case and said he had no details on how it was resolved.\n\nA spokeswoman for former DA Gibbons, now Tennessee commissioner of Safety and Homeland Security, said he was on vacation and could provide no information.", "article_metadata": {"title": "CA INVESTIGATION: Indicted ex-Memphis cop faced previous charge of on-duty rape", "og": {"url": "http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/investigations/ca-investigation-indicted-ex-memphis-cop-faced-previous-charge-of-on-duty-rape-ep-612265490-324332541.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/randle_1410702885976_8033021_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 440}, "type": "article", "description": "She called 911 and waited skittishly at a brightly lit gas station for the police.
