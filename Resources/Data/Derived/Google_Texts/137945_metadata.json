The program, backed by $2.4 billion, was written into the Affordable Care Act to offer an alternative to corporate players in the marketplace.\n\nSome of the plans faced fiscal growing pains and went belly up this fall, after the administration said Oct. 1 that it could pay less than 13 percent of what insurers had requested from a \u201crisk corridor\u201d program designed to protect against heavy losses in the marketplace.\n\nMaine\u2019s co-op was the only one to make money in 2014, although it was helped by the fact that only one other insurer, the for-profit Anthem, was offering plans on the state\u2019s exchange.\n\nIt had nearly 40,000 customers at the end of 2014, far more than the 15,000 or so the co-op had predicted. That accounted for 80 percent of the marketplace.\n\nThe co-op had figured to lose $1.5 million in 2014, but it ended up earning a profit of $5.9 million which it pumped back into its operations.\n\nBuoyed by its success, it branched out and began to offer plans in neighboring New Hampshire.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, Nebraska Republican and leading critic of the co-ops, said if Maine\u2019s program is \u201cas good as it gets, things seem pretty bleak.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only co-op operating in the black after the first year just announced it will stop accepting new exchange customers after Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt certainly seems like there is something seriously wrong with this program.\u201d\n\nMr. Sasse has threatened to hold nominees to the Health and Human Services Department until he gets more information about what led to the co-ops\u2019 demise.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Obamacare co-op that offered one of the program's few success stories said Wednesday it will suspend enrollment for 2016, marking another black eye for nonprofit plans that were supposed to give consumers a leg up in the marketplace.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "An Obamacare co-op that offered one of the program\u2019s few success stories said Wednesday it will suspend enrollment for 2016, marking another black eye for nonprofit plans that were supposed to give consumers a leg up in the marketplace.", "title": "Obamacare co-op in Maine to suspend 2016 enrollment", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/9/obamacare-co-op-maine-suspend-2016-enrollment/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/03/5a7ec38840a71c076e0f6a70670063a3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/03/5a7ec38840a71c076e0f6a70670063a3.jpg", "description": "An Obamacare co-op that offered one of the program's few success stories said Wednesday it will suspend enrollment for 2016, marking another black eye for nonprofit plans that were supposed to give co", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare co-op in Maine to suspend 2016 enrollment"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Social Issues"}, "article_summary": "So far, 12 out of the initial 23 co-op plans have failed.\nAn Obamacare co-op that offered one of the program\u2019s few success stories said Wednesday it will suspend enrollment for 2016, marking another black eye for nonprofit plans that were supposed to give consumers a leg up in the marketplace.\nThe Community Health Options plan of Maine said it cannot accept new customers in the individual market after Dec. 26.\nIt had nearly 40,000 customers at the end of 2014, far more than the 15,000 or so the co-op had predicted.\n\u201cMembers, both new and renewing, can rest assured that their 2016 coverage remains in full force and effect,\u201d he said."}
