The actress is seeking support for her Just Label It petition, which, according to Paltrow, had gathered 200,000 signatures in the six days since its launch.\n\n\u201cWe would love to have by the time the House comes back in September a half million signatures,\u201d Paltrow added.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Claire Parker, a spokesperson for the Coalition for Safe Affordable Food, criticized Paltrow\u2019s involvement in the GMO-labeling campaign.\n\n\u201cOut of touch Hollywood celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow want Congress to enshrine their lifestyle choices into law while ignoring the everyday realities facing American families,\u201d Parker said. \u201cThis legislation has earned the backing of everyone from farmers to food banks. We are confident the Senate will stand with science and American families rather than the extreme agendas of Hollywood elites and that common sense and scientific consensus will win out over media spectacle.\u201d\n\nThe organization also stressed the inconclusiveness of any negative health effects of GMOs on consumers, and said failure to pass the legislation could result in higher food prices. A recent Cornell University study found that allowing each state to develop GMO labeling would result in an average $500 increase in food costs to consumers per year.\n\n\u201cThe fact is American farmers rely on this safe, proven technology to grow the food that feeds the world and the leading health and safety organizations \u2013 from the World Health Organization to the American Medical Association \u2013 have deemed GMOs safe,\u201d Parker said. \u201cThis technology keeps food costs down, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nPaltrow, a longtime advocate for healthy eating habits, previously waded into the great American debate on food when she pledged to live on $29 worth of food stamps for a week to better understand the plight of poor Americans. The actress lasted four days before calling off the experiment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gwyneth Paltrow took to Capitol Hill to join lawmakers in pushing for the mandatory labeling of foods containing GMOs.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow took to Capitol Hill to join lawmakers in pushing for the mandatory labeling of foods containing GMOs.", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow Takes to Capitol Hill to Push for GMO Food Labeling", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/gwyneth-paltrow-head-palm-ap.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/08/05/gwyneth-paltrow-takes-to-capitol-hill-to-push-for-mandatory-gmo-food-labeling/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gwyneth Paltrow took to Capitol Hill to join lawmakers in pushing for the mandatory labeling of foods containing GMOs.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/gwyneth-paltrow-head-palm-ap.jpg", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow Takes to Capitol Hill to Push for GMO Food Labeling", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Blythe Danner, Capitol Hill, GMOs, Gwyneth Paltrow, Just Label It, Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015,Big Hollywood, Medicine,Gwyneth Paltrow", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015", "published_time": "2015-08-05T12:30:02-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERActress and lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow took to Capitol Hill Wednesday to join lawmakers in pushing for the mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\nIn a statement Wednesday, Claire Parker, a spokesperson for the Coalition for Safe Affordable Food, criticized Paltrow\u2019s involvement in the GMO-labeling campaign.\n\u201cOut of touch Hollywood celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow want Congress to enshrine their lifestyle choices into law while ignoring the everyday realities facing American families,\u201d Parker said.\n\u201cWe would love to have by the time the House comes back in September a half million signatures,\u201d Paltrow added.\nA recent Cornell University study found that allowing each state to develop GMO labeling would result in an average $500 increase in food costs to consumers per year."}
