The high volume of lead in public water supplies has contaminated children\u2019s blood and led Flint\u2019s mayor to declare a state of emergency.\n\nThe crisis has drawn widespread attention and outrage.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nAt a rally on January 16, Michael Moore said, \u201cI am standing in the middle of a crime scene. Ten people have been killed \u2026 because of a decision to save money.\u201d The city\u2019s water supply was changed from Detroit\u2019s water supply to the Flint River in 2014, in spite of the new source\u2019s reputation for being filled with contaminants like raw sewage and tires.\n\nAs Anti-Media previously reported, \u201cThe shift in supply was a result of failed procedures and negotiations to continue purchasing the water.\u201d\n\nFurther, the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality has admitted its failure in not requiring that non-corrosive additives be added to the water during treatment to counteract the lead that seeps into water from old pipes. Authorities at the state level reportedly belittled concerns from Flint\u2019s local community about the quality of their water. The national EPA has also been criticized for its involvement (or lack thereof) in the water crisis.\n\nThese examples of incompetence and corruption, along with the residents\u2019 ongoing suffering, led Moore to speak out. Meanwhile, the Michigan militia, known as the Genesee County Volunteer Militia, has been working with the Red Cross to deliver clean water door-to-door, making stops that include a senior living facility and an elementary school. The Detroit Free Press reported that in a news release, the militia said, \u201cIt is nothing less than shocking that our elected officials would try to hide the hazards that residents are being subjected to just by drinking a simple glass of tap water!!!\u201d Further, the group demanded more information from the government on who was \u201cinvolved in a coverup.\u201d\n\nDetails have emerged that suggest Governor Rick Snyder and his administration ignored warnings about the looming crisis \u2014 and that Snyder has since tried to cover up this prior knowledge. He released emails this week that were largely redacted, and Michael Moore has called for his arrest.\n\nThe militia is planning a rally for Sunday at 2pm at the City of Flint Municipal Center, and is working with Moore to ensure voices of dissent are continually heard.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to coordinate so the protests don\u2019t stop,\u201d Dave McKellar, a member of the right-wing armed force said. He owns a tree service business in Flint.\n\nMcKellar expressed his willingness to work with More in spite of differences of opinion on other matters. \u201cWe don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on many things,\u201d said McKellar. \u201cFor him to step forward and say something good\u2026 this time I agree with him.\u201d\n\nAs McKellar said of the militia, \u201cWhat we are is a constitutional defense force. We protect people who can\u2019t protect themselves in time of disaster, be it man-made or other.\u201d Still, the militia has made it clear its focus is not on weapons, but on the crisis at hand. The group posted on Facebook about its upcoming Sunday protest, noting, \u201cWe ask that you only wear side arms and not long rifles, this is not about our 2nd Amendment, this is about the infringement on the good people of Flint.\u201d\n\nThe alliance between the militia and Michael Moore is admittedly unlikely. One of Moore\u2019s most successful films, Bowling for Columbine, focused on the negative effects of guns in America, and the left\u2019s reaction to the Oregon standoff \u2014 including calls to drone strike the so-called \u201cdomestic terrorists\u201d have highlighted contentious, long-running divisions between armed protest movements and liberal causes. Animosity between left and right in the United States has reached fever-pitch on countless issues, from healthcare to police brutality to the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nNevertheless, the two seemingly conflicting parties have placed the health of their fellow citizens above partisan hatred. Though they do not appear to have established a permanent relationship, Moore and the militia\u2019s collaboration suggests that, perhaps, Americans can share a common cause.\n\nIndeed, a wide variety of groups have stepped up to help residents of Flint. In addition to Michael Moore, the militia, and the Red Cross, an Islamic charity, local activists, and a Native American tribe have committed to helping the struggling community, along with countless Americans across the country.\n\nThis content first appeared on the AntiMedia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The two seemingly conflicting parties have placed the health of their fellow citizens above partisan hatred., Flint, Genesee County Volunteer Militia, micheale moore, water crisis,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Carey Wedler | AntiMedia", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "The two seemingly conflicting parties have placed the health of their fellow citizens above partisan hatred., Flint, Genesee County Volunteer Militia, micheale moore, water crisis,", "title": "Michigan Militia Joins Michael Moore To Protest Flint Water Crisis", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/michigan-militia-joins-michael-moore-to-protest-flint-water-crisis/213039/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1c54c188bb06459b.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-22T18:22:42-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The two seemingly conflicting parties have placed the health of their fellow citizens above partisan hatred., Flint, Genesee County Volunteer Militia, micheale moore, water crisis,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1c54c188bb06459b.jpg", "title": "Michigan Militia Joins Michael Moore To Protest Flint Water Crisis", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "water crisis", "published_time": "2016-01-23T18:11:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-22T18:22:42-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1cff\"", "article_summary": "Michigan Militia Joins Michael Moore To Protest Flint Water CrisisThe two seemingly conflicting parties have placed the health of their fellow citizens above partisan hatred.\nFlint, MI \u2014 The water crisis in Flint, Michigan has inspired an unlikely partnership: a local militia group is coordinating with outspoken liberal filmmaker Michael Moore to demand accountability and clean water for residents.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsorAt a rally on January 16, Michael Moore said, \u201cI am standing in the middle of a crime scene.\nThe national EPA has also been criticized for its involvement (or lack thereof) in the water crisis.\nHe released emails this week that were largely redacted, and Michael Moore has called for his arrest."}
