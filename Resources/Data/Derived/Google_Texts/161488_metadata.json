It\u2019s a great and rewarding job \u2026 or at least it used to be.\n\nRecently, something has changed. My clients are wealthy people \u2013 the one-percenters who\u2019ve been raked over the coals for the last seven years \u2013 and for the first time I can remember, they\u2019re feeling very pessimistic about the future. On a business level, they feel beaten down by onerous and overbearing rules and regulations. And on a personal level, they feel demonized for the \u201ccrime\u201d of being successful.\n\nSomebody, please tell me \u2026 When did getting rich become a bad thing? Our nation was built on a \u201ccan-do\u201d attitude, and the people who \u201ccould do and did\u201d \u2013 people named Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, Carnegie, Gates, Jobs, Zuckerberg \u2013 got rich doing it. In America, you could always do more than just dream of being rich. If you had a great idea and worked hard to make it a reality, the sky was the limit.\n\nBut I\u2019m not seeing much of that these days. Many of my clients, people who used to make bold investments, are running scared. They\u2019ve turned skittish, and it\u2019s not because they\u2019ve grown old. It\u2019s because entrepreneurs have to be eternally and sometimes irrationally optimistic, and now they\u2019re looking out at the horizon and seeing nothing but danger of every conceivable kind: financial, legal, physical, etc. They used to come to me and say, \u201cLet\u2019s make some money.\u201d Now they say, \u201cLet\u2019s not lose any.\u201d\n\nProsperity has left the building. Survivability has taken the stage.\n\nWe\u2019ve entered a period of trickle-down negativity, and it\u2019s trickling down from the very top. The one-percenters used to be immune to bad times, as if they were surrounded by a force field. But now that has changed. Now my clients come to me and say they don\u2019t like how things are going in the world, and all they want to do is set up a portfolio for survival. And this is frightening, because I used to think pessimism wasn\u2019t in their DNA.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nNow, maybe you feel this doesn\u2019t concern you. Or maybe you\u2019re even enjoying a prolonged moment of schadenfreude because, after all, we\u2019re talking about rich people. But if that\u2019s what you\u2019re feeling, consider this: These are the people who create jobs. These could well be the people who pay your salary, or who will hire your sons and daughters. If the reward for getting rich through invention and hard work is that you\u2019ll become a pariah, then what\u2019s the point of even trying?\n\nTo my mind, there\u2019s still hope. This is an election year, and one thing we know for certain is that someone new \u2013 maybe a Democrat, maybe a Republican, maybe even an Independent \u2013 will be living in the White House a year from now.\n\nWhomever that person is, he or she had better have a handle on our economy, as well as a plan to get it back on track.\n\nThis will require more than lip service, more than boasting that the first order of business will be to repeal ObamaCare or provide Medicare for everyone. The next president will have to have a comprehensive plan to turn things around, to carry out Donald Trump\u2019s slogan and make America great again.\n\nBut that means we have to stop all this yammering about building walls, fighting terrorists and unveiling emails. Here\u2019s a slogan worth remembering: It\u2019s the economy, stupid!\n\nI have a front-row view of what is happening to the one-percenters, and what I see is a group that has been the country\u2019s punching bag for seven years. Now they\u2019ve lost their long-distance vision. They\u2019re not looking five years out \u2026 or three or two or even six months.\n\nThey\u2019re not looking to grow; they\u2019re looking to survive. And that\u2019s bad not only for them, but for all of us \u2013 because that negativity trickles down into their businesses and their investments.\n\nWhat they want and need is a candidate with a \u201ccan-do\u201d attitude, someone who seeks to effect sweeping change, someone who knows that when you\u2019re riding a dead horse, it\u2019s time to dismount. They want a candidate who understands the problem and has very specific plans to remedy it. Someone who will reduce the burden on business, which includes taxes and unnecessary regulations. Someone who understands that it\u2019s OK to be wealthy and that it\u2019s OK to compete and win, because nothing in this world ever got better without competition. Someone who knows that fertile soil allows everything to grow and that if you have a positive attitude and a positive business climate, everyone will grow together.\n\nThis is a country where any lump of coal can become a diamond, where if you can conceive it, you can achieve it. What the one-percenters \u2013 and the other 99 percent, as well \u2013 need is a president who believes it, and a government that will get out of the way so it can happen.\n\nEd Butowsky is the managing partner of Chapwood Investments, LLC, a private wealth management advisory firm that focuses on providing comprehensive financial counseling and investment advice to wealthy families and individuals.
