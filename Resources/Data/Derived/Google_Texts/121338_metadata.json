It took two months and 10 recipes for New York City Chef Dominique Ansel to perfect and release the cronut into the world in October 2013, and now another masterpiece has been created. The grilled cheese crescent doughnuts are an invention out of Oh Bite It! food blog, which provides step-by-step photos of the pastry hybrid-calorie nightmare.\n\n\u201cI can talk about buttery, flaky layers of crescent dough, toasted perfectly, held together by gooey, melty cheese,\u201d Oh Bite It blogger Amy wrote. \u201cI can definitely tell you that once your face sinks down into one, just one bite of this melt-in-your-mouth, out of this world puffed pillow of perfection, you will never be the same. Nothing will ever taste that great again\u2026 nothing will ever quite compare.\u201d\n\nThe basket of ingredients include: two rolls of Pillsbury Crescent Seamless Dough Sheets, six to eight Velvetta Cheese slices, Canola oil, and a one-inch and three-inch cookie cutter. The blog isn\u2019t allowed to call the creation a cronut for legal reasons, but the imitation looks remarkably similar. The official cronut recipe takes three days to complete, while the cheesy copycat only takes about 20 minutes from prep until it\u2019s time to take it out of the fryer.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that a third of America is obese, but our taste buds seem to be disregarding the signs of disease, cancer, and chronic conditions associated with high blood pressure, cholesterol, and an overall unhealthy diet. There is an undeniably innate human love for all that is fatty, salty, and sugary, albeit there\u2019s no reason we should indulge in it to excess. From the cheese to the dough, there\u2019s rampant fat and fluff in the ingredients that provide no nutritional value. Of course, it\u2019s suitable as a treat and cheat days are suggested by most dieticians, but there\u2019s been an overload in America. Everywhere we turn there\u2019s a new concoction of chemicals, carcinogens, and calories.\n\nThe blogger recognizes this and notes a disclaimer to cover her entire site. She said she\u2019s aware the recipes are \u201coutrageous, sugar filled, ooey gooey treats\u201d but she doesn\u2019t normally eat this way. \u201cIf you\u2019re easily offended by looking at crazy calorie-filled creations, this may not be the place for you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "grilled, cheese, cronut, fulfills, americas, unhealthy, love, pastry, hybrids", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Following the invention of the cronut, a croissant-doughnut mashup, comes the inspired cheese version, but do we need more unhealthy hybrids?", "title": "Grilled Cheese Cronut Fulfills Americans' Darkest Desires", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/grilled-cheese-cronut-fulfills-americas-unhealthy-love-pastry-hybrids-312994", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2014/12/03/grilled-cheese-doughnut-pastry-out-does-itself.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Following the invention of the cronut, a croissant-doughnut mashup, comes the inspired cheese version, but do we need more unhealthy hybrids?", "title": "Grilled Cheese Cronut Fulfills Americans' Darkest Desires", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/grilled-cheese-cronut-fulfills-americas-unhealthy-love-pastry-hybrids-312994", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2014/12/03/grilled-cheese-doughnut-pastry-out-does-itself.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/03/grilled-cheese-doughnut-pastry-out-does-itself.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-12-03T17:53:52-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-03T17:53:51-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Following the invention of the cronut, a croissant-doughnut mashup, comes the inspired cheese version, but do we need more unhealthy hybrids?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf685\"", "article_summary": "The grilled cheese crescent doughnuts are an invention out of Oh Bite It!\nFrom the cheese to the dough, there\u2019s rampant fat and fluff in the ingredients that provide no nutritional value.\n\u201cI can talk about buttery, flaky layers of crescent dough, toasted perfectly, held together by gooey, melty cheese,\u201d Oh Bite It blogger Amy wrote.\nThe blog isn\u2019t allowed to call the creation a cronut for legal reasons, but the imitation looks remarkably similar.\nShe said she\u2019s aware the recipes are \u201coutrageous, sugar filled, ooey gooey treats\u201d but she doesn\u2019t normally eat this way."}
