But that doesn\u2019t mean his incendiary campaign for the presidency has hurt his business here, where the Trump name is on apartment towers, golf courses and even public skating rinks.\n\nAlthough the terms of Trump\u2019s agreements are mostly secret, it\u2019s likely that only a felony conviction would allow a condo association or licensee to take his name off a building.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, you need to have a majority of condo owners in a building say, \u2018I want to try to break the branding contract,\u2019 \u201d said Robert Ivanhoe, an attorney with Greenberg Traurig. \u201cIf Trump has 30 years on his contract, you\u2019d have to pay him what he would earn in 30 years.\u201d\n\nThough Mayor Bill de Blasio last week called Trump \u201cdangerous\u201d and a \u201cdemagogue,\u201d he is powerless to take Trump\u2019s name off the two skating rinks, the Central Park carousel and the Bronx golf course that he manages for the city. \u201cIn August, we reviewed the city\u2019s existing contracts with Donald Trump and found no legal way to cancel these contracts,\u201d said a de Blasio spokeswoman.\n\nWhile condo boards have the ability to hire and fire management companies, it is telling that the Trump Organization has stayed on at many of the buildings it has constructed, including Trump World Tower at U.N. Plaza. \u201cTrump buildings are extremely well managed,\u201d said Leonard Steinberg, president at residential brokerage Compass. \u201cLike it or not, he does a good job.\u201d\n\nBecause of that following, Steinberg and others believe Trump\u2019s antics on the political stage will have little impact on the value of his properties in New York City.\n\n\u201cThese buildings that bear his name will continue to be valued based on the state of the market\u2014not his personality,\u201d said Louise Phillips Forbes, a residential broker at Halstead Property Management.\n\nJump-starting 2 WTC\n\nRupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox and News Corp. will get a rent break at Larry Silverstein\u2019s 2 World Trade Center, thanks to $9 million in subsidies from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The public funds are supposed to speed construction of the tower, ensuring Murdoch\u2019s media empire makes the move and unlocking $600 million for transportation spending, the Port Authority said.\n\nProtecting wages\n\nA judge upheld a state rule requiring nail salons to buy bonds to ensure workers get paid any back wages due.\n\nA Fifth Season\n\nPepsi challenged? The Mets made it to the World Series this past season, but that wasn\u2019t enough for Pepsi\u2014Citi Field\u2019s marquee sponsor since the stadium opened in 2009. The soda company didn\u2019t renew its deal with the team, and the red Pepsi sign towering over the second deck in right field will be removed. Rival Coca-Cola has been in discussions to join the Mets roster.\n\n\n\nSeagram Building owner Aby Rosen hopes to raise $30 million for an eatery to replace the fabled Philip Johnson-designed Four Seasons restaurant in the iconic Park Avenue office tower. Rosen says he\u2019s looking for as many as 100 investors, pledging a 120% return before partners take any proceeds and a 40% cut of future profits.\n\nVino in one hour\n\nAmazon has added booze to its $7.99 one-hour delivery service in Manhattan, as food-delivery wars heat up during the holiday season. Amazon also promises 60-minute delivery from Mario Batali\u2019s Italian-food emporium, Eataly.\n\nObamacare push\n\nThe White House has tasked New York-based health care startups ZocDoc and Oscar with coaxing the nation\u2019s uninsured to get coverage for 2016. Oscar created a two-minute video starring its ubiquitous cartoon characters explaining insurance concepts.\n\nMickey invests in Vice\n\nDisney invested an additional $200 million in Brooklyn\u2019s Vice Media to help finance original programming for Vice\u2019s new cable channel, set to launch in February. Disney now owns a 10% stake.\n\nCash flush\n\nTwo NYPD officers from Flushing\u2019s 109th Precinct were arrested on bribery charges for allegedly taking payoffs from local karaoke bar owners to ignore drug use and other violations at the venues.\n\nData point\n\nNew York City finished ninth out of 10 state regions in Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s annual economic-development grant contest, with $84.1 million awarded to 92 projects.\n\nGet Crain's Real Estate Daily (RED) Alert Sign up for our FREE daily Real Estate Alert email newsletter.
