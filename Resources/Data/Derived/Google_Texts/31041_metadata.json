Bush was President in 2006, 70% of Americans wanted the Federal Government to provide health care insurance to them. Mainly because the Middle Class became the working poor after NAFTA was signed and companies left our shores for cheaper labor markets and countries where they could pollute freely. We hadn\u2019t reached Wall Street\u2019s meltdown caused by years of financial deregulation by GWB, but it was coming.\n\nThen Senator Barack Obama promised \u201cHope and Change\u201d, and said he would deliver health care to struggling Americans and won big in 2008 \u2013 even a red state like Indiana voted for him.\n\nFrom one of President Obama\u2019s speeches:\n\nFor a long time, America was the only advanced economy in the world where health care was not a right, but a privilege. We spent more, we got less. We left tens of millions of Americans without the security of health insurance. By the time the financial crisis hit, most folks\u2019 premiums had more than doubled in about a decade. About one in 10 Americans who got their health care through their employer lost that coverage. So the health care system was not working. And the rising costs of health care burdened businesses and became the biggest driver of our long-term deficits.\n\nMuncie Voice has pointed out these statistics time and time again. Let\u2019s reiterate, \u201cAmerican was the ONLY advanced economy in the world where health care was not a right, but a privilege.\u201d\n\nThis is a fact, folks. It\u2019s not an opinion or a belief \u2013 FACT. Meaning, there is really no need to argue pro or con, left or right, liberal view versus conservative view \u2013 FACT.\n\nThe reason Muncie Voice was created in 2011 was the gross negligence of our Fourth Estate, a free and independent press, to report facts to the public. Especially in Indiana with Gannett News owning four (4) newspapers in Indianapolis, Muncie, Lafayette and Richmond. Hoosiers have been sold propaganda for years by the biggest newspaper chain in America.\n\nBack to President Obama\u2019s speech about his personal experience:\n\nEverywhere I went as I ran for President back in 2007, 2008, everyplace I\u2019ve gone as President, I would hear stories from folks just like you of insurers that denied a child coverage because he had a pre\u00ebxisting condition like asthma; of cancer survivors that had to choose between their home or their health care; of small businesses who wanted to do the right thing by their employees but had seen their insurance premiums go up so high that they just couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\n\nThe Gallup poll shows exactly where public opinion was in 2006 and 2007. It was reaching its peak at 70%. But, check out what happened during the election year in 2008 \u2013 it started to decline a bit. Why?\n\nIt became an issue during the campaign trail and the media, owned by republicans, started talking about it, negatively.\n\nPresident Obama delivered on his campaign promise and the Affordable Care Act is now law and working in states that cooperated. However, once he became president and passed ACA, free market libertarian billionaires with the last name, Koch, stepped forward spending billions in negative ads with corporate owned media and hired mouthpieces (politicians) to fight the ACA.\n\nThese mouthpieces now hold governor seats in 23 red states and our congress in the nation\u2019s capital. Their goal for 2016 is to buy THE seat in the People\u2019s House.\n\nThe Koch\u2019s and Big Insurance have spent billions in negative ads and with the help of mouthpieces like Rep. Luke Messer and others across the country, they\u2019ve been spouting negativity. The mouthpieces in Washington have voted to repeal the ACA over 50 times, and they even shut down our federal government after losing the 2012 election. This cost us taxpayers around $50 billion dollars. They\u2019ve used their network of conservative media to communicate to the base of traditional republicans and expand that base using \u201cdog-whistle politics\u201d on Fox News made famous by Ronald Reagan\u2019s use of \u201cWelfare Queens\u201d and \u201cYoung Bucks\u201d. It worked for Roger Ailes while he managed Reagan\u2019s campaign, so why shouldn\u2019t he use it as President of Fox News.\n\nAnd, it\u2019s worked brilliantly on unsuspecting Teapublicans and others who watch Fox News.\n\nEven Gallup identifies how one party\u2019s ideological beliefs can change despite evidence to the contrary:\n\nYet, a majority of Americans continue to say they disapprove of it, even as the ACA is making progress toward its stated goal of expanding health insurance coverage. That more than half of Americans think it is not the government\u2019s role to make sure Americans have healthcare coverage suggests that opposition to the ACA may be centered more on its philosophical underpinnings, rather than on the specifics of its actual provisions and outcomes.\n\nWhy are republicans so easily persuaded by the media and their own negatively speaking politicians? They say they don\u2019t trust politicians, but for some reason they trust their own. Does this make them bigger fools?\n\nThe US Chamber, Big Insurance, and Koch brothers have spent billions in negative ads and buying up political mouthpieces to repeal a law they don\u2019t want because it\u2019s working, and bringing down healthcare costs. However, they don\u2019t want any government \u2013 they want to eliminate it and privatize all functions of our democratic government.\n\nIf only President Obama had gone one step further and opted for Universal Health Care for all Americans. All the billions wasted on health insurance could be used to help prevent diseases, cut out the public and private sector from having to offer insurance for employees, and improve the health and well-being of all Americans.\n\nMaybe the 2016 presidential candidates will have this on their agenda and prove to the American people that we deserve exactly what we wanted in 2006. Or, will we continue to be led like sheep to believe exactly the opposite of our self interests?\n\nOne things for sure, the Oligarchs will continue spending billions of dollars in misinformation and propaganda campaigns because they\u2019ve worked so far. It took less than four (4) years to get over half of Americans to completely flip-flop their opinions without a shred of evidence to support their case.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Muncie Voice", "description": "Gallup Captures How Easily Republicans Change Their Minds Contrary to Factual Evidence MUNCIE, Indiana \u2013 According to a recent Gallup Poll, when George W.
