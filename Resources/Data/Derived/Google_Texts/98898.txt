In what forecasters at the National Weather Service in Boulder call “a nice change,” the weather in the metro Denver area this weekend is expected to be clear, dry and warm.

It’s just a matter of getting through the next few days of moisture.

“There will be about a 30 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms every day until Thursday, then less heading into the weekend,” said meteorologist Kyle Fredin.

That was the case on Monday, which, besides the rain, saw some hail strikes in Westminster and Arvada. Outside of Denver, the NWS set flood warnings for the Cache La Poudre and South Platte rivers in Weld, Morgan, Logan and Washington counties.

So far in May, the weather monitoring site at Denver International Airport has received 3.72 inches of rain. The 30-year average is 1.67 inches for this point in May. Since Jan. 1, Denver has had 8.79 inches of precipitation as of Friday. Normal is 5.08 inches, according to the service.
