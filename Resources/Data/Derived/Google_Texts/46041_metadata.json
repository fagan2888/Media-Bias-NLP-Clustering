I love my job. We got to know our patients.\"\n\nNow Marcotte, a single mother of four, and 156 former employees will be looking for work.\n\nCHI Health said the layoffs are part of a \"effort to bring healthcare costs down. Across the country, expense reductions are being made and staffing is being restructured.\"\n\n\"The signs were there, we just were not ready for them,\" Marcotte said.\n\nWhen Blue Cross Blue Shield and CHI Health couldn't reach an agreement for an insurance coverage contract, Marcotte noticed a significant decline in the number of patients visiting her office.\n\n\"I would say it probably dropped off between 60 percent and 65 percent when Blue Cross and CHI couldn't come to an agreement,\" Marcotte said.\n\nMarcotte said CHI Health did offer her a severance package. There's still a sense of urgency knowing she needs to provide for her children, though.\n\n\"It's a hard deal, it's hard to take,\" Marcotte said. \"It's hard to come home and tell your family you don't have a job tomorrow, you know? Can't put that easily to anybody.\"\n\nThe 156 laid-off employees represent about 1 percent of the entire workforce for CHI Health. Marcotte said her friends that were laid off were clerical workers, like herself.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 21:30:00 CST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Dave Roberts", "og": {"site_name": "KETV", "description": "After 5 1/2 years with the Lakeside Hospital Outpatient Imagine Center, Rebecca Marcotte never thought she'd be looking for a job anytime soon.", "title": "More than 100 CHI Health workers laid off Tuesday", "url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/more-than-100-chi-health-workers-laid-off-tuesday/30689442", "image": "http://www.ketv.com/image/view/-/30689576/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/14aenk6/-/CHI-Health-JPG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/more-than-100-chi-health-workers-laid-off-tuesday/30689442", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "ketv://content/article/30689442", "iphone": "ketv://content/article/30689442", "googleplay": "ketv://content/article/30689442"}, "name": {"ipad": "ketv", "iphone": "ketv", "googleplay": "ketv"}, "id": {"ipad": 505254249, "iphone": 505254249, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}}, "site": "@ketv", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "ketv://content/article/30689442", "app_name": "ketv", "package": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}, "ios": {"url": "ketv://content/article/30689442", "app_store_id": 505254249, "app_name": "ketv"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130967633662636}, "google-site-verification": "a0PMTzs25l6fcC16_88mc37ga4Phf53uYiDWwMp4Ois", "keywords": "CHI Health,", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/DaveRobertsLIVE"}, "news_keywords": "CHI Health,", "description": "After 5 1/2 years with the Lakeside Hospital Outpatient Imagine Center, Rebecca Marcotte never thought she'd be looking for a job anytime soon."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce5d\"", "article_summary": "Video: More than 100 CHI Health workers laid off Tuesday\"I got there at 10:30 a.m. and I was back home by 11:15 a.m.,\" Marcotte said.\nThe 156 laid-off employees represent about 1 percent of the entire workforce for CHI Health.\nCHI Health said the layoffs are part of a \"effort to bring healthcare costs down.\nMarcotte said CHI Health did offer her a severance package.\nWhen Blue Cross Blue Shield and CHI Health couldn't reach an agreement for an insurance coverage contract, Marcotte noticed a significant decline in the number of patients visiting her office."}
