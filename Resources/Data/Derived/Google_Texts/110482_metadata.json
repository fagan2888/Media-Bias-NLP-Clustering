The Affordable Care Act has enabled more than 16.4 million Americans to receive health-care coverage. Advancements in technology improve both diagnoses and treatment quality. Retail health offers a convenience used by more than 10 million patients at 1,800 retail-health locations. Along with the current challenges facing the healthcare system, such as an aging population, increased patient volume and physician shortages, these changes prompt the expansion of the traditional role of a nurse.\n\nGenerally, Americans believe nurses\u2019 roles are expanding as they share increased responsibilities to support the delivery of high quality health care, according to a poll commissioned by University of Phoenix College of Health Professions. The survey also found that adults in the United States view their experience with nurses as overwhelmingly positive. In fact, 95% found nurses to be a valuable addition to the health-care system as a whole, and 87% view nurses as trusted sources of health information.\n\n\u201cAs nurses take on greater responsibility, and as the needs of health-care organizations continue to grow more complex, the skills and training requirements of nurses must be prepared to match this growth,\u201d says Betty Nelson, Ph.D., RN, and academic dean for University of Phoenix School of Nursing. \u201cThis is especially important given that the United States is currently facing a shortage of as many as 90,000 physicians by 2025. Nurses with advanced education can help fill this shortage, particularly in areas where consumers do not have access to care.\u201d\n\nBecause of this, employers are looking for nurses with a variety of skills and certifications including:\n\nAdditional degrees or seeking an advanced degree\n\nIn-demand skills such as bilingualism, leadership and critical thinking\n\nFlexibility and professionalism\n\nThe desire to grow into advanced practitioners such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants\n\nSpecialized training for working with various populations\n\nAn openness to diverse opportunities in a number of different facilities\n\nIn order to keep up with the changes in the health-care system, at least 80% of the nation\u2019s nursing workforce will need a bachelor\u2019s degree by 2020, and the number of nurses with doctoral degrees will need to be double, according to the Institute of Medicine. Nursing education institutions play a critical role in meeting the needs of today\u2019s health-care system. Nurses need a place to obtain these degrees and further their skills within the health-care industry. Institutions recognize the expanding role of the 21st century nurse and are offering a wide range of curriculum and degree programs that address recent changes in the delivery of primary care. Graduates need to be equipped with the skills they need to succeed in today\u2019s health-care market.\n\nIt\u2019s now more important than ever that nurses have the training and skills to match the demands of the growing profession. Along with the nursing community, institutions that offer nursing degree programs must work together to enhance and better prepare the nursing workforce.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "Nurses\u2019 roles are expanding as they share increased responsibilities to support the delivery of high quality health care.", "title": "What employers look for in the 21st century nurse", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/services/how-to-choose-a-college/employers-21st-century-nurse-article-1.2360051", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2360052.1442258786!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/web-20177309-original.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-type": "article", "nydn_tags": "How to Choose a College", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-09-14T19:44:42", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/services/how-to-choose-a-college/employers-21st-century-nurse-article-1.2360051", "parsely-title": "What employers look for in the 21st century nurse", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-14T15:44:42-0400", "sailthru.title": "What employers look for in the 21st century nurse", "nydn_section": "How To Choose A College", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2360052.1442258786!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/web-20177309-original.jpg", "description": "Nurses\u2019 roles are expanding as they share increased responsibilities to support the delivery of high quality health care.", "robots": "NOFOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "How To Choose A College", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Nurses\u2019 roles are expanding as they share increased responsibilities to support the delivery of high quality health care.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Nurses\u2019 roles are expanding as they share increased responsibilities to support the delivery of high quality health care.", "title": "What employers look for in the 21st century nurse", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/services/how-to-choose-a-college/employers-21st-century-nurse-article-1.2360051", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2360052.1442258786!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/web-20177309-original.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "How to Choose a College", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2360052.1442258786!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/web-20177309-original.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2929\"", "article_summary": "Nurses need a place to obtain these degrees and further their skills within the health-care industry.\nInstitutions recognize the expanding role of the 21st century nurse and are offering a wide range of curriculum and degree programs that address recent changes in the delivery of primary care.\nIt\u2019s now more important than ever that nurses have the training and skills to match the demands of the growing profession.\nNursing education institutions play a critical role in meeting the needs of today\u2019s health-care system.\nAlong with the current challenges facing the healthcare system, such as an aging population, increased patient volume and physician shortages, these changes prompt the expansion of the traditional role of a nurse."}
