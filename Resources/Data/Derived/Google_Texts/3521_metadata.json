But if the electorate gives them the White House, they\u2019ll get what they need.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, this what divided government is,\u201d Ryan said, explaining last fall\u2019s Boehner-Obama budget deal. \u201cThe problem with divided government is you can\u2019t always get everything you want.\u201d\n\nA hangover from outgoing Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, that agreement increased spending levels over the limits established in the 2011 Budget Control Act.\n\nThat deal, Ryan argues, requires context and \u201ca civic lesson.\u201d\n\nThough Republicans control both chambers of Congress, the Wisconsin speaker explained that \u201cwhen you have a liberal progressive president who won\u2019t sign conservative bills into law, they don\u2019t go into law.\u201d\n\nConservatives in both the House and the Senate challenge that logic. Members such as Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, want to scrap the Boehner-Obama budget agreement and restart with a lower spending level\u2014one that reflects Republican priorities.\n\nCurrently, that budget skirmish divides the Republican ranks. Conservatives say the spending levels negotiated in the Boehner-Obama budget are a non-starter. Talks continue inside the conservative House Freedom Caucus. The budget hawks want to find at least $30 billion\u2019s worth of discretionary spending cuts in a $4 trillion budget.\n\nBut Ryan and GOP leadership have been clear: If Republicans want to pursue marquee reforms, they must get on board with the higher spending levels first.\n\nDuring a closed-door meeting before Congress left Washington for Presidents Day recess, Ryan told Republicans that if they\u2019ll just stomach the higher spending levels, the party has \u201ca chance to do big things in 2017.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s more a messaging than legislative exercise. Realistically, Ryan\u2019s reform agenda won\u2019t make it past President Barack Obama\u2019s veto pen. And with a Senate scrambling to find a replacement to fill Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat on the Supreme Court, it\u2019s uncertain how much work the upper chamber will accomplish this year.\n\nRyan said a GOP-led Congress should \u201cgive the people a clear and compelling choice.\u201d And by laying out an agenda of significant across-the-board reforms, Republicans can convince an electorate to deliver the White House.\n\n\u201cWe have to have the people break this tie [between a] liberal president, conservative Congress,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe have to do big things soon. Give us a president we can work with, and in 2017 we can get this country back on track.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the Kelly File, House Speaker Paul Ryan said the only way for the GOP to achieve reforms is for the American people to deliver a Republican president.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "On the Kelly File, House Speaker Paul Ryan said the only way for the GOP to achieve reforms is for the American people to deliver a Republican president.", "title": "Paul Ryan Reality Check: Reforms Require GOP President", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/PRyan.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-23T12:45:40+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/21mAMKM"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "On the Kelly File, House Speaker Paul Ryan said the only way for the GOP to achieve reforms is for the American people to deliver a Republican president.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/PRyan.jpg"}, "title": "Paul Ryan Reality Check: Reforms Require GOP President", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "politics", "published_time": "2016-02-22T22:50:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-23T12:45:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Paul Ryan, GOP, House of Representatives, Kelly File, Megyn Kelly,"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe have to have the people break this tie [between a] liberal president, conservative Congress,\u201d Ryan said.\nBut Ryan and GOP leadership have been clear: If Republicans want to pursue marquee reforms, they must get on board with the higher spending levels first.\nThe Republican House speaker told host Megyn Kelly that Republicans can\u2019t always get what they want.\nGive us a president we can work with, and in 2017 we can get this country back on track.\u201d\nConservatives say the spending levels negotiated in the Boehner-Obama budget are a non-starter."}
