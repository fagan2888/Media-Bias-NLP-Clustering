Brody is now 3 years old.\n\nBut after Brody's birth, Trisha struggled to get pregnant again. She tried many different medications and procedures, including artificial insemination.\n\n\"It's physically demanding. It's also emotionally and financially demanding. It's a huge sacrifice that you're making,\" Trisha said.\n\n\"She had to be on multiple medications. That was hard,\" David said.\n\n\"Finally, after a couple years of things not working out, we decided to give IVF a try,\" Trisha said.\n\nDuring in vitro fertilization, or IVF, doctors combine an egg and sperm outside the body in a lab. Once an embryo or embryos form, they are then placed in the uterus. Unfortunately, the expensive procedure did not work either.\n\n\"I was probably ready to throw in the towel. I was so emotionally drained,\" Trisha said.\n\nAfter debating it for a couple months, the Dohns decided to give IVF one more try. This time, the Dohns used a process called PGS testing. Doctors test embryos to see if they're healthy before transferring them into a woman's uterus.\n\n\"I think a lot of people wonder why if we have one perfect, healthy child why go through all of this, but for us it's about having that for Brody, having that sibling,\" Trisha said.\n\nThat's why this Christmas the Dohns are glad they kept the faith; they're expecting a baby boy in March.\n\n\"Our greatest joy is really to be parents. We're just so excited to experience that joy again and for our son to have a sibling--that's what we're most excited about,\" Trisha said.\n\nEven though the parenting path has been expensive, the Dohns are very thankful this holiday season.\n\n\"We understand how blessed we are to be in this situation because we know so many people who aren't,\" Trisha said. \"There's absolutely no greater gift than knowing that we're going to be parents.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Like many expectant mothers, Trisha Dohn is preparing her nursery, but her path to becoming a parent is anything but typical.
