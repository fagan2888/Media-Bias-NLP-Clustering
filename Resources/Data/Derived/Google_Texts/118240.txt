GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz drew a large crowd at the Trussville Civic Center on Sunday in an attempt to woo Alabama voters.

GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz has surged ahead in Iowa and is now working on securing the South.

Cruz drew a large crowd at the Trussville Civic Center on Sunday in an attempt to woo Alabama voters.

New polls have Cruz in second place in the race for the GOP nomination.

"God bless the great state of Alabama," said Cruz, as he opened his speech.

The room where Cruz gave his speech maxed out at around 1,000 people.

Cruz’ campaign estimated at least another 500 were in the Civic Center's gym that was used as the overflow room.

Trussville is one of the 12 stops Cruz is making in seven days.

It’s a push to win the “SEC Primary,” when Southern states, including Alabama, go to the polls March 1.

"I think Alabama is going to be very important this year considering our place in the SEC primary. Cruz is positioned to do well in the early voting states and I think he's going to do very well in Alabama," University of Alabama student Davy Bennett said.

Cruz secured at least one new vote from Mary Richmond.

"I had not committed until now," Richmond said. "He honed in on the Christian aspect of it, which is important to me. He just said all the right things."

Cruz also promised to investigate Planned Parenthood, pass a flat tax reform plan, and end welfare benefits for people who immigrate to the United States illegally.

"We will finally secure the borders," Cruz said.

Cruz also vowed to the Trussville crowd that he would repeal "every word of Obamacare."

“I'm young and I feel like he's the leader of the new conservative movement in America," University of Alabama student Cameron Mixon said.

Cruz told WVTM 13 News that he did not watch Saturday’s debate among the Democratic presidential hopefuls.

He said he went to Summit Shopping Center in Birmingham to see Star Wars.
