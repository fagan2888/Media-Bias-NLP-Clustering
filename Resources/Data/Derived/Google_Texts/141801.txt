Hoping to score tickets to see the Chicago Cubs play in the National League Championship Series? Well it could cost you a fortune.

The current average asking price for NLCS tickets is $1,325.93, making it the most expansive price for any League Championship Series ticket in history, according to TiqIQ.com, a tickets aggregation site. The price is for a game at Chicago's Wrigley Field.

The Cubs advanced to the NLCS when they eliminated the St. Louis Cardinals, 6-4, in Game 4 of the division series on Tuesday night.

It's the first time in 12 years that the Cubs will be playing in a league championship. It puts the Cubs just one step away from the Word Series, which they haven't won since 1908.

Devoted Cubs fans have attributed the century-long drought to the "Billy Goat" curse. The superstition dates to Oct. 6, 1945, when a bar owner supposedly placed a hex on the club for booting his foul-smelling pet goat out of Wrigley Field, according to History.com. The Cubs lost, and haven't played in a World Series since then.

"Fans are definitely pretty excited this year," said Chris Matcovich, vice president of data and communications at TiqIQ. "They have a bunch of guys this year that have definitely stepped up and made this a pretty fun team to watch, regardless of who you root for."

The New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers play the deciding Game 5 on Thursday. If the Mets advance to face the Cubs, the average championship series ticket price listed on TiqIQ would be $1,084.31, by far a record. The previous NLCS record is $490.12, for last year's Cards-Giants series.
