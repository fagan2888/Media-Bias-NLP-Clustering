Thirteen Senate and Assembly committees meet at the Statehouse, while dozens of bills that have been on Christie\u2019s desk for months \u2014 including the Atlantic City rescue package and the \u201cDemocracy Act\u201d \u2014 are due for action. Here\u2019s my primer on that: http://politi.co/1NYcj8j\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cThe unions in our state decided that they were going to spend millions and millions of dollars, so I think the combination of the second term for a governor, which is always one that loses seats, and the huge way we got outspent, I think, are the two things that contributed the most to it and there's nothing I could do about either of those things\u201d \u2014 Chris Christie http://bit.ly/1kDaHHf\n\nWHERE\u2019S CHRISTIE? No public schedule but he\u2019s doing the full circuit this morning on Fox News (7:00), MSNBC (7:30), CNN (8:00) and CNBC (8:30). Yes, CNBC.\n\nPREZ POLLS\n\nIowa: CNN/ORC poll released Friday shows Christie in 8th place at 3 percent \u2014 unchanged from August poll.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY \u2014 Democratic State Committeewoman Jan Bidwell, Glen Rock Councilman Arthur Pazan, WNBC news photographer/editor Howard Gowa. Sunday for lobbyist A.J. Sabath and Democratic political consultant Victoria Mayer.\n\nSTATE NEWS\n\nAT LEAST WE\u2019RE STILL IN THE TOP HALF \u2014 \u201cNew Jersey gets D grade in 2015 State Integrity Investigation,\u201d by Ian Shearn for The Center for Public Integrity: \u201cBridgegate is perhaps the most brazen of a series of controversies, including lavish all-expense-paid trips and an ongoing battle with the press over public records, that have engulfed the Christie administration in recent years. All of this has contributed to the state earning an overall score of 65, or a grade of D, in the State Integrity Investigation, a data-driven analysis of state government accountability and transparency conducted by the Center for Public Integrity and Global Integrity. The report also found in New Jersey a significant \u201cenforcement gap,\u201d which measures the difference between the laws on the books and how they're actually implemented. The score places the Garden State 19th overall, a precipitous drop from 2012, when it earned a grade of B+ and the top rank in the nation. The two scores are not directly comparable, however, due to changes made to improve and update the questions and methodology, such as eliminating the category for redistricting, a process that generally occurs only once every 10 years.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NYcMY9\n\nNOT EASY FOR SCHEPISI \u2014 \u201cMountains to climb: North Jersey lawmaker tells of her road back after brain aneurysm,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Lindy Washburn: \u201cSchepisi, 43, knows that \u201con the lucky spectrum\u201d she\u2019s off the charts: After her brain surgery, she has no complications. She has returned to work full time, run an active political campaign and \u2014 as of last week \u2014 been reelected to a third term in the Legislature. But that luck came with a price \u2014 a financial one. As she dealt with her medical expenses, she needed all the skills she uses as a lawyer to navigate the billing maze: untangling what was charged and what was owed, what was in-network and what was out-of-network, what was her insurer\u2019s responsibility and what was her own. It hasn\u2019t been easy.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Muliiy\n\nLEMONADE \u2014 \u201cIs debate demotion an obstacle or opportunity for Christie?,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Charles Stile: \u201cChristie just might turn the debate into one of his town-hall events, the highlights of which are quickly cut-and-pasted by his media staff and instantly pumped to news outlets for the post-debate buzz. More people might hear about Christie\u2019s performance in the debate than those who might actually watch it, his supporters argue. \u201cI\u2019ll show up wherever I\u2019m told to show up on Tuesday night, and I will debate and I will make an impression because that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Christie said Friday in an interview with conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham. Yet, that confident, pre-debate spin cannot entirely conceal the damage of the demotion to the Christie aura. The onetime front-runner and the promising, pragmatic face of the GOP\u2019s future is now saddled with the stigma of a candidate who has edged closer to the exit door of the 2016 race.\u201d http://bit.ly/1kD9Y8J\n\n\u2014From the New York Times\u2019 Alexander Burns: \u201cThe demotion highlighted Mr. Christie\u2019s transformation from a dominant figure in the Republican Party \u2014 a favorite of national campaign donors and a master of projecting his personality through the New York-area television media \u2014 into a pugnacious underdog, jostling for attention with candidates who lack his political agility and raw charisma.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1kDanrK\n\n\u2014\u201cFox got it wrong in how it set main GOP debate that excludes Christie, pollsters say,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Claude Brodesser-Akner http://bit.ly/1NYw8wn\n\n\u2014From 538\u2019s Harry Enton: \u201cWhat if a mainstream Republican wins neither Iowa nor New Hampshire? I\u2019m not talking about a Donald Trump sweep. I\u2019m talking about two factional candidates within the party trading victories: A social conservative (Ben Carson, say) wins Iowa, and a moderate (Chris Christie) wins New Hampshire. That eventuality seems more likely than usual in 2016 because so many candidates are running, and the party establishment can\u2019t seem to \u2018decide\u2019 which candidate to back. To be clear, such a scenario isn\u2019t likely, but it\u2019s at least possible. And it could mean chaos...that disarray could lead to a nominee who is much more moderate than the median Republican voter \u2014 like Christie.\u201d http://53eig.ht/1XVx5Kw\n\n\u2014WaPo: \u201cAs GOP voting looms, long-shot candidates bet on a single state\u201d http://wapo.st/1NYb74T\n\nSHAMELESS SELF-PROMOTION: My wife Emily Helck and I are interviewed on the latest episode of \u201cThe Backgrounder\u201d podcast, hosted by Paul Brubaker. We didn\u2019t talk politics. We talked about what it was like to both have cancer in our 20s and to be together through both experiences. I was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in late 2008 and treated 2009, when we were dating (well, living in sin together). We married in 2010, and two years later she was was diagnosed with breast cancer. You can listen here: http://bit.ly/1NY8NLk\n\nGO AHEAD. GIVE HIM A HUG \u2014 \u201cDrug Czar Approves Of Gov. Chris Christie's Viral Message On Addiction,\u201d by The Huffington Post\u2019s Jason Cherkis: \u201cDrug czar Michael Botticelli told The Huffington Post in an interview that he watched the Christie video Friday morning. \u2018I thought it was quite moving and impassioned,\u2019 Botticelli said. \u2018I also thought that it was great that Governor Christie was articulating what are the prime principles of our national drug control policy.\u2019\u201d http://huff.to/1NY2V4C\n\nPENSION PROBLEMS \u2014 \u201cNow that election is over, focus on the pension, union says,\u201d by The AP\u2019s Michael Catalini: \u201cThe new and bigger Democratic majority in New Jersey, expanded with financial help from the state's largest teachers union, must pay more toward the public pension in 2016 than Gov. Chris Christie has this year, the labor group says \u2026 \u2018Follow the state's commitment to achieve full funding and to the honor the commitment made by every public employee who\u2019s been making their contribution in every paycheck,\u2019 said NJEA executive director Ed Richardson.\u201d http://sfg.ly/1NY373G\n\nHE\u2019S READY FOR HIS CLOSEUP. ARE YOU DUMB, MR. DEMILLE? \u2014 \u201cChristie\u2019s behind in the polls, but a TV attraction,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Salvador Rizzo: \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that television and ground-level politics can veer off in starkly different directions sometimes. Rarely in history has a presidential candidate gotten so much airtime with so few signs of voter support. And rarely has a candidate gotten 7 million views for a video posted online, as Christie did last week by speaking compassionately about addiction.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NYadFo\n\nGATEWAY \u2014 \u201cGovernors, senators hammering out a framework for new rail tunnel,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Dana Rubinstein and David Giambusso: \u201cIn August, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer called on the region to create a separate \u2018development corporation\u2019 to build a new rail tunnel connecting New Jersey commuters to their jobs in midtown Manhattan. Multiple sources have told POLITICO New York the two states, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and federal officials are now hammering out a framework for a new entity dedicated solely to building the project.\u201d http://politi.co/1NYYJ4A\n\n** A Message from Nuclear Matters: Providing more than 62% of America\u2019s carbon-free electricity, existing, state-of-the-art nuclear energy plants play a vital role in achieving our clean-energy and carbon-reduction goals.

Benning DeLaMater, a public information officer with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, said there's no scenario in which the agency would allow the Orphaned Wildlife Center in Otisville, N.Y. to take in the bear.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NYarws\n\nHOLY MAN \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019ll never believe who got Jim McGreevey to join Twitter,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s The Auditor: \u201cFormer Gov. Jim McGreevey recently created his own Twitter page \u2014 but he still doesn't have a profile picture, nor has he tweeted anything yet. Maybe that's because he joined only for one reason: the pope. McGreevey told The Auditor that he launched his account simply to read Pope Francis\u2019 feed. \u2018My sole purpose was to access the pope's sayings during the course of the day \u2014 to remind myself what\u2019s important.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1kD8E5W\n\nABOUT THE TIMELINE ON CHRISTIE\u2019S TURNING AGAINST ABORTION... \u2014 \u201cChris Christie On Ben Carson: Candidates Have To Back Up Personal Stories,\u201d by BuzzFeed\u2019s Christopher Massie: \u201cAsked by radio host Michael Medved about a Politico story that raised questions about Ben Carson\u2019s claim that he was offered a \u2018full scholarship\u2019 to West Point, Christie said, \u2018I\u2019ve been campaigning for the last two days, so I haven\u2019t followed it as closely as I might have otherwise. But what I will tell you is we\u2019re all responsible for our personal story, right? We put our personal story out there, we tell folks our history, that\u2019s part of our candidacy.

Livio: \u201cArguing it was \u2018wrongly excluded\u2019 from a line new of discounted insurance plans, Saint Peter\u2019s University Hospital Friday sued to stop Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey from selling the policies without giving the New Brunswick hospital a chance to participate. The hospital\u2019s attorney, Jeffrey Greenbaum, confirmed he filed an injunction in state Superior Court in Middlesex County asking a judge to prevent the state\u2019s largest insurance company from selling OMNIA Alliance policies that will offer consumers a 15 percent discount from their other products in 2016.

Noting that some cities had no crime increase this year, Jeffrey Fagan, a professor at Columbia Law School, said there was \u2018no evidence other than a few unconfirmed anecdotes that there is de-policing in U.S. cities, or that police actions have led to a rise in homicide in a handful of cities.\u2019 \u2026 While Christie has said the Ferguson effect is real, he has also said it isn't happening in New Jersey \u2026 Several New Jersey police departments also denied any impact.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NYXLVS\n\nIS THIS WHAT CHRISTIE MEANT BY \u2018TAKE THE BAT OUT\u2019?\u2014\u201cN.J. bats\u2019 future looks bleak,\u201d by The Record\u2019s James M.

Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie to veto the proposal, arguing it is dangerous and unnecessary. If either governor objects, federal regulations require the agency to deny Liberty's application. The timing for a final decision remains unclear. Christie vetoed a prior version of the proposal in 2011 and vowed at the time that his \u2018opposition to this will continue as long as I'm governor.\u2019 Cuomo said last month there were \u2018serious questions\u2019 lingering around the project.

While most opt for a reserved public image, he reveled in flamboyance. He debuted a television show, \u2018Vernon Vibes,\u2019 in 2012, on which he routinely skewered his critics.

But Rotella was no ordinary parent. She was the principal of an elementary school in her son's district. So she went to the school and had a teacher retest her son. This incident, dating back more than 20 years, is one of many that a four-year Department of Education investigation used to conclude in September that Rotella \u2018demonstrated conduct unbecoming a school administrator.\u2019 The report relies on testimony from numerous current and former teachers and principals to depict Rotella as an iron-fisted assistant superintendent whose feverish focus on exam scores helped foment the district's test-obsessed culture.\u201d http://mycj.co/1NYYFBQ\n\nQUICK HITS\n\n\u2014\u201cObamacare czar in Jersey City: High deductibles mirror trend in private insurance\u201d http://bit.ly/1NY7Dzf\n\n\u2014\u201cNJ delegation calls for federal agency to correct joint base pay disparity\u201d http://bit.ly/1NYXN09\n\n\u2014\u201d\u201cFine print: State wants to help private-sector workers save for retirement\u201d\n\n\u2014\u201c2K mourners remember Pastor Ronald Christian during rousing memorial service\u201d http://bit.ly/1NYaPLn\n\n\u2014\u201cFulop is guest of honor at Marine Corps Ball\u201d http://bit.ly/1NY3I5A\n\n\u2014\u201cWhy is enrollment falling at Rider and other N.J. private colleges?\u201d http://bit.ly/1NYaFUg\n\n\u2014\u201cFederal probe found Title IX problems at Mercer County Community College\u201d http://bit.ly/1NYaNmO\n\n\u2014\u201cLittle Egg Democrats get 'death card'\u201d http://on.app.com/1NY7wnf\n\n\u2014\u201cKelly: It\u2019s past time to overhaul the way we vote\u201d http://bit.ly/1NY47oG\n\n\u2014 \u201cN.J. fantasy sports bill would allow games, with a catch\u201d http://bit.ly/1kD9OhM\n\n\u2014 \u201cRally held to save Liberty State Park from commercial development\u201d http://bit.ly/1NY4csm\n\n\u2014\u201cCheng\u2019s win in A.C. challenged by Zappia\u201d http://bit.ly/1NYaAA3\n\n\u2014\u201cGroup files appeal to stop demolition of Duke Farms mansion\u201d http://bit.ly/1NYXous\n\n** A Message from Nuclear Matters: Some of America\u2019s existing nuclear energy plants face early closure due to current economic and policy conditions.
