An Abbott spokesperson emailed PolitiFact an updated list of lawsuits at the time, showing 27 had been filed since Obama's Jan. 2009 inauguration.\n\nAbbott's Obama remarks arrive one day after his campaign released a web ad attacking rival state Sen. Wendy Davis (D) as an unready flip-flopper. Texas' gubernatorial primaries will take place on Tuesday, March 4.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: How Many Fingers Is Rick Perry Holding Up?
