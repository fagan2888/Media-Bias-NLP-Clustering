In 2014, the year the marketplaces opened, nearly 7 in 10 consumers said they were satisfied with their premiums, and 59% said they were satisfied with their deductibles.\n\n\u201cThese are important signals to track to identify potential gaps in consumer understanding of how their plans work and the adequacy and transparency of coverage,\u201d conclude the authors of the survey by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\u201cThese trends also could affect the potential for marketplaces to attract new enrollees \u2014 particularly people who are currently healthy \u2014 and (to) retain existing consumers.\u201d\n\nThe law, commonly called Obamacare, allows Americans who don't get health benefits at work to shop among plans on state-based marketplaces operated by the federal government or by the states themselves.\n\nConsumers making less than four times the federal poverty level \u2014 about $47,000 for a single adult or $97,000 for a family of four \u2014 qualify for subsidies. And insurers must provide a basic set of benefits and cannot turn away consumers, even if they are sick.\n\nEnrollment in the marketplaces has been increasing, but at a slower rate than initially forecast; there are about 12 million people in a marketplace plan.\n\nAnd many insurers are seeking significant premium increases next year, in part because enrollees are sicker and more expensive than they anticipated.\n\nThe warnings are fueling a new round of attacks on the health law by critics who say the marketplaces aren\u2019t sustainable and should be repealed.\n\nThe new Kaiser survey suggests that some of the criticism is overblown.\n\nWhile Americans who get a health plan through an employer \u2014 the dominant form of health insurance in the U.S. \u2014 are happier with their coverage, consumers in the marketplaces remain generally satisfied.\n\nTwo-thirds of people with marketplace plans rated their coverage \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d in 2016.\n\nBy comparison, more than three-quarters of people with employer-based coverage said their coverage was \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, despite much media coverage of health plans that are narrowing their networks to exclude more hospitals and physicians, large majorities said they were satisfied with their choice of providers.\n\nBut the increasing prevalence of high-deductible plans that require consumers to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket for their medical care before coverage kicks in is fueling mounting consumer anxiety, as is the case with employer-provided coverage.\n\nJust a third of people in a high-deductible plan that they purchased themselves through a marketplace or directly said they have benefited from the health law.\n\nIn contrast, more than half of consumers in lower-deductible plans said they have benefited.\n\nThe Kaiser survey was conducted between Feb. 9 through March 26, among a nationally representative random sample of 786 adults ages 18-64 who purchase their own insurance, including 512 with marketplace plans.\n\nThe margin of sampling error is plus or minus 5 percentage points for those in marketplace plans, and higher for subgroups.\n\nALSO:\n\nAs Republicans look for an Obamacare replacement, two GOP lawmakers make their own bid\n\nCongress moves to fund Zika response, but experts say it's not enough\n\nZika's coming, and there's not enough money for another health emergency\n\nTwitter: @noamlevey", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Most Obamacare enrollees are satisfied with coverage, but worries over costs are rising", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Most Americans enrolled in health plans through the Affordable Care Act are happy with their coverage, despite persistent attacks on the health law by Republicans , including presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump.", "title": "Most Obamacare enrollees are satisfied with coverage, but worries over costs are rising", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fi-obamacare-survey-20160520-snap-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-573e9205/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-survey-20160520-snap", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Kaiser, premiums", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/87255023", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-05-19", "Description": "Most Americans enrolled in health plans through the Affordable Care Act are satisfied with their coverage, despite persistent attacks on the health law by Republicans, including presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.
