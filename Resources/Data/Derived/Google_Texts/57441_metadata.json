And yet, it happens \u2013 all the time, to the best of us.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people are going to be struggling with these issues,\u201d says Chuck Bell, programs director at Consumers Union in New York. Bell helped get a consumer protections bill passed in New York last March, which has certain protections for patients against out-of-network billing. \u201cPeople are busy. They don\u2019t have a lot of time to sort through bureaucracy. I have lawyers come to me and say, \u2018If I can\u2019t figure this out, how can someone else?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe bill, which goes into effect April 1 of next year, grew out of a case study that was inspired by a New York Department of Financial Services report, which stated that out-of-network bills are the department\u2019s top health insurance-related complaint.\n\nEmergency situations comprise some of the financial burden. \u201cIn an ER situation, you are in no position to shop around or drive across town to find a provider,\u201d Bell says. The report highlights one example of a patient with a severed finger who received a bill from a nonparticipating plastic surgeon, who reattached the patient\u2019s finger for $83,000. The patient\u2019s insurer noted that other area physicians charged $21,000 for the same procedure \u2013 so the patient was expected to cough up the remaining $62,000.\n\n[Read: Can You Afford Your Cancer Care?]\n\nBeware the Out-of-Network Anesthesiologist\n\nAnother frequent consumer complaint is out-of-network anesthesiologists. \u201cA lot of providers don\u2019t tell you when they are going to bring an out-of-network anesthesiologist into your care,\u201d Bell says, adding that by the time you realize that\u2019s what you\u2019re dealing with, it's too late.\n\nUnder the new legislation, he continues, the provider is supposed to give you significant warning about who your anesthesiologist will be so you can plan ahead. The new legislation also makes it mandatory to keep provider directories up to date since providers may roll in and out of networks within just 15 or 30 days, Bell adds.\n\nBut it\u2019s ultimately patients\u2019 responsibility to check whether a provider is covered before they actually go to the doctor, says patient advocate Trisha Torrey, who herself once got stuck with an out-of-network bill for a dermatologist to whom she had been referred by her own doctor.\n\n\u201cJust because a doctor recommended a specialist doesn\u2019t mean that insurance will cover it. Too many patients rely on the word of the doctor to think that something will be paid for,\u201d Torrey says. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you to verify that specialist is covered.\u201d\n\nAnd if the specialist is not covered, Torrey continues, \u201cThat\u2019s the time to go back to the original doctor,\u201d Torrey adds. \u201cIn this day and age, no patient should accept a referral unless they verify that the referred doctor is in the insurance plan.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act may complicate matters slightly, she adds, since it potentially \u201ctightens the number of doctors you can see. And the less you pay for premiums, the less likely you are to be able to pick carte blanche a doctor,\u201d she says, adding that Medicaid and Medicare patients especially might have a hard time finding a doctor.\n\nBell adds that he hopes providers are in sync with the ACA's open enrollment schedule, so that patients don\u2019t run into surprise bills. \u201cYour ability to transfer into the middle of a health plan in the middle of the year is not great,\u201d Bells says. \u201cSo a provider should agree to stay within a calendar year.\u201d\n\n[See: Infographic: How to Read Your Hospital Bill.]\n\nWhen It\u2019s Too Late\n\nBut let\u2019s say you\u2019ve already been to the specialist, or had surgery with an anesthesiologist who was not covered, or had some unfortunate visit to the ER \u2013 and you're stuck with a huge bill.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t suffer in silence. Complain,\u201d Bell says. \u201cWe encourage people to contact their state\u2019s department of insurance or their state attorney general.\u201d Bell adds that each state\u2019s network adequacy standards differ. For example, if you live in a small town and do have to see an out-of-network provider because no one else is available for miles, some states will charge you an in-network fee.\n\n\u201cIf the health plan doesn\u2019t have an adequate number of physicians, you would be able to see an out-of-network physician at an in-network rate,\u201d Bell continues.\n\nThe new New York legislation also creates a system of mandatory arbitration so that when disputes do occur \u2013 and you were charged $80,000 for a procedure for which your insurance company will only cover half \u2013 you have someplace to dispute the claim, Bell says, adding that he hopes the bill will be a model for the country.\n\nAnother resource patients can access is FAIR Health, where they can find out what they should have been charged for procedures \u2013 since lack of disclosure about what patients might get reimbursed for when dealing with out-of-network providers has been another recurrent problem.\n\nOn this website, you can look up a procedure benchmark for reimbursement based on your ZIP code.\n\n[Read: A Patient's Guide to Second Opinions.]\n\n", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"We all need a small amount of sodium to keep our bodies working properly \u2013 but too much is linked to heart disease.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "How to navigate the system and prevent it from happening again.", "zone": "patientadvice/articles", "author": "Kristine Crane", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "How to navigate the system and prevent it from happening again.", "title": "Socked With an Out-of-Network Medical Bill?", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2014/08/13/socked-with-an-out-of-network-medical-bill", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/66/19/c9bf9b064fafaa0653038bf99fbc/140813-hospitalbill-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "How to navigate the system and prevent it from happening again.", "card": "summary", "title": "Socked With an Out-of-Network Medical Bill? - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/1a6e448/2147483647/crop/329x329%2B93%2B0/resize/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F66%2F19%2Fc9bf9b064fafaa0653038bf99fbc%2Fresizes%2F500%2F140813-hospitalbill-stock.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],Affordable Care Act,patient advice,patients,medical quality,patient safety,doctors,patient-advice-include [Consumer Advice],healthandwellness [Consumer Advice],Kristine Crane", "published_at": "2014-08-13", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-08-13"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z2oqok", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "patients, doctors, referrals, ACA, in-network physician, out-of-network physician, ER, anesthesiologist"}, "article_summary": "Bell helped get a consumer protections bill passed in New York last March, which has certain protections for patients against out-of-network billing.\n\u201cIn an ER situation, you are in no position to shop around or drive across town to find a provider,\u201d Bell says.\nAs if the human price of illness wasn\u2019t enough, a seemingly unwarranted medical bill that follows may truly feel like rubbing salt in the wound.\nFor example, if you live in a small town and do have to see an out-of-network provider because no one else is available for miles, some states will charge you an in-network fee.\nBeware the Out-of-Network AnesthesiologistAnother frequent consumer complaint is out-of-network anesthesiologists."}
