One man is in the hospital after a drug deal gone wrong. It happened Saturday night in the 1900 block of W. Western Ave. Police say the 24-year-old was involved in a drug deal with three other people when they decided to rob him.

During the robbery there was a struggle over a gun. The 24-year-old was then shot in the thigh. Police say the 24-year-old then jumped out of the car and hobbled down the street.

That is when a stranger saw the man, picked him up and took him to the hospital.

The man had a broken femur and was taken into surgery. He is currently being watched in the hospital as he will be arrested after he recovers. He was wanted on a warrant.
