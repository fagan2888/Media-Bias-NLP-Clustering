Jim Wilson's commentary on March 8 about ColoradoCare \u2014 Amendment 69 \u2014 it is obvious that he is misinformed about the amendment. He makes statements that aren't strictly accurate:\n\n1.\"Amendment 69 is Single Payer Health Insurance\" - Not exactly.\n\n\u2022 ColoradoCare would replace private insurance, but Medicare, VA, and other federal government payment plans would stay in place. However, for most Coloradans the current bewildering and expensive array of private insurance plans would be replaced with one simple plan covering every Colorado resident.\n\n2.\"ColoradoCare would carry a price tag of approximately 1 \u00bd times the total budget of the state of Colorado\" \u2014 False.\n\n\u2022 ColoradoCare would cost $25 billion a year \u2014 coincidentally, that is approximately the same as the state budget. But that money has nothing to do with the state budget. The money would go directly to ColoradoCare. And, $25 billion is $4.5 billion less than Coloradans currently spend on private, for-profit, health insurance..\n\nHere are some facts about ColoradoCare:\n\n\u2022 It is simple and it covers everyone \u2014 if you are a Colorado resident, you are covered.\n\n\u2022 You will have high quality coverage like the Platinum Plus plan now available from private insurance companies.\n\n\u2022 You can choose any doctor \u2014 there are no narrow networks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 There are no co-pays for primary and preventative care and no deductibles.\n\n\u2022 It saves Coloradans money \u2014 about $4.5 billion a year over our current private insurance system.\n\n\u2022 Medicare coverage for seniors (including those in PERA) will not change \u2014 but ColoradoCare will pay for the supplemental insurance that seniors now pay for.\n\n\u2022 ColoradoCare will replace the private insurance plans that working PERA members now purchase.\n\nFind out more about ColoradoCare at coloradocare.org or attend an informational meeting at 3:30 p.m. March 18 at the Ca\u00f1on City library. Former State Sen. Jeanne Nicholson will talk about ColoradoCare and answer any questions you have.\n\nJim Wilson: please attend. We look forward to seeing you there.\n\nJoe Whelan,\n\nFlorence", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/opinion/ci_29626115/joe-whelan-setting-record-straight-amendment-69", "modificationDate": "2016-03-13T09:45:12-0600", "sailthru.section": "Opinion", "endDate": "2026-03-11T09:04:55-0600", "description": "In response to Rep.
