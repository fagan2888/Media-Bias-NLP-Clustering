Real Clear Politics has Clinton leading her main opponent for the nomination, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, by 12.8 points in Iowa, 49.8 to 37 percent in the state. (The third contender for the nomination, former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, is currently standing at an average of 6 percent in Iowa.)\n\nIn New Hampshire, however, Sanders has taken a slight lead over Clinton in the polls: Real Clear Politics averages Sanders at 49 percent to Clinton's 44.7 percent of Democratic voters.\n\nDemocratic Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton speaks during the second Democratic presidential primary debate at Drake University on Nov. 14, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa.

Given that the expected Dem turnout for Iowa is 100,000, we expect our operation in the state to have a large impact,\" said Ilyse Hogue, President of NARAL Pro-Choice America. \"The stakes are high in 2016. Between shrinking access to abortion, contraception under siege, no real family leave policies in this country, and a Supreme Court up for grabs, we will look back at this election as an inflection point. We want voters to know that when it comes to women's rights and women's opportunity, only a champion can forge the right path by being vocal about the kinds of policies we need to allow women to be in control of our destinies. Hillary is that vocal champion.\"\n\nNARAL reports that they have spent \"months knocking on doors and meeting with Iowans talking to them about the importance of reproductive freedom in their lives.\" The pro-choice organization also unveiled print and online ads throughout Iowa and New Hampshire today.\n\nWhile Sanders also has an excellent record on women's health and reproductive rights, NARAL notes that \"Hillary has a deep understanding of the fact that economic inequality for women cannot be solved without centralizing reproductive freedom, including access to abortion and contraception, strong laws preventing pregnancy discrimination, and parental leave.\"\n\nIn a statement, Clinton welcomed the endorsement today, saying, \"I am honored to earn the endorsement of NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC. As one of our country's leading advocates for reproductive rights, NARAL's work is more important than ever. Women's health and rights are under attack across America. In Texas, state leaders are taking their fight to cut women off from access to safe and legal abortion all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Colorado Springs, a violent extremist targeted a health center. Meanwhile, Congress has voted to restrict reproductive rights and cut women off from access to affordable health care. And one after another, Republicans running for President have pledged to cut funding for Planned Parenthood; restrict abortion access; and repeal the Affordable Care Act, which ensures that women will no longer be charged more just for being women.... I will stand with NARAL and women across the country in defending access to abortion, contraception, and sex education. I will stand with NARAL in advocating for policies that help women and families. The stakes could not be higher in this election, and I am grateful to the more than 1 million members of NARAL for their support.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "This morning, NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC announced their endorsement of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for President of the United States.
