Justices ruled in favor of the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage and provided hope for proponents of gerrymandering.\n\nThey also ruled in favor of Oklahoma\u2019s controversial lethal injection drug and against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), putting roadblocks on its ability to regulate health-damaging pollutants from power plants.\n\nOn The Daily Show, Jon Stewart shows clips of conservative pundits lamenting the \u201cObamacare\u201d and gay marriage rulings and chalking up the lethal injection and EPA rulings as victories for conservatives, which wholeheartedly confuses Stewart.\n\n\u201cSo yes, gay people have the right to marry, and poor people have the right to insurance\u2014but on the bright side, Americans can still kill prisoners painfully and everyone else slowly,\u201d Stewart summarized.\n\nFox News, in particular, celebrated the EPA defeat as a \u201cvictory for business.\u201d \u201cYou seem really giddy about that victory,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cYou know the losing team in that game was lungs. You know that, right?\u201d\n\nStewart turns to his senior correspondent Jason Klepper to bring some clarity to the discussion.\n\n\u201cAfter a week of redefining what marriage is and doling out health care, the Supreme Court has finally brought justice back to America. Remember America?, Klepper asks rhetorically. \u201cA place where big business always wins, where it\u2019s a little hard to breathe and where we get to decide how super painful to make your death. I mean that\u2019s the country I\u2019m proud to fly my confederate flag over,\u201d says Klepper.\n\nWatch the full segment which is broken up into two parts here:\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\n\nSupreme Court Restricts EPA\u2019s Ability to Regulate Toxic Emissions From Power Plants\n\nJune 2015 Smashes Heat and Rainfall Records in U.S.\n\nQ & A With Green Party Presidential Candidate Jill Stein", "article_metadata": {"description": "On The Daily Show, Jon Stewart blasts conservatives for celebrating the Supreme Court's rulings on lethal injection and EPA regulations as victories, despite", "og": {"site_name": "EcoWatch", "description": "On The Daily Show, Jon Stewart blasts conservatives for celebrating the Supreme Court's rulings on lethal injection and EPA regulations as victories, despite", "title": "Jon Stewart Slams Conservatives and Supreme Court for Letting Big Business Win Again", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://ecowatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/stewartFB.jpg", "url": "http://ecowatch.com/2015/07/01/jon-stewart-slams-supreme-court-epa/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On The Daily Show, Jon Stewart blasts conservatives for celebrating the Supreme Court's rulings on lethal injection and EPA regulations as victories, despite", "creator": "@ecowatch", "image": "http://ecowatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/stewartFB.jpg", "title": "Jon Stewart Slams Conservatives and Supreme Court for Letting Big Business Win Again", "site": "@ecowatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-07-01T13:47:04-04:00", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/EcoWatch", "section": "Energy", "tag": "featured", "published_time": "2015-07-01T13:47:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "featured, science, environment, eco, green"}, "article_summary": "The Supreme Court has been handing down some significant decisions in the last week.\nOn The Daily Show, Jon Stewart shows clips of conservative pundits lamenting the \u201cObamacare\u201d and gay marriage rulings and chalking up the lethal injection and EPA rulings as victories for conservatives, which wholeheartedly confuses Stewart.\n\u201cAfter a week of redefining what marriage is and doling out health care, the Supreme Court has finally brought justice back to America.\nFox News, in particular, celebrated the EPA defeat as a \u201cvictory for business.\u201d \u201cYou seem really giddy about that victory,\u201d says Stewart.\nJustices ruled in favor of the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage and provided hope for proponents of gerrymandering."}
