Hello? Is this thing on? \u2014 Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) January 1, 2014\n\nHe's tweeted a dozen or so times since.\n\nHe's already pronounced 2013 the best year in history because it brought less war, povery, and discrimination. He says 2014 is going to be even better because \"Sherlock is back!\"\n\nClearly, he is getting the hang of the Twitter-is-for-lolz thing.\n\nMarc Andreessen is most famous for founding Netscape.\n\nBut lately, he's become a highly regarded venture capitalist in Silicon Valley.\n\nIt helps that Andreessen surrounded himself with partners who are stars from the industry.\n\nMost of them \u2014 starting with cofounding partner Ben Horowitz \u2014 are former top CEOs who built startups and operated them as large companies. Others include Jeff Jordan, the former CEO of OpenTable and Scott Weiss, the former CEO of IronPort.\n\nNow they all run Andreessen Horowitz less like a VC firm, and more like a consultancy. Each partner works for every portfolio company. The firm is modeled after how Michael Ovitz ran CAA.\n\nTruthfully, this is Andreessen's first real foray into Twitter. He joined the service 2427 days ago, and then didn't do it again for another 4 years.\n\nThen he tweeted once two and a half years ago and stopped again.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Nicholas Carlson", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "\"Hello?
