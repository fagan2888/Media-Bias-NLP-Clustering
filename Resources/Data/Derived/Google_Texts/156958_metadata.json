Most recently, Congress enacted the Travel Promotion Act, which created what is now known as Brand USA.\n\nBrand USA is a public-private partnership that serves as the nation\u2019s first cooperative destination marketing organization. The organization is charged with growing America\u2019s share of the global travel market. Through a combination of voluntary private sector contributions and a nominal fee on foreign visitors, Brand USA\u2019s activities are aimed at influencing increased global visitation to and spending in the United States, without a cost to U.S. taxpayers. To increase and ensure the accountability and effectiveness of Brand USA, I have introduced H.R. 4450, the Travel Promotion, Enhancement, and Modernization Act of 2014.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA number of provisions in the legislation will shine a spotlight on Brand USA\u2019s activities, ensuring fair scrutiny of the program\u2019s actions by Congress and the American public. The bill requires Brand USA to establish specific performance metrics to measure the impact of Brand USA\u2019s marketing efforts and to demonstrate its cost and benefit to the U.S. economy. It clarifies that, despite being a public-private partnership, Brand USA is subject to the same requirements as federal agencies, such as its obligation to respond quickly to audits by the GAO - Congress\u2019 investigatory arm. The legislation also dramatically improves the threshold at which Brand USA must explain its expenditures, ensuring much more disclosure than previously required about how the entity is operating.\n\nTo improve Brand USA\u2019s corporate governance, my legislation strengthens the requirements for professional experience necessary to be appointed to Brand USA\u2019s Board of Directors. Because Brand USA conducts international promotional campaigns with a budget in the hundreds of millions of dollars, it operates similar to a multinational corporate entity. It is important that the Board of Directors be up to the task of such an entity\u2019s fiduciary responsibilities. If there is ever a future question about Brand USA\u2019s finances or decision making, the financial competence of the Board of Directors who oversee its operations will undoubtedly be scrutinized. That is why my legislation seeks to ensure the Board is properly qualified. Additionally, the bill statutorily requires Brand USA to establish a competitive procurement process and to affirmatively certify that any contracts it enters into are competitively bid.\n\nFinally, Brand USA has had the legal authority to compel the U.S. travel and tourism industry to pay annual fees to fund its activities. This legislation repeals that authority. Public-private partnerships should be cooperative, voluntary efforts. If Brand USA is not properly working with the private sector, the private sector should be able to terminate its activities and not be compelled to prop up a program that is not working.\n\nIn a time when the American public\u2019s top interest continues to be economic growth, Brand USA\u2019s mission is worthwhile and consistent with decades of sound policy. However, Congress should make every effort to push reforms that improve the operations, management, and disclosure of programs it enacts. That is what H.R. 4450 will accomplish, and that is why it is worthy of support.\n\nBilirakis has represented congressional districts in Florida's Tampa Bay area since 2007.
