(NASDAQ:AMGN) has succeeded yet again in its aggressive efforts aimed at preventing Sandoz, the generics drug unit of Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS), from launching a biosimilar version of its blockbuster cancer drug Neupogen in the US. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (which focuses on US patent law) in Washington ordered that sales launch of Neupogen biosimilar, dubbed \u201cZarxio,\u201d should be ceased \u201ceffective immediately\u201d as long as there is an ongoing legal dispute against it.\n\nNeupogen is designed to treat neutropenia in cancer patients. The drug brought in nearly $1.2 billion for Amgen last year, despite loss of US patent protection in 2013. Neupogen has the advantage of being a biologic, so that generic copies of the drug\u2019s organic substance cannot be made. Sandoz dared to challenge the drug\u2019s dominance in the US by filing an application for a biosimilar version, Zarxio, with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was surprisingly accepted in July 2014. Biosimilars are not exact copies of biologic drugs but aim to use the same active ingredients to produce an effect very similar to the original drug. Biologics, being complex, require a lot more expertise and time to be imitated. It was only in 2010 that review and potential approval of biosimilars in the US got regulatory authorization under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nBiosimilars are expected to be priced at significantly less than the original brand name drug, while being more expensive compared to generics. Neupogen biosimilars are already widespread in markets other than the US. Novartis itself sells Neupogen copy under the name Zarzio in as many as 40 countries worldwide since 2009. The drug constitutes one of the most prominent biosimilars in the world with an estimated 30% market share in Europe alone.\n\nIn January, Zarxio received positive appraisal from the FDA earlier than expected. This dealt a blow to Amgen, who was still reeling from a massive patent cliff for many of its blockbuster products and could not afford to have another one\u2019s sales cannibalized. Amgen immediately sued Sandoz on grounds of unfair competition and patent infringement, claiming that the company failed to meet disclosure prerequisites of Zarxio development under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act.\n\nWhile the court was still reviewing Amgen\u2019s case, the FDA announced the first-ever approval of a biosimilar in the US \u2014 for none other than Neupogen\u2019s knock-off Zarxio. Sandoz postponed the drug\u2019s launch until the court\u2019s ruling on Amgen\u2019s injunction. Ten days later, a San Francisco-based federal judge had given a decision in Sandoz\u2019s favor, only to be re-appealed by Amgen, this time both against the denial of its earlier petition as well as the court\u2019s ruling in Sandoz\u2019s favor. Despite the absence of any legal obligations to hold off Zarxio\u2019s launch, Sandoz agreed to wait until May 11 or when a decision is made on Amgen\u2019s second petition, whichever happens earlier.\n\n\"Sandoz has agreed to refrain from launching its Zarxio product until the earlier of May 11, 2015 or a decision by the Federal Circuit on Amgen's application for an injunction pending appeal,\u201d the court\u2019s filing confirmed.\n\nNovartis took on the position of the \u201cbigger person\u201d in the scenario with spokeswoman Julie Masow saying: \u201cWe acknowledge the court\u2019s decision and look forward to a prompt resolution of the appeal procedure. We continue to look forward to launching Zarxio as the first U.S. biosimilar in the near future.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Circuit will hold court on June 3 to decide if the trial judge was justified in making Sandoz halt Zarxio sales launch even after FDA approval.", "article_metadata": {"DESCRIPTION": "US Court of Appeals blocks Novartis AG (ADR)'s (NYSE:NVS) Sandoz from launching Neupogen biosimilar, Zarxio, until the court arrives at a decision on Amgen Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMGN) patent infringement and unfair competition lawsuit against Novartis.", "COPYRIGHT": "2016 Bidness Etc", "AUTHOR": "Hannah Ishmael", "og": {"url": "http://www.bidnessetc.com/42000-amgen-inc-succeeds-in-blocking-neupogen-biosimilar-us-launch-yet-again/", "image": "http://images.bidnessetc.com/img/amgen-inc-succeeds-in-blocking-neupogen-biosimilar-us-launch-yet-again.jpg", "type": "Business_news", "description": "US Court of Appeals blocks Novartis AG (ADR)'s (NYSE:NVS) Sandoz from launching Neupogen biosimilar, Zarxio, until the court arrives at a decision on Amgen Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMGN) patent infringement and unfair competition lawsuit against Novartis.", "title": "Amgen, Inc.
