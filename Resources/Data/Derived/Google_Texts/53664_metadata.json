The stage is now set for a major political showdown, reminiscent of the battle over Obamacare.\n\nGiven that the burden of implementing these regulations will fall upon the states, the role of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) is crafting a counterattack should surprise no one. Details of the pushback were finalized at the group\u2019s meeting in San Diego just two weeks ago.\n\nToday we\u2019ll look at how the opposition to the plan is shaping up, along with the strengths and weaknesses of what are being called a landmark set of regulations to combat climate change.\n\n\u201cNo challenge poses a greater threat to our future and future generations than a changing climate,\u201d declared President Obama. \u201cWe\u2019re the first generation to feel the effects of climate change, and the last generation that can do something about it.\u201d\n\nThe forces aligned with the dirty energy industry would appear to agree with the importance of the administration\u2019s plan\u2013it\u2019s just they feel more threatened by having to change the way they do business than by climate change.\n\nFrom the New York Times:\n\nIn the early months of 2014, a group of about 30 corporate lawyers, coal lobbyists and Republican political strategists began meeting regularly in the headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, often, according to some of the participants, in a conference room overlooking the White House. Their task was to start devising a legal strategy for dismantling the climate change regulations they feared were coming from President Obama.\n\nThe group \u2014 headed in part by Roger R. Martella Jr., a top environmental official in the George W. Bush administration, and Peter Glazer, a prominent Washington lobbyist \u2014 was getting an early start.\n\nBy the time Mr. Obama announced the regulations at the White House on Monday, the small group that had begun its work at the Chamber of Commerce had expanded into a vast network of lawyers and lobbyists ranging from state capitols to Capitol Hill, aided by Republican governors and congressional leaders. And their plan was to challenge Mr. Obama at every opportunity and take the fight against what, if enacted, would be one of his signature accomplishments to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Washington Post described the legislative strategy of industry opponents, noting it was a byproduct of the recent ALEC annual meeting in San Diego.\n\nIn anticipation of the rule\u2019s unveiling, a task force of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) \u2014 a conservative group funded in part by electricity producers and fossil-fuel \u00adinterests \u2014 approved model legislation to be sent to state legislatures around the country. The model bill would give state governments special authority to \u201cexpedite approval of resources to challenge the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan,\u201d according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post\u2026\n\n\u2026The effort by ALEC to fire up state-level resistance to the EPA\u2019s plan was approved July 24 at a meeting in San Diego of the group\u2019s Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force. Members representing some of the nation\u2019s biggest utilities, oil and gas companies and energy trade associations voted to support model legislation that brings states into the fight against the regulation.\n\nThe proposed legislation seeks to direct state attorneys general to join lawsuits against the EPA to prevent \u201cunlawful and costly obligations from being imposed on states,\u201d according to the copy obtained by The Post. It also calls for transferring money into a special fund set up by participating states to underwrite efforts to challenge unwanted environmental regulations. The money would come from state appropriations as well as \u201cany gifts, grants and donations\u201d from outside groups.\n\nConnor Lynch at Salon explained what\u2019s behind the partisan nature of the resistance to actually doing something about climate change:\n\nWhy has this scientific fact become such a partisan issue? It\u2019s not that complicated: Massive multi-national corporations and their billionaire chief executives \u2014 who are destroying our planet, and making astronomical profits in the process \u2014 are legally bribing our elected officials and spreading lies throughout the population. In 2012, the oil and gas industry spent $76 million on political contributions with 89 percent of it going to \u2014 surprise! \u2014 Republicans. This was almost double what they spent in 2008 \u2014 $39,658,963. And 2016 will be no different; we can expect the number to shoot up, maybe over $100 million, while the Republican share of that money, which was 95 percent in 2014, could edge even closer to 100 percent.\n\nIs it any surprise, then, that GOP candidates say things like, \u201cThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive\u201d; or compare themselves to Galileo in their denial of science.\n\nNot everybody in business is blinded by the quest for short term gain, as Adam Vaughn at the Guardian pointed out:\n\nHundreds of businesses including eBay, Nestle and General Mills have issued their support for Barack Obama\u2019s clean power plan, billed as the strongest action ever on climate change by a U.S. president\u2026\n\n\u2026The rules are expected to trigger a \u201ctsunami\u201d of legal opposition from states and utilities who oppose the plans, which will significantly boost wind and solar power generation and force a switch away from coal power. Republican presidential hopefuls moved quickly to voice their opposition, saying they would be economically damaging.\n\nBut 365 businesses and investors wrote to 29 state governors to strongly support the rules, which they said would benefit the economy and create jobs.\n\nThe Devil is in the Details\n\nSo what all the fuss about? If you remember back to the days of hyperbole over Obamacare, you\u2019ll recognize some of the rhetoric. Get ready for GOP claims of increased costs\u2013no doubt aimed at \u201cthose people\u201d the administration claims to care about,\u2013 along with predictions of job destruction and economic ruin.\n\nKeeping with Obamacare analogy, you\u2019ll also be exposed to partisans praising the President\u2019s plan as being much more than it actually is.\n\nBrad Plummer at Vox explains:\n\nSo how big a deal is this rule, anyway? You can look at it in a few different ways. Optimistically, the program has the potential to transform the US electricity industry, pushing utilities in every state to take cleaner energy much more seriously. The administration is also hoping this new rule will give a much-needed jolt to global climate talks, spurring other countries to respond with further actions.\n\nOr you could take the dour view: this is a jury-rigged, legally vulnerable plan that\u2019s still only a small piece of what\u2019s necessary to slow the pace of global warming. (By my calculations, this rule amounts to a 6 percent cut in current US greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 \u2014 so think of it as just one part of Obama\u2019s broader climate plan.)\n\nFor those of you interested in all the details, here\u2019s a link to the final version of the EPA Clean Power Plan.\n\nThe EPA Plan\u2019s Impact on California\n\nFor those of us living on the left coast, the administration\u2019s plan is a big nothingburger.\n\nFrom the Los Angeles Times:\n\nThe new rules won\u2019t have much direct effect on California because they are less stringent than the carbon-cutting targets already on the books. State regulators have for years targeted carbon emissions with strict standards on vehicle emissions, energy efficiency, low-carbon fuels and renewable power. Key to California\u2019s efforts is the cap-and-trade program to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, factories, transportation fuels and other major sources.\n\nAn analysis of the EPA\u2019s proposed carbon plan last year by the California Air Resources Board found the state could meet its federal emissions target as much as 10 years early, in 2020, just by fully executing existing climate change programs.\n\nThe City of San Diego Has a Plan\u2026\n\nClaire Tregeser at KPBS reviewed the recently released detailed look at San Diego\u2019s Climate Action Plan:\n\nThe plan legally commits San Diego to having 100 percent of its energy come from renewable sources such as wind and solar by 2035. It does not specify that goal will be achieved using community choice aggregation, a program that would allow San Diego to control where its energy comes from. Under the current system, San Diego Gas & Electric buys the energy.\n\nBut the plan includes community choice aggregation as one of the options for the City Council to consider\u2026.\n\n\u2026The plan outlines how the city will use a pedestrian master plan and bike master plan to achieve the goal of 50 percent of urban area residents commuting to work in other ways besides driving. It also says the city will consolidate growth in villages so people live closer to where they work.\n\nNicole Capretz, who penned an early version of the Climate Action Plan under then-iMayor Todd Gloria, now heads up the Climate Action Campaign, a non-profit oriented towards keeping the plan on track.\n\nThe concerns Capretz expresses in the KPBS story are very real, namely that it\u2019s hard to see actual leadership coming out of city hall on the nuts and bolts of the critical aspects of the plan, like encouraging density in strategic areas and investments in non-autocentric infrastructure.\n\nOne need look no further than the shortsightedness going on in Hillcrest over density and bike lanes to understand why a little guidance from the Mayor would be a good thing.\n\nThe Long View on Climate Change\n\nGetting back to the President\u2019s plan, it\u2019s a step in the right direction. It\u2019s a small victory for activists and public interest groups have worked for decades to alert the world to the perils of climate change.\n\nToday\u2019s final words come via Common Dreams:\n\n\u2026environmental and civil rights campaigner Van Jones expressed hope in an article for CNN that the plan will bring meaningful change to low-income communities of color: \u201cAfter all, one in six black kids and one in nine Latino children has asthma. Seventy-eight percent of African-Americans live within 30 miles of a dirty, polluting coal plant. African-Americans are also more likely to live in coastal areas and die during heat waves\u2026\u201d\n\n\u2026\u201dThis is the most significant action yet from the Obama administration, but it\u2019s still not enough to secure his climate legacy,\u201d said May Boeve, executive director for 350.org. \u201cCutting coal emissions is low hanging fruit, the next challenge will be standing up to Big Oil. We\u2019ll be pushing the administration to build on this announcement and take the additional steps necessary to protect our climate, like rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline, ending fracking, and preventing Arctic and offshore drilling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile historic, when measured against increasingly dire scientific warnings it is clear the rule is not enough to address our climate crisis,\u201d said Friends of the Earth president Erich Pica. \u201cThis rule is merely a down payment on the U.S\u2019s historic climate responsibility. It isn\u2019t enough for the U.S. to merely make reforms to our existing utility structure. We must boldly reshape our economy by democratizing energy to move beyond fossil fuels, including natural gas.\u201d\n\nOn This Day: 1735 \u2013 Freedom of the press in the colonies was established with an acquittal of John Peter Zenger. The writer of the New York Weekly Journal had been charged with seditious libel by the royal governor. The jury said that \u201cthe truth is not libelous.\u201d 1979 \u2013 The film \u201cRock & Roll High School\u201d starring the Ramones premiered in New York. 1987 \u2013 A new 22-cent postage stamp honoring noted author William Faulkner, went on sale in Oxford, MS.
