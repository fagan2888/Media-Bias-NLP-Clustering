Discussing health-care reform, innovation and America's energy future from Davos, Switzerland, with Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas. For the world to continue to grow, Saudi Arabia needs to be a major player, Perry says.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry believes President Barack Obama's signature health-care law will undergo substantial changes as individual states develop better alternatives, the former Republican presidential candidate told CNBC on Wednesday.

"So the idea that this Affordable Care Act—Obamacare, whatever you want to call it—is going to stick around is just not reality," Perry told CNBC during an interview on "Squawk on the Street." "The reality is that the states will be where the ideas bubble up from."

Perry's comments come as the governor traveled to Davos, Switzerland, for the annual World Economic Forum, an elite gathering of world business and political leaders at a Swiss resort. Perry told CNBC that he planned to speak during a panel on legalizing recreational drugs, where he may be the only dissenting voice.

"I may be one of the only people on that panel who does not think that's a good idea," Perry said.
