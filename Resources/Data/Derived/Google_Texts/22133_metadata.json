What\u2019s more, it appears that this trend has been driven without reference to economic growth.Healthcare experts point to several government surveys to back up this assertion. The Census Bureau\u2019s America Community Survey, for example, found that about 3 million more people gained employer coverage between 2010 and 2014, but the number of uninsured people dropped by more than 10 million during the same period.Another survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that while employer coverage was basically flat during that period, more than 12.6 million people enrolled in health insurance plans.\u201cThis kind of shift in insurance I don\u2019t think can be explained by the economy,\u201d Rand Corporation Economist Christine Eibner told the Boston Globe. \u201cThe increase [in coverage] is large enough that it can\u2019t be driven by just economic recovery.\u201dMuch of the growth does appear to be due to the expansion of Medicaid in several states, the Census Bureau survey notes.Regardless of which tenets of the law are responsible, however, economist Robert Kaestner of the University of Illinois Chicago says it is difficult to argue the ACA has failed to deliver on its promise.\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that the Affordable Care Act has done most of the work in decreasing the number of uninsured,\u201d Kaestner said.And with that kind of result, many now believe that the law\u2019s detractors may be out of options for repeal.While the ACA remains highly unpopular in the Republican party, political pundits argue that taking away healthcare coverage from millions of people could hurt the party electorally if the eventual GOP presidential nominee is seen as having an implausible replacement plan.\u201cRepealing the law without a plausible plan for replacing it would be a mistake,\u201d a policy paper from 10 leading Republican health experts said.That appears to be the case \u2013 at least currently \u2013 with current Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. An analysis published last week from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that Trump\u2019s outline of repealing and replacing the ACA would increase the number of uninsured by about 21 million while costing the government nearly $500 billion over 10 years.And that just isn\u2019t going to cut it, said economist Gail Wilensky.\u201cAny repeal has to have a way to increase coverage and not just by a few million,\u201d said Wilensky, who ran Medicare under former President George H.W. Bush. \u201c[The ACA] is obviously not the only way to do this \u2013 but it is important that it gets done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/obamacare-definitely-worked-experts-say-29674.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/iStock_obamacare1_000033980998_Small.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "Wednesday marks the sixth anniversary of the passage of the healthcare law, and growing evidence suggests it is responsible for a number of successes", "title": "Obamacare definitely worked, experts say"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wednesday marks the sixth anniversary of the passage of the healthcare law, and growing evidence suggests it is responsible for a number of successes", "title": "Obamacare definitely worked, experts say", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/obamacare-definitely-worked-experts-say-29674.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/iStock_obamacare1_000033980998_Small.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Wednesday marks the sixth anniversary of the passage of the healthcare law, and growing evidence suggests it is responsible for a number of successes", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "article_summary": "\u201c[The ACA] is obviously not the only way to do this \u2013 but it is important that it gets done.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, it appears that this trend has been driven without reference to economic growth.Healthcare experts point to several government surveys to back up this assertion.\nAn analysis published last week from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that Trump\u2019s outline of repealing and replacing the ACA would increase the number of uninsured by about 21 million while costing the government nearly $500 billion over 10 years.And that just isn\u2019t going to cut it, said economist Gail Wilensky.\u201cAny repeal has to have a way to increase coverage and not just by a few million,\u201d said Wilensky, who ran Medicare under former President George H.W.\nThe Census Bureau\u2019s America Community Survey, for example, found that about 3 million more people gained employer coverage between 2010 and 2014, but the number of uninsured people dropped by more than 10 million during the same period.Another survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that while employer coverage was basically flat during that period, more than 12.6 million people enrolled in health insurance plans.\u201cThis kind of shift in insurance I don\u2019t think can be explained by the economy,\u201d Rand Corporation Economist Christine Eibner told the Boston Globe.\nYou can quibble about the approach, the cost and some of the basic tenets of the law, but a growing number of experts say the nation\u2019s latest major healthcare policy is doing exactly what it was intended to do: increase insurance coverage in the United States.Wednesday marks the sixth anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and economists have market it by sharing evidence that suggests the dramatic gain in the number of Americans with coverage is due to the law \u2013 not the gradually recovering economy.The ACA was signed into law March 23, 2010 and in the six years since, the share of Americans without health insurance has dropped to a historic low of about 9%, with room to fall even further."}
