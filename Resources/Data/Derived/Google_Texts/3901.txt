New turf field installed at Wheaton's Graf Park

hello

Young soccer, football and lacrosse players in Wheaton now have a new field to play on.

Wheaton Park District played host to a ribbon-cutting ceremony Friday evening for the recently installed synthetic turf field at Graf Parat 1701 Manchester Road, behind Monroe Middle School.

Park officials say the original natural grass field required too much time and money to maintain.

In addition, whenever it rained the field would become off limits. Teams also were restricted from accessing the field when sod got replaced or other maintenance was being performed.

Now, teams are expected to have more time on the field. The young athletes who will play on the field are members of Wheaton Wings soccer, Wheaton Rams football and the Wheaton Park District's boys' lacrosse league.

Celebrations Friday included a performance by the Rams cheerleading squad, soccer and lacrosse scrimmages and the first game of the Wheaton Bowl.
