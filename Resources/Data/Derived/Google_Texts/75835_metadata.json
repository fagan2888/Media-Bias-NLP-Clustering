In 2012, he founded AlleyNYC, a shared space for entrepreneurs which is expanding from 16,000 to 55,000 square feet in its midtown location. Recently, the company also partnered with Entrepreneur Media.\n\nLast month, Saltzman agreed to participate in the U.S. State Department Speaker and Specialist Program, in which he will be working with technology entrepreneurs in Kuwait City. I met Saltzman in April and interviewed him by email last week.\n\nShould entrepreneurs work for other startups before launching their own businesses?\n\nI believe the answer to this is very subjective. Sometimes, great products come from people who have tons of experience in big business and see a pain point that needs to be solved. I have seen these people quit to start a new business without any startup experience, and it works out. In this case, having a deep understanding of the pain point and a practical way of solving it is all one needs to start a successful company.\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on the Economy]\n\nConversely, I think it\u2019s useful to learn how startups work from a hands-on perspective. Jumping in by taking a position within a startup has proven to be an amazing experience for many people.\n\nWhat are the best examples of rebounding from failure you\u2019ve seen?\n\nI believe the quicker that you accept failure as a lesson, the closer you are to success. I\u2019ve seen countless examples of this in my career. I love lean methodology; if you learn \u201clean,\u201d you learn to fail fast. I actually have a personal story about this.\n\nMy first tech startup was a huge failure. We raised a million dollars with an amazing idea, in a climate that seemed ripe for the product. We spent months building a perfect product, hiring developers and designers. We contracted a top-notch PR firm, and then we officially launched. It was like listening to crickets. We spent a million dollars, expended blood, sweat and tears, and invested months building something that nobody used. In the end, everyone on the founding team learned to iterate around what people wanted and embraced the value of creating a minimum viable product. My first tech startup may have seemed like a total failure, but the products that have been built by that original team now have combined valuations of over $50 million.\n\nWhat role will Entrepreneur Media have with AlleyNYC?\n\nEntrepreneur Media partnered with my company to create a distribution platform for all startups working out of AlleyNYC. This will allow us to share organic content, create awareness around what startups are creating, and gather authentic stories directly from the entrepreneurs. We\u2019re also curating media coverage for the plethora of events we host.\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons]\n\nThe most exciting initiative we are working on is infusing the startup world into big business. We are launching a \u201cbig business accelerator,\u201d where we host companies in a structured environment, providing funding and mentorship with a direct link to big organizations. Together, we will curate companies that will change big business through strategic partnerships. This summer, we hosted an event called Collide with the agency Rapp in order to bring attention to this initiative. You can check out the highlights of the event here.\n\nHow does AlleyNYC differentiate itself from other entrepreneurship co-working spaces?\n\nCoworking spaces are communities, and I believe that each is different. The culture of AlleyNYC is primarily what sets us apart. We often hear people say they are hit with a rush of excitement coming in the front door, and are motivated just by walking around. This is not by accident. COO and co-founder Nsi Obotetukudo and myself interview applicants every day. We make sure they are a good culture fit for AlleyNYC.\n\nWe also tirelessly work on creating value and pay strict attention to the experience of being a member. We are much more like an incubator than a co-working space in this regard, providing amenities and services that aid in the growth of member businesses. A sponsor, Rackspace, gives our members products, and Mintz Levin provides legal office hours. We host weekly yoga classes. And we have \u201cTreat Yo\u2019self Fridays,\u201d when we buy an amazing lunch for our members, as well as massages and manicures, weekly. We look at AlleyNYC membership as a lifestyle, not just a place to work.\n\nWhat lessons do you emphasize as a TechStars NYC mentor?\n\nI like to use a very Socratic approach when mentoring. I do not like to provide an answer, but rather suggest and ask questions about the issue that needs to be solved so they can learn not only how to solve it, but the thought process on how to overcome the obstacle as a whole.\n\nIssues that come up are just tests, and the better we become at solving these issues, the more likely we will be successful. Every business has surprises. I like the saying \u201clife is what happens when you are busy making plans.\u201d I have learned that no matter what crazy circumstances pop up in business, remaining cool, calm and collected is the way to go.\n\n[READ: 'Relationships Are the New Currency']\n\nWhich lessons will you bring from America to Kuwait City?\n\nI am bringing Sam Hysell, who has been doing lean methodology workshops for years. Together, we will be focusing on lean community management, as well as facilitating blogging and social media workshops. I am getting tons of emails from the Kuwaiti people asking for specific instruction, so that is why I chose these lessons. However, I plan to do much more. If you would like to follow me on my trip, follow #jasoninq8 via Twitter.\n\nWhat are the cultural challenges you anticipate in Kuwait City and how do you plan to overcome them?\n\n90 percent of working Kuwaiti citizens are employed in the government sector. Thousands of Kuwaiti students study for business and technology degrees in the U.S., but return to find current Kuwaiti business and economic regulations a barrier to the creation of new businesses. This is much different than what we are witnessing in the U.S.\n\nIt is predicted that 40 percent of the U.S. workforce will be self-employed by 2020, and it is estimated 28 percent to date. I do not believe that there is one solution to change this \u2013 however, I do believe that this speaker program powered by the U.S. State Department is a step in the right direction. I personally plan on doing everything in my power to influence young entrepreneurs to build products and/or services that they are passionate about. It\u2019s only a matter of time before we start to see a spike in the private sector in areas like Kuwait.\n\nWhat is your vision for the future of global collaboration?", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Economic Intelligence [Opinion]", "title": "Jason Saltzman Talks AlleyNYC and the Entrepreneur Community", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Entrepreneur Jason Saltzman explains how to help new ideas thrive.", "title": "More Than a Place to Work", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2014/09/09/jason-saltzman-talks-alleynyc-and-the-entrepreneur-community", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/35/abd93aa08ff6a60f268f0330c5f80d/48651WideModern_Entrepreneur_101813.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Jason Saltzman Talks AlleyNYC and the Entrepreneur Community", "description": "Entrepreneur Jason Saltzman explains how to help new ideas thrive.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Sept. 9, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lisa Chau,technology,entrepreneurship,Economic Intelligence [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Entrepreneur Jason Saltzman explains how to help new ideas thrive."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf6ba\"", "article_summary": "Entrepreneur Media partnered with my company to create a distribution platform for all startups working out of AlleyNYC.\nWe are launching a \u201cbig business accelerator,\u201d where we host companies in a structured environment, providing funding and mentorship with a direct link to big organizations.\nTogether, we will curate companies that will change big business through strategic partnerships.\nSometimes, great products come from people who have tons of experience in big business and see a pain point that needs to be solved.\n[SEE: Political Cartoons]The most exciting initiative we are working on is infusing the startup world into big business."}
