STEPHEN Ira Beatty, the eldest child of Warren Beatty and Annette Bening, is spearheading a change in the law that would allow transgender people to access public healthcare.

Stephen, who was born a girl and came out as transgender at the age of 14, appears in a new public service announcement urging New York State to change its Medicaid regulation.

The state currently excludes transgender people from Medicaid - basic healthcare available to those on low incomes in the US.

In the video Stephen explains: "I grew up outside of New York, but I've always known I've wanted to move here for the city's vibrant artistic community.

"As a trans person, I would hope that I'd be welcomed but many trans people aren't because we don't have the basic healthcare coverage we need to survive."

The video makes no mention of his famous parents, who are known for their activist work.

Stephen was born Kathlyn Elizabeth and has three younger siblings. His parents reportedly initially struggled with his decision to change sex.

He is a vocal supporter of the transgender community and writes a blog for the WeHappyTrans website where he describes himself as an "activist and a writer".
