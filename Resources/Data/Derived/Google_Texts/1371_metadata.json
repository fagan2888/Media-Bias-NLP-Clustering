She is the founder of The Abortion Survivor Network, an advocacy organization with a stated mission to advance awareness of and to support abortion survivors.\n\nShe is scheduled to testify at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing entitled \u201cLate-Term Abortion: Protecting Babies Born Alive and Capable of Feeling Pain.\u201d\n\nBills sponsored by Sens.
