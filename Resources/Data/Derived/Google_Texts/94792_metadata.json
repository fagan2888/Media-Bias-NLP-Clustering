The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Stephanie Armour got 20,000 pages of e-mail from the House Oversight Committee that MIT professor Jonathan Gruber exchanged with the White House on ObamaCare, making it clear that he played a far more integral role in its development than the Obama administration acknowledged after videos emerged of Gruber contradicting their position on King v Burwell. The e-mails cover 14 months and demonstrate intense involvement from the beginning of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency to the passage of the Affordable Care Act:\n\nJonathan Gruber, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist whose comments about the health-care law touched off a political furor, worked more closely than previously known with the White House and top federal officials to shape the law, previously unreleased emails show. The emails, provided by the House Oversight Committee to The Wall Street Journal, cover messages Mr. Gruber sent from January 2009 through March 2010. Committee staffers said they worked with MIT to obtain the 20,000 pages of emails. \u2026 The emails show frequent consultations between Mr. Gruber and top Obama administration staffers and advisers in the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services on the Affordable Care Act. They show he informed HHS about interviews with reporters and discussions with lawmakers, and he consulted with HHS about how to publicly describe his role.\n\nPolitically, at least, it makes it a little more difficult to distance Obama and his team from repeated remarks like this from Gruber:\n\nMore than one video has emerged of Gruber making similar comments.\n\nAlso, remarks in the e-mails themselves from White House staffers calling Gruber \u201cour hero\u201d make Obama\u2019s description of Gruber\u2019s relationship to the team look particularly dishonest. Shortly after a series of videos emerged showing Gruber\u2019s contempt for Americans, Obama told reporters that Gruber was just \u201csome adviser who never worked on our staff.\u201d The MIT e-mails show that Gruber got invited to consult Obama directly, making the President look like a liar on what would normally be a petty issue, had Gruber not repeatedly shot off his mouth in public about the strategies employed to deceive American voters.\n\nThe Gruber videos caught the attention of the public for two reasons. One, it showed the dishonesty of the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress over how this program was both sold and written. Two, Gruber\u2019s arguments directly contradict what the Obama administration has represented in its arguments to the Supreme Court in King v Burwell. Politically, these e-mails are a disaster. Legally, they won\u2019t mean anything at all. The court decided King weeks ago, if not months, and we\u2019re only waiting for the decision and opinions to emerge.\n\nFinally, why did Oversight have to go to MIT to get these e-mails? This should have been provided to Oversight from the White House. The sheer volume alone of these communications show that Gruber\u2019s role was critical in the process of ObamaCare. To compare, recall that Hillary Clinton turned over what she said were the complete set of work-related e-mails from four years at the State Department \u2014 and that came up to 50,000 pages of communications. And no one believes that it comprises the complete set of e-mails, either, especially after Sidney Blumenthal\u2019s subpoena found dozens that no one knew existed.\n\nThis pattern of hiding e-mails and some advisers wasn\u2019t limited to the State Department, in other words. Looks like this may have been the Obama administration mantra:\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Did Obama lie about Gruber being just \u201csome adviser\u201d?", "title": "WSJ: Gruber worked far more closely with White House than previously acknowledged", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/06/22/wsj-gruber-worked-far-more-closely-with-white-house-than-previously-acknowledged/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/G790p0LcgbI/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/G790p0LcgbI/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-22T12:41:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T12:19:03+00:00"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, emails, Jonathan Gruber, lies, ObamaCare,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "WSJ: Gruber worked far more closely with White House than previously acknowledgedposted at 8:41 am on June 22, 2015 by Ed MorrisseyGruber\u2019s baaaaaa-aaaaack, and badder than ever.\nOne, it showed the dishonesty of the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress over how this program was both sold and written.\nThe emails, provided by the House Oversight Committee to The Wall Street Journal, cover messages Mr. Gruber sent from January 2009 through March 2010.\nLooks like this may have been the Obama administration mantra:Related Posts:\nThis should have been provided to Oversight from the White House."}
