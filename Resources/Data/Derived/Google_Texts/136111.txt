The first glimpse of projected costs for health insurance plans to be offered under the Affordable Care Act shows that uninsured Floridians seeking coverage in the exchange will pay about 16 percent less than expected for the least expensive plans.

An average individual cost of $328 per month, for the second-cheapest mid-level plan, puts Florida on a par with the national average. Individuals will pay more or less according to their age. And this is the price before federal subsidies, which will discount costs for Americans making up to 400 percent of the poverty level — $46,000 a year for individuals, or $94,200 for a family of four.

There is still no word on which companies will be competing for customers in Southwest Florida. This information — along with the all-important coverage details for every plan — is expected to be revealed on Tuesday, the first day of a six-month open enrollment period.

FAQ on Affordable Care Act

The Obama administration released partial data for 36 states participating in the Federal Marketplace. The numbers countered widespread predictions recently that the selection of plans would be narrow and prices would be unaffordable. But this is a sample of low-end prices only; plans with many bells and whistles will cost more.

Higher locally

In Southwest Florida, individual coverage costs are all higher than the state average, and the gap tends to widen with age.

But for a majority of this region’s uninsured, tax credits will reduce premiums substantially — by 50 percent or more of the sticker price, depending on income.

The variation in premiums from one region to another reflects both local health care costs and the level of insurance company competition in a given area, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid press office.

A total of 95 different plans are available in Sarasota County, 69 in Manatee and 90 in Charlotte — below the statewide average of 102, but well above the national average of 53. Most of these plans are in the bronze, silver and gold categories. Only two or three choices exist in the low-cost “catastrophic” category, with very high deductibles.

But there appears to be a fairly wide selection of the priciest platinum plans, which cover 90 percent of a person’s medical expenses: 14 in Sarasota, 9 in Manatee and 15 in Charlotte.

The lowest cost for a bronze plan, which covers 60 percent of medical expenses, averages $128.12 per month in Florida for a 27-year-old. In Sarasota County that cost is $191.26; in Manatee, $197.89; and in Charlotte, $175.29.

For a 55-year-old, the lowest-cost state average is $272.62 a month. In Sarasota County, the lowest cost for a bronze plan is $406; in Manatee, $421.09; and in Charlotte, $372.99.

The two lowest costs for a silver plan, which covers 70 percent of expenses, average $167 and $190.89 a month in Florida for a 27-year-old. In Sarasota County those costs are $213.96 and $216.42; in Manatee, $220.45 and $227.29; and in Charlotte, $198.78 and $212.24.

For a 55-year-old, the two lowest-cost silver plans average $335.35 and $406.19 a month. In Sarasota County, they are $453.36 and $460.52; in Manatee, $469.08 and $483.64; and in Charlotte, $422.99 and $451.62.

The lowest cost for a gold plan, which covers 80 percent of medical expenses, averages $188.54 a month in Florida for a 27-year-old. In Sarasota County that cost is $244.93; in Manatee, $253.42; and in Charlotte, $229.25.

For a 55-year-old, the lowest-cost state average for gold is $401.18 a month. In Sarasota County, the lowest cost for a gold plan is $521.17; in Manatee, $539.24; and in Charlotte, $487.81.

Different region, different prices

Those rates are higher than in South Florida, which has a much higher concentration of uninsured residents, inviting more competition.

But they should remain a pleasant surprise for Southwest Floridians who have shopped around, because individual plans have historically been costly here.

“Unfortunately, because of the way that the state Office of Insurance Regulation chooses to define geographical rating areas, each of Florida’s 67 counties is its own rating area,” said Greg Mellow, policy director for Florida CHAIN, a nonprofit patient advocacy group in Tallahassee. “So there will be variation from county to county, sometimes significant. However, that variation should at least roughly mirror the variation we see across the state in the current individual and small group markets.”

Administration officials released the information, central to their campaign to persuade millions of uninsured Americans to sign up for coverage, even as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, waged a fierce fight on the Senate floor, risking a government shutdown if necessary to eliminate financing for the expansion of coverage under President Barack Obama’s health care law.

“I can tell you right now that in many states across the country, if you’re, say, a 27-year-old young woman, don’t have health insurance, you get on that exchange, you’re going to be able to purchase high-quality health insurance for less than the cost of your cellphone bill,” Obama said Tuesday, speaking at a health care forum in New York City with former President Bill Clinton.

For a family of four with an annual income of $50,000, the administration said, monthly premiums for the second-cheapest silver plan will vary widely, averaging $600 in Arizona, $800 in Georgia, $961 in Indiana, $1,069 in Mississippi, $859 in New Hampshire, $943 in New Jersey and $656 in Utah.

For Florida, the figure is $789.

However, the data provided only a partial picture of the reality that consumers will face. The figures, almost by definition, provide a favorable view of costs, highlighting the least expensive coverage in each state.

Consumer advocates said that people shopping for health insurance should consider not only price but also other factors like the list of covered drugs and the doctors and hospitals available in a health plan.

Under the 2010 health law, most people buying insurance in the exchanges will be eligible for federal subsidies in the form of tax credits. Taking account of these subsidies, the administration said, a family of four with income of $50,000 will generally be able to buy a silver-level plan for $282 per month, while a 27-year-old with income of $25,000 will be able to get such coverage for $145 per month.

Gary M. Cohen, the director of the federal Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, said that premiums were generally lower in states with vigorous competition in their insurance markets and robust programs to review rates.

For those who enroll in a plan by mid-December, coverage will begin Jan. 1. New policies are not directly comparable to those now covering individuals and families who buy insurance on their own.

In many states, including Florida, insurers now can turn down people with illnesses and disabilities or charge them higher premiums, based on their medical history or pre-existing conditions.

That will generally not be allowed next year.
