That\u2019s one of the key findings of a survey showing the gap between CEO and average worker pay in America is more than 10 times larger than the typical American perceives.\n\nIn the report, Harvard University and Chulalongkorn University researchers analyzed survey data from 40 countries about perceptions of pay gaps between rich and poor. In every country, respondents underestimated the size of the gap between CEO and average worker pay. In the United States, for example, the researchers found the median American respondent estimated that the ratio of CEO to worker income is about 30-to-1. In reality, the gap is more than 350-to-1.\n\nThe study also found the median American respondent said the ideal pay gap is about 7-to-1 \u2014 a lower ideal than respondents in many industrialized countries. Additionally, no major industrialized country has anywhere close to a 7-to-1 pay gap. That ratio is more than seven times lower than the actual gap in social democratic countries like Denmark and Sweden.\n\nIn an interview with the Harvard Business Review, one of the researchers who conducted the study said Americans\u2019 inaccurate beliefs about the pay gap may be the reason economic inequality hasn\u2019t become more of a political issue.\n\n\u201cThe lack of awareness of the gap in CEO-to-unskilled-worker pay \u2014 which in the U.S. people estimate to be 30-to-1 but is in fact 350-to-1 \u2014 likely reduces citizens\u2019 desire to take action to decrease that gap,\u201d Harvard\u2019s Michael Norton said.\n\nEarly in the 2014 election cycle, Democrats seemed poised to make economic inequality a central focus of their campaigns, following the high-profile election victories of economic populists like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study suggests Americans vastly underestimate the current gap between the country's rich and poor", "title": "Why voters don\u2019t care more about income inequality", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A new study suggests Americans vastly underestimate the current gap between the country's rich and poor", "title": "Why voters don\u2019t care more about income inequality", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/05/why_voters_dont_care_more_about_income_inequality_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/10/mitt_apology_square-e1351518173199.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study suggests Americans vastly underestimate the current gap between the country's rich and poor", "title": "Why voters don\u2019t care more about income inequality", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/10/mitt_apology_square-e1351518173199.jpeg", "creator": "@@davidsirota", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Sirota", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bill de Blasio, Denmark, Elizabeth Warren, Ferguson, Harvard, Harvard Business Review, Harvard University, Income inequality, Sweden", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Bill de Blasio, Denmark, Elizabeth Warren, Ferguson, Harvard, Harvard Business Review, Harvard University, Income inequality, Sweden, Business News, Politics NewsIf critics of income inequality are wondering why the growing gap between rich and poor hasn\u2019t been a more potent political issue in the upcoming elections, a new study offers some answers: Americans grossly underestimate this inequality.\nIn the report, Harvard University and Chulalongkorn University researchers analyzed survey data from 40 countries about perceptions of pay gaps between rich and poor.\nAdditionally, no major industrialized country has anywhere close to a 7-to-1 pay gap.\nIn the United States, for example, the researchers found the median American respondent estimated that the ratio of CEO to worker income is about 30-to-1.\nIn every country, respondents underestimated the size of the gap between CEO and average worker pay."}
