President Barack Obama hasn’t had a cigarette in 5 years.

In a new interview in GQ, Mr. Obama says that he hasn’t smoked since the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act, his signature health-care law.

“I made a promise that once health care passed, I would never have a cigarette again. And I have not,” he told the magazine.

In June, Mr. Obama was photographed holding an item in his hand that resembled a cigarette pack during a foreign trip to Germany— leading to theories that he was still smoking occasionally. But the White House strongly denied those reports, saying that the president had quit smoking.

Mr. Obama said in a 2009 press conference he had lapsed into having a cigarette occasionally but wasn’t a daily smoker. His doctor has said he has quit entirely.

Interviewed by sports columnist and podcaster Bill Simmons, Mr. Obama also discussed UFO conspiracies, the worst moment of his presidency and the rise of Donald Trump.

On UFOs: “it’s a little disappointing. People always ask me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff going on that’s top secret isn’t nearly as exciting as you expect. In this day and age, it’s not as top secret as you’d think.”

On Mr. Trump: “I would’ve enjoyed campaigning against Trump. That would’ve been fun.”

On the worst day in his presidency: “Sandy Hook … Which remains, by the way, the worst few days of my presidency. I went up and visited with those families and—you know, Bill, you’ve still got small kids. These are 6-year-olds, right? And you have 20 of them who’ve been massacred.”
