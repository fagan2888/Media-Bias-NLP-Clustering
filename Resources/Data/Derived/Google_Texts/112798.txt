Undocumented students looking for a path to higher education often turn to private universities that have more freedom to offer special scholarships and programming that make tuition more affordable.

For undocumented Nashvillians, Lipscomb University can be a lifeline.

The university began admitting undocumented students in 2008. Over time, it broadened its efforts, working alongside YMCA Latino Achievers and other community groups to recruit students.

"We welcome everybody here," said Lisa Steele, assistant dean of intercultural development. "Nowhere in the Bible does it say love your documented neighbor only. It says love your neighbor."

Officials also encourage students to do community service that benefits other undocumented Nashvillians. Lipscomb students do volunteer translating at Colt Elementary School.

Because undocumented students are not eligible for federal aid or loans, Lipscomb offers special Latino Achievers scholarships that offset the full cost of tuition.

Lipscomb President L. Randolph Lowry said the university's efforts are a reflection of its Christian mission.

"We think it's part of our mission as an institution to reach out to those in need who can benefit from an education," Lowry said. "We look back in time and look at Jesus and how he reached out to people in the community. That's what we think we might be doing with these students."
