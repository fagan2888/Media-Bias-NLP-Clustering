The study was conducted by Field Nation, a cloud-based company that connects employers with contractors, and Future Workplace, an executive development firm.\n\nThe ACA requires employers of 50 or more full-time people to provide health benefits.\n\nAfter surveying 600 human resource employees and 959 freelancers, the results show a whopping 68 percent of employers said the ACA will have a \u201chigh impact\u201d on their hiring decision with 74 percent saying they plan to increase freelance contracts.\n\nThe uptick was largely attributed to the mandate\u2019s tax penalty, which increased to its largest number in 2016 at $695 per employee. According to the study, on average, freelancers work less than 40 hours a week, are willing to work for less money and have contacts that generally last between one and five months.\n\n\u201cThe trend of companies hiring more freelancers will continue annually, causing for an even more blended workforce, and creating new challenges for business leaders,\u201d Dan Schawbel, a Partner & Research Director at Future Workplace, said in a statement provided to The Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cThe workforce is willing to make sacrifices, including compensation and benefits, in order to gain the freedom and flexibility afforded to the freelance career path.\u201d\n\nDespite health-care plans being a major factor in helping draw skilled workers, a large number of companies said they are open to changing their business model in order to avoid the crippling costs.\n\nDo You Think Obamacare Is Hurting The Economy?
