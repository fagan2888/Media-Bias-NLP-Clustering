The largest source of complaints every month at the bureau involves debt collectors.\n\nAlso, 35 percent of adults have a debt in collections, a recent Urban Institute study found. It estimates that 77 million Americans owed an average of $5,200 in overdue debts.\n\nThat means a lot of people are dodging calls from debt collectors, some of whom use overly aggressive \u2014 and illegal \u2014 tactics.\n\n\u201cMost debt collectors play by the rules, but it\u2019s those who don\u2019t that tar the industry,\u201d said Gail Cunningham, spokeswoman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.\n\nDebt in collections involves failing to pay a nonmortgage bill, such as a credit card balance, child support, a medical or utility bill, parking ticket or membership fee. The debt is so far past due that the account has been closed and placed in collections, often with a debt-collection agency.\n\nIf you\u2019re being hounded by a debt collector, here are some things to know.\n\nDebt-collection rules\n\nGet familiar with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. It lays down the rules for how a debt collector must treat a consumer. \u201cIt is up to consumers to become familiar with the provisions within the act so that they can know when a collector has crossed the line,\u201d Cunningham said.\n\nFor example, a collector cannot harass you by threatening you, cursing, lying or calling before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. unless you agree to it. And collectors may not contact you at work if you tell them you\u2019re not allowed to get calls there. They can\u2019t say you\u2019ll be arrested if you don\u2019t pay. Other than to get location information about you, a debt collector generally is not allowed to discuss your debt with anyone other than you, your spouse or your attorney.\n\nThe problem with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is it\u2019s old, dating to 1977. The protection bureau has said it is considering updating collection rules for the age of new communication technology. It is likely to address email, cellphones, social media and robo-suing, in which collectors can use technology to sue debtors quickly and easily, said Bill Bartmann, who operates CFS2, a Tulsa-based debt-collection agency.\n\nStatute of limitations\n\nThis term means time ran out for the creditor to collect the money from you, and it probably can\u2019t sue you in court.\n\nStill, it\u2019s tricky for consumers because the time varies by state and type of debt, the FTC said.\n\nFor example, the statute of limitations for credit card debt in a few states may be as long as 10 years, but most states impose a period of three to six years. It\u2019s four years in Texas.\n\nShould you pay \u201ctime-barred\u201d debts? Though ethically you might feel you still owe an old debt, legally you do not. Even so, collectors can continue to contact you about debts after they are legally time-barred unless you send a letter to the collector demanding that communication stop, according to the FTC.\n\nIn some states, if you pay any amount on a time-barred debt or even promise to pay, the debt is revived, resetting the clock on a new statute of limitations period.\n\nThat means the collector can sue you to collect the full amount of the debt.\n\nCredit effect\n\nThe time that collections stay on your report, affecting your ability to get the best loan rates or get a loan at all, is seven years.\n\nIt\u2019s better to contact a creditor before it contacts you, Bartmann said. That way, you might avoid being reported to the credit bureau or being turned over to a collector. You might even be able to lower the interest rate on your account. And it helps to send some money, even if it\u2019s not the minimum amount required on your statement, he said.\n\n\u201cIt demonstrates that you\u2019re not running. \u2026 It causes creditors to be more sympathetic and be more willing to work with you.\u201d\n\nWhen the calls start\n\nWhen you get a call, tell the collector that you are recording the call and that by staying on the line he or she agrees to the recording.\n\n\u201cI would tell them that, even if you weren\u2019t recording the phone call,\u201d Bartmann said. It\u2019s likely to put the caller on his best behavior.\n\nFor the same reason, also insist on getting the name of the agent and collection company, along with a return telephone number.\n\nGet it in writing. Insist on written verification of the debt before you have a conversation. That not only verifies the debt, but it gives you time to figure out a strategy for dealing with the collector when he or she calls back.\n\nDuring the conversation, briefly explain the circumstances that brought about your delinquent debt \u2014 divorce, job loss, health issues. Rather than offering a payment plan, ask the collector what your options are.\n\nTerms might be more favorable than what you might have offered, Bartmann said.\n\nDealing with abuse\n\nIf you get an abusive collector, tell him or her to calm down or you will hang up, Bartmann said. If they don\u2019t remain civil, hang up and call back to get a supervisor and lodge a complaint. Then complain to your state attorney general\u2019s office, naag.org and the consumer protection bureau.\n\nIf it gets so bad you need an attorney, you can contact the National Association of Consumer Advocates, and it can connect you with a lawyer.\n\nIf you don\u2019t owe\n\nPeople who don\u2019t owe debts are often also harassed too, a protection bureau analysis found. The bureau offers sample letters that consumers can use to deal with debt collectors, one of which tells collectors to stop contacting you unless they can show evidence that you are responsible for the debt.\n\n\u201cPeople should pay their bills,\u201d Bartmann said, \u201cbut collectors should be civil in the process.\u201d\n\nGregory Karp,\n\nChicago Tribune\n\nWhere to get help\n\nLearn more about the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act: tinyurl.com/ftc-fdcpa\n\nLearn more about time-barred debts: tinyurl.com/olddebts\n\nFind sample letters that can be used to deal with debt collectors: consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb (type \u201cdebt collector\u201d in the search box)\n\nContact the National Association of Consumer Advocates to connect with a lawyer: naca.net", "article_metadata": {"description": "These tips can help you handle abusive debt collectors.", "og": {"description": "These tips can help you handle abusive debt collectors.", "title": "Tormented by debt collectors?
