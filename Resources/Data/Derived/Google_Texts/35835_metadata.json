The adoption and adherence to Florida\u2019s plan has helped to tremendously and measurably improve the state\u2019s air quality.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s final rule illegally requiring the states to change their previously approved plans, came after the agency agreed to settle a lawsuit. The EPA\u2019s imprudent rush to settle the matter has led the agency to adopt an illegal final rule that is in conflict with the Clean Air Act and imposes on Florida\u2019s right to determine the most effective strategy for achieving air quality standards, Bondi said.\n\nToday, Bondi filed the petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit asking the Court to review the EPA\u2019s final rule. Besides the clear violation of state\u2019s rights enumerated in the Clean Air Act, the final rule also stands to stall or reverse progress the plaintiffs have made in improving the quality of the air in their state.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Protecting Your Pocket", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://protectingyourpocket.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2015/08/11/bondi-16-other-ags-sue-epa-over-rejection-of-air-qualilty-plans/", "image": "https://cmgpbpprotectingyourpocket.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/big_bend_power_station.jpg?w=300", "type": "article", "description": "Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi is leading 16 other attorneys general in a legal action against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for illegally invalidating the individual air quality protection plans in those states.\r\n\r\nIn June, the EPA issued a final rule requiring 35 states, including...", "title": "Florida AG, 16 others sue EPA over rejection of air quality plans | Protecting Your Pocket"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://protectingyourpocket.blog.palmbeachpost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0eb717cde8a67beef4209846aa3f6a28?s=16", "keywords": "clean air act, epa, florida attorney general, uncategorized, air quality plans, bnblogs, mobile breaking business, news, newsfeed", "viewport": "width=1024", "description": "Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi is leading 16 other attorneys general in a legal action against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for illegally invalidating the individual air quality protection plans in those states."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc099\"", "article_summary": "The adoption and adherence to Florida\u2019s plan has helped to tremendously and measurably improve the state\u2019s air quality.\nFlorida Attorney General Pam Bondi is leading 16 other attorneys general in a legal action against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for illegally invalidating the individual air quality protection plans in those states.\nIn June, the EPA issued a final rule requiring 35 states, including Florida, to revise their individual State Implementation Plans governing carbon emissions during power plant Startup, Shutdown or Malfunction.\nThe EPA\u2019s final rule illegally requiring the states to change their previously approved plans, came after the agency agreed to settle a lawsuit.\nThe Clean Air Act establishes a cooperative-federalism approach to regulating the nation\u2019s air quality and dictates that EPA has the primary responsibility to identify air pollutants that pose a threat to public health and to set national air quality standards; however, the Act gives states the primary responsibility to determine how to achieve those standards."}
