After being struck, the truck went to the left, partially into the dirt shoulder. The driver of the truck over-corrected to the left causing the truck to roll towards the right, coming to a rest upright in the right shoulder.\n\nThe Pontiac went left through the center median and came to rest next to the left eastbound lane, facing westbound.\n\nThe right front passenger of the Toyota, 20-year-old Rene Teasley, was transported to University of Arizona Medical Center where he was pronounced deceased.\n\nA second passenger that was in the bed covered by a camper shell, a 13-year-old male, was ejected and was admitted to UAMC.\n\nThe driver, 48-year-old Michael Spicker of Vail, was also transported to UAMC and admitted.\n\nThe driver of the Pontiac was identified as 32-year-old David Molina of Tucson. He was not injured, and was arrested and booked into the Pima County jail for one count of manslaughter and one count of aggravated assault.\n\nThe westbound lanes were closed for about seven hours Sunday. It reopened just before 3 p.m. The investigation is ongoing, according to a news release. Tune in to Mauricio Marin's report at 5:30 p.m. on KOLD.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2013 Tucson News Now.
