For savvy pathologists and clinical laboratory managers, this represents an opportunity to serve a cash-paying market for medical laboratory testing.\n\nAnother aspect of this trend which may be worth studying by pathologists and clinical laboratory administrators is the use of \u201cgamification\u201d by these mobile app developers. Gamification uses technologies and programming to more deeply engage the user, just as a video game does.\n\nCorporate wellness platform Keas of San Francisco, California, recently announced an $8-million investment round, according to a story at mobihealthnews.com. Ignition Partners and Atlas Ventures provided the capital. With this latest round of funding, investors have $25.5 million invested in Keas.\n\nWellness App Developer Uses Gamification as a Strategy\n\nKeas was founded in 2009 by Google Health veteran Adam Bosworth. The purpose of the program is to engage employees and encourage them to participate activities that support their health.\n\nFirst iterations of Keas, however, did not sufficiently engage users, according to the mobihealthnews.com story. \u201cIt was technically accurate, but very boring,\u201d observed Josh Stevens, Keas CEO since 2012. \u201cWe want to make health social and mobile and really engaging for employees,\u201d he declared.\n\nApplying Game Design to Non-Game Apps\n\nAfter several major pivots, Keas used gamification to enhance its appeal to users, a story at gigaom.com reported. According to gamification.org, the concept involves applying game design thinking to non-game applications. Several industry experts have labeled gamification one of the most important trends in technology.\n\nFor example, Keas emphasizes three things to gamify exercising, according to a Gamification Corp. synopsis. They are:\n\n1. game mechanics;\n\n2. social interaction; and,\n\n3. small groups.\n\nPlayers accrue points and status, which drives positive reinforcement in the game mechanics. To interact socially, small teams six participants use competitive statistics and community Q&A forums. If a team member stops participating, the entire team is unable to play. This brings social pressure to bear to encourage all participants to exercise.\n\nAverage Employee Visits Mobile App Site 12 Times Each Month\n\nThe average employee engages with the site 12 times a month, according to Keas. This is significant, because it is about triple the number of times the same users visited the existing wellness sites of client companies before they introduced the Keas wellness app. The existing wellness sites are portals usually offered by health plans.\n\nKeas is available as a mobile app. It is expanding its functionality by integrating with other health and wellness applications. For example, the program recently integrated with Fitbit and Runkeeper.\n\nKeas also plans to partner with the health coaching platforms GAIN Fitness and meQuilibrium. Pathologists and clinical laboratory professionals will be interested to learn that Keas will also partner with Laboratory Corporation of America (NYSE: LH), which provides medical laboratory tests, biometrics and health assessment.\n\nHospital Case Study Shows Benefits of a Wellness Mobile App\n\n\u201cAt Chilton Hospital, a non-profit hospital with 1,300 employees, 40% of eligible employees registered for the Keas challenge,\u201d Keas officials stated in a press release announcing the 2011 investment round. \u201cIn addition to the 1,230 pounds Chilton Hospital employees shed during the 12-week challenge, 73% of Keas players reported feeling more positive towards their employer and 64% thought the experience made them more productive at work. By the end of the Keas challenge, 88% of players reported that they would remain proactive about their health as a result of the program.\u201d\n\nWellness Programs Lower Healthcare Costs, Increase Productivity\n\nThe typical employer pays an average of $10,000 per year per employee for healthcare, according to a story published at venturebeat.com. Stevens further observed at the 2013 HealthBeat conference that 70%-80% of healthcare costs are preventable.\n\n\u201cIt is in employers\u2019 best interests to motivate their employees to do the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care costs are rising, and every time an employee takes personal time off to visit a doctor or fill a prescription can result in $250-$500 in productivity costs. The productivity savings of healthy employees are huge.\u201d\n\nWellness Startups Shifting to Direct-to-Employer\n\nThe workplace wellness market could be worth from $2.7 billion to $8.2 billion per year, according to a story in Venture Beat. Employers reach about half of the world\u2019s population.\n\nAnother driver in the United States is the Affordable Care Act. It will enable insurance companies to directly reimburse wellness programs at a higher rate than ever before, reported another Venture Beat story.\n\nPathology groups and clinical laboratory managers might want to think about how to directly approach major employers in their communities to provide wellness testing. Similarly clinical laboratory managers may want to explore how to use mobile apps to create more engagement with their patients.\n\n\u2014Pamela Scherer McLeod\n\nRelated Information:\n\nKeas raises $8M, partners with Fitbit for gamified employee wellness\n\nJiff pivots to employee wellness curation\n\nWorkplace wellness startup Keas raises $6.5M\n\nKeas raises $8M to get employee to exercise and eat more veggies\n\nKeas jogs out new-and-improved tools to promote employee health\n\nWellness startups find a channel to better health: Employers", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "pathology, clinical laboratory, medical laboratory, mobile app, keas, mobihealthnews.com, google health, adam bosworth, josh stevens, gamification, gigaom.com, gamification.org, laboratory corporation of america, fitbit, runkeeper, gain fitness, mequilibrium, labcorp, nyse: lh, chilton hospital, venture beat, affordable care act,adam bosworth,affordable care act,chilton hospital,clinical laboratory,fitbit,gain fitness,gamification,gamification.org,gigaom.com,google health,josh stevens,keas,labcorp,laboratory corporation of america,medical laboratory,mequilibrium,mobihealthnews.com,mobile app,nyse: lh,runkeeper,venture beat,digital pathology,instruments & equipment,laboratory instruments & laboratory equipment,laboratory news,laboratory operations,laboratory pathology", "description": "Venture capitalists are beginning to pour dollars into mobile apps designed to support employee health and wellness.
