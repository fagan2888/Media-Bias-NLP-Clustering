And imagine this technology on the road in about five years.\n\nStop imagining. Scientists at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Australia report that they\u2019ve developed inexpensive supercapacitors that can be used in tandem with ordinary batteries to increase the acceleration of an electric car and can recharge the batteries in a matter of minutes.\n\nRelated: This 3D Printed Car May One Day Be Yours\n\nThe supercapacitors are thin films made up of an electrolyte, which conducts electricity, sandwiched between two electrodes made of graphene, a sheet of carbon one-atom thick. This film is flexible and so can be embedded in a car\u2019s body panels, such as the roof, fenders, hood, even the floor.\n\nAnd their power density \u2013 the amount of electrical energy they can store \u2013 is so great that it can quickly and fully turbocharge a car\u2019s battery.\n\n\u201cVehicles need an extra energy spurt for acceleration, and this is where supercapacitors come in,\u201d said Marco Notarianni of QUT\u2019s Science and Engineering Faculty. \u201cThey hold a limited amount of charge, but they are able to deliver it very quickly, making them the perfect complement to mass-storage batteries.\u201d\n\nAnd, Notarianni said, cars with such technology could be commercially available in five years. The researchers\u2019 findings are published in the Journal of Power Sources and another scholarly publication, Nanotechnology.\n\nOne member of the QUT team, Jinzhang Liu, a postdoctoral research fellow, said today\u2019s graphene-based supercapacitor has a lower energy density than a Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery used to power a car. Despite this, a supercapacitor\u2019s ability to release power quickly is far greater than a conventional battery.\n\n\u201cIn the future,\u201d Liu said, \u201cit is hoped the supercapacitor will be developed to store more energy than a Li-Ion battery while retaining the ability to release its energy up to 10 times faster, meaning the car could be entirely powered by the supercapacitors in its body panels.\n\n\u201cAfter one full charge this car should be able to run up to 500km, similar to a petrol-powered car and more than double the current limit of an electric car,\u201d Liu said.\n\nSome researchers once looked to graphene-based supercapacitors as an eventual replacement for Li-Ion batteries for powering electric cars. But even if that turns out not to be possible, the devices\u2019 role as a complement to Li-Ion batteries remains extremely valuable.\n\nRelated: Tax Breaks for Tesla? States Should Think Twice\n\nThe discovery could mean a lot to the global automotive industry and its customers, not only because electric cars have less impact on the Earth\u2019s environment, but also because the components of the supercapacitors are very inexpensive.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a lot to like about the QUT\u2019s supercapacitors beyond powering cars. They can be used in many non-automotive, battery-powered applications, Liu said, \u201cfor example, by putting the film on the back of a smart phone to charge it extremely quickly.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared at OilPrice.com.\n\nRead more from OilPrice.com:\n\nMagnesium-Ion Batteries Could Be The Future Of Energy Storage\n\nOak Ridge Labs Develops New Device For Lighter, Faster Cars\n\nDespite Strong Gains, Electric Vehicles Still Far From Mainstream", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Imagine the fender of an electric car not just preventing mud splatters but also turbo", "title": "This Innovation Can Recharge Electric Car Batteries in Minutes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/11/Innovation-Can-Recharge-Electric-Car-Batteries-Minutes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05102013_Tesla_Model_S_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/11/Innovation-Can-Recharge-Electric-Car-Batteries-Minutes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05102013_Tesla_Model_S_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Imagine the fender of an electric car not just preventing mud splatters but also turbo", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Imagine the fender of an electric car not just preventing mud splatters but also turbocharging the vehicle\u2019s battery in a matter of minutes.\n\u201cAfter one full charge this car should be able to run up to 500km, similar to a petrol-powered car and more than double the current limit of an electric car,\u201d Liu said.\nSome researchers once looked to graphene-based supercapacitors as an eventual replacement for Li-Ion batteries for powering electric cars.\nBut even if that turns out not to be possible, the devices\u2019 role as a complement to Li-Ion batteries remains extremely valuable.\nScientists at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Australia report that they\u2019ve developed inexpensive supercapacitors that can be used in tandem with ordinary batteries to increase the acceleration of an electric car and can recharge the batteries in a matter of minutes."}
