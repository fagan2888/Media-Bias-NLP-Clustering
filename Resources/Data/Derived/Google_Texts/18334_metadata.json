Carroll said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating after they found that the fire was started with an accelerant, but authorities couldn\u2019t yet definitively say that the fire was a hate crime. Carroll said, \u201cWe try to be prudent about what we say. [The fire] definitely was started intentionally so we are waiting for the FBI\u2019s investigation to see if they can give us any more insight into what happened.\u201d\n\nThe incident has prompted \u201cheightened awareness\u201d among the Muslim community in Houston, Carroll admitted. His organization has begun preparing safety kits that include information to teach people \u201chow to protect their mosque, be vigilant about security, not to walk alone.\u201d\n\nSuspected arsonists have targeted Houston-area Islamic centers and mosques before, a city home to about 60,000 Muslims and over 41 mosques and storefront religious centers. The American Civil Liberties Union found that there were at least five anti-mosque incidents in Texas between 2006 and 2010. In 2010, members of the Dar El-Eman Islamic Education Center in Arlington, Texas, found \u201cgraffiti depicting Uncle Sam and Allah in a sexual position spray-painted in the parking lot,\u201d while another Islamic center in nearby Clear Lake, Texas suffered two fires in the same week. And in 2011, a Houston mosque was deliberately set on fire.\n\nThe arson came just days after a gunman shot to death three Muslims in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, an event that has sparked outcries of anti-Muslim sentiment. And just two weeks ago, Texas state Rep. Molly White (R) wrote a Facebook post telling Muslims to \u201crenounce Islamic terrorist groups and publicly announce allegiance to America and our laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in a time where this happens and this is not new for us,\u201d Carroll explained. \u201cAny time people make blanket statements about Muslims and equate all of us with the actions of a few, it gives tacit approval to [some] people in our society to mistreat Muslims. It\u2019s sort of justification when you hear all the negative press \u2026 ultimately those comments are going to manifest itself in some type of negative behavior. The words always come first and we wish that people would watch their words and not be so quick to judge.\u201d\n\nAs with the Chapel Hill shootings, Muslim leaders in the community are continuing to respond with compassion. \u201cThe majority of Americans are fair-minded so they have an affinity to come out in times like these,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cWe have a lot of community members \u2014 not just those of Muslim faith \u2014 who have spoken up and we\u2019re so thankful of them.\u201d\n\nZahid said, \u201cWe want to make sure that we don\u2019t point the fingers at anyone, blame anyone, or spread hate towards any group whether they be Muslim, whether they be non-Muslim, whatever they are. We want to love everyone. We want to help everyone get better through this. Inshallah.\u201d\n\nFurther citing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Zahid wrote in a Facebook post, \u201cDarkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"We want to make sure that we don't point the fingers at anyone, blame anyone, or spread hate towards any group whether they be Muslim, whether they be non-Muslim, whatever they are.
