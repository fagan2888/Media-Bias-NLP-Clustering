For information, call RotaCare Daly City at: (650)515-6885 or email RotaCare Daly City at: dcclinic@rotacarebayarea.org\n\nAbout RotaCare Bay Area\n\nRotaCare Bay Area is a volunteer alliance of medical professionals, organizations and community members dedicated to providing free primary, quality healthcare services to uninsured families and individuals with limited ability to pay for medical care.\n\nThe organization was formed in 1989 when a local Rotarian and his club identified that many local residents had limited access to primary health care services. They resolved to meet the need, first with a clinic in Santa Clara. Since then, RotaCare Bay Area has grown to 12 clinics operating in Coastside (Half Moon Bay), Concord, Daly City, Gilroy, Monterey, Mountain View, Pittsburg, Richmond, San Jose, San Leandro, San Rafael, and Santa Cruz. In 2014, the Free Medical Clinics experienced over 28,170 patient visits. Since its founding, RotaCare has recorded more than 285,000 patient visits. The organization receives no government funding or insurance reimbursement.\n\nEven with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, RotaCare Clinics are still very much in need. Millions of Californians remain uninsured and without an affordable option for Healthcare. RotaCare is poised and ready to be the safety net for those members of the community.\n\n\n\n\n\nRotaCare Bay Area, Inc. 514 Valley Way Milpitas, CA 95035 408.379.8000", "article_metadata": {"original-source": "http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/11/04/783628/0/en/RotaCare-Daly-City-Free-Medical-Clinic-Has-Moved.html", "title": "RotaCare Daly City Free Medical Clinic Has Moved", "og": {"site_name": "GlobeNewswire News Room", "title": "RotaCare Daly City Free Medical Clinic Has Moved", "url": "http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/11/04/783628/0/en/RotaCare-Daly-City-Free-Medical-Clinic-Has-Moved.html", "image": "http://globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/383648?filename=383648.jpg&size=1", "locale": "en_US", "article": {"tag": "RotaCare Bay Area, Inc., RotaCare Bay Area,  Inc., Free Health Care, Safety Net, Uninsured, Affordable Care Act, Community Clinic", "published_time": "11/4/2015 8:31:32 PM", "author": "RotaCare Bay Area, Inc."}, "type": "article"}, "author": "RotaCare Bay Area, Inc.", "DC.date.issued": "11/4/2015", "keywords": "RotaCare Bay Area, Inc., RotaCare Bay Area,  Inc., Free Health Care, Safety Net, Uninsured, Affordable Care Act, Community Clinic", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "MILPITAS, Calif., Nov. 04, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RotaCare Bay Area, a non-profit organization offering free medical care to the underprivileged, moved the RotaCare Daly City Free Medical Clinic from its current location at Seton Medical Center to 380 90th Street in Daly City.\nRotaCare Daly City at Seton Medical Center is one of twelve RotaCare Clinics currently operating in the Bay Area, providing free urgent and routine medical care to the medically uninsured.\nIn collaboration with the San Mateo County Public Health Department, the new Daly City RotaCare Clinic is open Mondays, 5:30PM \u2013 7:30PM for Urgent Medical Services (first come, first serve) at 380 90th Street, Daly City, CA 94015.\nRotaCare Daly City at Seton Medical Center was first established in June 1993.\nRotaCare Bay Area shows its utmost gratitude to Seton Medical Center for the continued support of RotaCare Daly City and for helping the clinic reach several thousands of patients over the past 22 years."}
