And, it\u2019s evolving quicker than you might think. Value-based reimbursement is no longer the future of healthcare, a pilot project, or some far off place where the healthcare system will one day be. That day is today and there are significant financial stakes that hinge on patient satisfaction.\n\nFor example, the Affordable Care Act outlines that CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services) holds back 1% of reimbursements to hospitals in the U.S. each year. This 1% is redistributed as a reward to top-performing hospitals and taken away from poor performers. Thirty percent of what makes a hospital a top or poor performer is made up of that hospital\u2019s Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) score. The HCAHPS is a survey given directly to patients that measures their experience at that hospital. It\u2019s a direct measure of patient satisfaction.\n\nNow, 1% may not sound like a lot, but consider that Medicare payments alone totaled $597 billion in 2014 and that the average hospital in the United States has a profit margin in single digits, if at all. That 1% can literally mean the difference between a great year and a terrible one or even whether a hospital keeps its doors open. The potential financial rewards and consequences around patient satisfaction are very real.\n\nSo, now that we know what the stakes are, how can providers improve patient satisfaction? Call centers are one big way to move the needle and can vastly improve a patient\u2019s experience. But, a call center cannot just simply book appointments or give automated reminder calls. That\u2019s not enough, and let\u2019s not call it patient engagement!\n\nHealth systems need to have call centers that engage patients throughout their entire journey, providing them with an exceptional experience. Here\u2019s what you need to know to improve the connection:\n\n1. Listen\n\nCall staff should listen closely to patients, ask additional questions if necessary, and offer help based on what the patient has said.\n\n2. Reference previous calls\n\nWhen speaking to patients who call frequently, call center staff should be able to quickly reference past calls to better determine the patient\u2019s needs.\n\n3. Always follow up\n\nOnce a call is over, the conversation should continue. Before ending the call, schedule a time to call the patient for a follow-up of that day\u2019s call, or a reminder call if they are due for an office visit or a prescription renewal.\n\n4. Make the most of patient outreach\n\nCommunication is an integral part of the patient care continuum, and patients should be alerted about seasonal immunizations, health events in their community, and screening tests they should have.\n\nAdditionally, patients should be contacted for confirmation of their appointment, and if they need to complete any information or documentation before their visit, they should be given what they need so they can arrive prepared.\n\nCall center staff can also connect with patients to collect feedback and improve satisfaction levels.\n\n5. Don\u2019t underestimate post-discharge calls\n\nPost-discharge calls encourage patients to become involved in their own care and can help start relationships with new patients who have received care and been discharged. These follow-up calls also confirm that medication instructions are understood and being followed.\n\nPost-discharge calls can:\n\n\u00b7 Improve patient adherence to treatment\n\n\u00b7 Ensure that patients understand instructions\n\n\u00b7 Increase patient satisfaction\n\n\u00b7 Allow better coordination of care\n\nAdding these tools to a current call center or investing in a new call center will require significant effort and finances, but it is a worthwhile investment that is in line with where the system is going.\n\nHCAPHS scores are just one sign of the United States transformation to a value-based system where a patient\u2019s opinion and experience matters. The health systems that embrace this new model and treat their patients like valued customers will thrive in this new environment and be rewarded both financially and with better outcomes. And, those who hold onto the old models will not survive in the new healthcare world.
