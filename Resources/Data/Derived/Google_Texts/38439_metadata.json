But because the Affordable Care Act prohibits price discrimination for pre-existing conditions in the new health insurance marketplace, the state ruled the pool is now \u201cobsolete,\u201d according to the Tribune.\n\nGov. Rick Perry signed the bill to abolish the pool in June.\n\nPeople in the pool will have until Dec. 15 to find a new form of insurance, whether that\u2019s signing up for the federal exchange or seeking it elsewhere before the deadline comes.\n\nTexas is among several states that have resisted the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but because the law has been passed and upheld in Congress and the Supreme Court, states are now offering exchanges through the federal program. Republicans in Texas have launched a crusade to defund the law, leading to the 16-day government shutdown that ended yesterday.\n\nPerry called forcing Obamacare on the nation was \u201ca criminal act.\u201d\n\nBut Texas remains the leader in the number of uninsured people \u2014 in 2012, 6 million people were without health insurance, including some 852,000 children.\n\nThe Obamacare exchanges signed into law in 2010 officially opened for business Oct. 1, but are wrought with technological failures from an overloaded infrastructure system.", "article_metadata": {"description": "People in the pool will have until Dec. 15 to find a new form of insurance, whether that's signing up for the federal exchange or seeking it elsewhere before the deadline comes.", "vf": {"unique_id": "wp_chron_blog_chron_com_txpotomac_1944_blogEntryId72585"}, "title": "Texas closing high-risk insurance pool, pushing people to sign up for Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "Texas on the Potomac", "description": "People in the pool will have until Dec. 15 to find a new form of insurance, whether that\u2019s signing up for the federal exchange or seeking it elsewhere before the deadline comes.", "title": "Texas closing high-risk insurance pool, pushing people to sign up for Obamacare", "url": "http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2013/10/texas-closing-high-risk-insurance-pool-pushing-people-to-sign-up-for-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/files/2012/03/Rick-Perry-2.jpeg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/files/2012/03/Rick-Perry-2.jpeg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "NextGEN": "1.7.5", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-18T16:11:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-18T16:11:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad56\"", "article_summary": "Texas is closing its high-risk health insurance pool for the state\u2019s sickest residents, the Texas Tribune reported Thursday.\nBut because the Affordable Care Act prohibits price discrimination for pre-existing conditions in the new health insurance marketplace, the state ruled the pool is now \u201cobsolete,\u201d according to the Tribune.\nSince 1998, the pool charged high prices to Texans with pre-existing conditions to obtain insurance they can\u2019t get elsewhere.\nPerry called forcing Obamacare on the nation was \u201ca criminal act.\u201dBut Texas remains the leader in the number of uninsured people \u2014 in 2012, 6 million people were without health insurance, including some 852,000 children.\nThe 23,000 people currently enrolled in the plan will have to withdraw from the program and sign up for the health care programs offered by the federal Affordable Care Act before the pool officially closes on Jan. 1 of next year."}
