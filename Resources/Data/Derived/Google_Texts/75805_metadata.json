Mickelson said the Americans have strayed from a winning formula they had under Paul Azinger in 2008.\n\nWatson was sitting in the middle of his 12 players and said he had a different philosophy.\n\nThe statement was issued one day after an ESPN report citing four unidentified people who were in the U.S. team room on the night before the final round. Those people said Watson blamed the players for their performance in foursomes \u2014 Europe went unbeaten in both sessions to build a 10-6 lead going into singles \u2014 and scoffed at a gift from the players by saying it was meaningless if they didn\u2019t win.\n\nThe gift was a replica of the Ryder Cup the players had signed.\n\nThe report also said Watson denigrated some of the European players, and only praised the play of U.S. rookies Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed.\n\nWatson was the oldest captain in Ryder Cup history. He was the last U.S. captain in 1993 to win the Ryder Cup away from home.\n\n\u201cThe guys gave everything. They played their hearts out,\u201d Watson said in his statement. \u201cI was proud to get to know each and every one of them.\u201d\n\nMickelson was playing his 10th Ryder Cup \u2014 no American has played more times \u2014 and said the U.S. team was not involved in any decision. He heaped praise on Azinger for his \u201cpods\u201d system that got the players involved when they won at Valhalla in 2008.\n\nWatson dismissed that during the press conference, saying winning the Ryder Cup was not about pods and that it simply took 12 players to win.\n\nThe ESPN report said Mickelson was the last to speak during the team meeting, kept his back turned at Watson and tried to rally the players. Europe won key matches early and clinched the cup with four matches still on the course.\n\nWatson said he had a \u201ccandid conversation\u201d with Mickelson this week \u201cand it ended with a better understanding of each other\u2019s perspectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhil\u2019s heart and intentions for our team\u2019s success have always been in the right place,\u201d Watson said. \u201cPhil is a great player, has great passion and I admire what he\u2019s done for golf.\u201d\n\nWatson said the loss at Gleneagles fell to him.\n\n\u201cI was their captain,\u201d he said. \u201cIn hindsight, whatever mistakes that were made were mind. And I take full responsibility for them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I regret that my words may have made the players feel that I didn't appreciate their commitment and dedication to winning the Ryder Cup,\" Watson said in a statement issued Saturday through the PGA of America. \"My intentions throughout my term as captain were both to inspire and to be honest.\"", "Author": "Doug Ferguson", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "\u201cI regret that my words may have made the players feel that I didn\u2019t appreciate their commitment and dedication to winning the Ryder Cup,\u201d Watson said in a statement issued Saturday through the PGA of America. \u201cMy intentions throughout my term as captain were both to inspire and to be honest.\u201d", "title": "Tom Watson takes blame for U.S. Ryder Cup loss", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/4/tom-watson-takes-blame-us-ryder-cup-loss/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/04/britain-ryder-cup-gol_lanc8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/04/britain-ryder-cup-gol_lanc8.jpg", "title": "Tom Watson takes blame for U.S. Ryder Cup loss", "description": "\"I regret that my words may have made the players feel that I didn't appreciate their commitment and dedication to winning the Ryder Cup,\" Watson said in a statement issued Saturday through the PGA of", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Tom Watson, Phil Mickelson, The Ryder Cup"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde032\"", "article_summary": "Watson was the oldest captain in Ryder Cup history.\nThe gift was a replica of the Ryder Cup the players had signed.\nTom Watson took the blame Saturday for his communication with his players in another American loss at the Ryder Cup, and the 65-year-old captain said he called Phil Mickelson earlier this week to clear the air.\nHe was the last U.S. captain in 1993 to win the Ryder Cup away from home.\nWatson dismissed that during the press conference, saying winning the Ryder Cup was not about pods and that it simply took 12 players to win."}
