Most metropolitan areas, including New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami, showed relatively high prevalence of dry eye syndrome -- ranging from 17 percent to 21 percent -- and high levels of air pollution.\n\nThe findings were presented at the 117th annual meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology in New Orleans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Residents of major cities such as Chicago or New York with high levels of air pollution have an increased risk of dry eye syndrome, U.S. researchers say.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Residents of major cities such as Chicago or New York with high levels of air pollution have an increased risk of dry eye syndrome, U.S. researchers say.", "title": "Dry eye syndrome higher in cities with high air pollution", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2013/11/17/Dry-eye-syndrome-higher-in-cities-with-high-air-pollution/12761384744152/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/12761384744152/2013/1/6bc74598bb2e7421b442cf78a853a1df/v2.1/Dry-eye-syndrome-higher-in-cities-with-high-air-pollution.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Health", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc72f\"", "article_summary": "This is the first study of a large patient population covering the entire continental United States to link dry eye syndrome treatment location to atmospheric conditions -- in particular, air pollution coupled with weather conditions, Galor said.\nThose living in areas with high levels of air pollution had the highest magnitude of increased risk for dry eye syndrome, at an incidence rate ratio of 1.4.\nNEW ORLEANS, Nov. 17 (UPI) -- Residents of major cities such as Chicago or New York with high levels of air pollution have an increased risk of dry eye syndrome, U.S. researchers say.\nMost metropolitan areas, including New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami, showed relatively high prevalence of dry eye syndrome -- ranging from 17 percent to 21 percent -- and high levels of air pollution.\nThe findings were presented at the 117th annual meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology in New Orleans."}
