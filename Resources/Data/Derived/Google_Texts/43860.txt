Oklahoma City Police say a woman who was driving under the influence lost control of her car on New Year's Day and crashed into a concrete barrier on Interstate 35 Service Road near S.E. 44th Street.

An officer said when he arrived at the crash scene just before 1 p.m., he found 36-year-old Julie Singletary sitting in the driver's seat of the damaged vehicle. A baby who was under a year old was in the back seat, strapped in a child seat

Singletary told the officer she was going to see a friend when she crashed. The officer noted in his police report that her speech was "thick" and slurred, and she was very difficult to understand.

Singletary refused to be examined by paramedics, and then failed several sobriety tests. The officer arrested her for DUI and child endangerment. Her child was placed in DHS custody.
