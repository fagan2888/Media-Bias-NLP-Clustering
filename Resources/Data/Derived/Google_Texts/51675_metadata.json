Still, Gruber would\u2019ve been better.\n\nTime\u2019s Person of the Year designation has lost a lot of its stature. Part of its decline can probably be attributed to the fact that it\u2019s come to be seen as an honorific.\n\nIt was originally conceived to recognize the person who, \u201cfor better or for worse . . . has done the most to influence the events of the year.\u201d\n\nSo Adolf Hitler (1938) and Josef Stalin (1939 and again in 1942) qualified.\n\nIn 2001, however, the editors couldn\u2019t bring themselves to bestow the title on Osama bin Laden, even though he certainly deserved it.

That\u2019s why the computer was hailed as the \u201cMachine of the Year\u201d in 1982 and our \u201cEndangered Earth\u201d was dubbed \u201cPlanet of the Year\u201d in 1988.\n\nIn 2006, \u201cYou\u201d won the contest because of all the wonderful work you do in creating Web content.

By making the issue his personality, he could avoid the tougher questions about the substance of what he said \u2014 and did.\n\nIt worked, in part, because Gruber really is arrogant. But Gruber\u2019s arrogance goes beyond the personal. He represents the arrogance of the expert class writ large.\n\nThey create systems, terms and rules that no normal person on the outside can possibly penetrate. They make life and living more complicated and then get rich and powerful off of their ability to navigate that complexity.\n\nTime and again they sell simplicity and security and deliver more complications and insecurity, which in turn creates demand for more experts promising simplicity and security the Gruberians never deliver.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Americans are stupid, it\u2019s that the experts have been geniuses at creating a system that makes normal people feel stupid.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Jonathan Gruber should have been Time\u2019s Person of the Year.
