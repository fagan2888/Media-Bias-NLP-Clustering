There are two versions of the robot - one that stands five feet tall was a simple legs and control mechanisms. Its six-foot tall brother is more advanced, capable of complicated locomotion.\n\nRelated: Killer Robots: If No One Pulls the Trigger, Who\u2019s to Blame?\n\nDuring the test, to be conducted at a ship graveyard in Alabama, the robots are expected to keep its balance on a moving boat; turn valves; pick up, haul and turn on a hose, and then turn the water toward a fire. Sensors that allow the robots to essentially see through smoke using a combination of laser, stereo and infrared sensors will also be tested. The Navy also said it would test a small drone that can fly through a sub, looking for victims.\n\n\u201cIts upper body will be capable of manipulating fire suppressors and throwing propelled extinguishing agent technology (PEAT) grenades,\u201d the Navy announced. \u201cIt is battery powered and holds enough energy for 30 minutes of firefighting. Like a sure-footed sailor, the robot will also be capable of walking in all directions, balancing in sea conditions, and traversing obstacles.\u201d\n\nThe robots are also capable of making some autonomous decisions, including how to move their joints and where to step. A human is expected to supervise the test and will have the ability to manipulate the robot.\n\nThe Navy said the use of these robots is still years away. But their ability to perform tasks like hauling a fire hose and turning valves is not far from the skills required by a soldier on the battlefield, raising questions about the ethics of the military use of robots.\n\nRelated: Slideshow--An Army of Robots\n\nSAFFiR is just one of many robots currently being developed, and many of the projects are funded by DARPA, the secretive defense research branch of the U.S. military. DARPA is also offering a $2 million prize for companies and universities to develop robot technology.\n\nDOD is not the only one developing robot technology, of course. Boston Dynamics, which was recently acquired by Google, is working on its own humanoid robot, and has developed a robotic mule designed to haul gear on the battlefield.\n\nA Fine Line\n\nThe blistering pace of robotic technology development scares some within the defense and ethics communities. Human Rights Watch and the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots have already launched campaigns to create prohibitions against the militarization of robots.\n\n\"Giving machines the power to decide who lives and dies on the battlefield would take technology too far,\u201d Steve Goose, Arms Division director at Human Rights Watch, said in a November 2012 statement announcing the release of a study, \u201cLosing Humanity: The Case Against Killer Robots.\" He said, \u201cHuman control of robotic warfare is essential to minimizing civilian deaths and injuries.\u201d\n\nRelated: World\u2019s Most Lethal Drone Just Flew over Florida\n\nMichael Gennert, the director of Worcester Polytechnic Institute\u2019s robotics engineering program, said DOD funding of technological advances has led to amazing consumer products and services.\n\n\u201cA lot of technologies that DARPA funded have fabulous uses. The Internet, GPS systems, cell phones, all of this tech that was developed by DOD and used for defense purposes have great applications beyond that. This is a huge technology investment,\u201d Gennert said.\n\nGennert and a team of scientists are competing in DARPA\u2019s challenge with Atlas, a six-foot-tall, 330-pound humanoid robot, meant to respond to disasters. He said that robots like this can save lives.\n\n\u201cIf you had that kind of robot for Fukushima, you could prevent a huge loss of life,\u201d he said, referring to the number of sick first responders to the disaster. \u201cIn robotics, you have the same technology that might appear on the battlefield that could appear in disaster recovery.\u201d\n\nBuilding Ethics into Robotic Technology\n\nThe potential use of robots on the battlefield is certainly a concern, Gennert said. \u201cIs it possible to weaponize a robot? It\u2019s conceivable. Right now, and hopefully for the future, you have to have a person making decisions about firing weapons.\u201d\n\nGennert said he considers robo-ethics so important that he requires all of his undergraduate robotic students to take a course on social issues connected to robotics. \u201cIt\u2019s a university\u2019s role \u2026to develop the wisdom in our students and beyond to use that technology for humankind\u2019s benefit. That\u2019s part of our mission,\u201d he said.\n\nGennert also cautioned that the use of autonomous humanoid robots is more than five years away. In the near future, he envisions the use of robotic assistants for first responders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine having a robot assistant that could help [firefighters], carry a hose and extra air. It\u2019s a bit closer in time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can imagine that a smoke jumping firefighting crew could carry a small reconnaissance robot, a little UAV. If they\u2019re fighting the fire and they lost contact with it, you launch your robot, get over the trees, and you can find the fire.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Navy has announced that it will test a robot fire fighter this summer.
