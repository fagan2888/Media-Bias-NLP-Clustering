Iran and six major powers agree in November on a historic deal that freezes key parts of Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for temporary relief on some economic sanctions, a first step toward a more comprehensive pact to be completed six months later.\n\n10) Boston Marathon bombings\n\nMotivated by extremist Islamist beliefs, two Chechen immigrant brothers plant bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 250 others.
