What he witnessed was a replay of Gov. Kasich\u2019s reelection campaign in Ohio, only in a different state.\n\nThe Big Question\n\nMr. Draper was in hot pursuit of Gov. Kasich for a few days in the small state where Kasich hopes to finish in the top three so he can gain traction in the next two states to vote, South Carolina and Nevada, where his chances right now are slim to nothing based on polling data from RealClearPolitics. com.\n\nIt\u2019s too bad Mr. Draper didn\u2019t ask Ohio\u2019s CEO one big question he successfully evaded answering in 2014, a question that would have demanded some candid and blunt answers from a candidate whose distemper is well known.\n\nHad Mr. Draper been able to mind the gap between what Gov. Kasich says he\u2019s done, and what he\u2019s actually done in his five years as state leader, he could have drawn him into explaining what he would have done differently from Ted Strickland, had he been the governor when the Great Recession hit, taking down Ohio and nearly every other state in the process?\n\nWould the tax-cutter have lowered income taxes, a forever fixation of his, as his prime solution to the recovery, and by doing so would he have forced Ohio into a real economic depression? Would he have touched the state\u2019s rainy day fund, as Strickland did to keep Ohio afloat, or would he have left it sitting there to safeguard the state\u2019s credit rating?\n\nMr. Draper\u2019s 2,908-word campaign profile on Gov. Kasich\u2019s meanderings in New Hampshire follows the normal contours of reporters covering the mercurial leader, who has followed Republican dogma for decades even though he wanders from it from time to time, especially when he tries to show off his so-called \u201cbig heart\u201d for the less fortunate.\n\nThe come-away observation Mr. Draper does make in \u201cThe Primary That Disqualified the Qualified,\u201d is that selling yourself as the commercial pilot who knows how to land the plane isn\u2019t what GOP voters, especially base voters, want in their next president. What they do want is a bomber pilot who won\u2019t stop until they see a mushroom cloud forming in the distance. Solid credentials from elections past, based on real experience in government, isn\u2019t energizing Republican voters who are drifting toward Donald Trump and Ted Cruz as their co-pilots.\n\nCommercial airline pilots like John Kasich, who think running government is as easy as wheels up, flaps, down are selling the wrong product to customers who want something new and improved. In fact, the government outsider is now king, as one poll after another shows, and commercially trained pilots like John Kasich, who crafted his \u201cland the plane\u201d metaphor to dazzle low-information voters, and who says he\u2019s done it before and can do it again, won\u2019t be in the cockpit come General Election time. Bomber pilots are needed and recruitment isn\u2019t coming from so-called \u201cestablishment lane\u201d politico pilots like John Kasich.\n\nA small indication of this phenomena comes from Hart Research Associates who found that 11 percent of voters are enthusiastic about a presidential candidate with no previous elected experience in government. HRA also found 13 percent of independents say that being \u201ceasygoing and likable\u201d describes Donald Trump well. And further muddling establishment-lane politicians expectations, 16 percent of 18-49 year-old women say Trump is helping the GOP\u2019s image. Adding salt to the wound of changing attitudes among GOP primary voters are the 24 percent of them who think Donald Trump has the right temperament to be president.\n\nSo far, that bomber pilot in our national election saga is New York real estate mogul Donald Trump. His motivated base wants bombing runs, not steady descents to a safe landing that requires compromising with Democrats, as Mr. Kasich is fond of saying he knows how to do. Commercially train pilots like John Kasich, who thought reliance on their long tenure in government held lots of trump cards to be played this election cycle, are maybe coming to grips with the realization that they and their records are exactly the opposite of what GOP base voters want. If service is their trump card, Mr. Trump has shown that\u2019s not necessarily a winning hand anymore. The aviation metaphor, devised by Mr. Kasich and taken airborne at the GOP debate in California, with President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Air Force One jet standing silently as a backdrop, is apt for a governor whose only flying experience is flying off the handle at someone he dislikes or gets in his way.\n\nRobert Draper recalls an encounter Gov. Kasich had with a woman who attended one of his small-venue New Hampshire events. \u201cHow did Kasich, the Ohio governor, intend to make himself heard amid the roaring, goading din of the scene-stealing billionaire? Slouching and noticeably dyspeptic, Kasich waited for her to finish. His reply was one he\u2019d given to reporters a half-dozen times already that day. \u2018\u2018Look, I don\u2019t spend any time thinking about him,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t take this seriously.\u2019\u2019 His focus was on making his case to the voters of New Hampshire, the state where Kasich was investing inordinate energy in hopes of staging an upset victory over Trump, who was then polling ahead of everyone else by double digits.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m free!\u2019 Kasich exclaimed at one point, perhaps not yet fully appreciating the price of insignificance, of being a governor in an agitator\u2019s world,\u201d Mr. Draper wrote. \u201cHe did say of Trump: \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t like people who call other people names. I don\u2019t like the divisiveness. I don\u2019t like the negativity.\u2019\u2019 After that, he declared himself done with the topic and scanned the audience for another question.\u201d\n\nCamp Kasich is no shrinking violet when it comes to dividing and snarking enemy encampments, then decrying the very same tactics when other candidates employ them. Having lunch on the New Hampshire campaign trail with Gov. Kasich, Mr. Draper \u201cexpressed skepticism\u201d that the governor could so easily dismiss the man who had dominated the Republican field for the past five months.\n\n\u201c\u2018I don\u2019t care what the polls say,\u2019\u2019 he [Kasich] snapped. \u2018\u2018Look. There\u2019s going to be a vote coming up. And then we don\u2019t have to have this discussion anymore.\u2019\u201d Draper got a full dose of the self-basting, perpetually petulant governor who says he has solutions to the nation\u2019s worries. For reporters who know how Mr. Kasich likes to treat media, which he\u2019d rather be done with except he needs them to stenographer his legendary quips that show his dysfunctional personality in full bloom, his statements show just how cemented he is to his beliefs, which no amount of discussion has a reasonable chance of changing it.\n\nBased on nearly 40 years as a performance politician that has made him a wealthy political celebrity, at least in Ohio, his showmanship skills are his first line of offense. It\u2019s impossible to imagine John Kasich arriving at a decision that counters his long-held beliefs on fiscal or social policy that run counter to what the majority of Americans want today.\n\n\u201cToday a Trump victory seems less far-fetched. It is Kasich, currently polling sixth in New Hampshire (and 21 points behind Trump), who faces long odds of winning there on Feb. 9.,\u201d Mr. Draper writes. \u201cKasich is the purest example of this inversion: What had in previous elections been a badge of honor \u2014 not just his executive experience as a governor but his experience in government period \u2014 now marks him as a confederate of a corrupt political system that, in the Trumpian view of things, has crippled America.\u201d\n\nAs the smart reporter Mr. Draper has shown himself to be, he deduces from the new dynamics of today\u2019s GOP race for the White House that \u201cgood governance\u2026has become not just an oxymoron but a politically poisonous phrase from a dead language.\u201d Saying it, he says, \u201cis to mark your political extinction \u2014 or so the thinking goes in the winning camps these days. Kasich is, in a way, the last holdout, espousing old-fashioned sentiments about America\u2019s yearning to \u2018\u2018hang together\u2019\u2019 and his desire to lead with \u2018\u2018a big heart\u2019\u2019 rather than with a fusillade of invective. His approach may ultimately be proved right, but only if virtually every poll is wrong.\u201d\n\nThe author goes on to pick apart the very reasons Camp Kasich touts as why he\u2019ll be \u201cthe story\u201d coming out of New Hampshire, where after spending millions already with a promise to spend more, he\u2019s drifted down to sixth place.\n\nCamp Kasich is waging a campaign, he says, based on a likely false premise. \u201cPerhaps there was no establishment lane. The Kasich campaign\u2019s obsession with beating Bush presupposed that Republican voters had the slightest interest in candidates who preached from the gospel of governance. Every poll reflected that the opposite was true. People were responding to the outsiders \u2014 and correspondingly turning away from those candidates, like Kasich and Bush, who ran on the idea that they \u2018\u2018can fix it,\u2019\u2019 in the words of Bush\u2019s widely mocked campaign slogan. Senators Rubio and Cruz recognized this; their stump speeches reflected more of what they had fought against \u2014 Obamacare, gun control, climate-\u00adchange accords \u2014 than what they had actually accomplished with their Senate colleagues. In this manner, they experienced gains in the polls as had the genuine outsiders in the race: Trump, Carson and Fiorina.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Draper notes, John Kasich is still clinging to his theory that his resume best qualifies him for the big job. \u201cHe had no interest in pretending to be anything other than the governor that he was, that in less than two months, Republican voters would turn to someone who could land the plane. But there was no recent evidence to suggest that this was true \u2014 or that voters would select the man currently polling sixth in New Hampshire as their steady-handed pilot, rather than more cunning aviators like Cruz and Rubio (now battling for second place behind Trump) or Christie (fourth).\u201d\n\nNH Reporters Still Clueless\n\nAs if to prove the very point of Mr. Draper\u2019s article, some New Hampshire political reporters continue to stenograph the governor\u2019s sweet song of bringing people together as only he and his resume can.\n\nThe New Hampshire Union Leader, which has already endorsed New Jersey Gov. Chris Chrsitie, repeated the wishful thinking from Camp Kasich.\n\n\u201c\u2018If I am the story coming out of New Hampshire,\u2019 said John Kasich, his words trailing off.The Republican presidential hopeful joked that he probably shouldn\u2019t say it with the media and cameras around.If he is the story after the nation\u2019s first primary, people will not just know how to pronounce his name, Kasich said. He added, \u2018And I probably, probably, will be President of the United States.\u2019 Kasich argued his electability as he wrapped up his remarks Monday to a candidate forum hosted by the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce and the law firm of Devine Millimet. With the New Hampshire primary just around the corner, the Ohio governor finds himself in a crop of well-known Republican candidates seeking a strong performance here to propel the campaigning longer into the nominating calendar.Kasich continues to focus on economic themes, both for his experience as a governor and as a former 18-year congressman who was an architect of the last balanced federal budget. Kasich told his audience Monday that he would rebuild the military and renew global relationships to defeat Islamic State terrorismKasich continues his campaign swing today with town hall meetings in Derry and Keene,'\u201d Dan Tuohy dutifully wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, according to a new national poll out by Reuters today, Gov. Kasich finds himself third from the bottom [at 1.4%], just barely ahead of Rick Santorum. You Know Who leads with 40.6 percent.\n\nSo what\u2019s the bottom line for Mr. Kasich\u2019s chances, according to Robert Draper? \u201cIt seemed likelier that John Kasich would soon return home to what he referred to as \u2018\u2019the second-best job in America.\u2019\u2019 In Ohio, the sitting governor remained extremely popular \u2014 though, according to the most recent poll, even there, he was still nowhere near as popular among Republican voters as You Know Who.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Plunderbund", "description": "In a\u00a0long and not exactly flattering article that appeared in The New York Times Magazine recently,\u00a0Robert Draper, a national reporter who regularly contributes to the publication, followed Ohio Go\u2026", "title": "NYT Mag Report On Kasich: GOP Voters Want Bomber Pilots, Not Commercial Pilots", "url": "http://plunderbund.com/2016/01/05/nyt-mag-report-on-kasich-gop-voters-want-bomber-pilots-not-commercial-pilots/", "image": "http://www.plunderbund.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PBLOGO2.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-05T21:11:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-05T21:11:35+00:00"}, "fb": {"page_id": 192462068938}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1"}, "article_summary": "Bomber pilots are needed and recruitment isn\u2019t coming from so-called \u201cestablishment lane\u201d politico pilots like John Kasich.\nIf service is their trump card, Mr. Trump has shown that\u2019s not necessarily a winning hand anymore.\nCommercial airline pilots like John Kasich, who think running government is as easy as wheels up, flaps, down are selling the wrong product to customers who want something new and improved.\nThe come-away observation Mr. Draper does make in \u201cThe Primary That Disqualified the Qualified,\u201d is that selling yourself as the commercial pilot who knows how to land the plane isn\u2019t what GOP voters, especially base voters, want in their next president.\n\u201cHow did Kasich, the Ohio governor, intend to make himself heard amid the roaring, goading din of the scene-stealing billionaire?"}
