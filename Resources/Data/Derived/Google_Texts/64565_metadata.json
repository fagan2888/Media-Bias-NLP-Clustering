Like the way standing on bread lines during the Great Depression seems far-off and distant to millennials.\n\nBut until we get to that point, it seems we\u2019re all doomed to bear witness to the political battle over health care legislation. Whether you call it the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, or now SCOTUScare, the fights over the law have dominated the last five years.\n\nLast week\u2019s Supreme Court decision in King v. Burwell was the latest in a series of court victories for supporters of the Affordable Care Act. Not that any of the decisions have stemmed the conservative desire to see Obamacare\u2019s longevity cut short, as they\u2019ve repeatedly launched legal battles to end the law.\n\nSo what\u2019s John Oliver\u2019s take on the legislative history of the law, and, most importantly will King, at last, bring closure for the ACA?\n\nTo paraphrase the great wit, Mark Twain, reports of the ACA\u2019s demise have been greatly exaggerated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reports of the Affordable Care Act's demise have been greatly exaggerated.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "Author": "Kathryn Rubino", "og": {"site_name": "Above the Law", "description": "Reports of the Affordable Care Act's demise have been greatly exaggerated.", "title": "John Oliver On The End Of SCOTUScare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/John-Oliver-LF.png", "url": "http://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/john-oliver-on-the-end-of-scotuscare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/John-Oliver-LF.png", "description": "Reports of the Affordable Care Act's demise have been greatly exaggerated.", "card": "summary"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669, "pages": 42029395601}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, John Oliver, King v.
