In some cases, the inventions have also made them rich.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see more inventors in Congress,\u201d said Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.). \u201cThey would appreciate our U.S. Constitution and the clause in there that sets out to protect intellectual property.\u201d\n\nMassie holds 29 patents that help designers digitally sculpt on a computer by using their sense of touch. The technology has been used by companies that make jewelry, toys, cars and reconstructive implants for wounded soldiers.\n\nOnly a few lawmakers have an educational background in science and engineering, which produces many inventors. In all of Congress, there are eight former engineers, one chemist, one microbiologist and one physicist. There are also five former software company executives, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nIn contrast, 213 members of Congress hold law degrees, and 100 have worked in education, be it as a teacher, professor or in some other role.\n\nThe number of patent-holding inventors in Congress identified by The Hill is small.\n\nIn addition to Massie, there\u2019s Rep. Trent Franks Trent FranksDems: House GOP just like Trump Supreme Court wrestles with corruption law House GOP reignites push for budget plan MORE (R-Ariz.), whose LP 1000 Life Pager looks like a pager but secretly contains pepper spray.\n\nRep. Jerry McNerney (D-Calif.) owns patents on a type of wire nut and software that reduces stress on wind turbines so that they can last longer.\n\nRep. Bill Johnson (R-Ohio) came up with the design for a device that takes in different bits of information for different applications, processes it and spits it back in real time.\n\n\u201cI tell people I have the design on the precursor to the iPad,\u201d Johnson told The Hill. \u201cI get the bragging rights but Apple gets the money.\u201d\n\nJohnson came up with the idea while he was a volunteer baseball coach. He thought that it could better process players\u2019 statistics, but eventually advertised it as an aide for golfers.\n\nThe record for congressional patents goes to Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who holds 37 of them, including car alarm technology that uses his voice to ward off intruders.\n\nIssa is helping to lead the charge in the House to pass patent reform legislation \u2014 an issue that splits the Capitol\u2019s inventors, despite their similar backgrounds.\n\nThe Californian has said that his career before entering office helped form his opposition to patent \u201ctrolls,\u201d who critics say bog down innovation with harassing lawsuits over suspected intellectual property theft.\n\nHe has been on both sides of patent infringement litigation through the company, Directed Electronics Inc., which helped make him the wealthiest member of Congress, with an estimated net worth of more than $350 million.\n\nIssa may hold the record for patents in Congress, but a number of them are now expired, and he has questioned the validity of others. He has jokingly jostled about his patent record with Massie.\n\n\u201cI understand some of yours are still valid and mine are mostly expired,\u201d Issa said during a hearing late last year.\n\n\u201cWell, some of yours were never valid, but we will leave it at that,\u201d Massie replied.\n\nMassie is one of the most outspoken critics of the patent reform push.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican, who began inventing while he was an undergraduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, fears lawmakers\u2019 efforts could prevent researchers from finding breakthroughs.\n\n\u201cI think this bias in the proposed legislation against NPE\u2019s \u2014 or non-practicing entities \u2014 is a very, very dangerous thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like telling somebody that your career as a writer is illegitimate unless you own a printing press.\u201d\n\nCongressional inventors are split on the long-simmering dispute, which will rear its head into two separate House hearings this coming week.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office director Michelle Lee will testify in the House Judiciary Committee, as it considers a major piece of legislation meant to clamp down on lawsuits from the \u201ctrolls.\u201d On Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee will take up a bill that aims to reduce the amount of abusive letters sent by companies that suspect their patent rights are being violated.\n\nMcNerny, who invented the modification for wind turbines, opposes broad patent reform legislation, saying it could hurt inventors like him.\n\n\u201cI was an individual inventor,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really working for a corporation when I did these inventions. So I felt like a little guy, and I certainly want to see the rights of the little guy protected.\u201d\n\nJohnson, whose proto-iPad device never made it to market, was more critical of people who file lawsuits against bigger, successful companies.\n\nBecause of his design, he has been told he \u201cprobably has a case\u201d against companies that made tablets, he told The Hill. But he has declined to take them up on it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the idea and the progress that we\u2019ve made, but somebody else that has the wherewithal actually brought it to market and I\u2019m okay with that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have a real problem with somebody that sits around and thinks up an idea, doesn\u2019t have the equipment, and then when somebody else does, they think that somebody owes them something. I don\u2019t agree with that.\u201d\n\nPatent reform cuts across party lines and has also been embraced by the White House.\n\nAs the effort gets going in coming weeks, members with a patent or inventor background will be able to weigh in with their unique perspective, said Michael Rosen, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very helpful, just as in the way during that during the ObamaCare debate, some of the members of Congress \u2014 in particular, I think it tended to be Republican opponents of ObamaCare \u2014 sort of had an added sense of credibility if they themselves were doctors,\u201d said Rosen, who is also an intellectual property lawyer at Fish and Richardson.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The came up with gizmos as varied as a car alarm, decoy pepper spray and a proto-iPad.", "description": "The came up with gizmos as varied as a car alarm, decoy pepper spray and a proto-iPad.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem and Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The came up with gizmos as varied as a car alarm, decoy pepper spray and a proto-iPad.", "title": "Congress's exclusive club of inventors", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/238472-meet-the-inventors-in-congress", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/issadarrell_massiethomas_070914gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/238472-meet-the-inventors-in-congress", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-13T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Dustin Weaver", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Trent Franks,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-13T06:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/238472-meet-the-inventors-in-congress", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The came up with gizmos as varied as a car alarm, decoy pepper spray and a proto-iPad.", "card": "summary", "title": "Congress's exclusive club of inventors"}, "dcterms.title": "Congress's exclusive club of inventors"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16f8\"", "article_summary": "Among the farmers, lawyers and career politicians on Capitol Hill, there\u2019s also a smaller, more exclusive club: the inventors.\nMcNerny, who invented the modification for wind turbines, opposes broad patent reform legislation, saying it could hurt inventors like him.\nIssa is helping to lead the charge in the House to pass patent reform legislation \u2014 an issue that splits the Capitol\u2019s inventors, despite their similar backgrounds.\nTheir voices will hold weight as Congress dives into a new debate over patent reform, an issue that cuts across party lines.\nMassie is one of the most outspoken critics of the patent reform push."}
