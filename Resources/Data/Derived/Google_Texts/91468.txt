HOPKINTON, N.H. – During a campaign stop in New Hampshire Tuesday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she has set “two big national goals” for her potential presidency.

“I like national goals,” Clinton said. “I look out here, I see some people who remember when President Kennedy set the national goal that we would get to the moon before the end of the decade. And we got there.”

She said Kennedy’s goal “lit a flame of innovation and imagination.”

“Well, here’s what I want to do,” Clinton said. “By the end of my first term, I want to see 500 million—half a billion—solar panels installed in the United States of America. By the end of my second term, I want to see enough clean, renewable energy to power every single home in America.”

“I know we can do it,” she continued. “I was in Iowa yesterday, they’re already getting 30 percent of their energy from wind.”

Clinton added that the new technologies her plan calls for are an “opportunity” to create jobs.

She said it would require government “incentives” and taking away subsidies from the oil and natural gas industry.

Clinton said she was “thrilled” by the Supreme Court’s ruling on same-sex marriage. She reiterated her belief in “a woman’s right to choose.”

Clinton also called for universal pre-kindergarten, a higher minimum wage and providing two years of community college.

Clinton said she was optimistic about her chances in both the New Hampshire primary and the general election.

“I’ve been called a lot of things, but I’ve never been called a quitter,” Clinton said.
