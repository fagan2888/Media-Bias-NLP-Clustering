Bush, Jeb Bush, News, Politics News\n\nGeorge W. Bush, tireless during his father\u2019s 1988 campaign, still had to confront his drinking problem if he was to take center stage. Some of the pieces of sobriety were in place. He had been attending Bible study since the mid-\u201980s and already thought of himself as born-again. He had an ultimatum from Laura, and with his father\u2019s rise to the presidency came opportunities, including the possibility of buying the Texas Rangers. (His great-uncle Herb Walker had once owned the Mets.) The team was a beloved Texas institution. As he told a local news program, \u201cThis job has very high visibility, which cures the political problem I\u2019d have: What has the boy done?\u201d He quickly raised $75 million, despite no experience in running a professional sports team. His own contribution was $600,000, but since he put the deal together, he was handed a 10 percent share. So his $600,000 turned into $7.5 million overnight. He would ultimately rake in $15 million.\n\nHe was now a public figure and worthy of being a gubernatorial candidate. Suddenly a long-simmering family squabble burst into public view. Barbara sent a message to her son, first through aides, and then through reporters. \u201cI\u2019m hoping, having bought the Rangers, he\u2019ll get so involved that he won\u2019t do it.\u201d George W. did nothing to contain his resentment. Also using a reporter to get a message to his mother: \u201cThank you very much. You\u2019ve been giving me advice for forty-two years, most of which I haven\u2019t taken.\u201d Barbara wanted that year\u2019s Bush candidate to be Jeb, but the younger son wasn\u2019t coming along as quickly as George W. He had a net worth far less than the Ranger windfall, a family that seemed to need him, and a wife who strongly preferred to stay out of the public eye.\n\nThe shock of Bush 41 losing the presidency, when it had once seemed so certain to continue to a second term, galvanized the Bushes and cleared the way for both Jeb and George to take their turns at keeping the family in politics. While Jeb started his race for governor of Florida methodically and with the family\u2019s full backing, even permission, George W., in Texas, was asked to back off, partly because his parents felt he would be deflecting funds from his brother, but also because they did not think he could beat Ann Richards, the sharp-tongued incumbent, who had told the 1988 Democratic National Convention that George H. W. Bush had been born \u201cwith a silver foot in his mouth.\u201d Florida governor Lawton Chiles, whom Jeb would be challenging, was considered vulnerable. By November, however, polls in Texas and Florida showed movement in unexpected directions. On election night the family\u2019s predictions were inverted: Bush was the new governor of Texas, Chiles was reelected in Florida. George W. got on the phone with his father, who was distraught about Jeb\u2019s loss and continued to lament about what terrible news this was until W. cut him off: \u201cWhy do you feel bad about Jeb? Why don\u2019t you feel good about me?\u201d\n\nGeorge had accomplished something his father had twice failed to do\u2014win a state election in Texas\u2014and was now in uncharted waters. Despite the wide array of political positions held by family members, no Bush had served as a governor. He was now the political standard-bearer for the dynasty (and now it really was a dynasty), and there was no familial reference point to guide him. He could be his own man.\n\nIn an interview with the Houston Post, he embraced evangelical Christianity. \u201cHeaven is only open to those who accept Jesus Christ,\u201d he said. His cousin John Ellis was compelled to comment, \u201cI always laugh when people say George W. is saying this or that to appease the religious right. He is the religious right.\u201d Even if his faith wasn\u2019t put on display for the sake of votes, it had that effect and appealed to a segment of the Texas electorate that had grown tired of being ignored. It was also a clean break from the muted Episcopalian religiosity of his parents and grandparents. They didn\u2019t talk openly about faith because it wasn\u2019t polite to do so. George W.\u2019s lack of qualms about bearing witness, and Jeb\u2019s conversion to Catholicism, added a new dimension to the Bush dynasty.\n\nAnd yet he governed Texas much as his father might have. He reached across the aisle to work closely with Democrats and formed a real partnership with his Democratic lieutenant governor. He refused to take a hard line on immigration, even when it became clear that heated rhetoric was paying political dividends in California. He signed a law that guaranteed spots in public colleges and universities to students in the top tenth of any Texas high school graduating class\u2014as a response to the courts\u2019 dismantling of affirmative action. He even proposed offsetting cuts in property taxes with increases in other taxes.\n\n*\n\nThe second Bush presidency came down to 537 votes out of 6 million in Florida, the margin of victory in the final tally after the U.S. Supreme Court intervened in the 2000 Florida recount. In this extraordinary chapter in the story of this extraordinary dynasty, the growing vastness and influence of the Bush dynasty became apparent. Jeb was by now governor of Florida and had promised to deliver his state\u2019s twenty-five electoral votes to his older brother. Cousin John Ellis was on the election desk at Fox News, keeping W. informed of the see-saw in the vote count. As the issue moved to the courts, it was President Bush\u2019s former secretary of state, James A. Baker, who headed the legal team. And then there was the eerie historical parallel: fifty years earlier, Prescott Bush had lost in a close election after a bid for a recount was stopped by the courts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yes, George and Barbara Bush imagined Jeb as the presidential heir -- but the rivalry gets even more complicated", "title": "One Bush to rule them all: Jeb and George W.\u2019s behind-the-scenes struggle for Bush legacy supremacy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Yes, George and Barbara Bush imagined Jeb as the presidential heir -- but the rivalry gets even more complicated", "title": "One Bush to rule them all: Jeb and George W.\u2019s behind-the-scenes struggle for Bush legacy supremacy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/28/one_bush_to_rule_them_all_jeb_and_george_w_s_behind_the_scenes_struggle_for_bush_legacy_supremacy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/jeb_george_w_bush.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Yes, George and Barbara Bush imagined Jeb as the presidential heir -- but the rivalry gets even more complicated", "title": "One Bush to rule them all: Jeb and George W.\u2019s behind-the-scenes struggle for Bush legacy supremacy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/jeb_george_w_bush.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Stephen Hess", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, George W.
