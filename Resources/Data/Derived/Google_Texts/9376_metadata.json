It provides incentives for medical practices to continually evaluate the relative effectiveness of competing medical interventions as a way of delivering better, less costly care to more people. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records is enabling researchers to conduct these head-to-head comparisons in more automated ways, reducing the time and expense associated with the highly controlled clinical trials used to evaluate new drugs and devices.\n\nA communications challenge with these new approaches, however, is how to explain the risks and rewards of participation to patients. In focus groups, Magnus found that no meaningful discussions could take place until his research team had educated patients on some fundamental concepts of medical research, such as standards-of-care, randomization and informed consent. To help with this process, his team produced three short, animated videos that would rapidly get everyone up to the same level of understanding. Magnus and his collaborators are making these videos available to all for educational purposes.\n\nThe first video, \u201cWhich Medication is Best?,\u201d explores the influences and uncertainty associated with physicians\u2019 prescribing preferences. \u201cResearch on Medical Practices\u201d explains medical record reviews, study randomization and randomization of clinics and hospitals; and \u201cInforming or Asking\u201d describes ways to explain study participation to patients.\n\nMagnus and his bioethicist collaborators from the Seattle Children\u2019s Research Institute and University of Washington expect to publish their final ethics policy recommendations later this year.\n\nPreviously: Bioethicists say criticisms of preemie oxygen study could have \u201cchilling effect\u201d on clinical research; Stanford biomedical ethicist discusses Choosing Wisely Initiative and Will new guidelines lead to massive statin use?\n\nVideos by Booster Shot Media", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "john ioannidis", "og": {"image": "http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/wp-content/themes/scope/images/logo_share.jpg"}, "description": "\u201cOver 85 percent of our major medical guideline recommendations are not based on high-quality evidence,\u201d said Robert Califf, MD, director of the Duke", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe had to dispel the myth that doctors always know which treatments are most effective for individual patients,\u201d Magnus told me.\n\u201cResearch on Medical Practices\u201d explains medical record reviews, study randomization and randomization of clinics and hospitals; and \u201cInforming or Asking\u201d describes ways to explain study participation to patients.\nThe first video, \u201cWhich Medication is Best?,\u201d explores the influences and uncertainty associated with physicians\u2019 prescribing preferences.\nPreviously: Bioethicists say criticisms of preemie oxygen study could have \u201cchilling effect\u201d on clinical research; Stanford biomedical ethicist discusses Choosing Wisely Initiative and Will new guidelines lead to massive statin use?\nA communications challenge with these new approaches, however, is how to explain the risks and rewards of participation to patients."}
