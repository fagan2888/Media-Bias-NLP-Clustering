I personally have been bullish for ages on the healthcare sector (such as here, here and here) because of the big-picture trends behind the industry. A short list of these influences include:\n\nAging America needs more care: According to the Administration on Aging, the population of Americans older than 65 in 1999 was 35.3 million. That increased 12.5% in 10 years to 39.6 million in 2009. And by 2020, that age group should hit 55 million. Older Americans simply need more medical devices, drugs and treatment \u2014 meaning a big tailwind for healthcare in the years ahead.\n\nAccording to the Administration on Aging, the population of Americans older than 65 in 1999 was 35.3 million.

Obamacare unlocks \u201ccustomers.\u201d Say what you want about the Affordable Care Act, also known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d but the bottom line is that 10.3 million uninsured Americans now have coverage. Those are a whole lot more \u201ccustomers\u201d for the healthcare industry as a result.\n\nSay what you want about the Affordable Care Act, also known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d but the bottom line is that 10.3 million uninsured Americans now have coverage. Those are a whole lot more \u201ccustomers\u201d for the healthcare industry as a result. Emerging markets untapped: According to the World Bank, the developed world typically spends upwards of 10% of its GDP on healthcare. The U.S. spent 17.9% of its GDP on healthcare in 2012, the most recent data available, while the U.K. spent 9.4%, Germany spent 11.3% and France spent 11.7%. Meanwhile, emerging markets spend next to nothing on healthcare. China spent a paltry 5.4%, India spent 4.0% and many nations in Africa spent less than 3%. As nations develop, they spend more on necessities like infrastructure and healthcare first \u2014 and that means growth for healthcare companies abroad.\n\nThere are other reasons, including the fact that healthcare spending is largely recession-proof as patients prioritize drugs or medical care over other discretionary expenses. But the bottom line is that healthcare has a lot more going for it than just a hot rumor on Wall Street.\n\nThe Deal of a Lifetime: 14 days for just $1 \u2014 CLICK HERE\n\nHow to Play the Healthcare Megatrend\n\nMy favorite ways to play this trend include:\n\nThe SPDR S&P500 Biotech ETF (XBI), to play a wide swath of small up-and-coming drug stocks developing the next generation of treatments for conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer.\n\n(XBI), to play a wide swath of small up-and-coming drug stocks developing the next generation of treatments for conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer.
