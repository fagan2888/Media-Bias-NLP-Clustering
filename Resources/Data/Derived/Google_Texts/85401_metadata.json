He\u2019s also the first teenager to defeat the top-ranked man at a Slam since Nadal was 19 when he beat Roger Federer at the 2005 French Open.\n\n\u201cWe keep saying, \u2018Who\u2019s the next guy?\u2019 And I think we may have found him,\u201d seven-time major champion John McEnroe said on the BBC broadcast.\n\nNadal dropped the first set in each of his previous three matches before coming back to win. When he took the second set Tuesday, though, Kyrgios stayed steady.\n\n\u201cKyrgios is young; he has nothing to lose,\u201d said Nadal\u2019s uncle and coach, Toni \u201cIt\u2019s like when Boris Becker won here. He was 17 and had a very good serve. He could beat everyone because of his serve. It\u2019s the same with Kyrgios. He plays aggressively and without any doubts.\u201d\n\nFor Nadal, who won Wimbledon in 2008 and 2010, it was yet another early exit at the grass-court tournament against a much-lower-ranked opponent. In 2012, he lost in the second round against No. 100 Lukas Rosol. Last year, he was beaten in the first round by No. 135 Steve Darcis. Neither of those players is considered an up-and-coming contender like Kyrgios is, but the common thread among the trio was going for broke.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, (on) this surface, when you have an opponent that decides to serve and to hit every ball very strong, you are in trouble,\u201d Nadal said.\n\nKyrgios, who saved nine match points while beating 13th-seeded Richard Gasquet in the second round, showed zero hint of nerves. Indeed, he soaked up all the attention and adoration offered by the Centre Court crowd, particularly after an audacious trick shot: Facing the net at the baseline, he whipped his racket around his back and casually flicked a shot that sailed between his legs and over the net for a winner.\n\nHe joked about reading that his mother said she didn\u2019t think he could beat Nadal.\n\n\u201cIt actually made me a bit angry,\u201d Kyrgios said, then noted: \u201cI\u2019ll just text her a smiley face.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, he faces No. 8 Milos Raonic of Canada, another man never before this far at Wimbledon. The other men\u2019s quarterfinals: seven-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer against good friend and Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka in an all-Swiss matchup; defending champion Andy Murray against No. 11 Grigor Dimitrov; and 2011 champion Novak Djokovic against No. 26 Marin Cilic.\n\nThe women\u2019s quarterfinals Wednesday: No. 3 Simona Halep against 2013 runner-up Sabine Lisicki, and No. 9 Angelique Kerber against No. 13 Eugenie Bouchard. The semifinal on the other side of the draw was established Tuesday: 2011 champion Petra Kvitova against No. 23 Lucie Safarova.\n\nKerber edged Sharapova 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-4 Tuesday. Sharapova made 49 unforced errors, 38 more than Kerber. Still, the 2004 champion saved one match point at 5-2 in the final set, then five more at 5-4, before pushing a backhand long to end it.\n\n\u201cI felt like I worked too hard within the match to let it go the easy way. So I did everything I could in the end to try to save those,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cI did, but I didn\u2019t save the last one.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 144th-ranked Kyrgios, a wild-card entry, hit 37 aces and delivered a between-the-legs winner on one point.
