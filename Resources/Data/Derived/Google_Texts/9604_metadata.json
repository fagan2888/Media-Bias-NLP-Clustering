An Allegheny County judge upheld that ruling when the municipality appealed it, the lawsuit says.\n\nKenneth Radinick, 43, claims that Mackey is upset over Radinick's continued airing of a problem with the police department's radio systems and has taken several actions against him including suspending him for five days without pay after a Sept. 28, 2011 argument with another officer. The other officer only received a written reprimand, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe president of the Bethel Park Police Association claims in a federal lawsuit filed Thursday that police Chief John Mackey has singled him out for disciplinary actions because of his advocacy efforts and his challenge of a 2011 suspension.\n\nTribLive commenting policy\n\nYou are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.\n\nWe moderate comments. Our goal is to provide substantive commentary for a general readership. By screening submissions, we provide a space where readers can share intelligent and informed commentary that enhances the quality of our news and information.\n\nWhile most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderating decisions are subjective. We will make them as carefully and consistently as we can. Because of the volume of reader comments, we cannot review individual moderation decisions with readers.\n\nWe value thoughtful comments representing a range of views that make their point quickly and politely. We make an effort to protect discussions from repeated comments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 either by the same reader or different readers.\n\nWe follow the same standards for taste as the daily newspaper. A few things we won't tolerate: personal attacks, obscenity, vulgarity, profanity (including expletives and letters followed by dashes), commercial promotion, impersonations, incoherence, proselytizing and SHOUTING. Don't include URLs to Web sites.\n\nWe do not edit comments. They are either approved or deleted. We reserve the right to edit a comment that is quoted or excerpted in an article. In this case, we may fix spelling and punctuation.\n\nWe welcome strong opinions and criticism of our work, but we don't want comments to become bogged down with discussions of our policies and we will moderate accordingly.\n\nWe appreciate it when readers and people quoted in articles or blog posts point out errors of fact or emphasis and will investigate all assertions. But these suggestions should be sent via e-mail. To avoid distracting other readers, we won't publish comments that suggest a correction. Instead, corrections will be made in a blog post or in an article.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Tribune-Review", "description": "The president of the Bethel Park Police Association claims in a federal lawsuit filed Thursday that police Chief John Mackey has singled him out for ...", "pubdate": "2013-09-05 12:39:00", "author": "Tribune-Review", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "The president of the Bethel Park Police Association claims in a federal lawsuit filed Thursday that police Chief John Mackey has singled him out for ...", "title": "Officer sues Bethel Park, says he has been targeted for disciplinary actions", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVELogo.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-05 14:56:51.091", "url": "http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/4654123-74/lawsuit-mackey-police", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president of the Bethel Park Police Association claims in a federal lawsuit filed Thursday that police Chief John Mackey has singled him out for ...", "creator": "@triblive", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tribbird://", "iphone": "tribbird://"}, "name": {"ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"ipad": 328217517, "iphone": 328217517}}, "title": "Officer sues Bethel Park, says he has been targeted for disciplinary actions", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVETwitter.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-05 12:39:00", "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "sailthru.title": "Officer sues Bethel Park, says he has been targeted for disciplinary actions", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "sailthru.canonical": "http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/4654123-74/lawsuit-mackey-police", "keywords": "lawsuit, police, radinick, actions, bethel", "headline": "Officer sues Bethel Park, says he has been targeted for disciplinary actions", "sailthru.tags": "Newsletter, News, Breaking", "article": {"category": "News", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "published_time": "2013-09-05 12:39:00", "subcategory": "Admin Page", "mainsection": "News", "section": "News", "publishedtoweb": "2013-09-05 12:39:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-05 14:56:51.091", "tag": "lawsuit, police, radinick, actions, bethel", "subsection": "Admin Page", "title": "Officer sues Bethel Park, says he has been targeted for disciplinary actions", "author": "Tribune-Review"}, "docauthor": "Tribune-Review", "sailthru.description": "The president of the Bethel Park Police Association claims in a federal lawsuit filed Thursday that police Chief John Mackey has singled him out for ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd83db\"", "article_summary": "Because of the volume of reader comments, we cannot review individual moderation decisions with readers.\nThe other officer only received a written reprimand, the lawsuit says.\nTo avoid distracting other readers, we won't publish comments that suggest a correction.\nThe municipality's civil service commission agreed with Radinick that the suspension was retaliatory and reduced his punishment to a reprimand.\nTribLive commenting policyYou are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service."}
