For employees, it's even lower \u2014 just $4 a visit.\n\nFortune points out Wal-Mart is targeting rural areas for their test markets, where health care options are limited and many people are newly insured under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA health care official explained to Forbes how Wal-Mart's model for cheap health care could work well in those areas. \u201cBoth Texas and South Carolina have primary care access problems, [but] interestingly, the access problem is specifically related to cost. And neither state is expanding Medicaid, so both will continue to have a group of uninsured who will prioritize cost when seeking care.\"\n\nAt these clinics, patients will often see nurse practitioners, who can prescribe most of the same medication as a doctor but receive less training.\n\nThat training gap is one of the reasons some doubt the ability of these facilities to treat complicated conditions like diabetes. They argue patients will benefit better from sticking with one doctor who understands them and their illness.\n\nThe success of these clinics remains to be seen, and Wal-Mart hasn't said if it plans to implement them on a larger scale.\n\nThis video contains images from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The retail giant recently opened up 6 health care clinics in Texas and South Carolina, and it plans to open another 6 by the end of the year.", "og": {"url": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/lifestyles/health/wal-mart-wants-be-your-doctor-new-store-clinics/ngy8X/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/21/de/42/DDN_Facebook_Icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "The retail giant recently opened up 6 health care clinics in Texas and South Carolina, and it plans to open another 6 by the end of the year.", "title": "Walmart wants to be your doctor with in-store clinics | Health"}, "twitter": {"site": "@daytondailynews", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2012/05/15/e2/a8/Walmart_exteriorcropped.jpg", "description": "Groceries, clothes, school supplies &mdash; you can get everything at Wal-Mart &mdash; and soon, that might include health care.", "card": "summary", "title": "Wal-Mart wants to be your doctor with new in-store clinics"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/lifestyles/health/wal-mart-wants-be-your-doctor-new-store-clinics/ngy8X/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2575617/news/lifestyles/health/wal-mart-wants-be-your-doctor-new-store-clinics/ngy8X/", "keywords": "walmart,wal-mart,newsy_stub,newsy,newsfeed,monday_stub,medicine,me_stub,health care,health,cox_viral,cox_stub,cox_shared,clinic,Nurse practitioner,Health_Medical_Pharma,Dow Jones Industrial Average", "google-site-verification": "fR8PW_DfizdYW0uymF5VkAzfbNKqKxqfnhqsbXSP7oI", "news_keywords": "wal-mart, newsy_stub, newsy, monday_stub, me_stub, cox_viral, cox_stub, cox_shared, walmart, Nurse practitioner"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbba6\"", "article_summary": "A health care official explained to Forbes how Wal-Mart's model for cheap health care could work well in those areas.\nBy Ben LawsonVideo transcript provided by Newsy.comGroceries, clothes, school supplies \u2014 you can get everything at Wal-Mart \u2014 and soon, that might include health care.\nBut this time the clinics are fully owned by Wal-Mart and staffed by nurse practitioners, medical assistants and physicians.\nThe success of these clinics remains to be seen, and Wal-Mart hasn't said if it plans to implement them on a larger scale.\n\u201cBoth Texas and South Carolina have primary care access problems, [but] interestingly, the access problem is specifically related to cost."}
