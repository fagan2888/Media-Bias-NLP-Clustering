The event kicked off with the annual parade. Hundreds lined the streets to get their hands on some beads and other goodies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having fun just wandering around and looking at the buildings again. I mean, you live here all your life and you don\u2019t really look at them,\u201d Mardi Gras-goer Kelly Reed says.\n\nA live band provided music, and there wasn\u2019t a shortage of places to eat or shop. Local vendors used this opportunity to show off their merchandise. The entire day was fun for the whole family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun. There\u2019s a lot of food. A lot of people out here. I like it,\u201d Mardi Gras-goer Jeffrey James says.\n\nEvent organizers are excited with the turnout of this year\u2019s Meridian Mardi Gras festivities.\n\n\u201cJust can\u2019t express enough gratitude to the city of Meridian and Community Development for partnering with us and letting us put this on,\u201d Meridian Mardi Gras Committee chair Will Hayes says. \u201cWe also want to thank other business who have contributed to make this happen.\u201d\n\nHayes says Meridian Mardi Gras has been growing over the last several years and believes it is getting bigger and better.\n\n\u201cA fun family event for everyone in the city of Meridian and surrounding areas, and I think we\u2019ve succeeded at that. We just hope to make it better every year and it has been this way so far,\u201d Hayes says.\n\nWith Meridian Mardi Gras falling on Feb. 14, some were confused on how to celebrate.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t decide if it\u2019s Mardi Gras or Valentine\u2019s Day, so that\u2019s why you get this right here,\u201d Reed says, pointing to her beads and heart-shaped sunglasses.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Meridian Mardi Gras was bigger and better than ever, event organizers say.
