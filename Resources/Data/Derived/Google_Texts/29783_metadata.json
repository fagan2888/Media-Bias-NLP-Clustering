International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde attended the forum and met with Pope Francis on Monday.\n\nFrancis has sought to shine the spotlight on the scourge of human trafficking and modern-day slavery and has enlisted Christian and Muslim and other faith leaders to do the same.\n\nDuring the Sunday gathering, representatives of the France-based Consumer Goods Forum, which has 400 supermarket chains and consumer goods corporations as members, announced that it had recently passed a resolution to \"strive to eradicate forced labor from our value chains.\"\n\nMembers of the forum include supermarket chain Carrefour and foodmakers Barilla, Campbell's, Nestle, Hershey's and Bumble Bee. It wasn't immediately clear if the forum's internal resolutions are binding on members, though membership can be terminated.\n\nPell congratulated the Consumer Goods Forum for its pledge and announced the Vatican would do the same.\n\n\"It is against this backdrop that I am pleased to confirm that the Vatican itself will commit to slavery-proofing its own supply chains and I hope that today's announcement will serve as encouragement for others to follow suit,\" he said.\n\nHe noted that the members of the Consumer Goods Forum represents 2.7 trillion euros in annual sales, and directly employ 10 million people around the globe.\n\nThe Vatican's contribution to the movement to slave-proof supply chains pales by comparison, given it is a tiny city state of 44 hectares, a few hundred residents and a few thousand employees. But it does have a sought-after tax-free supermarket and department store.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vatican commits to slavery-proofing its own supply chains - AP News: ROME (AP) \u2014 The Vatican says it will ensure that .05/27/2016 7:52:27AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "ROME (AP) \u2014 The Vatican says it will ensure that its supply chains don't use", "title": "AP News - Vatican commits to slavery-proofing its own supply chains", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/01/18/vatican-commits-to-slaveryproofing-its-own-supply-chains-n2106339", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\18\\35f446e7-c48f-40cb-8836-a40448223cd5.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "ROME (AP) \u2014 The Vatican says it will ensure that its supply chains don't use", "title": "AP News - Vatican commits to slavery-proofing its own supply chains", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/01/18/vatican-commits-to-slaveryproofing-its-own-supply-chains-n2106339", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/18/35f446e7-c48f-40cb-8836-a40448223cd5.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Vatican commits to slavery-proofing its own supply chains, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "ROME (AP) \u2014 The Vatican says it will ensure that its supply chains don't use forced labor after a forum of some of the world's biggest supermarket chains and food manufacturers announced new efforts to slave-proof their own supply chains.\nPell congratulated the Consumer Goods Forum for its pledge and announced the Vatican would do the same.\n\"It is against this backdrop that I am pleased to confirm that the Vatican itself will commit to slavery-proofing its own supply chains and I hope that today's announcement will serve as encouragement for others to follow suit,\" he said.\nThe Vatican's contribution to the movement to slave-proof supply chains pales by comparison, given it is a tiny city state of 44 hectares, a few hundred residents and a few thousand employees.\nDuring the Sunday gathering, representatives of the France-based Consumer Goods Forum, which has 400 supermarket chains and consumer goods corporations as members, announced that it had recently passed a resolution to \"strive to eradicate forced labor from our value chains.\""}
