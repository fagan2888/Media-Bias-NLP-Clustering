Already, there are internal frictions in Clintonland that recall her 2008 campaign.\n\nThe problems facing the former Florida governor are more in the open: For a candidate that much of the Republican Party establishment views as a strong front-runner, he gets surprisingly bad marks from voters.\n\nIn an NBC/Wall Street Journal national poll last month, Jeb Bush was viewed positively by only 19 percent of respondents; 32 percent viewed him negatively. By contrast, Hillary Rodham Clinton had a 45 percent positive rating and 37 percent negative.\n\nTwo recent Bloomberg Politics polls, in Iowa and New Hampshire, the initial tests, are revealing.\n\nIn Iowa, among likely Republican voters, Mr. Bush has a 43 percent unfavorable rating, unusually high.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a tightly packed race, he finishes first among New Hampshire Republican primary voters. But he is viewed unfavorably by 50 percent of the general electorate in that battleground state. Of the 22 possible presidential aspirants, only Donald Trump is perceived more negatively.\n\nMr. Bush\u2019s backers counter that such early polls are irrelevant because the public doesn\u2019t yet know his achievements as a successful conservative two-term governor or his reputation as the most substantive politician in the Bush clan. If Mr. Bush runs, these attitudes \u201cwill change when they get to know him and his record,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a Bush political confidant.\n\nThe negatives probably reflect views about his older brother, George W. Bush, whose presidency ended six years ago. \u201cAll they know\u201d about Jeb, Mr. Murphy said, is that \u201che is the brother.\u201d Unsettling to some other Republican strategists is that the Bush brand itself might be problematic. The record of Jeb Bush\u2019s father, the 41st president, George H.W. Bush, has been re-evaluated more positively: He is credited with expertly managing the end of the Cold War, the successful first Iraq War, a budget deficit deal and passing the Americans with Disabilities Act. But those are distant memories for many voters, unlike George W. Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\nThe 43rd president remains decidedly less popular than Bill Clinton, his predecessor. In a Quinnipiac University poll last year that asked who was the best of the dozen post-World War II presidents, George W. Bush tied for last place with Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, each chosen by only 1 percent of those surveyed.\n\nJeb Bush will try to strike some distance from his brother. The most noteworthy domestic achievement of Bush 43, legislation giving prescription drug benefits to senior citizens, is hard to embrace when Republicans are denouncing Obamacare.\n\nThe Bush tax cuts led to soaring deficits, and its jobs record isn\u2019t one Republicans relish: Almost 21 million private sector jobs were created during Clinton\u2019s eight years in office, and 7.5 million have been in President Obama\u2019s first six years. Under George W. Bush, 463,000 private sector jobs were lost.\n\nOn foreign policy, the conservative icon William F. Buckley once declared that President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to go to war in Iraq was all-defining: \u201cIf he\u2019d invented the Bill of Rights, it wouldn\u2019t get him out of his jam.\u201d That decision still looks like a jam.\n\nOn Friday, Jeb Bush said he \u201cwon\u2019t talk\u201d about his brother\u2019s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nBut the association may be hard to shake. In Iowa, 50 percent of Republicans said the strength of his potential candidacy rested more on family connections than on his vision for the country or unique qualities; only one in five Democrats thought that was the case with Mrs. Clinton and the connection to her husband.\n\nThe view was even more widespread in New Hampshire, where two-thirds of general-election voters said Jeb Bush\u2019s candidacy would be based on his family connections.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150215165706, "twitter": {"description": "As a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, Mr. Bush\u2019s association with his brother George W.
