An indication of their turmoil was their announcement that they had reached their verdict Thursday afternoon but wanted to wait until Friday morning to read it because some of them were \u201cemotionally drained.\u201d\n\nThe concept of sending someone to his death is unfamiliar in Hawaii, where capital punishment was abolished in 1957, before the islands became a state. But this jury had to make that decision because Williams\u2019 crime occurred in military housing and he was tried in the federal court system, where the death penalty is available.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to obtain a death penalty in a state such as Hawaii where the people have not voted for the death penalty on a state level,\u201d said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cThis is a difficult crime, a child, but the death penalty is a huge step,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a punishment that for some states is outside of their standards.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright set an Oct. 14 hearing to formally sentence Williams.\n\nWilliams was bracing for the death penalty, his attorney John Philipsborn said. \u201cBoth of us were relieved,\u201d Philipsborn said. \u201cI think he was very grateful for the outcome.\u201d\n\nAfter the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Darren Ching, who handled the case, and Florence Nakakuni, the U.S. attorney for Hawaii, hugged outside the courtroom. Ching got a kiss from his wife.\n\n\u201cWe put forth the best case we had, and we respect the verdict,\u201d said Steve Mellin, trial attorney with the Justice Department\u2019s capital case section.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hawaii juror favored death for ex-soldier, 8-4", "title": "Hawaii juror favored death for ex-soldier, 8-4", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Hawaii juror favored death for ex-soldier, 8-4", "title": "Hawaii juror favored death for ex-soldier, 8-4", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/28/hawaii_juror_favored_death_for_ex_soldier_8_4/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/soldiers-daughter-killed.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hawaii juror favored death for ex-soldier, 8-4", "title": "Hawaii juror favored death for ex-soldier, 8-4", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/soldiers-daughter-killed.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jennifer Sinco Kelleher", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ll never get those autopsy pictures out of my mind.\u201dHe voted for the death penalty.\n\u201cIt is difficult to obtain a death penalty in a state such as Hawaii where the people have not voted for the death penalty on a state level,\u201d said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, D.C.\u201cThis is a difficult crime, a child, but the death penalty is a huge step,\u201d he said.\nWilliams was bracing for the death penalty, his attorney John Philipsborn said.\nBut this jury had to make that decision because Williams\u2019 crime occurred in military housing and he was tried in the federal court system, where the death penalty is available.\nBecause they couldn\u2019t agree, Naeem Williams will be sentenced to life in prison without possibility for release for the 2005 beating death of his daughter, Talia."}
