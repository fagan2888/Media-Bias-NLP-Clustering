Deadly protests erupted in Nepal\u2019s southern Terai region following the constitution\u2019s adoption, and more than 40 died in related violence.\n\nIndia argues that Nepal\u2019s new constitution needs to better represent its southern regions, which have close ethnic ties to India. Officials in Kathmandu and citizens across Nepal, meanwhile, accuse India of violating their country\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nNepal gets 60 percent of all imports and nearly all of its fuel from India. Consequently, wood is being used to cook food and heat homes throughout the country.\n\nWith winter setting in across the Himalayas, many remote villages without road access are in danger of not having enough fuel stockpiled before snow blocks routes accessible only by foot.\n\nIndia\u2019s unofficial trade blockade also has hampered Nepal\u2019s ongoing efforts to rebuild after two massive earthquakes in 2015. Without fuel, international aid can\u2019t be delivered to some of the most affected areas.\n\nAs evidenced by Friday\u2019s protests, the trade dispute has sparked anti-Indian sentiment across Nepal. It has spurred many to demand closer ties with Beijing and to call for the reopening of northern trade routes into China across the Himalayas, which were damaged in the earthquakes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "India is Nepal\u2019s No. 1 trading partner, but restricted the flow of transport trucks after Nepal adopted a new constitution in September.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "India is Nepal\u2019s No. 1 trading partner, but restricted the flow of transport trucks after Nepal adopted a new constitution in September.", "title": "India's Trade Blockade Sparks Protests in Kathmandu", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151120_NepalProtests_Peterson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-23T18:02:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1kL4jhJ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "India is Nepal\u2019s No. 1 trading partner, but restricted the flow of transport trucks after Nepal adopted a new constitution in September.", "title": "India's Trade Blockade Sparks Protests in Kathmandu", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151120_NepalProtests_Peterson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Asia", "published_time": "2015-11-23T17:36:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-23T18:02:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Nepal, India, Modi, Beijing, China, blockade, earthquake"}, "article_summary": "Deadly protests erupted in Nepal\u2019s southern Terai region following the constitution\u2019s adoption, and more than 40 died in related violence.\nKATHMANDU, Nepal\u2014Protesters here vented their frustration with India\u2019s ongoing trade blockade of Nepal, which has created a nationwide fuel and medicine shortage and slowed the country\u2019s economy to a standstill.\nIndia\u2019s unofficial trade blockade also has hampered Nepal\u2019s ongoing efforts to rebuild after two massive earthquakes in 2015.\nAs evidenced by Friday\u2019s protests, the trade dispute has sparked anti-Indian sentiment across Nepal.\nIt has spurred many to demand closer ties with Beijing and to call for the reopening of northern trade routes into China across the Himalayas, which were damaged in the earthquakes."}
