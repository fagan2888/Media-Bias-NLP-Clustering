The airline is considering hiring a contractor to fill roles in departments like bag handling and customer service to cut costs so that their airfare prices stay competitive, according to United spokesman Luke Punzenberger.\n\nThe airline met with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents the workers, to discuss the changes and it must have been messy.
