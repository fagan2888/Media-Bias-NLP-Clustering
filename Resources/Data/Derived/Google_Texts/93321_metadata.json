Vicki Marble, R-Fort Collins, is the lone sponsor of a so-called \u201cconstitutional carry\u201d bill that would allow \u201ca law-abiding person to carry a concealed handgun without a permit.\u201d\n\nMarble\u2019s Senate Bill 32, coupled with Senate Bill 86, which would repeal legislation requiring background checks on gun transfers, narrowly passed the Senate Judiciary Committee last Monday.\n\nIt is unlikely that the legislation seeking to loosen gun restrictions and expand gun rights will become law in the split legislature and with Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper wielding a veto pen. But the bill is worth reviewing nonetheless \u2014 in part because it\u2019s one of the few gun bills that isn\u2019t just a reaction to the laws passed in the 2013 session, and also because it represents a position of growing popularity in the gun-rights movement.\n\nMarble and other gun-rights supporters say at least five other states have enacted constitutional-carry laws without any problems. And while that may be true, Colorado\u2019s own concealed-carry laws also haven\u2019t been problematic. Nor have they been a significant impediment to people who seek a permit.\n\nCurrently, adults 21 or older who want to legally carry a concealed handgun must apply for a permit from their local sheriff\u2019s office, pay no more than $100, submit to fingerprint background checks and prove they have passed a handgun training course.\n\nMarble\u2019s legislation would do away with the safety course and the fingerprint background check.\n\nBut why lessen safety requirements and screening? Has anyone desiring a permit been unjustly burdened by such mandates?\n\nYes, the Second Amendment guarantees U.S. citizens a right to bear arms, but Colorado\u2019s law doesn\u2019t materially interfere with that right. It merely imposes a couple of minor but prudent safeguards to the entitlement.\n\nIn 2013, more than 50,000 concealed-weapons permits were issued or renewed with only a handful being denied for various reasons. Does that sound like Colorado has a broken system or one that is frustrating those who wish to carry a concealed weapon?\n\nTo us it sounds like a system that is pretty much operating as intended.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado\u2019s concealed-carry law ain\u2019t broke, so don\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d it", "title": "Colorado\u2019s concealed-carry law ain\u2019t broke, so don\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d it", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/06/colorados-concealed-carry-law-aint-broke-so-dont-fix-it/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150206__OP08CONCEALEDp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150206__OP08CONCEALEDp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-06T14:56:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:29:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ca4\"", "article_summary": "Yes, the Second Amendment guarantees U.S. citizens a right to bear arms, but Colorado\u2019s law doesn\u2019t materially interfere with that right.\nIt is unlikely that the legislation seeking to loosen gun restrictions and expand gun rights will become law in the split legislature and with Democratic Gov.\nDoes that sound like Colorado has a broken system or one that is frustrating those who wish to carry a concealed weapon?\nAnd while that may be true, Colorado\u2019s own concealed-carry laws also haven\u2019t been problematic.\nIn 2013, more than 50,000 concealed-weapons permits were issued or renewed with only a handful being denied for various reasons."}
