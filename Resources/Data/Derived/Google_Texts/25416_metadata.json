He should tell us how the coalition or NATO will forge a ground force capable of not just attempting to \u201ccontain\u201d ISIL within its interior lines in Iraq and Syria\u2014even as the group expands its reach into other countries\u2014but actually driving it from Raqqa. He should tell us the force structure and funding our commanders will need to rebuild so we can continue and expand this fight while facing other threats around the globe. And he should explain why he won\u2019t use the secure facility at Guantanamo Bay to safely hold and interrogate newly captured terrorists in order to help prevent the next plot against innocent Americans.\u201d\n\nGOP donors and the party\u2019s business-wing don\u2019t want immigration to become another casualty of immigrant jihadis. That\u2019s because immigration provides business with more than one million extra lower-wage customers and taxpayer-funded customers each year, which boost profits and stock values.\n\nIn 2013, Obama used his legal powers to up the annual immigration of new workers to 2.1 million, even as 4.4 million Americans turned 18. Unsurprisingly, the rush of new workers flatlined wages, boosted profits, and spiked Wall Street wealth.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan is following the same don\u2019t-mention-immigration course and is even deep-sixing the House\u2019s Nov. 19 vote passage of a bill to curb the inflow of Syrian refugees. Obama wants to bring in at least 10,000 more Muslim migrants from Syria in 2016.\n\nOn Dec. 3, Ryan embraced his inner progressive, downplayed the possibility of a jihad attack and described mass-shootings as an issue of \u201cmental health.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t help but watch this on TV and yell at the TV and say, \u2018What can we do to prevent this from happening?\u2019\u201d he said on CBS.\n\nThis particular shooting in San Bernardino\u2014there\u2019s just too much unknowns before we speculate about the origin of this one. But what we have seen\u2014and a common theme among many of these mass shootings\u2014is a theme of mental illness. And we need to fix our mental illness laws, our policies. They\u2019re outdated. And that is something that we are working on right now. We are moving a bill through the process here, the Murphy legislation, because we think that\u2019s one of the more consistent and common themes\u2014people with mental illness are getting guns and conducting these mass shootings.\n\nThat determination to avoid the issue of immigration is also why Ryan delegated the Speaker\u2019s Dec. 5 weekend speech to a deputy, who obligingly talked about the uncontroversial need to tighten oversight of visitors\u2014including Brits, Germans, and French\u2014who have visited areas near the Islamic State\u2019s mini-Caliphate in north-eastern Syria. The visa issue is so uncontroversial that even the Democrats are willing to help fix the problem.\n\n\u201cThe next terrorist to attack our country could be only one flight away. And that\u2019s why the House is preparing to act on legislation to prevent our enemies from entering this country through our visa-waiver program,\u201d said Rep. Candice Miller, the chairman of the House Administration Committee, which handles various lesser issues, such as funding the Capitol\u2019s operations.\n\nThroughout her speech, she did not talk at all about the House\u2019s lopsided Nov. 19 vote to curb Muslim refugees.\n\nHuge majorities of Americans strongly oppose the migration of Muslims to the United States. Muslim migrants tend to be unskilled, heavily reliant on taxpayer-funded welfare programs, reluctant to integrate into Americans society, are under intense internal pressure to preserve their own mix of religion, culture, and politics, relatively likely to join jihad groups\u201456 Muslims were indicted on jihad charges in the first 11 month of 2014, and to support pro-jihad political groups.\n\nYet the federal government is set to increase their population in the United States up to 6.2 million by 2030. For example, a record 680,000 migrants from Muslims countries were granted green cards from 2009 to 2013. Also, two million people from Muslim-majority countries were admitted to the United States since the jihad atrocity on 9/11/2001.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Government-approved immigrant jihadis have attacked and killed another 14 Americans, but GOP politicians are ignoring the obvious fix.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Government-approved immigrant jihadis have attacked and killed another 14 Americans, but GOP politicians are ignoring the obvious fix.", "title": "GOP Leaders Ignore Anti-Jihad Fixes Demanded By Voters", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Tashfeen-Malik-and-Syed-Farook-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-12-06T18:52:09-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/06/dont-mention-immigration-gop-leaders-ignore-anti-jihad-fixes-demanded-voters/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Government-approved immigrant jihadis have attacked and killed another 14 Americans, but GOP politicians are ignoring the obvious fix.", "title": "GOP Leaders Ignore Anti-Jihad Fixes Demanded By Voters", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Tashfeen-Malik-and-Syed-Farook-Getty.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "American jobs, Congress, foreign workers, Green Cards, Islamic, islamic extremism, law enforcement, migration, Mitch McConnell, mitch mocconnell, Muslim, Obama, paul rya, Paul Ryan, refugees, San Bernardino Attack, Syria, Syrian refugees, taxes, terrorism, U.S. Senate, Visas, welfare,Big Government, Immigration, Jihad,gop", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-12-06T16:49:37-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-12-06T18:52:09-07:00", "tag": "welfare", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,Jihad"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Yet the federal government is set to increase their population in the United States up to 6.2 million by 2030.\nAlso, two million people from Muslim-majority countries were admitted to the United States since the jihad atrocity on 9/11/2001.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERGovernment-approved immigrant jihadis have attacked and killed another 14 Americans, but GOP politicians are ignoring the obvious fix demanded by the American public\u2014reduce Islamic migration into the United States.\nIn 2013, Obama used his legal powers to up the annual immigration of new workers to 2.1 million, even as 4.4 million Americans turned 18.\nHuge majorities of Americans strongly oppose the migration of Muslims to the United States."}
