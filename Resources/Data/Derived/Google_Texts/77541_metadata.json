In fact, if one were to go by the leaks, which were first published by Politico, it appears that the offices of Boehner and Reid regularly coordinated to exempt Congress from the health care law.\n\nBut given that Boehner is now apparently against congressional Obamacare exemptions, the emails make him look inconsistent and hypocritical \u2013 which may have been the point of their leaking.\n\nThis \u201cis for [Boehner] & [Reid] to ask the President to carve us out of\u2026Obamacare\u201d Share:\n\nFrom Politico:\n\n[B]ehind-the-scenes, Boehner and his aides worked for months with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), and others, to save these very same, long-standing [congressional Obamacare] subsidies, according to documents and e-mails provided to POLITICO. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was also aware of these discussions, the documents show.\n\nOne email even appears to show that Boehner\u2019s office discussed how it would disguise a planned meeting on the subject with President Barack Obama as a meeting on immigration reform, National Review Online reported.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let it get out there that this is for [Boehner] and [Reid] to ask the President to carve us out of the requirement of Obamacare,\u201d Boehner chief of staff Mike Sommers wrote on July 17.\n\n\u201cThis is a little bit more difficult because it isn\u2019t a routing meeting because [House Minority Leader Nancy] Pelosi and [Senate Minority Leader Mitch] McConnell won\u2019t be there,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am even ok if it is the President hauling us down to talk about the next steps on immigration.\u201d\n\nRepublicans said the leaked emails completely mischaracterize the speaker\u2019s actions.\n\nA \u201csenior lawmaker\u201d told National Review Online that Boehner was the one who came up with the idea of using the Obamacare Hill exemption as an issue in the House\u2019s budget battle with the Senate and the White House.\n\n\u201cThe only memory I have of him talking about this is about how we could screw them with it,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nThe email leak has obviously complicated the \u201chigh-stakes\u201d negotiations between senior Democrat and Republican lawmakers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it before. I don\u2019t know how David thinks anyone on either side of the aisle will ever be able to work with him again. I guess this is part of Harry Reid\u2019s plan: He refuses to talk with Republicans so I guess his chief of staff figures he doesn\u2019t need to be able to do so either,\u201d a GOP aide told National Review Online.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a low-rent, self-dealing bagman,\u201d another aide said.\n\nIn a statement to National Review Online, Krone defended himself: \u201cEvery time one of these anonymous Republican aides takes a look at their paycheck, I hope they remember it was Harry Reid who protected their employer contribution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey and their bosses are welcome to return it if they\u2019re so outraged. I took the action I did because I refuse to stand by and watch those who pressed for this ruling turn around and attack the very thing they asked for, simply because they don\u2019t have the courage to stand up to a few whiners in their caucus. Integrity means owning in public what you advocate for in private,\u201d Krone said.\n\nTheBlaze reported in April that Congress was trying to figure out how to approach the provision of the Affordable Care Act, which was proposed by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) during the 2010 debate over Obamacare, that would force members of Congress and their aides into the law\u2019s health exchanges.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Ezra Klein noted: \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that the federal government has the authority to pay for congressional staffers on the exchanges, the way it pays for them now in the federal benefits program.\u201d\n\nOh, that meeting with the president Sommers discussed in an email? It never happened.\n\nThe latest news on Congressman Boehner calls to mind earlier allegations that he advised the White House in September on how to win Republican votes for U.S. military action in Syria.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nFeatured image Getty Images.
