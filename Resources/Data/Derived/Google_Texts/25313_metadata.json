After the war, he came home to serve in many roles including president of Texas A&M University.\n\n/ Download\n\nWikipedia\n\nJames Earl Rudder\n\nMay 6, 1910\u2013 March 23, 1970\n\nThe German army considered Pointe du Hoc a perfect spot for defending the coast of France from Allied forces during World War II. From a top its hundred-foot cliffs, German guns could reach both Omaha Beach and Utah Beach. The Germans thought their position was secure. And it was \u2014 until June 1944, when Texan James Earl Rudder and his 2nd Ranger Battalion began to climb those cliffs.\n\nCourtesy of Cushing Memorial Library\n\nRudder graduated from Texas A&M University in 1932 and was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the Army reserves. He taught high school and college \u2026 and coached football until he was called to active duty in 1941. He trained U.S. Army Rangers for one of D-Day\u2019s most dangerous operations: taking Pointe du Hoc.\n\nDuring the assault, over half of Rudder\u2019s men were killed or wounded and Rudder himself was shot in the leg. But the high ground was seized and the German guns were silenced.\n\nAfter the war, Rudder continued to take on tough challenges. As president of Texas A & M, he supported optional membership in the Corps of Cadets and he helped open the university to women, despite great opposition.\n\nWhen he died in 1970, Rudder was celebrated for his courageous leadership in both war and peace. An inscription on Rudder Tower, located on the A&M campus, remembers Rudder\u2019s \u201cuncommon ability to inspire men and lead them to exceptional achievement.\u201d\n\nFor More about James Earl Rudder\n\nIn June 2011, Humanities Texas published an excerpt from Thomas M. Hatfield\u2019s 2011 book Rudder: From Leader to Legend in our monthly e-newsletter. The excerpt details the Second Ranger Battalion\u2019s first night on Pointe du Hoc.\n\nThe James Earl Rudder Collection, 1918\u20132001, is held by Texas A&M University\u2019s Cushing Library. The collection includes materials from Rudder\u2019s time in the service during World War II, clippings from newspapers, posters, magazine issues, memorabilia, and Rudder\u2019s awards.\n\n\n\nRudder\u2019s statue on the Texas A&M University campus in College Station, Texas.\n\nIn recognition of the significance of Rudder\u2019s tenure as president of Texas A&M University, the university erected a sculpture of Rudder in 1993. The statue, which was designed by Lawrence M. Ludtke, was originally located in front of Bizzell Hall, but was moved in 2009 to stand at the south end of Military Walk.\n\nSelected Bibliography\n\nAmbrose, Stephen.
