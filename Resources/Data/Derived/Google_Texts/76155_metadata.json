What followed was bipartisan disdain for the former hedge-fund manager. Donald Trump remarked that Shkreli looked like a \u201cspoiled brat,\u201d while Hillary Clinton said that if he was going to try to gouge American families \u201cfor no good reason\u201d \u2014 as if there is any good reason \u2014 then she was going to hold him \u201caccountable.\u201d\n\nA few months later, after Shkreli had been indicted for securities fraud, the most hated man in America was called to appear before the most hated institution in America. Both Republican and Democratic members of Congress scolded the former executive, who invoked the fifth amendment throughout with a smirk, and later tweeted that he couldn\u2019t believe \u201cthese imbeciles\u201d represented the American people (a slight that would have sounded quite reasonable coming from anyone other than Martin Shkreli).\n\nIt was a political exhibition, put on by self-absorbed politicians hoping to score points by assailing the number-one villain of the year. Of course, watching members of Congress \u2014 Republic members, no less \u2014 feign outrage at such callous greed is kind of like watching Donald Trump acting surprised that his rallies have become violent. Shkreli, while no doubt deserving of the scorn he has received over the past few months, is just a minor-league player in the big con that it is modern American medicine \u2014 a con that politicians in Washington has long served obediently.\n\nOf all the industries in America, the one that Shkreli represents spends by far the most on political lobbying \u2014 more than $3 billion between 1998 and 2015 \u2014 and also tends to be the most profitable. These distinctions are hardly coincidental. In 2015 alone, the pharmaceutical industry spent nearly a quarter billion dollars on lobbying \u2014 with the insurance industry coming in a distant second; during this same period, drug prices in America increased by about 10 percent.\n\nOf course, drugs are already two-to-six times more expensive in the United States than elsewhere around the world, where prices are directly or indirectly controlled.\n\nWhen Shkreli defended his price gouging by claiming it was for \u201cresearch and development,\u201d he was simply repeating the traditional Big Pharma excuse for its exorbitant profiteering. While the process of drug development is unquestionably expensive and risky, the majority of companies tend to spend considerably more of their profits on marketing and advertising than research. In 2013, the biggest spender, Johnson & Johnson, spent $17.5 billion on marketing, compared to $8.2 billion on R&D.\n\nNow, it is easy to blame the greed of one person, such as Martin Shkreli, or even one industry for the massive costs of healthcare in America, which remains one of the unhealthiest country\u2019s in the developed world. People need a villain to point a finger at. Unfortunately, the real villain isn\u2019t something or someone you can point your finger at; it\u2019s not an executive or a corporation, but the very system that modern medicine has been founded on, where public health and welfare is subordinated to the cause of making of money.\n\nAs with the American economy at large \u2014 best described as corporate capitalism \u2014 healthcare is considered a commodity rather than a public good, which consequently leads to sickness being treated solely as a source of profit by various industries. Big players in this profit-obsessed social order do not want a healthier society, but one full of hyper-consumers who have been convinced that a pill \u2014 rather than diet, exercise, therapy, or any kind of lifestyle change \u2014 can solve every perceivable health problem, whether real or, especially now, imagined, thanks to a steady diet of pharmaceutical fear mongering.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After several months where Martin Shkreli and healthcare reform were hot topics, the issue has receded from view", "author": "Conor Lynch", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After several months where Martin Shkreli and healthcare reform were hot topics, the issue has receded from view", "title": "America\u2019s broken healthcare has fallen off the radar.
