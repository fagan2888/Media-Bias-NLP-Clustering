I have followed enough bills and acts (a lot of acting going on in D.C.) to know that their titles are usually the opposite of what will result. ie: \u201cThe Affordable Care Act\u201d, \u201cthe Patriot Act\u201d, ETC. HR5 is on a fast track vote for Thursday, Feb. 26th. That is another red flag considering the bill is over 600 pages long. Is this another one of those \u201cwe have to pass it to see what\u2019s in it\u201d circumstances? That didn\u2019t work out well the last time. Not for the American people anyways.\n\nSo I decided to take a deeper look into HR 5. The CBO has information on their website that gives some detail about the bill. However, I wanted more detailed explanations for what it actually means for regular folks. Below you will find the CBO info and also information from https://whatiscommoncore.wordpress.com that breaks it down by page number.\n\n\u201cStudent Success Act\u201d to Crush Religious Freedom, Private School Autonomy, Parental Rights: #NO on HR5 This one is such a betrayal. I\u2019ve never been so shocked and angry over a proposed Congressional bill that I burst into tears. Not until tonight. I\u2019d been quietly reading and taking notes on H.R. 5, \u201cStudent Success Act\u201d (SSA) when my husband simply, offhandedly asked me how I was doing. Though I\u2019d been quiet, I was boiling over as I read tucked-away portions of this 600+ page bill which, despite the local-control-touting, anti-Common Core-sounding words (on page 10 and elsewhere), is terrible. When my husband asked how I was doing, I stood up, walked to the couch and explained through my hot, angry tears what destruction and reduction of vital freedoms will take place if this bill passes: It ends private schools\u2019 religious freedomfrom government control. Itharms funding freedom in private schools. Itputs into question parental rights and control over education. It pushes sameness of testing. Those are just a few things. There are more. We have conscious deceivers in D.C. pushing this bill: its damages are so painfully ironic. The bill is touted specifically to \u201creduce the federal footprint and restore local control while empowering parents\u201c. What a poignant lie. If H.R. 5 passes this week, in exchange for billions in federal funding, we will be crushed in the following ways. The federal Department of Education aims to take over: STATE AUTHORITIES AND RIGHTS PARENTAL RIGHTS TO DIRECT EDUCATION OF A CHILD RELIGIOUS FREEDOM \u2013 NO MORE RELIGIOUS COUNSELING, MENTORING OR TECHNOLOGIES ALLOWED IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS PRIVATE SCHOOL AUTONOMY: GOVERNMENT-APPOINTED OMBUDSMEN WILL MONITOR COMPLIANCE PRIVATE SCHOOL FUNDING \u2013 PRIVATE SCHOOLS MUST CONSULT WITH PUBLIC DISTRICTS WHICH ENFORCE EQUALITY H.R. 5 the \u201cStudent Success Act\u201d won\u2019t be enforced for five years\u2013 plenty of time for its promoters to plan implementation, and for the opposition to burn out, give up, to feel there\u2019s no way to rein it in. The bill is 600-plus-pages long but was just barely introduced this month; and it\u2019s being fast-tracked for a vote thisweek. Those whose lives will be changed by it have likely never heard of it and elected reps haven\u2019t had time to debate intended and unintended consequences. Would our representatives vote to pass this bill if they knew that it included such hidden away, serious damages to Americans\u2019 freedoms? If you read no further, here\u2019s the bottom line: H.R. 5 is not a viable alternative to the terrible \u201cEvery Child Ready for College and Career\u201d bill. Please call reps and senators: Vote NO on H.R. 5, the Student Success Act.\n\nIf you would like to track the bill visit: https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5/text\n\nThere are 11 cosponsors of HR5. There are 10 Republican cosponsors and only one Democrat. They are listed on https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5/cosponsors .\n\nThe group \u201cStop Common Core in Louisiana\u201d posted on their facebook page for people to call Rep Scalise and ask him to vote no on HR5. One of their reasons being that\n\n\u201cIf you reference nothing else in the bill when calling make sure to reference Page 552-553 in which it clearly states if a State participates in federal funding grants and programs by vote of the legislature (which includes approval of federal money in the state budget) the state waives its rights and gives full authority to the federal government.\u201d\n\nAccording to RedState.com:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Hayride", "description": "When I read the title of HR5, \u201cStudent Success Act\u201d, something just rubbed me the wrong way.
