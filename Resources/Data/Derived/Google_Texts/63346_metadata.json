Kerry, has acknowledged as much, according to two U.S. senators who spoke with him Sunday, John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.).\n\nKerry said that the Geneva negotiating process hasn\u2019t delivered, they said, and that new approaches are needed.\n\n\u201cHe acknowledged that the chemical weapons [removal] is being slow-rolled, the Russians continue to supply arms, [and] we are at a point now where we are going to have to change our strategy,\u201d Graham said.\n\nThe secretary spoke favorably about arming and training the rebels, Graham added.\n\n1 of 8 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 What Obama didn\u2019t know View Photos The many controversies that the White House says the president was kept in the dark about.

Thousands who had bought insurance have been receiving cancellations notices from insurers. The president said he wasn\u2019t aware his promise before the rollout would result in cancellations, and Obama had repeatedly stated that, although new health-care insurance would be available through the Affordable Care Act, those willing to stay on their plan would be able to do so.In fact, that wasn\u2019t the case.

Presented with a summary of Kerry\u2019s reported statements to them and about a dozen other members of Congress, Kerry\u2019s spokeswoman, Jennifer Psaki, called it a \u201cmischaracterization.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one in this administration thinks we\u2019re doing enough until the humanitarian crisis has been solved and the civil war ended,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is no different from the message Secretary Kerry conveyed during the private meeting.\u201d\n\nPsaki, who attended the meeting, said Kerry did not raise the prospect of lethal assistance for the rebels. \u201cThis is a case of members projecting what they want to hear and not stating the accurate facts of what was discussed,\u201d she said.\n\nIn fact, more than a year ago Kerry openly advocated changing the dynamics in Syria so that dictator Bashar al-Assad would have an incentive to negotiate. But the White House vetoed any serious training or arming of the rebels. That left Kerry beseeching Russia to persuade Assad to make concessions even as the dictator was gaining on the battlefield. Not surprisingly, that hasn\u2019t worked.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t achieved anything,\u201d U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi reported over the weekend to the Munich security conference, which Kerry and the members of Congress also attended. \u201cIn Homs [where civilians have been cut off from any aid] we haven\u2019t been able to do anything. And about prisoners, disappeared people, kidnapped people, again we haven\u2019t achieved anything.\u201d\n\nThe result: Syria has become \u201cthe worst humanitarian crisis at least since the Rwanda genocide,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, chief of the U.N. refu\u00adgee agency, told the conference.\n\nMore than 100,000 people have been killed. Nine million Syrians \u2014 more than a third of the country \u2014 have been forced from their homes. Assad is blocking aid and deliberately starving hundreds of thousands of his countrymen.\n\n1 of 86 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Tom Toles goes global View Photos A collection of cartoons about international news.

Last week, in Senate testimony that got less attention than it deserved, Obama\u2019s director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said Syria \u201cis becoming a center of radical extremism and a potential threat to the homeland.\u201d\n\nHavens in Syria, in other words, could play the same role that Afghan refuges offered al-Qaeda before 9/11. As the West cold-shouldered moderate and secular forces, extremist ranks have swelled in Syria to as many as 26,000, including 7,000 foreigners, Clapper said.\n\nIt was that testimony that prompted McCain and Graham to talk to me and two other journalists, Jeffrey Goldberg of Bloomberg View and Josh Rogin of the Daily Beast, about Kerry\u2019s remarks, as we flew back from Munich. The senators hope that the assessment of a growing direct threat, along with stark evidence of organized torture, could impel a shift in direction.\n\n\u201cOur director of national intelligence said that these people in Syria are planning attacks against the United States,\u201d McCain said. \u201cKerry confirmed that. . . . Maybe those two disturbing facts about the results of the war in Syria could maybe help them think they ought to change their policy.\u201d\n\nThe two senators don\u2019t agree on what that change should be. Neither favors sending U.S. troops. Graham wants to see U.S. drones attacking al-Qaeda havens. McCain would rather help establish a safe zone in which to train the Free Syrian Army and care for refugees, protected by Patriot missiles based in Turkey.\n\nA third route would be for the administration to put U.S. muscle behind a U.N. demand that Assad at least permit food and blankets to reach starving, freezing families.\n\nCan Kerry bring his boss around to a more activist policy? Obama has doubted that the United States could intervene in such a messy conflict without making things worse. He reportedly worries that even a limited commitment would inexorably suck the nation into something deeper. There certainly is no public clamor to intervene.\n\nOn the other hand, even as he has pulled back from Iraq and Afghanistan, Obama has proclaimed the war against al-Qaeda a national security imperative.\n\n\u201cSo to me,\u201d Graham said, \u201cit\u2019s a choice of, do we hit them after they hit us, or do we hit them before they hit us?\u201d\n\nRead more from Fred Hiatt\u2019s
