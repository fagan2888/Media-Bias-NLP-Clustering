And voters deserve to know exactly what those policies have accomplished for our country as they head to the polls.\n\nThe results are stunning.\n\n1. Soaring debt: The national debt has nearly doubled since President Obama\u2019s election. Today it stands at 74 percent of the economy, slowing economic growth and threatening our national security. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), \u201cThe large amount of debt could also compromise national security by constraining defense spending in times of international crisis or by limiting the country\u2019s ability to prepare for such a crisis.\u201d\n\n2. Skyrocketing mandatory spending: CBO projects that mandatory spending and interest on the debt is projected to consume 94% of all federal revenues 10 years from now, squeezing out funding for other priorities like education, health research, defense, and infrastructure.\n\n3. Struggling workforce: Since 2009, the percentage of working-age Americans who are not in the labor force has reached near-record levels. During that time, the number of adults outside the labor force has increased by 12 million. There are fewer full-time jobs in America than when the recession started. Nearly 29 million of the 124.5 million Americans in prime working years \u2013 ages 25-54 \u2013 are currently without a job.\n\n4. Stagnant incomes: Unfortunately, most American workers have not seen their incomes increase. Between August 2013 and August 2014, real average hourly earnings increased only 0.4 percent, failing even to keep up with inflation.\n\n5. Social Security bankruptcy: CBO projects that Social Security will go bankrupt in 2032, a year earlier than the Social Security Trustees predicted last year. The Disability Insurance Trust Fund is in the direst condition, as CBO expects it to be bankrupt as early as October 2016.\n\nToday, we live in a country where middle class income is falling, too many Americans of retirement age are working to pay bills, and a large number of trained workers are unable to find jobs that match their skills. Nearly a third of those between the ages of 18 and 34 are still living with their parents. And the average American citizen is more likely to be receiving a disability check than working in a manufacturing job.\n\nIn President Obama\u2019s own words, these are the policies on the ballot this November. For six years, our country has tried the president\u2019s approach, and it has not worked.\n\nAmerica\u2019s road back to prosperity requires a change of policy. Republicans are committed to working on bipartisan solutions to spur job creation and economic growth, including increasing exports, reforming our broken tax system, reducing the deficit and unlocking domestic energy resources.\n\nWith the right agenda, our economy will grow and American workers will flourish. My hope is that we start down that path on Tuesday.\n\nRepublican Dan Coats represents Indiana in the U.S. Senate.
