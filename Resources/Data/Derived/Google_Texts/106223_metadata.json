Talk to your doctor about non-hormonal prescription options. #DrSimonSays pic.twitter.com/FP5mAiT20J \u2014 James A. Simon MD (@JamesASimonMD) September 9, 2015\n\nDoctors tweeting doesn\u2019t sound like a particularly big issue, or even a thing \u2014 shouldn\u2019t they be, like, operating? \u2014 and normally, it isn\u2019t. But, like the rest of the internet, Doctor Twitter is becoming overrun with sponsored content \u2014 and an investigation by Stat News has found multiple doctors who regularly tweet (or otherwise post to social media) promoting products made by companies who pay them often tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars for \u201cconsulting\u201d and never disclose that fact in or immediately following the endorsement.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no obligation for doctors to disclose previous payments from these companies on social media, a provision of the Affordable Care Act requires doctors to disclose payments from drug and medical companies to the Department of Health and Human Services, which posts those on a public website. Multiple studies have shown the detrimental effects of \u201cconsulting\u201d money from such companies on doctors, though the doctors identified with Stat all either saw no issue with it or didn\u2019t respond. According to a user-friendly, non-governmental database of the Health and Human Services filings created by ProPublica, 1,630 companies paid out over $3.5 billion between August 2013 and December 2014 to some 681,000 doctors nationwide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become very unwieldy and problematic and it\u2019s ridiculous for a tweet,\u201d James Simon, a D.C. gynecologist who regularly tweets enthusiastically about Addyi, which you might know better as the \u201cfemale Viagra,\u201d told Stat. Simon has received nearly $500,000 from medical companies between August 2013 and December 2014, the months the data are currently available for, and worked as a consultant on developing Addyi for Sprout Pharmaceuticals for an undisclosed sum. Addyi debuted in June to disappointing results; women who use it are reporting, on average, half of one more sexually satisfying encounter per month.\n\nHas the @US_FDA has gone beyond it's role here ? Denies #Zetia indication to reduce heart disease risk + #statin. https://t.co/itABas9cWx \u2014 Dr. James Underberg (@lipiddoc) December 15, 2015\n\nStat also found that Dr. James Underberg, a clinical assistant professor at New York University\u2019s Langone Medical Center, has tweeted in promotion of Zetia, a cholesterol-lowering drug that paid him nearly $40,000 between 2013 and 2014 in promotional-speaking fees. Underberg told Stat, \u201cI applaud the state of Massachusetts. It\u2019s not an unreasonable request. If New York made such a rule, I\u2019d comply with it.\u201d The Medical Center did not respond to a request for comment by press time. In a statement, the Medical Center said, \u201cNYU Langone requires all compensated faculty to disclose their payments from outside activities and to disclose those interests in academic publications and educational lectures, where appropriate. While our policy does not require its physicians to disclose payments from outside activities online or in social media specifically, it is the expectation that faculty will disclose their industry relationships when appropriate. We are currently reviewing our policies as they relate to social media.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "description": "Like the rest of the internet, Doctor Twitter is becoming overrun with\u00a0sponsored content.", "application-name": "Select All", "og": {"url": "http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/03/doctors-drug-tweets-may-be-sponsored.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "Select All", "description": "Like the rest of the internet, Doctor Twitter is becoming overrun with\u00a0sponsored content.", "title": "Some Doctors Tweeting About Drugs Aren\u2019t Disclosing Payments"}, "twitter": {"description": "Like the rest of the internet, Doctor Twitter is becoming overrun with\u00a0sponsored content.", "site": "@selectall", "title": "Some Doctors Tweeting About Drugs Aren\u2019t Disclosing Payments"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Select All", "fb": {"app_id": 10153686558514826}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/selectall/icon.144x144.png", "keywords": "social media, twitter, doctors", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/selectall", "tag": "social media, twitter, doctors"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "news_keywords": "social media, twitter, doctors"}, "article_summary": "We are currently reviewing our policies as they relate to social media.\u201d\nWhile our policy does not require its physicians to disclose payments from outside activities online or in social media specifically, it is the expectation that faculty will disclose their industry relationships when appropriate.\nWhile there\u2019s no obligation for doctors to disclose previous payments from these companies on social media, a provision of the Affordable Care Act requires doctors to disclose payments from drug and medical companies to the Department of Health and Human Services, which posts those on a public website.\nMultiple studies have shown the detrimental effects of \u201cconsulting\u201d money from such companies on doctors, though the doctors identified with Stat all either saw no issue with it or didn\u2019t respond.\n#DrSimonSays pic.twitter.com/FP5mAiT20J \u2014 James A.
