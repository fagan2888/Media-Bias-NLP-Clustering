LITTLE ROCK — As Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, talked with reporters on one side of his brightly painted tour bus, a growing crescendo of voices chanting, “Ted! Ted! Ted! Ted!” nearly drowned out the voice of the junior senator from Texas during a Wednesday morning stop in Little Rock as his presidential campaign made a swing through Arkansas.

Jammed into the parking lot of the Republican Party of Arkansas’ Sixth Street headquarters, two blocks east of the State Capitol Building, a large crowd was gathered, waving signs, cheering and waiting for the 44-year-old tea party favorite to step up on the flatbed trailer set up as a stage and grab the microphone to kick off his latest stop on his “Re-Igniting America” tour.

“God bless the great state of Arkansas!” Cruz began, after his introduction by Rep. Bob Ballinger, R-Hindsville, co-chair of Cruz’s Arkansas campaign.

He then quickly launched into a riff of politically-themed barbs aimed at Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, which drew laughter and shouts from the crowd, moving on to a series of talking points that had people cheering and pumping campaign signs in the air.

Among those points, Cruz said, if elected, that he will have the Justice Department open an investigation into the activities of Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit women’s health organization, to disband the Department of Education, discontinue Common Core, do away with the Internal Revenue Service, repeal the Affordable Care Act and dismantle the Iran Nuclear Accord.

Additionally, he thundered, “I will instruct the Department of Justice, the IRS, and every other federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today!” which prompted loud cheers and applause.

Following his stop in Little Rock, Cruz continued on to stops in Russellville for a public meet and greet, then on to Van Buren, where he was keynote speaker at the Lincoln Day Dinner.
