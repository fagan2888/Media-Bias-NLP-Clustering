Despite a lengthy hiatus, his forays into acting, and his transition into his 30\u2019s, JT proved that he can still deliver the goods and that he still has an audience. His album sold 2.43 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan, making it the biggest hit of the year. But on the other, the sales figure represents the lowest total a year-end chart topper has had since Nielsen began reporting these retail numbers in 1991. And Timberlake\u2019s was the only album to break the 2 million mark in 2013.\n\nFor point of reference, the previous year\u2019s chart topper, Adele\u2019s \u201c21,\u201d sold 4.41 million copies. (And should you need further proof that the creative juices are running dry, \u201c21\u201d was also the biggest selling album of 2011 with 5.82 million copies sold.)\n\nThe overall sales record further paints a picture of a culture whose relationship to music is changing. Total album sales dropped 8 percent, from 316 million to 289.4 million. Even digital downloads experienced a decline in sales for the first time.\n\nAnd that overall picture would have been even worse without the late and unexpected arrival of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s self-titled album. The album, which has topped the Billboard 200 for three straight weeks, sold 1.3 million copies in the last 17 days of 2013 and proved that there is still a little muscle in star power. But even this silver lining comes attached to a gray cloud.\n\nAccording to Musicmetric, \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u201d was shared over 240,000 times via Bit Torrent in its first week, resulting an estimated loss of around $3 million. Additionally, the interest in her back catalog resulted in her entire discography being shared via Bit Torrent more than 2 million times in 2013.\n\nAll of this reinforces the bigger picture of a music audience that has been asking the same question for nearly two decades: \u201cWhy should we pay inflated prices for music when there are so many ways to get it for free?\u201d\n\nThe biggest problem is that the music industry has been issuing the same answer for those two decades: \u201cWe don\u2019t know, buy more CDs!\u201d\n\nTop 10 Albums of 2013 (By Sales) Album Artist Sales The 20/20 Experience Justin Timberlake 2.43 million The Marshall Mathers LP 2 Eminem 1.73 million Crash My Party Luke Bryan 1.52 million Night Visions Imagine Dragons 1.4 million Unorthodox Jukebox Bruno Mars 1.4 million Here's to the Good Times Florida Georgia Line 1.35 million Nothing was the Same Drake 1.34 million Beyonce Beyonce 1.3 million Based on a True Story...
