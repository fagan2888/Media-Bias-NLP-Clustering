A lightning strike along with heavy winds took a heavy toll on a Geary County apartment complex Saturday.

Geary County Emergency Services say lightning struck a Grandview Plaza apartment complex at 5:23 pm Saturday. The 36-unit complex was quickly evacuated.

Crews located a fire on the east side roof. Firefighters from both Junction City and Riley County battled the blaze, but 30 mile per hour winds caused the fire to spread.

The fire was brought under control around 11 p.m.

A drone from Dickinson County Fire District 1 was used for aerial video and determined the cause of the fire was due to the lightning strike.

Damages are estimated to be over one million dollars. No injuries were reported.
