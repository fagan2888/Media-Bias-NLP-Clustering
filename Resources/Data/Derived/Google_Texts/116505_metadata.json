The interview will be broadcast on the Spanish-language radio station El Sembrador. CONTRIBUTED IMAGE Related article \u00bb\n\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino is urging parishioners without health insurance to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA letter Bishop Gerald Barnes wrote on the topic is to be read during all Masses this weekend at the 91 parishes in Riverside and San Bernardino counties.\n\nThe bishop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s message comes days after Catholic organizations filed a lawsuit challenging the law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requirement that insurance policies have birth-control coverage. Dozens of businesses and other religious groups have filed similar suits.\n\nBarnes is worried that the Catholic Church\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vocal opposition to the parts of the law that deal with coverage of contraception and abortion services led some Catholics to believe the church opposes the entire Affordable Care Act, said John Andrews, a spokesman for the diocese, which covers Riverside and San Bernardino counties and 1.6 million Catholics.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese factors do not mean that we, as Catholics, should disobey the new health care law,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Barnes said in the letter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we happen to have an insurance plan that includes services that are objectionable to our faith, which most plans in California do, our response is to not utilize these services. We do this through an informed conscience and reflection on the teachings of our Church about the value and dignity of every human life and God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan for creation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBarnes is very concerned that many without health insurance \u00e2\u0080\" especially Latinos \u00e2\u0080\" are not signing up for Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Andrews said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is an opportunity for a lot of families who haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had health insurance before to get it, and the church is all for that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Andrews said.\n\nThe deadline to sign up for coverage for this year is March 31.\n\nAt least one other Catholic diocese in California, Fresno, has sent parishes materials on Obamacare enrollment and clarifications of the church\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position on health-care coverage, said Steve Pehanich, director of advocacy for the California Catholic Conference, which represents the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 12 dioceses. Pehanich said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not aware of another California bishop who has had the message delivered during Mass.\n\nCatholic leaders have conflicting views about the Affordable Care Act, which aims to provide health-care coverage \u00e2\u0080\" much of it government-subsidized \u00e2\u0080\" to millions of uninsured Americans.\n\nThe church has long supported access to medical care as a human right and a matter of basic dignity. But the church also teaches that contraception and abortion are sins.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act mandates that insurance policies cover contraception, including intrauterine devices and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmorning-after pill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which some people view as akin to abortion because it can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus.\n\nThere are some accommodations and exemptions for religious organizations, but the church contends they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t broad enough.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled March 25 to hear two lawsuits challenging the birth-control coverage mandate. Both were filed by businesses whose owners \u00e2\u0080\" evangelical Christians in one case, Mennonites in another \u00e2\u0080\" have religious objections.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act does not mandate coverage of abortion. But in about half the states, women can pay out of their own pockets for abortion coverage under insurance plans they buy on government insurance marketplaces.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "DAVID OLSON", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/n3gxmt-rcatholichealth0314abinary1519039.jpg", "content_section": "traffic", "content_title": "OBAMACARE: Bishop Barnes urges Catholics to sign up", "author": "DAVID OLSON", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "News: OBAMACARE: Bishop Barnes urges Catholics to sign up | care, insurance, coverage, health, california, catholic, affordable, act, church, people", "title": "OBAMACARE: Bishop Barnes urges Catholics to sign up", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/n3gxmt-rcatholichealth0314abinary1519039.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/care-689272-insurance-coverage.html", "type": "article"}, "section": "traffic", "sailthru.date": "2014-03-14 15:59:05", "content_author": "DAVID OLSON", "sailthru.title": "OBAMACARE: Bishop Barnes urges Catholics to sign up", "sailthru.tags": "traffic, care, insurance, coverage, health, california, catholic, affordable, act, church, people", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/n3gxmt-rcatholichealth0314abinary1519039.jpg", "content_type": "article", "Keywords": "care, insurance, coverage, health, california, catholic, affordable, act, church, people", "publication_date": "2014-03-14", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/n3gxmt-rcatholichealth0314abinary1519039.jpg", "Description": "News: OBAMACARE: Bishop Barnes urges Catholics to sign up | care, insurance, coverage, health, california, catholic, affordable, act, church, people"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3382\"", "article_summary": "OBAMACARE: Bishop Barnes urges Catholics to sign up Share Pin It 1 of 2 More Galleries Bishop Gerald Barnes does an interview with Petra Alexander, director of Hispanic Affairs for the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino, about the Affordable Care Act.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese factors do not mean that we, as Catholics, should disobey the new health care law,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Barnes said in the letter.\nCONTRIBUTED IMAGE Related article \u00bbThe Roman Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino is urging parishioners without health insurance to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Affordable Care Act does not mandate coverage of abortion.\nBut in about half the states, women can pay out of their own pockets for abortion coverage under insurance plans they buy on government insurance marketplaces."}
