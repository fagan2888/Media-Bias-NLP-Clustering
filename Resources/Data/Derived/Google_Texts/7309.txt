Carlee Soto, little sister of a teacher who died protecting her students in the Newtown school shooting, said she believes the country will pass stricter gun control measures in the future, even though nothing has been done in the year since the shooting.

“It was extremely hard to watch these members of Congress come in and vote no on something so sensible. It’s a background check,” she said on “Fox News Sunday” with Chris Wallace. “I believe that we will have sensible gun laws in the future.”

Vigils and memorials around the country remembered the one-year anniversary of the Dec. 14 shooting that left 26 people, including Miss Soto’s sister Vicki, dead.

“One year later, to me, it’s just another day without my older sister by my side,” Miss Soto said.

Miss Soto has become an advocate for gun control in the wake of the shooting. While she said there are days she doesn’t want to go on camera or address people, she continues to speak out for those who have suffered from gun violence.

“There are so many people who can’t be advocates for this, and I know I can,” she said.
