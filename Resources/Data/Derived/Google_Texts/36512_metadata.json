Maybe stifling auto lending qualifies.\n\nGains in the housing and auto industries have been among the few economic bright spots during the Obama presidency. The Fed\u2019s quantitative easing and consequent low interest rates have led to rising home prices and robust car sales \u2013 both important to the economic recovery. Now these industries are at risk, critics say, thanks to a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nRelated: Rapid Growth of U.S. Mortgage Lenders Draws Scrutiny\n\nIn December, as it was sharpening its teeth, the CFPB demanded $98 million from Ally Financial in settling charges that it had discriminated against minority customers. Ally, one of the largest indirect auto lenders in the country, agreed to the payment since it was eager to gain special status allowing it to borrow from the Federal Reserve, and because management wanted the government to go ahead with selling a large holding of Ally stock acquired during the financial crisis.\n\nNote that Ally collects no information about the race of the customers who apply for a loan, making it unlikely that the company engaged in any sort of purposeful discrimination. No matter. The CFPB claimed that computer models could determine that minority buyers (African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians and Pacific Islanders) paid higher rates, but submitted no data to make that case.\n\nIf this sounds preposterous, it is. It was, to all appearances, a successful shakedown \u2013 perpetrated by a new federal agency keen to be taken seriously. Richard Cordray, CFPB czar, celebrated this first major \u201cwin\u201d in prepared remarks which described the settlement as the largest auto loan discrimination case ever. He claimed that because Ally and the auto dealers with which it works share interest charges above a certain set amount, they have an incentive \u201cfor interest rates to be marked up to consumers.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThese incentives have unjustly hurt minority borrowers.\u201d Ally\u2019s sin was not making \u201csufficient efforts to ensure that it was complying with fair lending laws\u2026.\u201d Cordray crowed that \u201ctoday\u2019s order establishes a new compliance framework.\u201d\n\nBoom \u2013 so much for scaring the daylights out of auto lenders. Could this be one reason that auto sales plunged in January and surprised industry experts by falling year-over-year? Yes, the weather was cold, but is it possible that lenders are trying to figure out how to dodge the next CFPB bullet?\n\nRelated: Critics Say CFPB Is an Overreaching Monster\n\nThe Ally charges are worrisome, because industry observers expect the CFPB hounds to soon be loosed on the mortgage industry. Last month the agency issued some eight hundred pages of new rules defining who should be considered a \u201cqualified\u201d borrower. Though the mission of the agency includes making financial transactions simpler and more transparent, industry participants describe the rules as hideously complicated and open to interpretation.\n\nIn a letter to Cordray last November, 54 bankers associations from around the country asked that the new Ability to Repay/Qualified Mortgage rules (technically, Federal Reserve Regulation Z) be postponed, so as not to disrupt lending. They did not ask that the regulations be changed \u2013 just delayed, so that software vendors and other compliance specialists would be able to prepare products that would guarantee that the banks were abiding by the new rules.\n\nThe letter acknowledges that the agency had agreed to make allowances for some confusion (since the rules had been frequently changed), but states that \u201cmany banks will not move forward with lending until they are certain they are in full compliance and within the bounds of acceptable risk.\u201d\n\nThe bankers claim that \u201cit is a virtual certainty that mortgage lending in our states will be curtailed.\u201d They cite studies concluding that about 20 percent of current mortgage loans are not in compliance with the new rules, and that the credit shrinkage could well exceed that amount.\n\nRelated: 4 New Rules that Could Stop You from Buying a Home\n\nMr. Cordray, with the bit now between his teeth, is unmoved, and the new rules are now in effect. Rafferty Capital Markets analyst Richard Bove, who has frequently faulted bank regulators for overreaching and stifling the flow of credit in the process, says in a new note to clients that the CFPB \u201cno longer believes that lending money to potential homeowners is a transaction between the borrower and the lender.\u201d In his view, the rules are so onerous, and the risks to banks so significant, that \u201cno low income household is ever likely to be able to obtain the funds to buy a home in this country again.\u201d\n\nMr. Bove may be guilty of hyperbole, but it appears that the evangelical Mr. Cordray is guilty of recklessness. Early on, Republicans balked at the proposed structure of the CFPB, which is funded by the Federal Reserve and therefore does not answer to Congress. They also objected to the appointment of Mr. Cordray, fearing that he, and the agency, would operate with little oversight.\n\nIn fairness, the arrangement reflected the reasonable view that complacent financial industry regulators had failed to prevent the unstable and unscrupulous lending that led to the mortgage meltdown and the recession. Financial firms played one group of overseers off against another, while legislators with ties to the banks softened regulations. The concept of an independent agency may have been sound, but its zeal could well create a whole new set of problems.\n\nMost worrisome is that Mr. Cordray\u2019s avenging team, not content with suppressing auto and mortgage lending, is now investigating loans to small businesses. Heaven help us, and heaven help the U.S. economy.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "What could possibly be more brainless than turning off credit to the housing industry?", "title": "Overreaching CFPB Threatens Economy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/02/05/Federal-Agency-Could-Stifle-Recovery", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Used%20Cars%20%28flickr%3ADennis%20S.%20Hurd%29.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/02/05/Federal-Agency-Could-Stifle-Recovery", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Used%20Cars%20%28flickr%3ADennis%20S.%20Hurd%29.jpg", "creator": "@lizpeek", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "What could possibly be more brainless than turning off credit to the housing industry?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa8b\"", "article_summary": "Related: Critics Say CFPB Is an Overreaching MonsterThe Ally charges are worrisome, because industry observers expect the CFPB hounds to soon be loosed on the mortgage industry.\nRichard Cordray, CFPB czar, celebrated this first major \u201cwin\u201d in prepared remarks which described the settlement as the largest auto loan discrimination case ever.\nMost worrisome is that Mr. Cordray\u2019s avenging team, not content with suppressing auto and mortgage lending, is now investigating loans to small businesses.\nMaybe stifling auto lending qualifies.\nRelated: Rapid Growth of U.S. Mortgage Lenders Draws ScrutinyIn December, as it was sharpening its teeth, the CFPB demanded $98 million from Ally Financial in settling charges that it had discriminated against minority customers."}
