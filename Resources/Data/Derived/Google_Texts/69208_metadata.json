Friday marks the deadline for the Obama administration to finalize rules that will include protections for transgender patients. - Ted Eytan/Flickr\n\nFor years, transgender adults have faced discrimination in healthcare so hostile it\u2019s almost laughable. Almost.\n\n\u201cA trans-woman broke her arm playing softball,\u201d said Mara Keisling, executive director the National Center for Transgender Equality. \u201cThe insurance company refused to pay for it because if she hadn\u2019t been transgender she wouldn\u2019t have been playing softball. There\u2019s just a million stories like that.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is finalizing specific provisions of a rule under the Affordable Care Act that broadens civil rights protection.\n\nThis is the first federal law to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in healthcare, which means hospitals, nursing homes, health insurers and doctors are barred from discriminating against transgender Americans \u2014 as well as others based on sex.\n\nThis new rule puts the entire industry on notice. It\u2019s now illegal to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation, just like it\u2019s been illegal to deny care to people based on age, religion or race. Friday is the deadline for the Obama Administration to finalize new rules.\n\nHHS\u2019s Jocelyn Samuels said that means insurers can no longer categorically deny services. For example, take gender transition care.\n\n\u201cIf an insurer said, 'we will not cover any services related to gender transition, we will treat that as a denial of access to coverage' \u2014 that is prohibited by the ACA,\u201d she said.\n\nOnce the final rule is in place, University of Michigan Law Professor Sam Bagenstos, a former assistant attorney general for civil rights under the Obama Administration, said he can imagine scenarios where an insurer covers some services, but gender transition remains expensive.\n\n\u201cIt gets gray pretty quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the real question is how much is HHS going to feel willing to say in the abstract about these questions.\u201d\n\nWhile this likely opens the doors to more lawsuits, Keisling of the National Center for Transgender Equality noted this gives people legal standing for the first time.\n\n\u201cWhen they go to the doctor and the doctor say 'I don\u2019t feel comfortable,' they know they have the ability to say, 'I am a human being and you have to treat me. I have a legal right to get medical care,'\u201d Keisling said.\n\nKeisling estimates there are some 1 million transgender Americans, some of whom have stopped seeking medical care due to bad experiences in the past.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2015/11/02/health-care/new-protections-transgender-patients-are-coming", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/8604815836_71ec0d624a_z.jpg?itok=zsW9m09n", "type": "article", "description": "Friday is the deadline for the Obama Administration to finalize new rules.", "title": "New protections for transgender patients are coming"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "0naqczkIbC3o8vAigJQ6BmE/676jG8aEsdzUnAvJ7wO8EJ9rHINNkfaD+t5SCRxgApfBHnHiw4v4z4E40tYehA==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Friday marks the deadline for the Obama administration to finalize rules that will include protections for transgender patients.\nFor example, take gender transition care.\nI have a legal right to get medical care,'\u201d Keisling said.\n\u201cThe insurance company refused to pay for it because if she hadn\u2019t been transgender she wouldn\u2019t have been playing softball.\n\u201cA trans-woman broke her arm playing softball,\u201d said Mara Keisling, executive director the National Center for Transgender Equality."}
