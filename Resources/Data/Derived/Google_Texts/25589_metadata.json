Too many people in this country still suffer silently. Too many mental health problems, for which there are treatments, are left untreated.\u201d\n\nEliminating stigma was a key focus at the National Conference on Mental Health, held at the White House on June 3, 2013.\n\nFinally, the Vice President highlighted the upcoming expansion of mental health and substance use disorder benefits and federal parity protections for 62 million Americans, resulting from the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe made sure that the Affordable Care Act includes mental health and substance abuse services as one of the 10 categories of essential benefits that must be covered by health plans in the new health insurance marketplaces.\u201d\n\nThe Administration will issue the final rule implementing the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 by the end of this year.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/browserconfig.xml", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "application-name": "Whitehouse", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"title": "Vice President Biden Marks the 50th Anniversary of the Community Mental Health Act", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/10/25/vice-president-biden-marks-50th-anniversary-community-mental-health-act", "image": {"src": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "height": 240, "width": 240}, "creator": "@WhiteHouse", "site": "@WhiteHouse", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#003C80", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"site_name": "whitehouse.gov", "description": "At the Kennedy Forum\u2019s event commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Community Mental Health Act, Vice President reaffirms the Administration\u2019s commitment to increasing access to mental health and substance abuse treatments, eliminating the stigma surrounding mental illness, and supporting research to better understand the functioning of the human brain.", "title": "Vice President Biden Marks the 50th Anniversary of the Community Mental Health Act", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/10/25/vice-president-biden-marks-50th-anniversary-community-mental-health-act", "image": {"width": 240, "secure_url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "height": 240}, "updated_time": "2013-10-25T16:22:08-04:00", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimized": "width", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-25T16:20:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-25T16:22:08-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb160\"", "article_summary": "Vice President Joe Biden spoke at the John F.
