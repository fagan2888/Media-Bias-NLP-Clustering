If Planned Parenthood really wants to disprove the now-overwhelming body of evidence that their affiliates traffick in baby body parts, they should release their fetal tissue contracts with the for-profit company StemExpress for law enforcement, Congress, and all the world to see.\n\nThe Center for Medical Progress has released videos of senior executives at Planned Parenthood discussing the sale of fetal organs at the organization\u2019s affiliates.\n\nIn a series of statements, Planned Parenthood spokespersons have called the videos \u201cheavily edited\u201d and denied illegal conduct.\n\nProfiting from transactions involving human organs, including fetal human organs, is a felony in the United States.\n\nAccording to their website, Fusion GPS \u201cprovides premium research, strategic intelligence, and due diligence services to corporations, law firms, and investors worldwide.\u201d\n\nThe Weekly Standard reports that Fusion GPS is \u201can opposition research firm with ties to the Democratic party\u201d with \u201ca history of harassing socially conservative Republican donors.\u201d\n\nIn a second statement, Daleiden said:\n\nPlanned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards makes two key admissions today in Planned Parenthood\u2019s letter to Congress: that Planned Parenthood gets paid $60 per baby body part harvested, and that Planned Parenthood doctors alter their abortion procedures to get higher-quality body parts. Both of these admissions speak to Planned Parenthood\u2019s financial benefit and profit motive for supplying fetal tissue, and both are the points CMP\u2019s videos have documented and illustrated from the very beginning. When a Tissue Procurement Organization handles all dissection, packaging, and shipping of fetal organs, and all Planned Parenthood does is spend 10 minutes consenting a patient, the $60 per body part harvested quickly adds up to illegal baby parts profit for Planned Parenthood. And when a Planned Parenthood doctor manipulates the abortion to get higher-quality baby parts, they are prizing Planned Parenthood\u2019s financial interests ahead of women\u2019s health.\n\nThis post has been updated to include an additional statement from The Center for Medical Progress and The Weekly Standard\u2019s report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood commissioned analysis making media news.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Planned Parenthood commissioned analysis making media news.", "title": "Center for Medical Progress: Video Analysis 'Complete Failure'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/826live.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-27T16:19:52+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1hIgj1X"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Planned Parenthood commissioned analysis making media news.", "title": "Center for Medical Progress: Video Analysis 'Complete Failure'", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/826live.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-08-27T13:43:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-27T16:19:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Fusion GPS, New York Times, Center for Medical Progress, Planned Parenthood investigation, Planned Parenthood videos"}, "article_summary": "And when a Planned Parenthood doctor manipulates the abortion to get higher-quality baby parts, they are prizing Planned Parenthood\u2019s financial interests ahead of women\u2019s health.\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s desperate, 11th-hour attempt to pay their hand-picked \u2018experts\u2019 to distract from the crimes documented on video is a complete failure,\u201d said David Daleiden, the Center for Medical Progress\u2019s project lead for its Human Capital series, in a statement.\nAccording to the Times, Planned Parenthood hired a research firm to examine the videos and turned their findings over to congressional investigators.\nIn a series of statements, Planned Parenthood spokespersons have called the videos \u201cheavily edited\u201d and denied illegal conduct.\nThis post has been updated to include an additional statement from The Center for Medical Progress and The Weekly Standard\u2019s report."}
