Each day, participants consumed either 12 servings of chips made with vegetable oil or 24 servings of chips made with olestra. The serving sizes varied with each volunteer\u2019s individual calorie intake.\n\nAt the end of the trial, the detoxifying effect of olestra was clear. Participants who consumed olestra chips decreased their PCB levels by eight percent. For those who ate chips with vegetable oil, the figure was one percent.\n\n\u201cOur early work with animal studies predicted that we would see this effect in people,\u201d Jandacek explained. \"The findings showed that the rate of PCB disappearance from the participants that ate olestra was markedly faster during the one-year trial than that before the trial.\u201d\n\nPCBs, Diabetes, and Hypertension\n\nHypertension and diabetes currently affect 67 and 25.8 million Americans respectively, with incidence and complications on the rise in many states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Together, the conditions cost the nation well over $300 billion in health care services, medications, and lost labor.\n\nWhile olestra was shown to reduce certain factors of diabetes and hypertension risk, it remains to be seen whether regular consumption actually prevents these conditions. \u201c[Our findings] supports a larger intervention trial that may also determine whether reduction in PCBs will reduce the risk of hypertension and diabetes,\u201d Jandacek and colleagues wrote in their conclusion.\n\nSource: Jandacek RJ, Heubi JE, Buckley DD, et al.
