Garnet Coleman, a Houston Democrat, and Rep. John Zerwas, a Republican from Richmond, are both health policy experts. Zerwas is a physician.\n\nSo last session -- after Perry said \u201cno\u201d to being part of Obamacare -- Zerwas and Coleman set aside party affiliations and crafted an alternative.\n\nOn Monday, at a Richardson forum sponsored by The Texas Tribune and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, they said a majority of state lawmakers were ready to support what they came up with last session -- but Perry\u2019s promise of a veto got in the way.\n\n\u201cEven the conservatives understood their communities would benefit from the boost financially. From the jobs that would be created,\u201d Coleman said. \u201c[But] there was no reason for members to go out and vote for something they thought would beat them in the Republican primary. And frankly I don\u2019t blame them.\u201d\n\nThe Zerwas-Coleman legislation, HB 1391, called for Texas to do what other states have done to collect their share of federal money: Approach the Obama administration with an alternative that provides insurance coverage for more low-income people.\n\nTheir plan focused on the estimated 1.5 million Texas adults who earn 138 percent of what the federal government considers poverty level and therefore have no access to affordable coverage. That\u2019s approximately $16,000 or less annually for an individual.\n\nZerwas says those Texans currently rely on emergency care that often comes too late.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t provide that access when you have early stage breast cancer versus later stage breast cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t provide you that \u2026 access to healthcare when you\u2019ve got diabetes and early in your disease you\u2019re trying to get control of your diabetes so you don\u2019t end up with the serious qualities such as blindness and heart failure.\u201d\n\nThe Zerwas-Coleman plan said the newly covered should share some of their insurance cost through co-pays or deductibles, which currently isn\u2019t allowed under Medicaid. Private insurers would be involved. Taxes collected from premiums on healthcare plans would pay the state\u2019s costs.\n\nZerwas told the Richardson crowd he thinks a similar plan could have a chance next session.\n\n\u201cAs we go into this next session if the members hear loud and clear that their constituency wants something to happen, such as a Texas Solution \u2026 then I think that, you know, there is the ability to get some traction for things,\" Zerwas said.\n\nCounty judges from Dallas, Tarrant, Harris, Bexar, El Paso and Travis recently sent a letter to lawmakers saying medical providers are spending $4 billion a year to cover care low income Texans can\u2019t pay for.\n\nThey\u2019re among those asking legislators to give a Texas solution another try.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Government", "description": "Two key state lawmakers from opposing parties say they haven\u2019t given up on creating a plan that would allow Texas to collect billions of federal Medicaid", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://keranews.org/post/lawmakers-ready-again-back-texas-solution-obamacare", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kera/files/styles/medium/public/201408/coleman-zerwas_evan_health_forum_8-18-14.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Two key state lawmakers from opposing parties say they haven\u2019t given up on creating a plan that would allow Texas to collect billions of federal Medicaid", "title": "Lawmakers Ready To Again Back A 'Texas Solution' To Obamacare"}, "story_id": 341493559, "twitter": {"site": "@keranews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@keranews"}, "author": "Shelley Kofler", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Lawmakers Ready To Again Back A &#039;Texas Solution&#039; To Obamacare"}, "nid": 54296, "datePublished": "2014-08-18", "keywords": ", , , , , ,", "wordCount": 586, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "So last session -- after Perry said \u201cno\u201d to being part of Obamacare -- Zerwas and Coleman set aside party affiliations and crafted an alternative.\nThey\u2019re among those asking legislators to give a Texas solution another try.\nTwo key state lawmakers from opposing parties say they haven\u2019t given up on creating a plan that would allow Texas to collect billions of federal Medicaid dollars tied to the Affordable Care Act.\nOn Monday, at a Richardson forum sponsored by The Texas Tribune and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, they said a majority of state lawmakers were ready to support what they came up with last session -- but Perry\u2019s promise of a veto got in the way.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t provide that access when you have early stage breast cancer versus later stage breast cancer,\u201d he said."}
