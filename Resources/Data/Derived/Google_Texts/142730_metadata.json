She and her running mate, Basil Ottley, beat out a crowded six candidate field to win the Democratic primary for Governor of the Virgin Islands.\n\nDel. Christensen\u2019s primary win and all but certain victory in the general election means she will be the first Black female Governor of the U.S. and its territories.\n\nThe Virgin Islands is one of five U.S. territories who claim as their President Barack Obama but oddly can\u2019t vote in presidential elections. The largest U.S. territory is Puerto Rico with over 5 million people. Thanks to the House Republicans, Del. Christensen does not have a vote in on the House floor \u2014 all the Delegates in the U.S. House are Democrats.\n\n\u201cOur community has a lot of work to do as we address the economy, energy costs, health care, education, the government retirement system, and our infrastructure,\u201d a note from team Christensen read on facebook.\n\nBack in March, Delegate \u2014 and Doctor \u2014 Christensen, announced she would be running for governor of the Virgin Islands. Christensen has been known in her Congress for her work on health care and as a member of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. She had focused lots on energy on getting the Virgin Islands Obamacare coverage.\n\nThere were storms in the Caribbean yesterday as voters hit the polls. A message to supporters:\n\n\u201cWe would like to urge all of you to be prepared for the storm, securing your homes and your families before coming out to work or vote tomorrow. With the closing of ports and the potential grounding of aircraft, our candidates will visit the polls on their respective home islands on Election Day, Donna on St. Croix and Basil on St. Thomas before ending the day at headquarters for the election night count.\u201d\n\nFor Christensen and Ottley the day ended just fine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There may have been storms on election day, but for Delegate Donna Christensen the sun was shining.\u00a0 She and her running mate, Basil Ottley, beat out a crowded", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Lauren Victoria Burke", "og": {"image": "http://politic365.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/08/christ.jpg"}, "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "keywords": "Donna Christensen,First Black Female Gov: Christensen Wins Crowded Virgin Islands Primary,headline,National", "google-site-verification": "_JwiWIkiEZ4HQvBexdo_s_SK6wnFW7XjgHXUAzGaBt4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "She and her running mate, Basil Ottley, beat out a crowded six candidate field to win the Democratic primary for Governor of the Virgin Islands.\nBack in March, Delegate \u2014 and Doctor \u2014 Christensen, announced she would be running for governor of the Virgin Islands.\nThe Virgin Islands is one of five U.S. territories who claim as their President Barack Obama but oddly can\u2019t vote in presidential elections.\nThere may have been storms on election day, but for Delegate Donna Christensen the sun was shining.\nShe had focused lots on energy on getting the Virgin Islands Obamacare coverage."}
