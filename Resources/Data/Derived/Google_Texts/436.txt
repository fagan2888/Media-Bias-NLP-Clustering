A survey in the U.K. found people who slept on the left side of the bed had extra pep in their step and those who slept on the right were grumpier.

Have you ever been told you woke up on the wrong side of the bed? Well, there may be some scientific truth to that.

Sealy UK surveyed 1,000 people and found those who sleep on the right side of the bed are 7 percent more likely to wake up grumpy in the morning than those who sleep on the left side. They're also 3 percent more likely to not like their job.

But the people who slept on the left side were 9.5 percent more likely to have a good outlook on life and 8 percent more likely to enjoy their job and have good friends.

A sleep expert at Sealy UK said, "While the margins are small, the research certainly highlights an interesting trend."

In 2011, a different survey of 3,000 adults had similar findings.

So if you're the kind of person who wakes up grumpier than the Grinch, maybe you should switch sides of the bed.

Although, that may be easier said than done. In February, yet another survey concluded 40 percent of Americans have always slept on their chosen side of the bed.
