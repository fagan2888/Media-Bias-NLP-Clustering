Are you saying that if he wants changes on the Republican side, he needs to also make a change on Obamacare?\n\nKEVIN O\u2019 LEARY: Think about Obamacare. We all understand the 30,000-foot vision of that and it has merits but to say that you shouldn\u2019t tweak it at all is crazy, it hasn\u2019t been implemented yet and there\u2019s problems it with it. I think the Republicans can bring something to the table, tweak it more, making it easier to implement for business. Why not negotiate? I don\u2019t get it. Somehow over the last 36 months we\u2019ve been able to vilify business leaders, vilify the process of capitalism, tell young kids in school that making money is un-American. That\u2019s all crazy. That\u2019s not what made this country great.
