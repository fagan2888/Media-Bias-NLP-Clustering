A Topeka man who faces 14 felony charges will have his fate decided at a jury trial in 2015.

Daniel Lynn Cregut, 50, is accused of kidnapping his former girlfriend and shooting a man at a gas station on June 30, a report from the Capital-Journal said at the time.

When the woman returned from spending June 29 in Lawrence, she told police that Cregut was in her apartment with a handgun, the report said.

She tried to get away from him at the Huntoon Street Smoke Shop, 1237 S.W. Huntoon.

When the woman locked herself in the back room of the BP Amoco at 1401 S.W. Huntoon, Cregut is alleged to have shot a man in the hand.

Cregut then fled the scene and a standoff ensued for several hours at a house at 1270 S.W. Washburn.

His bond was set at $1 million on July 1, according to paperwork from Shawnee County District Court.

Cregut waived his right to a formal arraignment on Sept. 2. His jury trial will start at 9 a.m. on Feb. 2, 2015 at the Shawnee County Courthouse.

At the time, Miller’s bond was set at $100,000.
