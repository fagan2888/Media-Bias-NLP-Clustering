Mr. Binz didn\u2019t join the board until two years later, said Polly Page, who was a commissioner from 2000 to 2008.\n\n\u201cIn that decision, it gave them all the legal necessities for building this coal plant and getting the rate recovery that would make them whole. That was done in 2005, and Mr. Binz joined the commission in 2007,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Binz didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about the contradiction.\n\nHe earlier told The Washington Times that he was refusing all interviews until his confirmation, but he did tell the website CompleteColorado last week that as chairman, he approved a rate plan that allowed the utility to begin operating.\n\nMs. Page, though, said those plans were in the initial approval phase and all Mr. Binz did was \u201crubber stamp\u201d what was in place.\n\nMr. Binz was trying to convince the energy committee that he is not opposed to fossil fuels, but he is suffering in part because the administration of the man who nominated him \u2014 Mr. Obama \u2014 is moving to make their use less prevalent.\n\nOn Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced long-anticipated emissions rules that those in the industry say make new coal plants impossible. The rules are more generous, however, to natural gas.\n\nEPA Administrator Gina McCarthy defended the standards Friday morning, saying her agency and the administration are acting on behalf of future generations\u2019 right to breathe clean air.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, that is what the issue of climate change is all about. That\u2019s why EPA cares,\u201d Ms. McCarthy said during a speech at the National Press Club in Washington. \u201cThe president\u2019s climate action plan calls on federal agencies to take steady, sensible and pragmatic steps to cut the harmful carbon pollution that fuels our changing climate and to prepare for unavoidable impacts based on the climate change that is already happening and is inevitable.\u201d\n\nThe rules now will go through the public comment period and must survive congressional scrutiny.\n\nMany Republicans and several Democrats, such as Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, criticized the proposals.\n\nMr. Manchin, as a member of the Senate energy committee, is also critical in the battle over Mr. Binz. He announced after hearings last week that he cannot support the nomination because it didn\u2019t auger well for his state\u2019s reliance on coal.\n\nWith all of the panel\u2019s Republicans also expected to oppose Mr. Binz, his fate appears to rest with Sen. Mary L. Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat who is up for re-election next year in a state where fossil-fuel production is an important part of the economy. Her office didn\u2019t respond to three requests for comment last week, and those following the nomination said she is under intense pressure.\n\nIf Republicans and Mr. Manchin oppose Mr. Binz but Ms. Landrieu supports him, it would leave a tie vote in the committee. It is rare that a nominee who doesn\u2019t get a favorable vote is brought to the full Senate floor.\n\nIn this case, however, Mr. Binz has a major backer: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, whose staff has been working the Binz nomination. Indeed, two former Reid staffers, both of them now lobbyists, also are advising Mr. Binz.\n\nThe White House also hasn\u2019t given up on him, though its support seemed pro forma last week.\n\n\u201cMr. Binz is a highly qualified nominee who would do a great job at the FERC. And we continue to work with Congress to ensure that he gets a fair hearing and gets confirmed in a timely fashion,\u201d Josh Earnest, the deputy press secretary, told reporters.\n\nThe controversies over Mr. Binz have intensified in recent weeks after The Times reported on emails showing the coordination between him and the lobbyists and strategists he assembled.\n\nIndeed, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the ranking Republican on the committee, accused Mr. Binz last week of misleading her when he earlier denied he was working with such a team.\n\nOther emails obtained by The Times from researcher Chris Horner and the Free Market Environmental Law Clinic show Mr. Binz asked BP PLC oil company officials to lobby the committee for him.\n\nMr. Binz apologized to Ms. Murkowski on Tuesday, saying he didn\u2019t mean to mislead her. He also said he had asked one of the strategists not to work with him anymore.\n\nMs. Page, who overlapped Mr. Binz for a year on the Colorado commission, called him knowledgeable but said he was \u201cvery demanding and controlling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s more of an activist,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere I felt our job was to be a judge and listen to all the evidence, it\u2019s not his style.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's nominee to a top energy post is hanging on by a thread after a poor performance last week at a confirmation hearing where he failed to win over key supporters and even appeared to have misled a Senate committee about his record of support for a coal-fired energy plant.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s nominee to a top energy post is hanging on by a thread after a poor performance last week at a confirmation hearing where he failed to win over key supporters and even appeared to have misled a Senate committee about his record of support for a coal-fired energy plant.", "title": "Energy nominee Ron Binz loses voltage with contradictions, Obama coal rules", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/22/energy-nominee-ron-binz-loses-voltage-in-coal-war-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/15/ronbinz2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/15/ronbinz2.jpg", "description": "President Obama's nominee to a top energy post is hanging on by a thread after a poor performance last week at a confirmation hearing where he failed to win over key supporters and even appeared to ha", "card": "summary", "title": "Energy nominee Ron Binz loses voltage with contradictions, Obama coal"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan, Ben Wolfgang and Stephen Dinan, Ben Wolfgang", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Environment, Politics, Ron Binz, Polly Page, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8721\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Binz didn\u2019t join the board until two years later, said Polly Page, who was a commissioner from 2000 to 2008.\nMr. Manchin, as a member of the Senate energy committee, is also critical in the battle over Mr. Binz.\nMr. Binz didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about the contradiction.\nThat was done in 2005, and Mr. Binz joined the commission in 2007,\u201d she said.\nPage, though, said those plans were in the initial approval phase and all Mr. Binz did was \u201crubber stamp\u201d what was in place."}
