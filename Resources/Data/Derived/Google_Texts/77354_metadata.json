Photo by Dave Hunt for Agence France-Presse.\n\nVanuatu warned it faces imminent food shortages as accounts emerged of huge damage to a large outer island, days after one of the fiercest cyclones on record pummelled the Pacific archipelago.\n\nRelief agencies say conditions are among the most challenging they have faced, with some areas still inaccessible and concerns that disease and a lack of clean water could add to a revised toll of 11 confirmed fatalities.\n\nCommunications were still down to many of Vanuatu\u2019s 83 islands, most only accessible by boat, and Prime Minister Joe Natuman said Tuesday it would be at least a week before authorities had a better sense of the destruction.\n\nPresident Baldwin Lonsdale has appealed for the world to help after Severe Tropical Cyclone Pam roared ashore on Friday night.\n\nOn the streets of the capital, Port Vila, residents began clearing metal roof sheeting from the roads and used machetes to hack through fallen trees as they tried to rebuild their lives.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs lowered its earlier death toll of 24 to 11, citing figures from the Pacific nation\u2019s disaster office which included five from Tanna Island.\n\nThe scale of the disaster became clearer with the first teams of aid workers reaching Tanna, home to 30,000 people. It is some 200 kilometres (125 miles) south of the capital Port Vila, itself badly damaged.\n\nTom Perry from CARE Australia said the initial observations showed \u201cthe damage is significantly worse than Port Vila\u201d.\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said reconnaissance by the country\u2019s military showed that \u201cmore than 80 percent of houses and buildings have been partially or completely destroyed\u201d in Tanna.\n\n\u201cNot only buildings flattened, but palm plantations, trees. It\u2019s quite a devastating sight.\u201d\n\nNatuman said while initial assessors had been able to enter the eastern and western parts of the island chain, northern and southern areas were still largely unaccessible.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Only leftovers now\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be at least a week or two,\u201d he told reporters at Port Vila airport.\n\n\u201cRight now we are sending teams to do ground assessments to see how many people are homeless.\u201d\n\nInternational aid shipments have started arriving, including from Australia, Britain and the EU have pledged aid to the Pacific nation.\n\nOn Tuesday, French President Francois Hollande pledged to step up France\u2019s relief efforts in \u201cthe coming days, to respond to the urgency of the situation\u201d.\n\nBut with many outlying areas still inaccessible, Benjamin Shing, from Lonsdale\u2019s office, said survivors are still in danger of running out of food.\n\n\u201cThe first week we are relying on the fact that the food crops are still edible \u2026 but after the first week we\u2019ll need to get some rations on the ground,\u201d he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nWith crops wiped out, Shing feared the worst for a country that largely relies on subsistence farming, warning \u201cthere might be a lot of fatalities\u201d.\n\nAt least 3,300 people have sought refuge in 37 relief centres, according to the UN, which also said figures were found to be inaccurate due to inconsistent registration processes.\n\nAmong them was Melissa Song, a 22-year-old who had taken refuge in a hotel along with nine members of her family, including three children and an infant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had no sleep since Thursday,\u201d she told AFP.\n\nLocal woman Sale Chilia said residents living in Mele, a village two kilometres south of Port Vila, were starting to worry about where they could find their next meal.\n\n\u201cWe only have the leftovers now,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Sounded like a big plane\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn the capital Port Vila, access to water and electricity was partially restored after the storm brought down an estimated 80 percent of power lines and damaged most homes.\n\nStores also began reopening, but entire neighbourhoods remained without power as locals struggled to rebuild their homes.\n\n\u201cBefore, it\u2019ll take one to three months to recover,\u201d local Riby Esau, 60, told AFP. \u201cIt\u2019ll be longer now.\u201d\n\nPersonal belongings, household items, mattresses and clothes were spread out on the ground and hung on washing lines as people dried them out.\n\nSamuel Toara, 25, thought he was going to die as he hid in the pitch black of his home as the storm barrelled ashore.\n\n\u201cThe cyclone sounded like a big plane flying very low,\u201d he told AFP, describing how part of the roof blew off in the tempest.\n\n\u201cThe rain and wind was like white smoke and it flooded up to my knee. But I told the boys, don\u2019t worry about the water,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as we survive.\u201d\n\nVanuatu is no stranger to cyclones, which are common in the South Pacific, but locals said Pam felt worse than Cyclone Uma in 1987, which killed 30 people.\n\nUNICEF has estimated that 60,000 children have been affected by the cyclone and virtually all schools were closed.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/A-young-boy-kicks-a-ball-as-his-father-searches-through-the-ruins-of-their-family-home-in-Port-Vila-AFP-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Massive cyclone damage spurs fears of food shortages in island nation of Vanuatu"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde226\"", "article_summary": "Tom Perry from CARE Australia said the initial observations showed \u201cthe damage is significantly worse than Port Vila\u201d.\nA young boy kicks a ball as his father searches through the ruins of their family home in Port Vila, Vanuatu on March 16, 2015.\nIt is some 200 kilometres (125 miles) south of the capital Port Vila, itself badly damaged.\nOn the streets of the capital, Port Vila, residents began clearing metal roof sheeting from the roads and used machetes to hack through fallen trees as they tried to rebuild their lives.\n\u2013 \u2018Only leftovers now\u2019 \u2013\u201cIt\u2019ll be at least a week or two,\u201d he told reporters at Port Vila airport."}
