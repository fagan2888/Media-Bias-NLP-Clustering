Don\u2019t worry, though. You\u2019re not alone. The temptation of stuffing, turkey, and creamed corn is more than most can handle. And don\u2019t even get me started on the dessert. Although eating Thanksgiving dinner feels, well, amazing, taking it too far can leave us feeling uncomfortable. In case you were wondering what happens to your body when you eat too much, here\u2019s a quick run-through:\n\nInternational Business Times reported that this Thanksgiving the average American will consume over 3,100 calories. According to a video released by The American Chemical Society, just the sheer volume of all this food is one of the reasons eating too much can leave us feeling stuffed. The average stomach can contain between 1-2 liters of food and liquid during a meal. When we overeat, the stomach literally stretches, pressing against other organs and leaving us with a protruding abdomen.\n\nIt\u2019s not just food that is filling up your stomach, however. With each bite you take you swallow air, and this air builds up, taking space. Drinking carbonated drinks or beer will further increase your air intake. Fortunately, our bodies have an efficient way to get rid of this extra air, although it\u2019s best to be done away from the banquet table.\n\nFeeling full isn\u2019t just physical; it's neurological. When your stomach is full, your brain sends out chemical messages to let us know it\u2019s time to stop eating. The hormone peptide YY, or PYY regulates appetite and has the sole duty of getting you to put that fork down by any means necessary. Unfortunately, this also involves making you feel not so nice. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s all for your own good, and, as you probably know, this feeling of fullness will shortly pass just in time for Mom\u2019s pecan pie.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "thanksgiving, 2014, why, eating, too, much, turkey, dinner, can, leave, you, feeling, queasy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "What happens to our bodies and our brains when we eat too much food on Thanksgiving?", "title": "What Happens To Our Bodies When We Overdo It At Thanksgiving Dinner [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/thanksgiving-2014-why-eating-too-much-turkey-dinner-can-leave-you-feeling-queasy-312062", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2014/11/25/thanksgiving-dinner_0.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What happens to our bodies and our brains when we eat too much food on Thanksgiving?", "title": "What Happens To Our Bodies When We Overdo It At Thanksgiving Dinner [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/thanksgiving-2014-why-eating-too-much-turkey-dinner-can-leave-you-feeling-queasy-312062", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2014/11/25/thanksgiving-dinner_0.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/25/thanksgiving-dinner_0.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-11-25T10:44:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-25T15:41:37-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "What happens to our bodies and our brains when we eat too much food on Thanksgiving?"}, "article_summary": "Although eating Thanksgiving dinner feels, well, amazing, taking it too far can leave us feeling uncomfortable.\nDon\u2019t worry, though.\nDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s all for your own good, and, as you probably know, this feeling of fullness will shortly pass just in time for Mom\u2019s pecan pie.\nWhen your stomach is full, your brain sends out chemical messages to let us know it\u2019s time to stop eating.\nAccording to a video released by The American Chemical Society, just the sheer volume of all this food is one of the reasons eating too much can leave us feeling stuffed."}
