Chris Douglas, might sound like a scuttled agency from an early draft of the Affordable Care Act, but the sunny little creperie is actually a delightful breakfast and lunch joint with seasonal menu and limited hours well suited to the neighborhood\u2019s laid-back lifestyle.\n\nThe chow: Crepes are the main feature here, and they come in three batters: white flour, gluten-free buckwheat and, for and extra $1, vegan and gluten-free polenta. All are light and tender, and come with a broad range of fillings. Start with a savory plate like the bacon and brie ($8) or fig, brie and ham ($8) in a buckwheat crepe, and maybe add a cup of soup on the side. If it\u2019s on the menu when you visit, get the excellent French onion soup ($4 cup, $6 bowl). For dessert, the dark chocolate crepe with fleur de sel ($5) is a lovely, balanced finish that won\u2019t leave you feeling bloated from whipped cream. Want something sweeter? The \"Rose City,\" with rose chocolate and rose jelly ($7), has your name on it.\n\nReal deals: \"Les Trois Mini,\" three miniature dessert crepes for $8.\n\nHangout factor: The sunny shop\u2019s decor seems to be as seasonal as the specials. At present it\u2019s dressed up for Valentine\u2019s Day, with tulips on every table and heart-shaped lights in the window. Plenty of sunlight and bottomless coffee makes it a great place to linger, if you don\u2019t mind small children underfoot. If the place had a liquor license, there\u2019d be no reason to leave.\n\nLiquids: Blue Kangaroo coffee ($2), Steven Smith tea ($3), hot cocoa ($3), juices ($3\u2013$4).\n\nWhat\u2019s half-baked? Service can be a little awkward -- this is obviously Douglas\u2019 first restaurant -- but the place has only been open four months. They\u2019ll get it sorted soon enough.\n\nInside tips: Want to take home some of the honey in your crepe for later? Arugularium sells it by the jar.\n\nThe numbers: 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Thursday-Friday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday to Sunday; 8337 S.E. 17th Ave.; arugularium.com.\n\n-- Ben Waterhouse\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "arugularium,cheap eats,chris douglas,savory et sweet,sellwood", "title": "Savory Et Sweet's Arugularium adds solid crepes to Sellwood's adorable breakfast options", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Savory Et Sweet\\u0027s Arugularium adds solid crepes to Sellwood\\u0027s adorable breakfast options\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/dining/index.ssf/2014/02/savory_et_sweets_arugularium_a.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/ent_impact_dining/photo/14194155-standard.jpeg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12107638\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-11T18:38:01Z\", \"author\": \"Ben Waterhouse | For The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"tags\": [\"@dining\",\"@entertainment\",\"@food\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"@link-entertainment-oregonian\",\"@living\",\"@portland\",\"@se-portland\",\"arugularium\",\"cheap eats\",\"chris douglas\",\"savory et sweet\",\"sellwood\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.oregonlive.com/ent_impact_dining/photo/14194155-thumb_square_large.jpeg", "creator": "@benwaterhouse", "site": "@Oregonian", "card": "summary", "description": "Arugularium, a cute brick-and-mortar offshoot of farmers market vendor Savory Et Sweet, has a crepe for you, whatever your dietary limitations."}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, February 11, 2014, 10:54 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.oregonlive.com/ent_impact_dining/photo/crepe-croppedjpeg-aac9682359f1499d.jpeg\", \"author_name\": \"benwaterhouse\", \"author_nickname\": \"Ben Waterhouse | For The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"author_id\": \"10663884\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Portland & Oregon Dining\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/dining/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "OregonLive.com", "description": "Arugularium, a cute brick-and-mortar offshoot of farmers market vendor Savory Et Sweet, has a crepe for you, whatever your dietary limitations.", "title": "Savory Et Sweet's Arugularium adds solid crepes to Sellwood's adorable breakfast options", "url": "http://www.oregonlive.com/dining/index.ssf/2014/02/savory_et_sweets_arugularium_a.html", "image": "http://media.oregonlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_olive.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "OregonLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, February 11, 2014, 10:45 AM", "article_author": "Ben Waterhouse | For The Oregonian/OregonLive", "Description": "Arugularium, a cute brick-and-mortar offshoot of farmers market vendor Savory Et Sweet, has a crepe for you, whatever your dietary limitations."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f80\"", "article_summary": "The \"Rose City,\" with rose chocolate and rose jelly ($7), has your name on it.\nIf it\u2019s on the menu when you visit, get the excellent French onion soup ($4 cup, $6 bowl).\nThe chow: Crepes are the main feature here, and they come in three batters: white flour, gluten-free buckwheat and, for and extra $1, vegan and gluten-free polenta.\nService can be a little awkward -- this is obviously Douglas\u2019 first restaurant -- but the place has only been open four months.\nPlenty of sunlight and bottomless coffee makes it a great place to linger, if you don\u2019t mind small children underfoot."}
