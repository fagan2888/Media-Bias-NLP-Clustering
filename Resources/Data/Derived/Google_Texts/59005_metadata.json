His campaign robo-called local Republicans to get them attend, and even if they didn\u2019t show up, they heard a brief version of Sasse\u2019s campaign pitch on the phone. Sasse brought a 9.5-foot tall stack of Obamacare regulations to every town hall, almost guaranteeing a picture of him and the stack in every local paper.\n\nIn addition, the campaign invested in technology that allowed it to maximize its reach among its supporters in social media; when it wanted to push back against attacks, it could have its supporters get the word out to one another, a cheap and credible means of communication.\n\nEven when the campaign was functionally broke, it spent online and could achieve near-saturation with its target audience without spending much money. The long-form Internet video \u201c11 Missed Calls\u201d about his wife\u2019s aneurysm and the problems with our health-care system was incredibly affecting and got tens of thousands of views in Nebraska.

Those three did a joint 1,000-person rally in rural Nebraska that provided a much-needed boost at a time when Sasse was getting hurt by negative TV ads against him. Mark Levin did an excellent wide-ranging interview with Sasse and endorsed him on-air at the end of it. And the Drudge Report played an enormous part in spreading the word with its favorable coverage of Sasse.\n\nFor the longest time, it seemed a two-man race between Sasse and Shane Osborn, although a wealthy businessman, Sid Dinsdale, was lurking in the background. Often in such races, the top contenders immolate themselves in a two-man war, creating the space for the third candidate to rise. It seemed that might happen when Osborn went up his negative TV ads attacking Sasse. But Sasse, with the luxury of the support of outside groups that ran negative ads, didn\u2019t respond in kind. He stayed positive, in keeping with the general tenor of his campaign offering a solution-oriented conservatism.
