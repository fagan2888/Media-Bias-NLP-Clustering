Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes said the company has stopped conducting blood tests at its Newark, Calif., lab in the wake of error reports related to the accuracy of its blood testing.

“We stopped testing and have taken the approach of saying ‘let’s rebuild this entire laboratory from scratch,’ so that we can ensure it never happens again,” Holmes said in an interview on “The Today Show.”

Holmes said she “absolutely” believes the lab is now in compliance with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regulations. The agency has said the steps it has taken to ease federal concerns weren’t satisfactory, and is considering revoking the California lab’s license and banning Holmes from the industry for at least two years. The company’s Arizona lab is still operating.

“I feel devastated that we did not catch and fix these issues faster,” she said. “I’m the founder and CEO of this company. Anything that happens in this company is my responsibility at the end of the day.”
