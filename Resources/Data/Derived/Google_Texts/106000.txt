The fifth season of “Modern Family” arrived on Blu-ray/DVD this week and Speakeasy has an exclusive behind-the-scenes look from the Pritchett-Dunphy crew’s trip down under. In this episode, the family takes a vacation—or, as Phil Dunphy calls it, a “pilgrimage”— to Australia. Phil plays tour guide and leads the group as they hit up the Great Barrier Reef, the Australian bush, and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Here, the cast and crew talk about their experience shooting at the Sydney Opera House and at Bondi Beach. “We dug in and learned a lot about the different things one can do when in Australia,” said creator Steve Levitan. “While we only scratched the surface, we did a ton of things.”
