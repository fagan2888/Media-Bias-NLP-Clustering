Hmmm, it seems that Tailgunner Ted Cruz gets a little, well, pissy when he is asked to speak in a context that does not include function rooms full of Bible-banging hayshakers in Sean Hannity gear.

When Cruz said he's heard from "men and women across Texas" who have lost their health insurance as a result of Obamacare, Cuomo pressed the senator on what solutions he would offer to those people.

"You don't think that you have a responsibility as a U.S. Senator to do better than that in terms of offering a solution on what to do next?" the host asked.

"Well, I appreciate you're trying to lecture me in the morning," Cruz said. "Thank you for that."
