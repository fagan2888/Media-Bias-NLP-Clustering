The man had a choice\u2013he could fight the Senate\u2019s push for \u201camnesty first\u201d immigration legislation, which he had a very good chance of killing, or he could stage a showy fight against funding Obamacare that he\u2019d certainly lose. The first course would annoy the business backers who fund Senate and presidential campaigns. The latter course would gin up and channel conservative anger, boosting Cruz\u2019s profile in the caucuses and primaries,without doing anyone much damage at all (since it would fail). The choice seems to have been a no-brainer for the senator.\n\nI originally thought Cruz opposed amnesty and took a dive on the issue, doing the minimum possible to maintain his credibility. I now don\u2019t think his behavior was that bad. It was worse\u2013his very opposition to amnesty was fake. Evidence: The New York Times, in a bit of Anticipatory Strange New Respect, recently ran a piece on Cruz\u2019s attempt to stake out \u201cmiddle ground on immigration.\u201d The middle ground seems to be support for legalization that stops short of citizenship:\n\n\u201cA path to legal status, but not to citizenship. A green card with no right to naturalization.\n\nImmigration-reform legislation from the Senate\u2019s so-called Gang of Eight passed that chamber in June and includes a 13-year path to citizenship. Mr. Cruz pushed unsuccessfully for amendments that would have, among other things, eliminated the citizenship component.\n\nAsked about what to do with the people here illegally, however, he stressed that he had never tried to undo the goal of allowing them to stay.\n\n\u2018The amendment that I introduced removed the path to citizenship, but it did not change the underlying work permit from the Gang of Eight,\u2019 he said during a recent visit to El Paso\u201d [Emphasis added]\n\nLegalization-without-citizenship isn\u2019t the position of anti-amnesty types. It\u2019s the cutting edge position of pro-amnesty Republicans who are trying to sneak a lowest-common-denominator bill through the Republican House, knowing that once illegals are legalized citizenship can always be added later (or obtained through other, already-existing channels). Pro-amnesty journalists are even now going public with discussions of how to relax the citizenship demand.\n\nCruz isn\u2019t in opposition to Karl Rove on this one. He\u2019s saying what Rove\u2019s side wants to hear. He even defies logic in a way familiar to observers of pro-amnesty agitation\u2013claiming that he opposes citizenship because the prospect of getting it \u201cperpetuates illegal crossings.\u201d As if the prospect of getting legal status\u2013status that enables you to freely work and travel in the U.S. and lets your children be citizens\u2013doesn\u2019t make illegal crossing attractive.\n\nTrue, Cruz has talked about the need to \u201csecure the borders first.\u201d He even started a website called www.securebordersnow.com. But the promoters of the non-citizenship version of amnesty also talk about securing the border first\u2013it just turns out that they probably only mean Congress has to pass a border bill before it passes a legalization bill.\n\nDoesn\u2019t Cruz mean the borders have to actually be secured? That\u2019s what I thought, especially after hearing this speech, where Cruz makes all sorts of won\u2019t-get-fooled-again noises and talks about how different the immigration conversation will look \u201conce the borders are secure and we\u2019ve managed to stop illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nBut then I went and read the actual words of Cruz\u2019s online petition, which says only that\n\nany immigration reform must lead with real border security first\n\n[Emphasis on weasel words added.] Call me paranoid, but I now suspect there\u2019s not really any difference between Cruz and the quietly pro-amnesty Boehner-camp position, as recently outlined by Rep. Goodlatte. Cruz won\u2019t insist on securing the borders (and waiting to make sure) before he takes up legalization. He\u2019s willing to support a bill that starts (\u201cleads\u201d) with an enforcement provision and ends with an amnesty provision, as long as the amnesty stops short of granting citizenship. That will come as a surprise to the Tea Partiers who\u2019ve heard his rousing speeches.\n\nIn short, Cruz is (1) bamboozling the base on amnesty while (2) he gooses them on defunding Obamacare. In the course of (1) he appears to make the sort of gross political misjudgment familiar to followers of (2). For example, according to the NYT\u2018s story,\n\nMr. Cruz said the Obama administration and partisan Democrats would not yield on the citizenship requirement \u2026.\n\nHe\u2019s wrong. Of course Democrats will yield on the citizenship requirement (if that\u2019s the path to a path to legalization). In the Obamacare fight, Cruz has talked as if he might somehow force Democrats to abandon their achievement. He\u2019s wrong! He goaded House GOPs to defund the program, then seemed to throw up his hands and said the Senate was a lost cause. On immigration, he threw up his hands in the Senate and left the fight for the House. I sense a pattern\u2013in which Cruz attracts publicity but avoids victory, and then positions himself to blame others.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to make Newt Gingrich look like a self-effacing idealist. Gingrich has a Cruz-size ego, but at least he actually opposed what he said he opposed\u2013and when he provoked a government shutdown, he actually believed the tactic would work. Cruz doesn\u2019t have that excuse.\n\nP.S.: Cruz\u2019s www.securebordersnow.com is now strangely blank, with no petition language at all. Hmm.\n\n_____\n\nWhat if God has no taste? The jewel-like figure that explains the universe looks like something you\u2019d leave on the shelf at Bed Bath & Beyond. \u2026\n\n\n\n_____\n\nYou Go First, Part XVIII: \u201cTests on the [Obamacare price] calculator initially scheduled to begin months ago only started this week at some insurers.\u201d Luckily, Ezra Klein\u2019s authoritative juicebox Wonkblog tells me not to worry. \u2026\n\n_____", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mickey Kaus", "description": "Hey, Look at Me Fail: Isn't it obvious that Ted Cruz is in it for Ted Cruz?
