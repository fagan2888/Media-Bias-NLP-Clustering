Yale Health Plan, 2016 WL 1426291 (2d Cir. Apr. 12, 2016), addressed various issues that could arise during a plan administrator\u2019s review of a participant\u2019s benefit claim, appeal and any ensuing litigation. The Second Circuit held that, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA):\n\nWhen denying a claim for benefits, a plan administrator\u2019s failure to comply with the US Department of Labor\u2019s (DOL) claims procedure regulations in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503\u20101 will result in the plan administrator\u2019s claim determination receiving no deference on review in federal court, unless the plan\u2019s claims procedures fully conform to regulatory requirements and the plan administrator can establish that any failure was inadvertent and harmless;\n\nCivil penalties are not available to a plan participant or beneficiary for a plan administrator\u2019s failure to comply with the claims procedure regulations; and\n\nA plan administrator\u2019s failure to comply with the DOL\u2019s claims procedure regulations could warrant the introduction of additional evidence outside the administrative record if the claim determination is challenged in litigation.\n\nBackground\n\nIn Halo, the plaintiff was a college student who was insured under the university\u2019s health plan. The plaintiff underwent eye surgery with doctors who were outside of the plan\u2019s network. The university\u2019s health plan stated that treatment with an out-of-network provider was covered under the plan only if it constituted an emergency or if the plan preauthorized the treatment.\n\nBecause the participant\u2019s surgery did not meet the plan\u2019s coverage requirements for out-of-network treatment, the plan administrator denied the plaintiff\u2019s claim for coverage. In her subsequent lawsuit, the plaintiff alleged that the plan and the plan administrator violated the DOL\u2019s claims procedure regulations with respect to both the timing and content of the claim denials.\n\nThe US District Court for the District of Connecticut held that (1) when exercising discretionary authority to deny a benefit claim, a plan\u2019s failure to establish or follow reasonable claims procedures in accordance with the DOL\u2019s regulations entitles a claimant to de novo review of the claim in federal court, unless the plan \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with the regulation, in which case an arbitrary and capricious standard would apply to the federal court\u2019s review of the claim; and (2) a plan administrator\u2019s failure to follow the DOL\u2019s regulations may result in unspecified civil penalties. On review, the Second Circuit vacated and remanded the district court\u2019s decision.\n\nStandard of Review\n\nThe primary issue in Halo focused on what review standard a court should apply when a plan fails to comply with the DOL\u2019s claims procedure regulations: (1) a de novo standard, which allows a court to take a fresh look at the decision without deference; or (2) a much less exacting arbitrary and capricious review standard, which merely requires the plan administrator to interpret a plan\u2019s provisions reasonably. After examining regulatory guidance and applicable case law, the Second Circuit concluded that when denying a benefit claim, a plan\u2019s failure to comply with the DOL\u2019s claims procedure regulations will result in that claim being reviewed de novo in federal court, unless the plan has otherwise established procedures in full conformity with the regulations and can establish that its failure to comply with the DOL\u2019s claims procedures when reviewing the benefit claim was inadvertent and harmless. The Second Circuit rejected the lower court\u2019s substantial compliance doctrine and cautioned that, while minor deviations from the claims procedure regulations may occur, \u201csuch deviations should not be tolerated lightly.\u201d\n\nCivil Penalties\n\nThe Second Circuit also rejected the district court\u2019s ruling that civil penalties are available to a participant when a plan fails to comply with the DOL\u2019s claims procedures. The Second Circuit found that the district court\u2019s finding that civil penalties could attach to failures to provide a full and fair review was not supported by the regulations or ERISA.\n\nAdministrative Record\n\nIn reviewing a claim denial, regardless of the review standard, a district court typically limits its review to the administrative record\u2014the documents and information reviewed and considered by the plan administrator in rendering its claim decision. When there is good cause, however, a district court may exercise its discretion to consider additional evidence outside of the administrative record. The Second Circuit has previously held that a conflict of interest in the entity tasked with reviewing a benefit claim could constitute good cause and warrant the review and consideration of additional evidence. In Halo, the Second Circuit stated that good cause could also be expanded to include a plan\u2019s failure to comply with the DOL\u2019s claims procedures when that failure impacts the administrative record\u2019s development. The Second Circuit therefore held that a plan\u2019s failure to comply with the DOL\u2019s claims procedures may, in the district court\u2019s discretion, constitute good cause warranting the introduction of additional evidence outside the administrative record. The Second Circuit remanded this determination to the district court.\n\nHalo\u2019s Impact on Plan Sponsors and Administrators\n\nThe Halo decision presents a mixed message to employers. On the positive side, the Second Circuit reaffirmed that civil penalties are not available to plaintiffs who sue the plan alleging a violation of the DOL\u2019s claims procedures. On the negative side, the Second Circuit\u2019s decision enhances a plaintiff\u2019s ability to introduce additional evidence that was not included in the administrative record. More importantly, the Second Circuit lowered the bar for a plaintiff to argue that a de novo review standard should be applied in the face of administrative review errors. While the general rule in most circuits is that substantial compliance with the DOL\u2019s claims regulations will not change the standard of review from arbitrary and capricious to de novo\u2014even in the face of errors in the claims review process\u2014the Halo decision increases the burden on plans and plan administrators to prove compliance with the DOL\u2019s claims regulations in order to preserve deferential review. This case provides an important reminder for employers to establish written claim review procedures that conform to the DOL\u2019s claims regulations and adhere to a disciplined administrative procedure when reviewing benefit claims and appeals. These procedures include, as the Second Circuit notes, enhanced claims procedures for health and welfare plans in situations governed by the Affordable Care Act. Given the increased employee protections in ERISA claim review procedures over the past decade (see, for example, DOL\u2019s New Disability Claim Rules Add to a Plan Administrator\u2019s Duties under Welfare and Retirement Benefit Plans), employers should review their benefit plans\u2019 claims procedures, evaluate their compliance with applicable law, and make updates as necessary.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/second-circuit-applies-stricter-rules-47844/", "site_name": "JD Supra", "image": "http://www.jdsupra.com/showThumbnail.aspx?img=5223_362.jpg&size=og", "type": "article", "title": "Second Circuit Applies Stricter Rules for a Plan Administrator\u2019s Noncompliance with Benefit Claims Regulations | JD Supra"}, "twitter": {"description": "In Depth - On April 12, 2016, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Halo v.
