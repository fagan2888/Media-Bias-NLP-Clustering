Some of its defenders certainly feel that way. Over the past year or two, some of the male-centric institutions in American life that have at least partly resisted the incursions of feminism have come under significant cultural pressure: the National Football League, the United States military and even the fraternity party, sacred bonding ritual of future golf-playing insurance executives and other avatars of middle-middle guy-ness. Fairly or not, those environments have become identified with a widespread social problem that is surely not limited to jocks, jarheads and frat boys: the persistence of rape, domestic violence and other crimes against women that are rarely reported and still more rarely prosecuted, and whose perpetrators are too often protected by a code of male silence and secrecy.\n\nIf the panicky, defensive identity crisis of America\u2019s declining white majority is a principal driving force in our nation\u2019s bitterly divided political and cultural life (as I discussed here a few weeks ago, in the wake of Ferguson), so is the rearguard defense of masculinity. When Rush Limbaugh complains that nanny-state regulations on conduct are \u201cfeminizing\u201d football, or the national leader of an elite fraternity writes an op-ed blaming drunken young women as the real villains in a perceived campus rape epidemic (rather than, say, rapists), it\u2019s hard to say which feels stronger \u2014 the cluelessness or the desperation. As with the Caucasian rush to define the cop who shot Michael Brown as simultaneously the hero and victim of that tragic episode, this circling of the wagons around embattled manhood seems both perverse and unnecessary.\n\nOf course the two responses are intimately connected, not least because convincing oneself that men are a persecuted and disenfranchised group requires about the same level of mental gymnastics as explaining away the enormous social, cultural and financial advantages held by white people in American society. If anything should be obvious about this murky situation, I guess it\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s not about facts, but please indulge me while I air out a few. It\u2019s true that men hold only 81 percent of the 535 seats in Congress, and roughly 94 percent of the top executive jobs in the Fortune 1000, and that represents an enormous statistical shift from the days when both those numbers were close to 100 percent. Across all races, all socioeconomic classes and all kinds of employment, men are paid more than women, by an average of more than 25 percent. That disparity has barely shifted in recent decades, but at least employment listings no longer come in two different categories, as my mother can remember from the 1950s: \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d and \u201cHelp Wanted: Women.\u201d\n\nBut the collective male freakout that produces nervous TV gags about \u201cboobs on the ground\u201d in the Middle East, or an Oklahoma Highway Patrol captain advising women not to get pulled over by cops if they don\u2019t want to get raped by them, is not about anything as quantifiable as loss of material advantage. I agree, by the way, that both statements were blunders: The Fox News guy didn\u2019t realize he was coming off as a pig, and the Oklahoma trooper didn\u2019t consciously intend to blame women for the crimes of depraved cops. But that kind of public \u201cmisstatement,\u201d by someone who ought to know better, is actually more revealing than all the overtly misogynistic trollery on the Internet. The masculinity backlash is about perception and psychology, specifically the perception that \u201ctraditional\u201d gender roles are being undermined and that male-coded zones like the football field and the frat house are being invaded by an alien ideology.\n\nLGBT soldiers serve openly in the military, and same-sex marriage will almost certainly go nationwide within the next few years. Transgender people are more visible and vocal than at any time in recorded history (although we have a long, long way to go on that one). A gay defensive lineman may well get into an NFL game this year \u2014 with the Dallas Cowboys, of all teams \u2013 and other pro players have come out in basketball and soccer. What comes next? In the paranoid universe of Limbaugh listeners, Obamabot drones from the Feminazi Panopticon will soon be monitoring basement poker games for inappropriate jokes, to be reported to all employers, ex-wives and local school boards for social-media humiliation and reeducation.\n\nBut that kind of parody is a little too easy. It\u2019s more difficult to recognize the genuine cultural split here, and to see that for many men (and more than a few women), this is a subject of genuine pain and bewilderment. It feels as if areas of public life they were raised to venerate as unchanging symbols of American virtue and rectitude are under unfair assault. That\u2019s how I interpret all those Baltimore Ravens fans (some of them female) showing up at the team\u2019s first home game in Ray Rice jerseys, or all those Washington Redskins fans rallying around their team\u2019s patently derogatory nickname. It\u2019s an effort to draw a line in the sand, to resist the high-minded dictates of elite authority, to insist that some things are sacred and that cultural change goes this far and no further. People on the cultural left, with their DIY handicrafts and homegrown tomatoes, have a similar impulse to resist the onrushing force of a political economy built on constant revolution and reinvention, a world, as Karl Marx observed 166 years ago, in which \u201call fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away \u2026 all that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Beneath the freakout over frats, football and feminism lies a yearning for the lost world of 20th-century manhood", "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Beneath the freakout over frats, football and feminism lies a yearning for the lost world of 20th-century manhood", "title": "Rape, domestic violence and football: The last battle for American masculinity", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/27/rape_domestic_violence_and_football_the_last_battle_for_american_masculinity/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/ray_rice3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Beneath the freakout over frats, football and feminism lies a yearning for the lost world of 20th-century manhood", "creator": "@andohehir", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/ray_rice3.jpg", "title": "Rape, domestic violence and football: The last battle for American masculinity", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Rape, domestic violence and football: The last battle for American masculinity", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, domestic violence, Editor's Picks, Football, Gender, Gender Gap, Gender politics, Gender Roles, Masculinity, National Football League, NFL, Rape, ray rice, Ray Rice case, Sexual abuse, Sexual assault, Spousal abuse, Spousal violence", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd03cd\"", "article_summary": "Topics: domestic violence, Editor's Picks, Football, Gender, Gender Gap, Gender politics, Gender Roles, Masculinity, National Football League, NFL, Rape, ray rice, Ray Rice case, Sexual abuse, Sexual assault, Spousal abuse, Spousal violence, Life News, Politics NewsIs traditional masculinity \u2014 assuming for a moment that we have any idea what that term means \u2014 under attack?\nLGBT soldiers serve openly in the military, and same-sex marriage will almost certainly go nationwide within the next few years.\nIt feels as if areas of public life they were raised to venerate as unchanging symbols of American virtue and rectitude are under unfair assault.\nAcross all races, all socioeconomic classes and all kinds of employment, men are paid more than women, by an average of more than 25 percent.\nTransgender people are more visible and vocal than at any time in recorded history (although we have a long, long way to go on that one)."}
