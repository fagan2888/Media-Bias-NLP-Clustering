Col. Allen B. West\n\nPalm Beach Gardens, Florida, January 13, 2014 \u2013 It is a sure indicator that things are not going well for President Obama when a well orchestrated, scripted, and choreographed speech is given complete with the backdrop of well-placed Americans as stage props. Such was the case last week with not just one, but two speeches.\n\nI am reminded of the story in Russian folklore of Minister to Empress Catherine II, Grigory Potemkin. Legend has it that Potemkin built fake settlements along the banks of the Dnieper River to cover up the turmoil and poverty in the Crimea as Catherine the Great rode past.\n\nSo why did the Obama administration deem it necessary to conduct two speeches last week?\n\nOne speech focused on a socialist theme of income inequality, increasing the minimum wage (I thought those positions were entry level, not a career), and an emergency extension of unemployment benefits (for the 11th time \u2014 does that constitute an emergency or a permanent government entitlement?).\n\nThe other speech outlined a new government spending junket called \u201cpromise zones.\u201d You may recall the late Jack Kemp and Reagan economic advisor Art Laffer proposed urban economic empowerment zones focusing on capital tax reforms that would enable private capital investment into inner cities. That seems like a better idea, and that is what Senator Rand Paul proposes for Detroit.\n\nGiven the challenges facing President Obama it is clear why he felt the need to create a Potemkin Village of his own. Let\u2019s have a quick review of what Obama would rather cover up.\n\nFirst, he would rather Americans stop thinking about Obamacare, especially as many are uncertain as to their healthcare coverage status. We are told millions are signing up, but how many are actually signing up for Medicaid and not actually paying? As a matter of fact, how many have paid at all?\n\n...", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.created": "01-14-14", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:cGFnZTE=", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dcterms.modified": "01-14-14", "og": {"url": "http://nation.foxnews.com/2014/01/14/allen-west-obama-potemkin-president", "site_name": "FoxNation.com", "image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/p010714ps-0145.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Allen West: Obama is the Potemkin President"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/p010714ps-0145.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Allen West: Obama is the Potemkin President\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2014\\/01\\/14\\/allen-west-obama-potemkin-president\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/p010714ps-0145.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox News\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-14T20:51:56-05:00\",\"identifier\":\"60506\"}", "prism.section": "nation", "dc.date": "2016-05-24", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Allen West: Obama is the Potemkin President\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2014\\/01\\/14\\/allen-west-obama-potemkin-president\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/p010714ps-0145.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox Nation\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-14T20:51:56-05:00\",\"post_id\":\"60506\"}", "fb": {"admins": 100000924384522, "app_id": 155242997843474}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "Allen West: Obama is the Potemkin President"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2850\"", "article_summary": "Given the challenges facing President Obama it is clear why he felt the need to create a Potemkin Village of his own.\nI am reminded of the story in Russian folklore of Minister to Empress Catherine II, Grigory Potemkin.\nWestPalm Beach Gardens, Florida, January 13, 2014 \u2013 It is a sure indicator that things are not going well for President Obama when a well orchestrated, scripted, and choreographed speech is given complete with the backdrop of well-placed Americans as stage props.\nWe are told millions are signing up, but how many are actually signing up for Medicaid and not actually paying?\nLet\u2019s have a quick review of what Obama would rather cover up."}
