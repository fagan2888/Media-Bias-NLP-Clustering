He notes that the symptoms of depression are similar to those of infection: \u201cPatients experience loss of energy; they commonly have difficulty getting out of bed and lose interest in the world around them. Although our Western conceptualization puts affective symptoms front-and-center, non-Western patients who meet DSM criteria for major depression report primarily somatic symptoms.\u201d\n\nAnd, he writes, we already know that infectious agents can affect our emotions \u2014 he points to Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that\u2019s now somewhat famous (at least among science lovers) for its striking impact on its hosts. T. gondii can make rats like the scent of cat urine (causing obvious problems for the rats). In humans, it may have serious psychological effects \u2014 Dr. Canli cites research linking T. gondii with suicide. \u201cYet,\u201d he writes, \u201clarge-scale studies of major depression and T. gondii or systematic searches to discover other potential parasitic infections have not yet been conducted.\u201d\n\nHe believes researchers should compare tissue samples from depressed patients with those from non-depressed people, looking for evidence both of known pathogens and of new ones.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/11/depression_may_be_caused_by_infection.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Depression may be caused by infection"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Turhan Canli, a professor of integrative neuroscience at Stony Brook University, \u2026[is] looking at the possibility that depression could be caused by an infection.\nIn a paper published in the journal Biology of Mood and Anxiety Disorders, he lays out his case for rethinking depression as a response to infection.\nHe notes that the symptoms of depression are similar to those of infection: \u201cPatients experience loss of energy; they commonly have difficulty getting out of bed and lose interest in the world around them.\nIn humans, it may have serious psychological effects \u2014 Dr. Canli cites research linking T. gondii with suicide.\nT. gondii can make rats like the scent of cat urine (causing obvious problems for the rats)."}
