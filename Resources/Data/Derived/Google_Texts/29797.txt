Lafayette police have arrested two men in connection with the slaying of Nathaniel Tallman, whose body was found in eastern Wyoming on Thursday.

The department Saturday reported they had arrested Russell Britton, 58. He was being held in Boulder County Jail on charges of first-degree murder. Moises Cazares Mendez, 26, also was arrested and was in the Las Colinas Detention Facility in San Diego on $1 million bail.

Tallman, a 25-year-old graduate of Monarch High, was last seen Jan. 23 leaving his Lafayette home.

His 2014 Mitsubishi Lancer was found three weeks later at a Boulder office complex off Foothills Highway.

His remains were discovered Thursday near U.S. 85, about 10 miles north of Lusk, the county seat of Niobrara County.

The crime scene where the body was discovered was processed by the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigations.

Friends and family of Tallman’s had offered a $10,000 reward for information about his location.

Lafayette police deferred all questions to the Boulder County District Attorney’s Office.

In a statement, Lafayette police said more than 17 law enforcement organizations across northern Colorado, Wyoming and North Dakota, as well as the FBI and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, assisted in the investigation of Tallman’s disappearance.
