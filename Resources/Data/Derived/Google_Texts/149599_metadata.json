(NYSE:MOH) today announced that it is providing its outlook and guidance for fiscal year 2016.\n\nThe following table presents the Company\u2019s outlook for fiscal year 2016: (1)\n\nPremium Revenue $15.7B Health Insurer Fee Revenue (2) $335M Premium Tax Revenue $450M Service Revenue $550M Investment and Other Income $40M Total Revenue $17.0B Total Medical Care Costs $13.8B Medical Care Ratio (3) 88.2% Total Cost of Service Revenue $490M General & Administrative Expenses $1.4B G&A Ratio (4) 8.0% Premium Tax Expense $450M Health Insurer Fee Expense $220M Depreciation & Amortization $140M Interest and Other Expense $100M Income Before Income Taxes $460M EBITDA(5) $720M Effective Tax Rate 56% After Tax Margin 1.2% Diluted Shares 58M Diluted EPS $3.50 Adjusted net income per share(5) $3.86\n\n_____________________\n\n(1) All amounts are estimates; actual results may differ materially. See our risk factors as discussed in our Form 10-K and other filings.\n\n(2) Outlook assumes full reimbursement of the Health Insurer Fee and related tax effects in 2016.\n\n(3) Medical Care Ratio represents Medical Care Costs as a percentage of Premium Revenue.\n\n(4) G&A Ratio computed as a percentage of Total Revenue.\n\n(5) See reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure on next page.\n\nThe Company uses two non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental metrics in evaluating its financial performance, making financing and business decisions, and forecasting and planning for future periods. For these reasons, management believes such measures are useful supplemental measures to investors in comparing the Company's performance to the performance of other public companies in the health care industry. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to, and not as substitutes for or superior to, GAAP measures.\n\nThe first of these non-GAAP measures is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The following table reconciles net income, which the Company believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA:(1)\n\n2016\n\nOutlook Net income $202M Adjustments: Depreciation, and amortization of intangible assets and capitalized software $161M Interest expense $100M Income tax expense $257M EBITDA $720M\n\nThe second of these non-GAAP measures is adjusted net income (including adjusted net income per diluted share). The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure helps investors better understand the impact that acquisitions have on our earnings, exclusive of non-cash charges. Effective as of January 1, 2016, the Company will no longer exclude amortization of convertible notes and lease financing obligations from its presentation of adjusted net income (and adjusted net income per share). The Company made this change because various capital transactions that it completed in 2015 reduced the Company\u2019s relative reliance on convertible notes and lease financing as sources of capital. The Company believes that this change will enhance the comparability of this non-GAAP measure with the corresponding non-GAAP measure used by the Company\u2019s competitors. The following table reconciles net income, which the Company believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net income:(1) (2)\n\n2016 Outlook Dollars Per Share Net income $202M $3.50 Adjustments, net of tax: Amortization of intangible assets 21M 0.36 Adjusted net income $223M $3.86\n\n______________________\n\n(1) All amounts are estimates and subject to change.\n\n(2) Computation assumes 58 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\n\n2016 Business Outlook and Investor Meeting\n\nAs has been the Company\u2019s past practice, it will discuss its 2016 business outlook and strategy at its Investor Day Conference webcast and presentation to be held on February 11, 2016, at the Le Parker Meridien Hotel in New York City from 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.
