In fact, it was 18 games in two years since an Arvada victory \u2014 until Friday night.\n\nIn a game where junior cornerback Deondre Gordon jumped a slant route and walked into the end zone, the Bulldogs broke their long losing streak, beating Sheridan 27-14 at Trailblazer Stadium in Lakewood.\n\nArvada\u2019s last win had been a 48-47 overtime victory over Skyview on Sept. 13, 2013. And since 2004 the Bulldogs have an 18-94 record, going 0-10 in four of those seasons.\n\n\u201cOur overall theme for the week was \u2018resilience,\u2019 \u201d said first-year Bulldogs coach Richard Bortner. \u201cWe used a quote to describe that \u2014 \u2018I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBortner, who is a head coach for the first time, knows what it takes to rejuvenate a struggling program.\n\nBortner coached with current Ponderosa coach Jaron Cohen in 2013 at Hinkley. At that time Cohen was a first-year head coach, earning praise for his success that year while leading Hinkley to its first state playoff berth in Class 5A football in more than a decade.\n\nThis year Bortner\u2019s 25 players are barely enough for a varsity roster, especially when competing in the tough 3A Metro North conference.\n\n\u201cDefensively we focused on breaking down to tackle and not overrunning in our pursuit,\u201d Bortner said. \u201cOffensively we focused on execution and being at our best during the breaks in the game.\u201d\n\nRemember how the theme of the week was resilience?\n\nLate in the third quarter starting quarterback Ian Colman and backup quarterback Levi Mair left the game because of injuries \u2014 on the same play.\n\n\u201cOur offensive line, running back Micheal Lechuga and QB Todd Nelson \u2014 he hasn\u2019t taken a snap in practice this year \u2014 came together to run the ball down the field and close out the game,\u201d Bortner said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Arvada High football finally is back on track", "title": "Arvada High football finally is back on track", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/05/arvada-high-football-finally-is-back-on-track/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-05T20:04:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-05T20:04:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOur overall theme for the week was \u2018resilience,\u2019 \u201d said first-year Bulldogs coach Richard Bortner.\nIt was a long time since Arvada won a football game.\nIn fact, it was 18 games in two years since an Arvada victory \u2014 until Friday night.\n\u201cOur offensive line, running back Micheal Lechuga and QB Todd Nelson \u2014 he hasn\u2019t taken a snap in practice this year \u2014 came together to run the ball down the field and close out the game,\u201d Bortner said.\nLate in the third quarter starting quarterback Ian Colman and backup quarterback Levi Mair left the game because of injuries \u2014 on the same play."}
