Wichmann said in the company\u2019s 2015 fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nThe company said it ended 2015 with about 500,000 customers from the Obamacare exchanges \u2014 a number that has grown to about 700,000, as open enrollment extended into mid-January.\n\nIt expects that number to spike to just shy of 800,000 by the end of the signup season on Jan. 31, and then recede as people drop out of the market and they decline to pursue additional customers.\n\n\u201cWe are not pursuing membership growth, and have taken a comprehensive set of actions to contain membership and sharpen performance over the balance of 2016,\u201d Mr. Wichmann said.\n\nFor its part, the Health and Human Services Department reiterated what it said in November \u2014 that major insurers such as Aetna and Anthem are still committed to the program, so \u201cstatements from one issuer are not reflective of the marketplace\u2019s overall strength going forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore Americans are getting covered, and we\u2019re confident this positive trend will continue,\u201d HHS spokesman Benjamin Wakana said.\n\nThe administration said Tuesday it is buying more TV advertising in metropolitan areas with a large number of uninsured residents, while HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell and HealthCare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan will whip up enrollment in trips to the Carolinas, Florida, Texas and Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n\u201cWe are squarely focused on what more we can do to reach more people with this important information before time runs out,\u201d CMS spokeswoman Lori Lodes said in a written update for reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re doubling down in these final days to do everything we can to make sure each uninsured American understands their options for affordable coverage at HealthCare.gov.\u201d\n\nThe administration reminded customers that they face a tax penalty of $695 or 2.5 percent of income above the filing threshold\u2014 whichever is higher \u2014 for staying uncovered in 2016.\n\nOfficials say they will not extend open enrollment for people who miss the cutoff, meaning someone would need to get married or face some other type of significant life change to sign up on an exchange before open enrollment starts again.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nation's largest insurer said Tuesday it still might withdraw from the Obamacare marketplace by
