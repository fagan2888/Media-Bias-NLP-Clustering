"article_text": "The nuclear agreement between Iran, the U.S. and five other world powers merely places Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions \u201con hold\u201d and undercuts the international community\u2019s ability to condemn the regime if it violates the deal, the United Kingdom\u2019s former defense secretary said Thursday.\n\nLiam Fox, a conservative member of Parliament, said the P5+1 \u201ccaved\u201d to Iran\u2019s demands by conceding to immediate sanctions relief rather than implementing the West\u2019s original condition of a gradual, rewards-based sanctions lift.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve given everything away at the outset and it\u2019s all predicated on hope, a hope that they will change,\u201d he said.\n\nThe $150 billion Tehran is estimated to receive in unfrozen assets, he said, will allow the regime to rapidly update its aging military and civilian infrastructure, calling it \u201cridiculous\u201d to argue Iran will use most of the money to pay off debts.\n\nIran\u2019s violent proxies, including Hezbollah, Hamas and the Assad regime in Syria, will also profit from the sanctions relief, Fox continued.\n\n\u201cIf [Iran] regarded them as a priority for funding when they were already being very tightly squeezed by financial sanctions, then they\u2019re likely to see them as prime candidates for extra funding when the tsunami of unfrozen assets hits them.\u201d\n\nGiven the scope of money Tehran is expected to receive, Fox said the impact of future sanctions would likely diminish over time, expressing \u201cextreme skepticism\u201d of the agreement\u2019s insurance against cheating in the form of snapback sanctions.\n\nOnce domestic industrial interests begin to operate and make profits in Tehran, Western governments will find it difficult to reimpose sanctions even if Iran violates the accord, he added.\n\nFox said the P5+1 negotiators also bowed to Iran\u2019s demands by including an embargo lift on ballistic missile shipments into Tehran in the final accord.\n\nTo him, the \u201cgreatest surrender\u201d of the international community was in the final inspection requirements, which leave investigations of suspicious sites in the hands of the United Nations\u2019 International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n\u201cAnything other than totally unrestricted and unfettered access is unacceptable because we all know in light of the Iranians behavior in the past how they manipulate any weakness in the terms of the IAEA\u2019s access.\u201d\n\nHe called the agreement a \u201cfulfillment of the Iranians wish list\u201d that was about \u201cpolitics more than it was about security.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at the agreement itself, compare it to our initial demands and Iran\u2019s initial demands and see who it ended up being closer to,\u201d Fox said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liam Fox, a conservative member of Parliament, said the P5+1 \u201ccaved\u201d to Iran\u2019s demands by conceding to
