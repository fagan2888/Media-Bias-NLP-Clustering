The companies are hell-bent on taking away health care benefits already won.\"\n\nHe said that union leaders at the meeting this morning talked about a steady rise in price gouging \"everywhere\" by health care companies. \"Add in the mergers and you see what they are up to.\"\n\nHe said that the unions recognize that although the Affordable Health Care Act now in place was a step forward it is not adequate if workers' wages and standards of living are top be protected.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has already called for passage of single-payer health insurance, \"which would be the only solution to this problem,\" the source said.\n\nThe resolution passed at the closed-door session of the AFL-CIO executive council this morning incorporates the demand for single-payer health insurance into the federation's Raising Wages campaign.\n\nOn other matters the source said the federation's political committee has called for waiting before the AFL-CIO makes a presidential endorsement. \"That has been the position for a while,\" the source said but that position will be \"re-opened,\" the source said, for a full discussion by the executive council tomorrow.\n\nAsked if that move was because of pressure by labor supporters of one presidential candidate or another, the source said it was motivated by a desire to have a full and open discussion of presidential campaign endorsements by representatives of all of the nation's unions.\n\nPhoto: National Nurses United/Flickr", "article_metadata": {"generator": "SilverStripe - http://www.silverstripe.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b1e\"", "article_summary": "The resolution passed at the closed-door session of the AFL-CIO executive council this morning incorporates the demand for single-payer health insurance into the federation's Raising Wages campaign.\n- Union leaders meeting here today in closed session passed a resolution that calls upon the AFL-CIO to add a demand for single-payer heath insurance to the federation's Raising Wages campaign.\nThe AFL-CIO has already called for passage of single-payer health insurance, \"which would be the only solution to this problem,\" the source said.\n\"Essentially, the union presidents feel that what is being gained in wages can be taken away in health care costs,\" he explained.\nHe said that union leaders at the meeting this morning talked about a steady rise in price gouging \"everywhere\" by health care companies."}
