The terror I had felt, the fear, the certainty that I was about to die and the hope that it would be quick and without too much pain meant nothing to it. I wasn\u2019t important enough for it to have any feelings at all about me. It wasn\u2019t demonstrating its power or considering me at all.\n\nAfter it had happened, I had indeed recognized this. I felt no need to act against the elephant, to exact revenge or to advocate catching it or killing it as \u201crogue.\u201d Leakey only put into words what I already knew.\n\nIn \u201cShooting an Elephant,\u201d George Orwell looks at another side of this, describing the pressure he had felt in Burma when an elephant there killed a local man:\n\nI glanced round at the crowd that had followed me. It was an immense crowd, two thousand at the least and growing every minute. It blocked the road for a long distance on either side. I looked at the sea of yellow faces above the garish clothes-faces all happy and excited over this bit of fun, all certain that the elephant was going to be shot. They were watching me as they would watch a conjurer about to perform a trick. They did not like me, but with the magical rifle in my hands I was momentarily worth watching. And suddenly I realized that I should have to shoot the elephant after all. The people expected it of me and I had got to do it; I could feel their two thousand wills pressing me forward, irresistibly.\n\nTo Orwell\u2014and, to his credit, he understood this\u2014the elephant had to become, simply, a thing. Or rather, he had to look at it that way (though, as he writes, that was difficult for him, if not impossible in the long run).\n\nAt the end of the essay, Orwell makes his sad point: \u201cI had done it solely to avoid looking a fool.\u201d Orwell\u2019s political activism arose in part because of the understanding that grew within him during his time in the Burmese police about power and the reasons behind its actions\u2013including not looking foolish, something that endangers power.\n\nIn The New York Times this week, David Brooks writes about \u201cShooting an Elephant\u201d:\n\nIn his essay nobody feels like they have any power. The locals, the imperial victims, sure didn\u2019t. Orwell, the guy with the gun, didn\u2019t feel like he had any. The imperialists back in London were too far away.\n\nBrooks misses Orwell\u2019s point\u2014not surprising, for Orwell was writing from a leftist stance diametrically opposed to the conservative ideology Brooks long ago rallied to and, for all of his protestations, stays true to. Orwell did have power, and he acted on it. And he knew it. Power, Orwell understood (and this is something Brooks ignores), has one overriding need\u2014and that is to protect itself. Orwell had protected his power\u2013and did not like it.\n\nRunning away from my own elephant, I had headed toward a group of people watching from about 100 meters away. As I neared, they did not run, so I knew the elephant was no longer after me. They welcomed me, asked if I were OK, and we all turned to watch as the now-distant elephant lifted each of my cameras, tasted them, then grabbed my bag by the handle, twirled it around, and threw it. The elephant had been heading back into the forest after attacking one of their grain storage huts; it continued on its way and we all went home. Powerless but, at least, we had survived.", "article_metadata": {"description": "David Brooks misreads George Orwell essay -- and arrives at wrong conclusion about the failure of GOP intellectuals", "title": "David Brooks gets this wrong, too: He misses his own complicity in letting the GOP run off the rails", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "David Brooks misreads George Orwell essay -- and arrives at wrong conclusion about the failure of GOP intellectuals", "title": "David Brooks gets this wrong, too: He misses his own complicity in letting the GOP run off the rails", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/22/david_brooks_gets_this_wrong_too_he_misses_his_own_complicity_in_letting_the_gop_run_off_the_rails/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/david_brooks2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "David Brooks misreads George Orwell essay -- and arrives at wrong conclusion about the failure of GOP intellectuals", "title": "David Brooks gets this wrong, too: He misses his own complicity in letting the GOP run off the rails", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/david_brooks2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Aaron Barlow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, David Brooks, Editor's Picks, George Orwell, Media Criticism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In The New York Times this week, David Brooks writes about \u201cShooting an Elephant\u201d:In his essay nobody feels like they have any power.\nPower, Orwell understood (and this is something Brooks ignores), has one overriding need\u2014and that is to protect itself.\nBrooks misses Orwell\u2019s point\u2014not surprising, for Orwell was writing from a leftist stance diametrically opposed to the conservative ideology Brooks long ago rallied to and, for all of his protestations, stays true to.\nRunning away from my own elephant, I had headed toward a group of people watching from about 100 meters away.\nAs I neared, they did not run, so I knew the elephant was no longer after me."}
