Pennsylvania\u2019s 13th district contains parts of Philadelphia and Montgomery County. Allyson Schwartz is retiring this seat to pursue the governorship.\n\n\u201cMarjorie\u2019s experience, both on the Hill and around the globe working to empower women in emerging democracies as head of Women\u2019s Campaign International, is that of a fighter who understands the importance of getting more women to the decision-making table,\u201d Richards stated. \u201cI want that kind of leader fighting for Montgomery County in the US Congress.\u201d\n\nRichards ran on a ticket with Josh Shapiro when the two were elected in 2011. Since then the two have coordinated their political activities very closely, which could mean that Richards\u2019 decision to back Margolies likely had Shapiro\u2019s go-ahead.\n\n\u201cWinning Commissioner Richards\u2019 endorsement among a field of strong candidates makes this a very big day for my campaign,\u201d Margolies said. \u201cThroughout this campaign I intend to carry a message that Washington can, once again, work for families in Montgomery County if we send representatives to D.C. who fight for something larger than their political career.\u201d\n\nMargolies has heavily promoted the female public officials that have endorsed her campaign so far. For instance, last month she announced the support of all five Philly City Councilwomen.\n\nOther candidates in the Democratic primary include physician/activist Valerie Arkoosh, State Rep. Brendan Boyle, and State Sen. Daylin Leach.\n\nNovember 20th, 2013 | Posted in Congress, Front Page Stories, Top Stories | 2 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Montgomery County Commissioner Leslie Richards endorsed Marjorie Margolies\u2019 campaign to take back her old seat in Congress.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/pa-13-montco-commissioner-richards-backs-margolies/53093/", "description": "Montgomery County Commissioner Leslie Richards endorsed Marjorie Margolies\u2019 campaign to take back her old seat in Congress.", "title": "PA-13: Montco Commissioner Richards Backs Margolies"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "keywords": "marjorie margolies,pa 13,endorsement,montgomery county", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc0aa\"", "article_summary": "PA-13: Montco Commissioner Richards Backs MargoliesWritten by Nick Field, Contributing WriterMarjorie Margolies scored another endorsement today for her congressional campaign, this time from Montgomery County Commissioner Leslie Richards.\n\u201cWinning Commissioner Richards\u2019 endorsement among a field of strong candidates makes this a very big day for my campaign,\u201d Margolies said.\nPennsylvania\u2019s 13th district contains parts of Philadelphia and Montgomery County.\n\u201cI want that kind of leader fighting for Montgomery County in the US Congress.\u201dRichards ran on a ticket with Josh Shapiro when the two were elected in 2011.\nSince then the two have coordinated their political activities very closely, which could mean that Richards\u2019 decision to back Margolies likely had Shapiro\u2019s go-ahead."}
