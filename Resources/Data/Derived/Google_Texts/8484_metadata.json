We didn't do special teams today, so it was good to see execution out of both the guys. I'll know a little more when I go back and watch the film.\"\n\nColeman Key\n\nThe only knock on either of the two contenders for the starting quarterback job was Key lost the handle of a couple of balls, with the offense able to recover both times.\n\nIn the first key test of camp as the two look to replace Garrett Grayson, the bright spot was neither threw an interception. Stevens completed 15 of 21 passes for 198 yards and a score, while Key hit on 12 of 22 attempts for 213 yards and three touchdowns. He combined with wideout Jordon Vaden for the longest play of the scrimmage, a 59-yard scoring pass.\n\nBobo said the top three running backs all ran well, also mentioning true freshman Izzy Matthews making gains on the field with the third string.\n\nFive different backs had a carry of 12 yards or better, with Treyous Jarrells providing the biggest hitter, a 47-yarder to account for most of his 59 yards on eight carries. Jasen Oden Jr. rushed for 43 yards on seven carries with a touchdown, and Matthews accounted for 40 yards on four totes, one a 17-yard scoring run.\n\nThe tempo with which the offense played gave the defense trouble from Bobo's vantage point, especially on the hottest day of camp, amplified by the artificial surface at the stadium.\n\n\"Defense, that's the thing when you go no-huddle, you get a first down or two, you start to wilter a little bit,\" he said. \"They did bow their neck on the first drive and hold the offense to a field goal, but we've got to play better defense. A lot of it is attitude and effort, of lining up and playing the next snap. You know, being able to push through.\n\n\"We've got a lot of guys banged up, we've got a lot of bumps and bruises, but off the top of my head, I don't know if we fought through like we should have. They did get a stop in one minute to win the game, they held the offense. But overall, we've got to play harder and faster defensively.\"\n\nAn area of interest for the first-year head coach heading into the scrimmage was seeing if the defense could generate a pass rush without bringing added pressure. Defensive coordinator Tyson Summers kept things simple, but outside of a couple of twists, Bobo didn't see the rush he hoped for as just one sack was recorded by Adrian Robinson.\n\nHowever, Bobo felt both linebacker Cory James and safety Kevin Pierre-Louis impressed during the day.\n\nThat was via the eye test, but Bobo will critique harder during film study Sunday. At that point, the depth chart could see some changes as the scrimmage carries more weight than does a regular practice.\n\n\"We're going to grade the film,\" Bobo said. \"I'll meet with the offense, then I'll meet with the defense and we'll talk about it, and then we'll have a better understanding (Sunday) afternoon to evening of where we go into Monday's practice with these guys and where the depth chart sits. The depth chart changes daily, but anytime you have a scrimmage, which is of a little bit more of importance, the depth chart can change and it could be a little more significant than a day-to-day change.\"\n\nRashard Higgins, Trent Matthews, Kivon Cartwright, Jordan Benson, Trey Smith and Devin Jones were all held out for various ailments, but tight end Steven Walker played after an eventful Friday evening.\n\nHe was on hand as former CSU volleyball player Deedra Foss gave birth to their baby girl, one Bobo said weighed in at 5 pounds. He said when he talked to Walker that evening, the senior said he wanted to take part in the scrimmage. Walker had one catch, but it was good for a 4-yard touchdown from Key.\n\nMike Brohard: 970-635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com and twitter.com/mbrohard", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/csu/ci_28647188/colorado-state-offense-takes-day-first-fall-scrimmage", "modificationDate": "2015-08-15T15:37:55-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0815/20150815__16rhscsufbw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Mike Brohard \n \n  Sports Editor", "description": "FORT COLLINS - Round One went to the offense.\n\nColorado State's football team scrimmaged for the first time in fall camp Saturday, and head coach Mike Bobo said the offense held the upper hand the majority of the day with quarterbacks Nick Stevens and Coleman Key both looking sharp.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:28647188:view"}, "startDate": "2015-08-15T15:34:48-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/csu/ci_28647188/colorado-state-offense-takes-day-first-fall-scrimmage", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0815/20150815__16rhscsufbw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "FORT COLLINS - Round One went to the offense.\n\nColorado State's football team scrimmaged for the first time in fall camp Saturday, and head coach Mike Bobo said the offense held the upper hand the majority of the day with quarterbacks Nick Stevens and Coleman Key both looking sharp.", "title": "Colorado State offense takes the day in first fall scrimmage"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "FORT COLLINS - Round One went to the offense.\n\nColorado State's football team scrimmaged for the first time in fall camp Saturday, and head coach Mike Bobo said the offense held the upper hand the majority of the day with quarterbacks Nick Stevens and Coleman Key both looking sharp.", "title": "Colorado State offense takes the day in first fall scrimmage", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/csu/ci_28647188/colorado-state-offense-takes-day-first-fall-scrimmage", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0815/20150815__16rhscsufbw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-15T15:34:48-0600", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2025-08-15T15:34:48-0600", "sailthru.title": "Colorado State offense takes the day in first fall scrimmage", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "CSU", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Mike BrohardSports", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0815/20150815__16rhscsufbw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-08-15T15:38:14-0600", "news_keywords": "Loveland Colorado ReporterHerald CSU Colorado State University Rams sports football basketball"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf68b\"", "article_summary": "He said when he talked to Walker that evening, the senior said he wanted to take part in the scrimmage.\nAt that point, the depth chart could see some changes as the scrimmage carries more weight than does a regular practice.\nHe combined with wideout Jordon Vaden for the longest play of the scrimmage, a 59-yard scoring pass.\n\"For the most part, I thought both executed well and moved the ball,\" Bobo said after the two-hour session at Hughes Stadium.\n\"They did bow their neck on the first drive and hold the offense to a field goal, but we've got to play better defense."}
