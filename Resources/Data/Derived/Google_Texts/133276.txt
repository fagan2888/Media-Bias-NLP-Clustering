Images: Bears lose to the Vikings 38-17

hello

The Chicago Bears were overwhelmed by the Minnesota Vikings Sunday at TCF Bank Stadium in Minneapolis losing 38-17. Vikings QB Teddy Bridgewater scored 5 TD's, throwing 17/20 for 231 yards and 4 scores and ran for a fifth TD.

The Bears QB Jay Cutler was 26/37 with 2 TD's and 1 interception.

Sunday's loss to the Vikings mathematically eliminated the 5-9 Bears from playoff contention. The Bears have now missed the playoffs in eight of the last nine seasons.

The lack of energy for the Bears' third straight game was reminiscent of the end of last year's 5-11 season.
