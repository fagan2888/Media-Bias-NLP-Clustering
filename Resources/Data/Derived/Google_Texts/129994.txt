As Representative Daniel Webster appeared as a guest on Tuesday's New Day on CNN to discuss his intention to run for Speaker of the House of Representatives, substitute co-host John Berman pressed the Florida Republican to vow to work against a government shutdown in the face of calls by some GOPers to defund Planned Parenthood.



Berman first raised the subject of government downs in his second question to Rep. Webster, with the CNN host quoting outgoing Speaker John Boehner's criticism of Republicans whom he blamed for the last shutdown.

JOHN BERMAN: The man who's had the job for the last five years -- Speaker John Boehner -- says part of the problem is there are people inside your caucus with unrealistic expectations. He calls them "false prophets." Listen to what he says right here.



(JOHN BOEHNER)



BERMAN: So was it a mistake to shut down government to try to defund Obamacare.

Berman then asked Rep. Webster to "vow" that "there will be no government shutdowns on your watch." Berman:

The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, when he came into power into the Majority Leader seat, He essentially said no more shutdowns. Will you vow, as part of your campaign to be Speaker, that there will be no government shutdowns on your watch?

After the Florida Republican pointed out that the President shares responsibility for a government shutdown when he vetoes legislation, Berman followed up:

Well, you know, for instance, right now, he will veto any measure that defunds planned parenthood. So would you be willing to shut down the government -- or your half of a shutdown, as it were -- if the President vetoes such an action?

Below is a transcript of all Berman's questions to Rep. Webster from about 7:33 a.m. on the Tuesday, September 29, New Day on CNN:
