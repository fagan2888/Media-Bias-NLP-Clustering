And that could mean more money for wo\u00admen.\n\nFirst, wo\u00admen spend more on health care than men. On av\u00ader\u00adage, a wo\u00adman spent $5,246 on health care in 2012, com\u00adpared with a man\u2019s av\u00ader\u00adage of $4,125, ac\u00adcord\u00ading to the Health Care Cost In\u00adsti\u00adtute. This is partly be\u00adcause wo\u00admen paid high\u00ader in\u00adsur\u00adance premi\u00adums \u2014 in\u00adsurers used to be able to charge wo\u00admen more than men for the same health plan, a prac\u00adtice that was banned by the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act. But wo\u00admen also have high\u00ader costs be\u00adcause they use more health ser\u00advices: They are more likely to go to the doc\u00adtor when they get sick, they live longer, and they have ba\u00adbies.\n\nSo the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act is sav\u00ading wo\u00admen money on premi\u00adums. But it could also save them money each time they go to the doc\u00adtor, be\u00adcause more wo\u00admen are get\u00adting health cov\u00ader\u00adage in\u00adstead of pay\u00ading out of pock\u00adet. Big em\u00adploy\u00aders are re\u00adquired to of\u00adfer it, the ACA in\u00adsur\u00adance ex\u00adchanges provide more choices for in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adal shop\u00adpers, and par\u00adents can al\u00adlow their daugh\u00adters to stay on their plans longer un\u00adder Obama\u00adcare. More in\u00adsured wo\u00admen means more wo\u00admen who can split the cost of health care with their in\u00adsur\u00adance com\u00adpany.\n\nBut that\u2019s just the tip of the ice\u00adberg on why the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act could boost wo\u00admen\u2019s in\u00adcome and help close the gender wage gap, says Amy Al\u00adlina, deputy dir\u00adect\u00ador of the Na\u00adtion\u00adal Wo\u00admen\u2019s Health Net\u00adwork.\n\nAl\u00adlina says the health law\u2019s new cov\u00ader\u00adage op\u00adtions mean wo\u00admen don\u2019t have to worry about in\u00adsur\u00adance when look\u00ading for a job, and that means they are more likely to shop around and find the best job with the highest wage or highest earn\u00ading po\u00adten\u00adtial \u2014 not the one with the best health be\u00adne\u00adfits.\n\nNot re\u00adly\u00ading on an em\u00adploy\u00ader for health in\u00adsur\u00adance re\u00adduces the feel\u00ading of \u201cjob lock,\u201d the idea that people stay in a job that oth\u00ader\u00adwise pays poorly or does not of\u00adfer op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adit\u00adies for ad\u00advance\u00adment be\u00adcause they de\u00adpend on the health cov\u00ader\u00adage provided by the em\u00adploy\u00ader.\n\nWo\u00admen are more likely to stay in a job for health in\u00adsur\u00adance than men, be\u00adcause wo\u00admen value health in\u00adsur\u00adance more, says Heidi Hart\u00admann, an eco\u00adnom\u00adist who is also the pres\u00adid\u00adent and founder of the In\u00adsti\u00adtute for Wo\u00admen\u2019s Policy Re\u00adsearch.\n\n\u201cWo\u00admen have high\u00ader out of pock\u00adet health care costs than men, and any\u00adthing that im\u00adproves your dis\u00adpos\u00adable in\u00adcome by re\u00addu\u00adcing your costs is likely very valu\u00adable,\u201d Hart\u00admann said.\n\nHart\u00admann and Al\u00adlina agree that the free\u00addom to shop around for a bet\u00adter job is im\u00adport\u00adant \u2014 and Al\u00adlina says the flex\u00adib\u00adil\u00adity can help young wo\u00admen pick a high-pay\u00ading job that will set the bar on their lifelong earn\u00adings.\n\n\u201cIf you look for\u00adward in their lives and see what the be\u00adne\u00adfit is of start\u00ading at a high\u00ader wage, they will likely have high\u00ader earn\u00adings over the course of their life,\u201d Al\u00adlina said. \u201cYour start\u00ading place af\u00adfects your end\u00ading place in terms of lifelong earn\u00adings.\u201d\n\nShe points to some evid\u00adence from states that al\u00adlowed young adults to stay on their par\u00adents\u2019 plans be\u00adfore the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act was passed. In those states, a re\u00adcent study from the Journ\u00adal of Health Eco\u00adnom\u00adics found, young adults saw a mod\u00adest wage in\u00adcrease from stay\u00ading on their par\u00adents\u2019 plans. For men, stay\u00ading on their par\u00adents\u2019 plans meant they could stay in school and get a bet\u00adter de\u00adgree \u2014 hence the wage bump. For wo\u00admen, Al\u00adlina says, that in\u00adcrease in earn\u00adings came at least in part by the flex\u00adib\u00adil\u00adity of shop\u00adping around for a high\u00ader-pay\u00ading job.\n\nBut not every\u00adone agrees that Obama\u00adcare will lead to a health\u00adi\u00ader fin\u00adan\u00adcial fu\u00adture for wo\u00admen. Some eco\u00adnom\u00adists re\u00adject the idea that there are good-pay\u00ading jobs that wo\u00admen just can\u2019t take be\u00adcause they don\u2019t of\u00adfer health be\u00adne\u00adfits.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be nice if it were ac\u00adtu\u00adally true?\u201d said Joe Ant\u00ados, a health eco\u00adnom\u00adist at the Amer\u00adic\u00adan En\u00adter\u00adprise In\u00adsti\u00adtute, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in\u00adcludes time at the Con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal Budget Of\u00adfice and the Health and Hu\u00adman Ser\u00advices De\u00adpart\u00adment. \u201cJobs that don\u2019t of\u00adfer health in\u00adsur\u00adance typ\u00adic\u00adally pay less. They\u2019re aim\u00ading at a lower skilled part of the labor mar\u00adket. Tak\u00ading a high\u00ader pay\u00ading job that didn\u2019t have health be\u00adne\u00adfits is a non sequit\u00adur.\u201d\n\nAc\u00adcord\u00ading to the Census Bur\u00adeau\u2019s 2012 Amer\u00adic\u00adan Com\u00admunity Sur\u00advey, 93.5 per\u00adcent of full-time, private-sec\u00adtor work\u00aders earn\u00ading an\u00adnu\u00adal salar\u00adies up\u00adward of $80,000 were re\u00adceiv\u00ading health in\u00adsur\u00adance from their em\u00adploy\u00ader.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only reas\u00adon some eco\u00adnom\u00adists doubt the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act will have a pos\u00adit\u00adive ef\u00adfect on the gender wage gap. They also say that the costs as\u00adso\u00adci\u00adated with hav\u00ading health in\u00adsur\u00adance still re\u00adduce over\u00adall in\u00adcome.\n\nKath\u00ader\u00adine Baick\u00ader, an eco\u00adnom\u00adist and a pro\u00adfess\u00ador at the Har\u00advard School of Pub\u00adlic Health, who also serves as an ad\u00adviser to the Con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal Budget Of\u00adfice, points out that wo\u00admen who don\u2019t get their in\u00adsur\u00adance from their em\u00adploy\u00ader \u2014 wheth\u00ader they\u2019re stay\u00ading on a par\u00adent\u2019s plan or shop\u00adping for cov\u00ader\u00adage on their own \u2014 are still pay\u00ading a por\u00adtion of their wages to\u00adward the cost of health in\u00adsur\u00adance. A job that of\u00adfers health in\u00adsur\u00adance prob\u00adably pays less than a job that of\u00adfers no be\u00adne\u00adfits, but that\u2019s be\u00adcause health in\u00adsur\u00adance car\u00adries a mon\u00adet\u00adary value when em\u00adploy\u00aders are eval\u00adu\u00adat\u00ading an em\u00adploy\u00adee\u2019s total com\u00adpens\u00ada\u00adtion.\n\n\u201cHav\u00ading health in\u00adsur\u00adance in and of it\u00adself seems un\u00adlikely to af\u00adfect the gender wage gap,\u201d Baick\u00ader wrote in an email.\n\nWheth\u00ader the health law will make a dent on the gender wage gap isn\u2019t clear. In fact, one eco\u00adnom\u00adist of\u00adfers an even bleak\u00ader out\u00adlook: Obama\u00adcare will ac\u00adtu\u00adally widen the in\u00adcome dis\u00adpar\u00adity between men and wo\u00admen.\n\nAn\u00addrew Biggs, a former So\u00adcial Se\u00adcur\u00adity Ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion of\u00adfi\u00adcial and a cur\u00adrent schol\u00adar at the Amer\u00adic\u00adan En\u00adter\u00adprise In\u00adsti\u00adtute, says the health law cre\u00adates an in\u00adcent\u00adive for wo\u00admen to work less be\u00adcause they\u2019ll be able to get health in\u00adsur\u00adance else\u00adwhere \u2014 and that will ex\u00adpand the gender wage gap.\n\n\u201cThe gender pay gap is driv\u00aden al\u00admost en\u00adtirely by wo\u00admen tak\u00ading time out of the work\u00adforce to have kids,\u201d said Biggs. \u201cTo re\u00adduce the gender pay gap, es\u00adsen\u00adtially wo\u00admen have to work more. But wo\u00admen\u2019s labor sup\u00adply is more sens\u00adit\u00adive than men\u2019s is. You have some wo\u00admen who are work\u00ading so they could get health in\u00adsur\u00adance. If they could get it without work\u00ading, you may have less work\u00ading.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "Women don\u2019t need to get health insurance from their employer \u2014 which means they might start choosing better pay over better benefits.", "title": "Can Obamacare Help Close the Gender Wage Gap?", "url": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/health-care/2014/05/23/can-obamacare-help-close-gender-wage-gap", "image": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2014/05/22/pelosi-ACA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "mxRH-jX1pR5MjoxIjXJOxnDElPR-loQvW49hc6LMh6w", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2014/05/22/pelosi-ACA.jpg"}, "title": "Can Obamacare Help Close the Gender Wage Gap?", "description": "Women don\u2019t need to get health insurance from their employer \u2014 which means they might start choosing better pay over better benefits.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nationaljournal"}, "description": "Women don\u2019t need to get health insurance from their employer \u2014 which means they might start choosing better pay over better benefits.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a39\"", "article_summary": "On av\u00ader\u00adage, a wo\u00adman spent $5,246 on health care in 2012, com\u00adpared with a man\u2019s av\u00ader\u00adage of $4,125, ac\u00adcord\u00ading to the Health Care Cost In\u00adsti\u00adtute.\n\u201cHav\u00ading health in\u00adsur\u00adance in and of it\u00adself seems un\u00adlikely to af\u00adfect the gender wage gap,\u201d Baick\u00ader wrote in an email.\nBut that\u2019s not the only reas\u00adon some eco\u00adnom\u00adists doubt the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act will have a pos\u00adit\u00adive ef\u00adfect on the gender wage gap.\nWheth\u00ader the health law will make a dent on the gender wage gap isn\u2019t clear.\nBut that\u2019s just the tip of the ice\u00adberg on why the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act could boost wo\u00admen\u2019s in\u00adcome and help close the gender wage gap, says Amy Al\u00adlina, deputy dir\u00adect\u00ador of the Na\u00adtion\u00adal Wo\u00admen\u2019s Health Net\u00adwork."}
