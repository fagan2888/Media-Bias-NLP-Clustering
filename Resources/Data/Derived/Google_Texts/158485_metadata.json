Trumka\u2019s total pay of $322,131 was the equivalent of a $154.87 hourly wage.\n\n\u201cWorking people will turn out for candidates who support solutions that will make a difference in the real world \u2013 from raising the minimum wage to ensuring that all workers can bargain collectively and make a livable wage,\u201d Trumka said in an Oct. 8 statement.\n\nTrumka\u2019s own thoroughly livable wage is paid for with money taken from workers in AFL-CIO member unions. Many of those unions, including American Federation of Teachers and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, take dues and mandatory fees from taxpayer-funded public employees.\n\nAFL-CIO didn\u2019t respond to a Watchdog.org request for comment on Trumka\u2019s compensation.\n\nOn Twitter, Trumka expressed his support for a federal minimum wage hike using a hashtag popularized by President Obama\u2019s Organizing for Action.\n\nWe stand in strong support of the broad campaign to #RaiseTheWage leading up to & following 10/10, & its our responsibility to keep it going \u2014 Richard L. Trumka (@RichardTrumka) October 8, 2014\n\nAFL-CIO has attempted to build momentum for the president\u2019s $10.10 minimum wage campaign in the days leading up to 10/10, portraying the current $7.25 minimum wage as too little to support a family when working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year.\n\nMin. wage workers are trying to squeeze by on only $15,080 a year: http://t.co/hoCSCcPqa7 it\u2019s time for a raise #raisethewage \u2014 AFL-CIO (@AFLCIO) October 2, 2014\n\nIn 2013, less than 5 percent of American workers and less than 3 percent of those over the age of 25 were paid minimum wage. Studies have shown minimum wage hikes reduce employment among young, unskilled workers.\n\nAnother theme of AFL-CIO\u2019s minimum wage messaging has been \u201cincome inequality,\u201d with AFL-CIO asserting in a recent ad, \u201call the income gains of the last 15 years went to the richest 10 percent of Americans.\u201d According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this is a category that includes Richard Trumka, whose $272,250 gross salary alone put him well into the top 5 percent.\n\nTrumka isn\u2019t the only union boss to demand a higher minimum wage while taking more than 20 times the current $7.25 rate from American workers.\n\nAFSCME describes a federal minimum wage hike as \u201ca civil rights issue,\u201d and AFSCME President Lee Saunders screamed for \u201csolidarity\u201d at a recent Ohio AFL-CIO convention. Saunders was paid $350,058, the equivalent of $168.30 per hour, during the union\u2019s 2013 fiscal year.\n\nAFT President Randi Weingarten recently celebrated expanded \u201cliving wage\u201d mandates from far-left New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio, suggesting DeBlasio\u2019s action was a model for the whole state.\n\nGreat news for all of NYC \u2013 @BilldeBlasio Executive Order Will Expand Living Wage Law to Thousands More http://t.co/N7HR7nvWAc \u2014 Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) September 30, 2014\n\nHope this sparks debate in Albany;elsewhere-NY needs to #raisethewage http://t.co/N7HR7nvWAc \u2014 Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) September 30, 2014\n\nWeingarten was paid $557,875, the equivalent of $268.21 per hour, during the teachers union\u2019s 2014 fiscal year.\n\nEarlier this year, Trumka participated in a bus tour demanding a $10.10 minimum wage. AFL-CIO and Communist Party USA have hammered Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint\u2019s disinterest in debating Trumka on the issue, and AFL-CIO has attacked minimum wage hike critics with \u201cKoch Sisters\u201d ads.\n\nNot to be outdone, Service Employees International Union, whose 1.8 million public- and private-sector members are not affiliated with AFL-CIO, has called steeper government wage mandates \u201cessential for advancing civil & human rights today.\u201d\n\nRaising the minimum wage remains essential for advancing civil & human rights today: http://t.co/btnKZhUU1d #RaiseTheWage \u2014 SEIU (@SEIU) October 4, 2014\n\nSEIU President Mary Kay Henry was paid $295,870 in 2013, or $142.25 per hour.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AFL-CIO union boss Richard Trumka is paid $322,131, but that doesn't stop him from pretending his top priority is low-wage workers.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "AFL-CIO union boss Richard Trumka is paid $322,131, but that doesn't stop him from pretending his top priority is low-wage workers.", "title": "Union boss paid $154 an hour pushes for minimum wage hike - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/richard-trumka-300px.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-09T14:47:38+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/176020/union-boss-wage/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "AFL-CIO union boss Richard Trumka is paid $322,131, but that doesn't stop him from pretending his top priority is low-wage workers.", "title": "Union boss paid $154 an hour pushes for minimum wage hike - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/richard-trumka-300px.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "National", "published_time": "2014-10-10T04:00:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-09T14:47:38+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "union boss, Richard Trumka, AFL-CIO, AFT, American Federation of Teachers, AFSCME, Randi Weingarten, Lee Saunders, SEIU"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc3d8\"", "article_summary": "Earlier this year, Trumka participated in a bus tour demanding a $10.10 minimum wage.\nOn Twitter, Trumka expressed his support for a federal minimum wage hike using a hashtag popularized by President Obama\u2019s Organizing for Action.\nTrumka isn\u2019t the only union boss to demand a higher minimum wage while taking more than 20 times the current $7.25 rate from American workers.\nTrumka\u2019s own thoroughly livable wage is paid for with money taken from workers in AFL-CIO member unions.\nAFSCME describes a federal minimum wage hike as \u201ca civil rights issue,\u201d and AFSCME President Lee Saunders screamed for \u201csolidarity\u201d at a recent Ohio AFL-CIO convention."}
