The debate over how to best fight terrorism and how to best prevent future Wall Street collapses share a common thread, at least according to critics: Policymakers have mostly tried to look busy for the purposes of public image, rather than addressing the root causes of the events.\n\nI\u2019ll leave the foreign policy debate to those better equipped to discuss it, but let\u2019s take financial reform. Though Congress passed Dodd-Frank in 2010, and regulators have written rules ever since (only completing about 55 percent of them more than four years later), the massively complex law has failed to fully contain Wall Street\u2019s predilection for threatening the economy.\n\nRelated: Investors in Denial Over Coming Fed Rate Hikes\n\nThe biggest banks remain too big to competently manage their affairs and too interconnected to be safely dissolved in the event of collapse, as the recent rejection of their \u201cliving wills\u201d showed. Wall Street continues to amass outsized risk. Sales of securitized loans based on corporate debt are at a post-crisis high, and protections for investors for these loans have completely broken down. A recent academic study of the Volcker rule, the signature Dodd-Frank provision to eliminate proprietary trading at deposit-taking banks, found that affected banks have taken on more risk and carried less liquid assets than before the rule\u2019s enactment.\n\nFinancial Times columnist Martin Wolf lays the problem at the feet of Dodd-Frank itself, a sprawling document that employs 30,000 pages of rules to merely preserve the existing system. \u201cIf we want everything to stay the same, everything must change,\u201d Wolf writes, quoting a character from the Italian epic The Leopard.\n\nIf you focus only on one area where regulators have taken significant steps of late, you could actually manage a cheer. Bolstered by a rough consensus that transcends party ideology, and a persistent intellectual force from outside the Beltway, regulators have appeared to agree that if they cannot eliminate financial risk they can at least make it more likely that banks, not taxpayers, will pay to clean up the aftermath.\n\nOn Tuesday, Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo, the central bank\u2019s point person on financial regulation, announced at a Senate Banking Committee hearing what he called a \u201crisk-based capital surcharge\u201d for the most important banks. In reality banks aren\u2019t being charged anything: The requirement would simply force them to use more of their own assets to fund operations, and absorb any losses incurred.\n\nDuring the crisis, banks borrowed as much as $98 for every $100 they lent out, meaning that just a tiny amount of losses would make them insolvent. If banks fund their activities with more debt, they can extract more profit from their deals. But this constant grab for funding not only risks individual catastrophe, it tightly couples banks together, as they all borrow from one another. It magnifies a crisis when lending evaporates; as we saw in 2008, even stable financial firms couldn\u2019t find funding and teetered on collapse. Additional capital requirements would add resiliency amid the chaos.\n\nRelated: Steve Forbes\u2019s Golden Plan to Save the Economy\n\nAn international process called Basel III modestly increased capital requirements, but Tarullo has led efforts to consistently hike the baseline for U.S. banks beyond those international benchmarks. In April, the Federal Reserve increased the raw ratio of equity to debt, regardless of the type of assets, to 5 percent, nearly double the Basel III standard. Another new rule forces banks to have enough funds on hand to maintain operations for 30 days. The new \u201ccapital surcharge\u201d would increase the ratio on risk-adjusted assets to as high as 9.5 percent. And regulators told the Senate they would take further action if the banks fail to credibly demonstrate how they can be dismantled through the bankruptcy process.\n\nTarullo stressed that, in determining the proper capital ratio, the Fed would take into account how much short-term wholesale funding a big bank uses. If the bank borrows more money that must be paid back overnight or in a few hours, it would need to retain more capital, in case those funding sources dry up. Tarullo even pointed out that, in reaction to higher capital requirements, riskier financial institutions may opt to downsize themselves. \u201cThis measure might also create incentives\u2026 to reduce their systemic footprint and risk profile,\u201d he said.\n\nEach Fed increase on capital has been small and, by some viewpoints, inadequate. And the requirements still rely too much on risk weights, which banks can easily game (and have already begun to, with an assist from allies in Congress). But the trend toward forcing banks to absorb their own losses is unmistakable, and a consequence of focused, persistent, bipartisan demands.\n\nPolicymakers and academics on the left and right have highlighted significant increases in capital as the best way to tamp down the risk of taxpayer bailouts. Professors Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig offered the definitive case in their book The Banker\u2019s New Clothes. Martin Wolf, in his new book The Shifts and the Shocks, believes capital can solve a number of problems at once. \u201cIt would limit the implicit subsidy to banks\u2026 it would reduce the need for such intrusive and complex regulation; and it would lower the likelihood of panics,\u201d he writes.\n\nSenators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and David Vitter (R-LA) introduced legislation last year to impose higher capital requirements, and though their bill has never received a vote, it has moved the needle in the debate. At Tuesday\u2019s Banking Committee hearing, lawmakers in both parties praised Tarullo\u2019s stance. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of support in this committee and I think throughout the House and Senate on stronger capital standards like that,\u201d Brown said.\n\nCongress may look feckless, and often is. But a few committed lawmakers, backed by outside support, can effectively get the regulatory apparatus to act. Tarullo has advanced his position on capital steadily. Having Thomas Hoenig, a Republican and perhaps the biggest supporter of higher capital among regulators, in a top position at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has also helped. The Fed has yet to reach the level reformers believe necessary, but its officials have had to listen and react.\n\nRelated: People Are Quitting Their Jobs. That\u2019s Good News.\n\nRaising capital requirements will not prevent all of Wall Street\u2019s ills. As recent reports about bankers rigging benchmark rates and prices for credit default swaps shows, America still suffers from a financial crime wave, practically unabated since the financial crisis. \u201cThe message for every Wall Street banker is loud and clear,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said this week. \u201cIf you break the law, you are not going to jail but you might end up with a much bigger paycheck.\u201d\n\nConsidering that the Justice Department doesn\u2019t even do a good job prosecuting themselves, maybe we shouldn\u2019t expect them to prosecute the banks. But if we must live with an out-of-control financial sector \u2014 and we shouldn\u2019t \u2014 at least we can make progress on having the banks pick up the tab for their own recklessness.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Though Congress passed Dodd-Frank in 2010, and regulators have written rules ever since, the massively complex law has failed to fully contain Wall Street\u2019s predilection for threatening the economy.", "title": "Six Years After Lehman\u2019s Bankruptcy, Wall Street Is as Reckless as Ever", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/09/12/Six-Years-After-Lehman-s-Bankruptcy-Wall-Street-Reckless-Ever", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/09122014_Lehman_Brothers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/09/12/Six-Years-After-Lehman-s-Bankruptcy-Wall-Street-Reckless-Ever", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/09122014_Lehman_Brothers.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ddayen"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Though Congress passed Dodd-Frank in 2010, and regulators have written rules ever since, the massively complex law has failed to fully contain Wall Street\u2019s predilection for threatening the economy.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Raising capital requirements will not prevent all of Wall Street\u2019s ills.\n\u201cThe message for every Wall Street banker is loud and clear,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said this week.\nTarullo even pointed out that, in reaction to higher capital requirements, riskier financial institutions may opt to downsize themselves.\nAdditional capital requirements would add resiliency amid the chaos.\nWall Street continues to amass outsized risk."}
