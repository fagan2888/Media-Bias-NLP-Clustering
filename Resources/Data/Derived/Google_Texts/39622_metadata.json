Miller said last month that he would not seek re-election.\n\nBydlak becomes the sixth Republican and eighth candidate overall to enter the race, joining Republicans Matt Gaetz, Cris Dosev, Brian Frazier, John Mills, and Mark Wichern. Democrats Amanda Kondrat\u2019yev and Steven Specht have also filed for the race.\n\nHailing from northern Escambia County, Bydlak has served as director of outreach for the Coalition to Reduce Spending, an advocacy organization dedicated to reducing federal spending and debt.\n\n\u201cThe First District deserves innovative solutions, not just more of the same,\u201d Rebekah said. \u201cA vibrant, 21st century economy that benefits all demands a federal government that abides by our Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWashington is broken,\u201d she added, \u201cand I have the experience to be part of the solution. Every child born today will face tens of thousands of dollars in debt they did not ring up, thanks to career politicians who have no interest in stopping business as usual. I will fight for my generation\u2019s right to be free from this burden.\u201d\n\nBydlak was homeschooled before attending Pensacola State College and the University of West Florida, where she earned a master\u2019s degree in political science and public administration. As outreach director for the Coalition to Reduce Spending, she says she\u2019s spent the last three years advocating full-time for lower spending and debt among the public, elected officials, and candidates across the country.\n\nThe 25-year-old says her entrance into the race is sorely needed. \u201cVoters in the First District know that politics as usual will not solve the problems we face,\u201d she said. \u201cWith $19 trillion in debt, we simply can\u2019t accept the old solutions of big spending and cronyism. Having successfully advocated important spending cuts, pushed back against Obamacare, and built fiscally conservative coalitions nationwide, I\u2019m confident that I have the knowledge and skills to repeal Obamacare, cut spending and debt, protect educational freedom, and take care of our veterans.\u201d\n\nFor more information, visit Rebekah2016.com.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "EventON 2.3.20", "og": {"site_name": "The Pulse", "description": "The race for Northwest Florida\u2019s seat in Congress\u00a0got a little more crowded this morning as Rebekah Johansen Bydlak, a Republican, announced her candidacy.
