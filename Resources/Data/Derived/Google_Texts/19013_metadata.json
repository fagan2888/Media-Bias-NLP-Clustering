The culprit is the militarization of the police.\n\nThe weapons used in the \u201cwar on terror\u201d that destroyed Afghanistan and Iraq have made their way to local law enforcement. While police forces across the country began a process of militarization complete with SWAT teams and flash-bang grenades when President Reagan intensified the \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d the post-9/11 \u201cwar on terror\u201d has added fuel to the fire.\n\nThrough laws and regulations like a provision in defense budgets that authorize the Pentagon to transfer surplus military gear to police forces, local law enforcement are using weapons found on the battlefields of South Asia and the Middle East.\n\nA recent New York Times article by Matt Apuzzo reported that in the Obama era, \u201cpolice departments have received tens of thousands of machine guns; nearly 200,000 ammunition magazines; thousands of pieces of camouflage and night-vision equipment; and hundreds of silencers, armored cars and aircraft.\u201d The result is that police agencies around the nation possess military-grade equipment, turning officers who are supposed to fight crime and protect communities into what look like invading forces from an army. And military-style police raids have increased in recent years, with one count putting the number at 80,000 such raids last year.\n\nIn June, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought more attention to police militarization when it issued a comprehensive, nearly 100-page (appendix and endnotes included) report titled,\u201cWar Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing.\u201d Based on public records requests to more than 260 law enforcement agencies in 26 states, the ACLU concluded that \u201cAmerican policing has become excessively militarized through the use of weapons and tactics designed for the battlefield\u201d and that this militarization \u201cunfairly impacts people of color and undermines individual liberties, and it has been allowed to happen in the absence of any meaningful public discussion.\u201d\n\nThe information contained in the ACLU report, and in other investigations into the phenomenon, is sobering. From the killing of innocent people to the lack of debate on the issue, police militarization has turned into a key issue for Americans. It is harming civil liberties, ramping up the \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d impacting the most marginalized members of society and transforming neighborhoods into war zones. Here are 11 important\u2013and horrifying\u2013things you should know about the militarization of police.\n\n1. It harms, and sometimes kills, innocent people. When you have heavily armed police officers using flash-bang grenades and armored personnel carriers, innocent people are bound to be hurt. The likelihood of people being killed is raised by the practice of SWAT teams busting down doors with no warning, which leads some people to think it may be a burglary, who could in turn try to defend themselves. The ACLU documented seven cases of civilians dying, and 46 people being injured. That\u2019s only in the cases the civil liberties group looked at, so the number is actually higher.\n\nTake the case of Tarika Wilson, which the ACLU summarizes. The 26-year-old biracial mother lived in Lima, Ohio. Her boyfriend, Anthony Terry, was wanted by the police on suspicion of drug dealing. So on January 4, 2008, a SWAT team busted down Wilson\u2019s door and opened fire. A SWAT officer killed Wilson and injured her one-year-old baby, Sincere Wilson. The killing sparked rage in Lima and accusations of a racist police department, but the officer who shot Wilson, Sgt. Joe Chavalia, was found not guilty on all charges.\n\n2. Children are impacted. As the case of Wilson shows, the police busting down doors care little about whether there\u2019s a child in the home. Another case profiled by the ACLU shows how children are caught up the crossfire\u2013with devastating consequences.\n\nIn May, after their Wisconsin home had burned down, the Phonesavanh family was staying with relatives in Georgia. One night, a SWAT team with assault rifles invaded the home and threw a flashbang grenade\u2013despite the presence of kids\u2019 toys in the front yard. The police were looking for the father\u2019s nephew on drug charges. He wasn\u2019t there. But a 19-month-old named Bou Bou was\u2013and the grenade landed in his crib.\n\nBou Bou was wounded in the chest and had third-degree burns. He was put in a medically induced coma.\n\nAnother high-profile instance of a child being killed by paramilitary police tactics occurred in 2010, when seven-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones was killed in Detroit. The city\u2019s Special Response Team (Detroit\u2019s SWAT) was looking for Chauncey Owens, a suspect in the killing of a teenager who lived on the second floor of the apartment Jones lived in.\n\nOfficers raided the home, threw a flash-bang grenade, and fired one shot that struck Jones in the head. The police agent who fired the fatal shot, Joseph Weekley, has so far gotten off easy: a jury trial ended in deadlock last year, though he will face charges of involuntary manslaughter in September. As The Nation\u2019s Mychal Denzel Smith wrote last year after Weekley was acquitted: \u201cWhat happened to Aiyana is the result of the militarization of police in this country\u2026Part of what it means to be black in America now is watching your neighborhood become the training ground for our increasingly militarized police units.\u201d\n\nBou Bou and Jones aren\u2019t the only case of children being impacted.\n\nAccording to the ACLU, \u201cof the 818 deployments studied, 14 percent involved the presence of children and 13 percent did not.\u201d\n\n3. The use of SWAT teams is unnecessary. In many cases, using militarized teams of police is not needed. The ACLU report notes that the vast majority of cases where SWAT teams are deployed are in situations where a search warrant is being executed to just look for drugs. In other words, it\u2019s not even 100% clear whether there are drugs at the place the police are going to. These situations are not why SWAT was created.\n\nFurthermore, even when SWAT teams think there are weapons, they are often wrong. The ACLU report shows that in the cases where police thought weapons would be there, they were right only a third of the time.\n\n4. The \u201cwar on terror\u201d is fueling militarization. It was the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d that introduced militarized policing to the U.S. But the \u201cwar on terror\u201d has accelerated it.\n\nA growing number of agencies have taken advantage of the Department of Defense\u2019s \u201c1033\u201d program, which is passed every year as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, the budget for the Pentagon. The number of police agencies obtaining military equipment like mine-resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles has increased since 2009, according to USA Today, which notes that this \u201csurplus military equipment\u201d is \u201cleft over from U.S. military campaigns in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.\u201d This equipment is largely cost-free for the police agencies who receive them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The war on terror has come home -- and it's wreaking havoc on innocent American lives", "author": "Alex Kane", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The war on terror has come home -- and it's wreaking havoc on innocent American lives", "title": "11 chilling facts about America\u2019s militarized police force", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/04/11_disturbing_facts_about_americas_militarized_police_force_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/riot_police-620x4121.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The war on terror has come home -- and it's wreaking havoc on innocent American lives", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/riot_police-620x4121.jpg", "title": "11 chilling facts about America\u2019s militarized police force", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "11 chilling facts about America\u2019s militarized police force", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Militarized Police State, Military Police, Radley Balko, War on Terror", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca72d\"", "article_summary": "In many cases, using militarized teams of police is not needed.\nThe use of SWAT teams is unnecessary.\nFurthermore, even when SWAT teams think there are weapons, they are often wrong.\nThe weapons used in the \u201cwar on terror\u201d that destroyed Afghanistan and Iraq have made their way to local law enforcement.\nIt was the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d that introduced militarized policing to the U.S."}
