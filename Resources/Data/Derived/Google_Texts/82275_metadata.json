AAF says these regulations have cost more than $45 billion.\n\nThe costs associated with increased paperwork extend beyond the funds needed to cover the added expenses of hiring additional employees to navigate the rocky waters created by federal regulators at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service. For every hour an employee spends working on unnecessary paperwork, that employee could have been working to accomplish some other task to improve the business, whether that\u2019s improving customer relations, assisting with a new marketing campaign, or engaging in some activity that could help expand business or reduce costs.\n\nO\u2019Neill says the 165 million hours of paperwork and 106 regulations do not include the hundreds of \u201cguidance documents\u201d published by numerous federal agencies or the multiple regulations expected to be added by federal regulators through 2020.\n\nOne regulation O\u2019Neill says is likely to be particularly onerous for businesses is the High Cost Plan Excise Tax, popularly called the \u201cCadillac tax.\u201d The Cadillac tax is a 40 percent levy on \u201chigh cost plans,\u201d which ACA defines as plans that cost at least $10,200 for individuals or $27,500 for families. The tax was originally planned to start in 2018, but the Republican-led Congress agreed in December to delay implementation of the tax until 2020. AAF says once the Cadillac tax goes into effect, the paperwork costs associated with Obamacare will rise to even greater heights.\n\nFormer secretary of state and current Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is pledging to protect ACA from proposed changes offered by Republicans and some Democrats\u2014including presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (VT), who says he plans to create a government-funded single-payer health insurance system if elected in November. As the AAF report shows, the costs and lost productivity resulting from ACA harm businesses and families, who have had to pay rapidly increasing health insurance rates since the Obamacare health insurance marketplaces first opened in 2013.\n\nThe added regulatory expenses related to ACA represent only a small component of the growing regulatory burden the Obama administration has imposed on businesses, families, and governments. According to a June 2015 AAF report, \u201cSince President Obama took office, his regulators have added $35 billion in unfunded regulatory costs and at least 75 million paperwork burden hours on state and local governments,\u201d effectively bogging down local governments and diverting their attention away from problems affecting local communities.\n\nThe billions of pages of additional paperwork are not only damaging businesses, raising costs, and creating headaches for millions of Americans, their existence raises serious concerns about the protection of Americans\u2019 personal information. With more paperwork comes additional opportunities for identity thieves to get their hands on private data, a problem the federal government has failed to prevent in recent years. In July 2015, it was reported by the Obama administration sensitive personal information belonging to 21.5 million people was accessed by hackers in what The New York Times referred to as \u201ca colossal breach of government computer systems.\u201d It is believed millions of Social Security numbers and an unspecified number of fingerprints were stolen by the hackers, and theTimes reported the attacks likely originated in China.\n\nA study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation shows consumers purchasing \u201csilver\u201d health insurance plans in an Obamacare exchange have seen monthly premiums increase by an average of 11 percent in 2016; \u201cgold\u201d plan premiums rose by nearly 14 percent.\n\nRather than improving business or spending time with their families, Americans are now forced to spend countless hours working to comply with the countless regulations created by the Affordable Care Act, a destructive, inefficient, trillion-dollar mistake the next president and Congress should repeal and replace.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Opponents of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), President Barack Obamas signature law, including the entire field of Republican presidential candidates, say Obamacare has caused significant premium price increases and has forced millions of Americans out of insurance plans they enjoyed prior to the laws passage..05/27/2016 8:41:43AM EST.", "author": "Justin  Haskins", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Opponents of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), President Barack Obamas signature law, including the entire field of Republican presidential candidates, say Obamacare has caused significant premium price increases and has forced millions of Americans out of insurance plans they enjoyed prior to the laws passage.", "title": "Justin  Haskins  - Americans Can\u2019t Afford Obamacare\u2019s 165 Million Hours of Paperwork or $45 Billion Cost", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/justinhaskins/2016/02/15/americans-cant-afford-obamacares-165-million-hours-of-paperwork-or-45-billion-cost-n2119858", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/68/2015-03-09T134041Z_1_LYNXMPEB280KO_RTROPTP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Opponents of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), President Barack Obamas signature law, including the entire field of Republican presidential candidates, say Obamacare has caused significant premium price increases and has forced millions of Americans out of insurance plans they enjoyed prior to the laws passage.", "title": "Justin  Haskins  - Americans Can\u2019t Afford Obamacare\u2019s 165 Million Hours of Paperwork or $45 Billion Cost", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/justinhaskins/2016/02/15/americans-cant-afford-obamacares-165-million-hours-of-paperwork-or-45-billion-cost-n2119858", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/68/2015-03-09T134041Z_1_LYNXMPEB280KO_RTROPTP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Americans Can\u2019t Afford Obamacare\u2019s 165 Million Hours of Paperwork or $45 Billion Cost, Justin  Haskins , Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "AAF says once the Cadillac tax goes into effect, the paperwork costs associated with Obamacare will rise to even greater heights.\nAAF says these regulations have cost more than $45 billion.\nAs the AAF report shows, the costs and lost productivity resulting from ACA harm businesses and families, who have had to pay rapidly increasing health insurance rates since the Obamacare health insurance marketplaces first opened in 2013.\nA study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation shows consumers purchasing \u201csilver\u201d health insurance plans in an Obamacare exchange have seen monthly premiums increase by an average of 11 percent in 2016; \u201cgold\u201d plan premiums rose by nearly 14 percent.\nO\u2019Neill says the 165 million hours of paperwork and 106 regulations do not include the hundreds of \u201cguidance documents\u201d published by numerous federal agencies or the multiple regulations expected to be added by federal regulators through 2020."}
