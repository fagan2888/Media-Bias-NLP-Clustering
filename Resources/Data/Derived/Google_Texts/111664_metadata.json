(AP) - On a warm January day 150 years after the first governor\u2019s party arrived at Del Rio Springs to run the new Territory of Arizona, history came to life there again.\n\nFamilies who had lived on the Del Rio Ranch throughout the years joined history buffs to celebrate the governor\u2019s arrival at the same spot on Jan. 22, 1864. The event organized by the Chino Valley Historical Society quickly reached its capacity of 150 people and some had to be turned away for lack of parking.\n\nAttendees included government dignitaries and descendants of the Shivers family that owned part of the ranch in the 1800s.\n\n\u201cOf all the springs, creeks and rivers in Arizona, the governor\u2019s party chose Del Rio Springs,\u201d Chino Valley Mayor Chris Marley said. \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty neat.\u201d\n\nThe current ranch owners were unable to attend, but they did pay for the Circle J Chuckwagon Outfitters from Chino Valley to provide a free chuckwagon lunch for everyone.\n\nThe Prescott Regulators re-enacted Gov. John Goodwin\u2019s arrival with an 18-gun salute, while John Krizek and Jay Eby of the Westerners International described Del Rio\u2019s storied history.\n\n\u201cWe need to save it for our children so they remember,\u201d Yavapai County Supervisor Craig Brown said.\n\nDespite just leaving the hospital a few days earlier, 87-year-old Mary Converse Hardin was not about to miss the party. \u201cThis is kind of healing for me,\u201d she beamed as she chatted with her childhood friend and neighbor Betty Wells. Hardin was born at Del Rio in 1927 and lived there until 1945. That\u2019s the last time she saw Wells, and she\u2019s returned to visit the ranch only once before. She now lives in Cottonwood, while Wells has continued to ranch on her parents\u2019 place all her life.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d ride down on the river and have and have a weenie roast,\u201d Hardin recalled.\n\nBut most of the time, the kids were busy with chores, Wells said.\n\nThere was no better place to grow up, Hardin said.\n\nRobbi Yarbro Larson of Paulden couldn\u2019t agree more. She grew up on the Del Rio from 1961 to 1976.\n\n\u201cMainly, we just rode and worked cattle,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve ridden all over these hills.\u201d\n\nDuring play time they were luckiest kids in the arid region with their own swimming ponds filled by the\n\nplentiful Del Rio Springs. They could even ride a rowboat along a canal from one pond to the other.\n\nLarson remembers when the oldest building on the ranch burned down in 1969, just about the same time a new ranch hand and his family moved in. There was some kind of kitchen fire that ignited the wood ceiling, she recalled. The adobe had dated back to at least 1864.\n\n\u201cIt was a sad deal,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would really be something to have it standing now.\u201d\n\nThe remains of the adobe walls stood for several years until subsequent owners apparently leveled the area. Several others still stand from the ranch\u2019s Fred Harvey era.\n\nThe main entrance to the ranch once was lined with black walnut trees, Larson recalled. But like many other trees on the ranch, most of the walnuts are gone as the groundwater level has dramatically dropped.\n\nChris Wuehrmann of Prescott, a Del Rio tenant in 1976-79 who went on to run the popular Elderhostel program at Yavapai College, noticed how many trees had died since he lived there.\n\nEvery fall in the \u201870s when the farmers in the area stopped pumping groundwater for their crops, the Del Rio field filled up with water, he said.\n\n\u201cThe field would be all covered with Canada geese\u201d that stayed for the winter, he said.\n\nJames Bond, now 93 and living in Phoenix, owned the ranch from 1978 to 2004.\n\n\u201cI wanted it ever since I was 16 years old, but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d own it,\u201d Bond said of the ranch while enjoying his chuckwagon meal. He remembers driving by it on childhood trips from Flagstaff to Phoenix.\n\n\u201cI thought it was the most beautiful place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was always so pretty and green.\u201d\n\nThe ranch had lakes and five artesian wells when James Bond purchased it, his son Richard recalled, but they all were gone by the time he sold the place.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Water Resources estimates the Del Rio Springs will be dry by 2025 because of groundwater pumping.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On a warm January day 150 years after the first governor's party arrived at Del Rio Springs to run the new Territory of Arizona, history came to life there again.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "On a warm January day 150 years after the first governor\u2019s party arrived at Del Rio Springs to run the new Territory of Arizona, history came to life there again.", "title": "Chino Valley history party draws crowds", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/25/chino-valley-history-party-draws-crowds/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/25/662ac0e54120c203490f6a7067001415.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/25/662ac0e54120c203490f6a7067001415.jpg", "description": "On a warm January day 150 years after the first governor's party arrived at Del Rio Springs to run the new Territory of Arizona, history came to life there again.", "card": "summary", "title": "Chino Valley history party draws crowds"}, "Author": "JOANNA DODDER NELLANS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Hospitality Recreation, Rio Springs, Mary Converse Hardin, Betty Wells, Robbi Yarbro Larson"}, "article_summary": "DEL RIO SPRINGS, Ariz.
