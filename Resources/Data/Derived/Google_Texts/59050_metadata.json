But what, exactly, are we remembering? That is a question worth pondering this Memorial Day weekend. But first, to get warmed up, here\u2019s an easier one: Which of these is not like the others?\n\n(A) On Memorial Day, 1983, President Ronald Reagan attended a summit meeting in Williamsburg, Va., with leaders of the industrialized democracies, while Deputy Secretary of Defense W. Paul Thayer laid a wreath at Arlington Cemetery during the Memorial Day ceremony. (B) On Memorial Day, 1992, President George H.W. Bush attended a wreath-laying ceremony in Kennebunkport, Maine, where he also made brief remarks at an American Legion hall, and played a round of golf, while Vice President Dan Quayle laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery. (C) On Memorial Day, 2002, President Bush George W. Bush attended a ceremony at the Normandy American Cemetery in France. (D) On Memorial Day, 2010, President Barack Obama attended a Memorial Day ceremony at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery in Elwood, Illinois, while Vice President Joe Biden participated in the customary wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nThe answer, of course, is \u201cD\u201d \u2014 at least in the Fox News universe. Rightwing media figures quickly attacked Obama for \u201ctrampling on tradition\u201d and showing his disrespect for veterans and the military, as Media Matters reported at the time. On his radio show, Glenn Beck said, \u201cI am sick and tired \u2014 sick and tired \u2014 of people believing the lie that this administration has respect for the police or has respect for the soldiers of our country. I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d RedState blogger Erick Erickson tweeted:\n\nObama skipping the Tomb of the Unknowns this weekend for Chicago is offensive. Chicago can wait. The Commander-in-Chief has a job to do. \u2014 Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) May 25, 2010\n\nThen the next day, \u201cFox & Friends\u201d devoted an entire segment to pondering Obama\u2019s unprecedented insult, with host Brian Kilmeade, historian (with a tenuous grasp on recent history) Richard Miller, National Review\u2019s Andrew McCarthy and former Harry Reid aide Penny Lee discussing Obama\u2019s planned activities for Memorial Day, with chyrons framing the story, \u201cTrampling On Tradition?\u201d, \u201cOffensive To Soldiers?\u201d and \u201cMemorial Day Miss-Out?\u201d\n\nMedia Matters commented on this farcical charade as well, pointing out just how precedented Obama\u2019s actions were, despite claims to the contrary:\n\nIf the thrust of the attack is that this \u201cbreaks tradition\u201d and is therefore possibly \u201coffensive\u201d to soldiers, then conservatives either need to abandon this talking point or embrace the idea that several of their Republican heroes also hated the troops. But that\u2019s not how the noise machine works, which Erick Erickson demonstrated on Twitter yesterday.\n\nObama skipping the Tomb of the Unknowns this weekend for Chicago is offensive. Chicago can wait. The Commander-in-Chief has a job to do. \u2014 Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) May 25, 2010\n\nNeat trick, eh? This is evidence Obama hates the military because conservatives like Erickson have previously questioned Obama\u2019s \u201csupport for soldiers and belief in American Exceptionalism.\u201d Basically, Obama hates the military because conservatives claim Obama hates the military. That\u2019s CNN-quality analysis right there.\n\nBut the point of citing all the above is not to dwell on how conservatives demonize America\u2019s first black President, manufacturing evidence against him out of their own projected hostility towards him. This is all a part of something much broader picture \u2014 an overall poisoning, so to speak, of everything precious to them that escapes their control. We get a hint of this broader picture from another Media Matters post noting how the rightwing media has accused Obama of waging war on all sorts of cherished American holidays: Hanukkah, Christmas, Thanksgiving, Veterans Day, Memorial Day, Easter, Ramadan, Halloween.\n\nMedia Matters has been following the imaginary \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d since its inaugural campaign in 2004. In a typical entry, on November 29, 2012, Media Matters noted:\n\nFox News demonstrated the fundamental hypocrisy of its claim that progressives are engaged in a war on Christmas by expressing outrage at Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee because he uses the term \u201choliday tree\u201d rather \u201cChristmas tree\u201d to refer to the tree that will adorn the statehouse during the holiday season. However, minutes later, Fox announced that it would host its own \u201choliday wish list\u201d segment.\n\nWeeks later, just days before Christmas, they reported:\n\nBill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s annual fight against the manufactured \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d has become a revered holiday tradition over at Fox News. Just like last year, in December O\u2019Reilly has spent more time on his show discussing the \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d than actual military conflicts. As usual, events O\u2019Reilly identified as a unified \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d were almost always isolated incidents from around the country, usually pertaining to concerns over separation of church and state or efforts to make holiday celebrations more inclusive.\n\nOf course, the idea of defending purely Christian holidays is fundamentally absurd, considering how impure they are in the first place. Easter is basically a spring fertility festival (rabbits, eggs, get it?) and Christmas as we know it is similarly syncretic (as a very unhappy Christian explains at length here). But beyond the absurdity is the right\u2019s poisonous ill-humor \u2014 exactly the opposite of the good feelings people naturally bring to these celebrations.\n\nAn even darker perversion is at work in the holidays related to patriotism \u2014 Memorial Day, 4th of July and Veterans Day in particular \u2014 in which mindless jingoism is promoted, along with a torrent of divisive accusations. The true meaning of patriotism has its origins in the tradition of civic republicanism, of the sort that was practiced by the Renaissance-era Italian city-states. In a world dominated by large feudal hierarchies, with powerful militaries at their command, citizens of republics were collectively and individually responsible for sustaining the sphere of relatively remarkable freedom they enjoyed \u2014 including, but not limited to being responsible for military defense. The spirit of patriotism which animated them derived from the fact that they were responsible for continually re-creating the political community that gave their lives meaning. It was a feeling that no feudal subject could feel \u2014 patriotism and civic republicanism were inextricably linked.\n\nThis is not to say there weren\u2019t other forms of \u2014 well, loyalty, if you want. These are as old as humanity itself. They are most positive in the form of family bonds, and decidedly darker in the form of jingoism, with a spectrum of shades in between. But patriotism was more than loyalty. It was ownership. It was identity. And it was a large part of why America initially distrusted standing armies, and sought to protect itself through its state-level militias \u2014 which is the real reason behind the Second Amendment. It was not really until the 19th century, with the invention of modern nationalism and mass militaries, that a counterfeit simulacrum of patriotism emerged \u2014 one devoid of the critical consciousness that civic republicanism required.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When conservative pundits accuse Obama of \"disrespecting\" the military, they're missing what's really important", "author": "Paul Rosenberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "When conservative pundits accuse Obama of \"disrespecting\" the military, they're missing what's really important", "title": "The fake patriotism of Fox News: What the right doesn\u2019t understand about Memorial Day", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/24/the_fake_patriotism_of_fox_news_what_the_right_doesnt_understand_about_memorial_day/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/bill_oreilly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When conservative pundits accuse Obama of \"disrespecting\" the military, they're missing what's really important", "creator": "@PaulHRosenberg", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/bill_oreilly.jpg", "title": "The fake patriotism of Fox News: What the right doesn\u2019t understand about Memorial Day", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The fake patriotism of Fox News: What the right doesn\u2019t understand about Memorial Day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Conservatism, Editor's Picks, Erick Erickson, Fox News, Jingoism, Memorial Day, Patriotism, U.S. Military", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2bc\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Conservatism, Editor's Picks, Erick Erickson, Fox News, Jingoism, Memorial Day, Patriotism, U.S. Military, News, Politics NewsMemorial Day \u2014 or Decoration Day, as it is also known \u2014 is a day of remembrance.\n(C) On Memorial Day, 2002, President Bush George W.
