But Vuillermoz responded with a strong attack and then raised both his arms in the air when he crossed the line to give French riders a first win on this year\u2019s Tour.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to Vuillermoz. That was a great win, he was very strong,\u201d Froome said. \u201cThat was a tough climb, my team did a great job to bring me to the front. There was a lot of head wind.\u201d\n\nVuillermoz, a former mountain bike specialist, finished third on stage 3, which also finished with a sharp climb.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been a childhood dream of mine to win a stage on the Tour,\u201d said the 27-year-old Vuillermoz. \u201cI lost my father three years ago. I was thinking of him a lot today and I hope he\u2019s proud of me.\u201d\n\nBritish rider Dan Martin was second and Spaniard Alejandro Valverde placed third.\n\nThe climb took its toll and Nibali lost 10 seconds to Froome and to his other main Tour rivals: two-time champion Alberto Contador, 2013 Tour runner-up Nairo Quintana of Colombia and American Tejay Van Garderen, who has made a solid start to the race.\n\nAs they started to climb, thousands of raucous fans \u2014 many of whom were waving the black and white flag of Brittany \u2014 cheered them on loudly.\n\nFroome positioned himself to the right, while Vuillermoz and two other riders pushed ahead. Froome then launched one of his trademark blistering attacks but, after Vuillermoz showed he could respond in kind, Froome let him go and rolled in 10 seconds later in eighth place.\n\nFroome\u2019s attack did some damage, though, as Nibali crawled up at a sluggish pace.\n\n\u201cI was surprised to learn that I gained some time on Vincenzo Nibali there,\u201d Froome said.\n\nBefore the start, Eritrean fans waved flags and chanted songs in honor of the African MTN-Qhubeka team\u2019s two Eritrean riders: Daniel Teklehaimanot and Merhawi Kudus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, they\u2019re so passionate about their own people, and their own countrymen\u2019s success,\u201d team principal Douglas Ryder told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to see them come out and support the riders.\u201d\n\nMTN-Qhubeka is the first African team to compete in the Tour, with two South Africans also racing.\n\nRolling through the Brittany countryside, the riders went past the imposing Chateau de Hac on the Cotes-d\u2019Armor, a 15th century castle perched on the Brittany coastline.\n\nAn early breakaway of four riders were joined by a small group some 69 kilometers (42.8 miles) from the line, with Froome\u2019s yellow jersey group about 20 seconds behind.\n\nThe stage, in baking hot conditions, took its toll and British rider Mark Cavendish, winner of Friday\u2019s seventh stage, and fellow sprinter John Degenkolb of Germany both dropped back. Kudus fell approaching the end, along with French riders Nicolas Edet and Damien Gaudin, but all continued.\n\nSunday\u2019s ninth stage is a team time trial and Monday is a well-earned rest day.\n\nAfter an intense start to the race marked by three big crashes, strong side-winds and searing heat, the rest will be needed. Especially as Tuesday is the first of three straight days of tough climbing in the Pyrenees.\n\n\u201cI feel really good at the moment. Better or worse than 2013, it\u2019s hard to say,\u201d Froome said. \u201cWhen we arrive in the Pyrenees that will be the Tour. The fight for the yellow jersey will begin then.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Alexis Vuillermoz wins 8th stage of Tour de France; Froome keeps lead", "title": "Alexis Vuillermoz wins 8th stage of Tour de France; Froome keeps lead", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/11/alexis-vuillermoz-wins-8th-stage-of-tour-de-france-froome-keeps-lead/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150711_093812_tour-de-france.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150711_093812_tour-de-france.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-11T09:36:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T05:22:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s always been a childhood dream of mine to win a stage on the Tour,\u201d said the 27-year-old Vuillermoz.\nAfter Vuillermoz made an early move, Froome counter-attacked about 850 meters from the end and briefly moved into the lead.\n\u201cThat was a tough climb, my team did a great job to bring me to the front.\n\u201cI was surprised to learn that I gained some time on Vincenzo Nibali there,\u201d Froome said.\nFroome positioned himself to the right, while Vuillermoz and two other riders pushed ahead."}
