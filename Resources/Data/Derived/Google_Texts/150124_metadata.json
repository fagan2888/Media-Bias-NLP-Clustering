It was unfortunate. It was a big weekend for us. We could have made some huge strides in the NCHC, and it didn\u2019t work out that way for us.\u201d\n\nThe Pioneers played their third game without All-American defenseman Joey LaLeggia (upper-body injury) and didn\u2019t seemingly get any bounces.\n\n\u201cFor the hockey gods to be on your side, you have to be the warrior team. CC was more the warrior team,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cWe had some passengers again tonight.\u201d\n\nCC has won just six games this season \u2014 four during its past eight games \u2014 but the Tigers celebrated in front of a sellout crowd after taking possession of the Gold Pan, which DU had owned three of the last four years.\n\nDenver, which only needed a weekend tie to retain the traveling trophy, fell to 9-21-5 against CC at the World Arena. The Tigers won 3-2 in Denver on Friday.\n\nGame 2 on the Olympic-size ice was a chess match after both teams scored early.\n\nCC\u2019s Aaron Harstad tallied 16:06 into the game, and DU\u2019s Matt Tabrum tied it at 18:20.\n\nHarstad took a defenseman-to-defenseman pass from Erie product Jaccob Slavin and boomed a shot through traffic past Brittain.\n\nTabrum cashed in on linemate Arnold\u2019s rebound down low to beat senior goalie Josh Thorimbert.\n\nColorado College (6-18-6, 6-9-1 National Collegiate Hockey Conference) is 4-2-2 in its past eight games. The Pioneers (14-12-6, 8-9-3) slipped to fifth in the eight-team NCHC.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers\n\nDU Recap\n\nThe Post\u2019s three stars\n\n1.
