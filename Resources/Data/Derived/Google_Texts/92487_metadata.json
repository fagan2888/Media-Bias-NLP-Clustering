That\u2019s how long some 250,000 Coloradans have to buy themselves some Presidentially-approved, federally-mandated healthy health insurance on the Internet. The relevant website is Connect for Health Colorado.\n\nThose who don\u2019t enroll by March 31 won\u2019t be able to get coverage on the open market for the rest of 2014, barring a big life event such as job loss. The next public enrollment period begins November 15 and will run until February of 2015. If you miss next week\u2019s deadline you\u2019ll also be subject to the tax penalty otherwise known as the individual mandate \u2014 $95 per adult and $47.50 per child, or 1 percent of your income, whichever is greater.\n\n\u201cPeople should enroll so they can go to the doctor and get the care they need when they need it. That\u2019s really the whole reason to have health insurance and why it\u2019s important,\u201d said Adam Fox at the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also hugely important to protect yourself from medical debt, which is the number one cause of personal bankruptcy in the country,\u201d he added.\n\nFox said that over half of enrolling Coloradans qualify for subsidies, which so far average $275 per month. If an individual or family bring in less than 400% of the federal poverty line, they qualify for a subsidy.\n\nEven if they don\u2019t qualify for a subsidy, insurance may still be cheaper than previous private plans.\n\nThat was the case for Jason Lancaster, a 35 year-old Colorado business owner. Before the Affordable Care Act, Lancaster said he paid $670 a month for a Kaiser Permanente plan that covered him and his baby daughter \u2014 both healthy non-smokers. Lancaster\u2019s wife, Sara, who had elective heart surgery in 2006 for what doctors called a minor heart condition, was considered uninsurable. She was able to get on CoverColorado, pre-Affordable Care Act coverage specifically for folks with pre-existing conditions, for which she paid $350 a month just for herself. All told, the family\u2019s monthly insurance was just over $1,000 with two separate $5,000 deductibles between them.\n\nLancaster said he was one of the first people to hop on the exchange when it opened. Now the entire family pays $590 a month with a $3,500 deductible, without any financial assistance.\n\n\u201cWhen I talk to reporters about this what they find most interesting\u2026 is the fact that I\u2019m a business owner and a registered Republican,\u201d said Lancaster.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that what we have [in the ACA] is perfect, but there\u2019s this perception that anyone who\u2019s a business owner and conservative is against it. I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m not calling for a repeal.\u201d\n\nThe imperfect Affordable Care Act has, as laws go, made a lot of people angry. The Colorado Division of Insurance reported \u2014 at the request of Colorado Senate Republicans \u2014 that 337,241 policy cancellations have been sent to Coloradans due to the ACA as of February 21.\n\nWhile that number exceeds the current figures for Coloradans who have signed up for health insurance (just over 250,000 including medicaid), Fox said it doesn\u2019t necessarily equal 337,241 newly uninsured people and/or families.\n\n\u201cWe know that about 92 percent of Coloradans who received cancelation notices were also offered the option to renew that plan, at least for the coming year. So it\u2019s not an immediate cancelation in that sense,\u201d he said.\n\nThis week or this fall, Coloradans whose policies were cancelled due to the ACA will also need to buy health insurance. For anyone looking for a snapshot of costs, the state exchange has put together a county by county map of unsubsidized average plan rates.\n\nFox estimates that a person who knows what kind of plan they want and has their medical information at hand could buy a policy through the exchange in about an hour (although the exchange is expecting a rush this week that may slow things down). The website comes with a built-in chat feature with enrollment guides who can answer questions. In-person guides are also available.
