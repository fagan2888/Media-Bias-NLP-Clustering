(Newser) – The four men left duking it out for the Republican nomination look likely to soon be three after Tuesday's primaries: The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll shows that in their home states, "the fortunes of Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Marco Rubio appear to be heading in opposite directions," as the Journal puts it. Kasich is ahead of Donald Trump in Ohio with a 39% to 33% lead, while Ted Cruz has 19% in the Buckeye State. Rubio, meanwhile, looks headed for a disastrous loss in Florida; he trails Trump's 43% with 22%—barely leading Cruz's 21% in his home state. Both contests are winner-take-all, with Florida's 99 delegates being the big prize of the day. In Illinois, Trump holds a 34% lead over Cruz's 25%; Kasich trails at 21%. (Rubio is cool with his Ohio supporters voting for Kasich. Kasich does not feel similarly in Florida.)
