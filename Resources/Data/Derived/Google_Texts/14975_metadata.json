Jim DeMint has some news for all you Civil War buffs out there: Everything you thought you knew about how the war led to the emancipation of the Confederacy\u2019s millions of slaves is wrong.\n\nJoining Jerry Newcombe of Truth In Action Ministries radio show last week, the Tea Party hero and architect of last year\u2019s government shutdown insisted that the popular narrative was wrong and that an expansion of federal and executive power had nothing to do with emancipation. On the contrary, DeMint insisted, it\u2019s the Constitution and fervent Christians who should get the credit \u2014 no matter what those foolish liberals say.\n\nHere\u2019s DeMint\u2019s entire quote, which really must be read in-full to be appreciated:\n\nWell, the reason that the slaves were eventually freed was the Constitution. It was like the conscience of the American people. Unfortunately, there were some court decisions like Dred Scott and others that defined some people as property; but the Constitution kept calling us back to \u2018all men are created equal\u2019 and we have inalienable rights in the minds of god. But a lot of the move to free the slaves came from the people, it did not come from the federal government. It came from a growing movement among the people, particularly people of faith, that [slavery] was wrong. People like Wilberforce who persisted for years because of his faith and because of his love for people. So no liberal is going to win a debate that big government freed the slaves. In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln, the very first Republican, who took this on as a cause and a lot of it was based on a love in his heart that comes from god.\n\nAs ThinkProgress\u2019 Ian Millhiser wrote in response, it\u2019s hard to know where to start; there\u2019s just so much here that DeMint gets wrong. But here are a few of the more obvious mistakes in DeMint\u2019s attempt to rewrite American history:\n\n*The Constitution makes no mention of \u201call men are created equal,\u201d a paraphrase of one of the most famous lines in the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of Independence is not the Constitution, which is one of the key reasons why most historians and otherwise educated people call it the Declaration of Independence instead of calling it the Constitution. Because, again, they\u2019re not the same thing.\n\n*In fact, what mention the Constitution does make of slavery is mostly value-neutral. There\u2019s the infamous three-fifths clause, of course; there\u2019s also the explicit ban on legislation intended to stop the United States\u2019 involvement in the slave trade before 1808. And, most tellingly of all, is the Fugitive Slave Clause, which required that slaves who tried to escape from one state to another in order to attain freedom be returned to their masters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former South Carolina senator and current head of the Heritage Foundation is not exactly an historian", "title": "Jim DeMint: The federal government had nothing to do with emancipating the slaves", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former South Carolina senator and current head of the Heritage Foundation is not exactly an historian", "title": "Jim DeMint: The federal government had nothing to do with emancipating the slaves", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/09/jim_demint_the_federal_government_had_nothing_to_do_with_emancipating_the_slaves/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/jim_demint2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former South Carolina senator and current head of the Heritage Foundation is not exactly an historian", "title": "Jim DeMint: The federal government had nothing to do with emancipating the slaves", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/jim_demint2.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abraham Lincoln, Civil War, Emancipation Proclamation, Heritage Foundation, Ian Millhiser, Jim DeMint, Right Wing Watch, ThinkProgress, U.S. Constitution", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89d6\"", "article_summary": "But a lot of the move to free the slaves came from the people, it did not come from the federal government.\nOn the contrary, DeMint insisted, it\u2019s the Constitution and fervent Christians who should get the credit \u2014 no matter what those foolish liberals say.\nAs ThinkProgress\u2019 Ian Millhiser wrote in response, it\u2019s hard to know where to start; there\u2019s just so much here that DeMint gets wrong.\nHere\u2019s DeMint\u2019s entire quote, which really must be read in-full to be appreciated:Well, the reason that the slaves were eventually freed was the Constitution.\nSo no liberal is going to win a debate that big government freed the slaves."}
