He also praised a Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage and a congressional rewrite of the No Child Left Behind law as further victories for causes he\u2019s made central to his presidency.\n\nStill, he said, he plans to do much more in 2016.\n\n\u201cI said at the beginning of this year that interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter \u2013 and we are only halfway through,\u201d Obama said.\n\nCalling attention to his signature legislative achievement, Obama announced that 6 million people had signed up for health care so far this year under the Affordable Care Act, a surge that officials say illustrates the program\u2019s durability.\n\nAfter the news conference, Obama was to depart for San Bernardino, California, where he planned to meet with families of the 14 victims of the recent mass shooting. He then will fly to Hawaii where he\u2019ll spend two weeks on vacation with his wife and daughters in what has become a family Christmas tradition.\n\nHours before his departure, Congress passed a major bipartisan budget package that staved off a potential government shutdown and extended tax cuts for both families and businesses. The White House has indicated Obama will sign it.\n\nObama said lawmakers had ended the year on a \u201chigh note\u201d with additional legislation on transportation and education. He noted optimistically that by averting a funding crisis for the next nine months, Congress had cleared a path for cooperation with him next year on areas of common ground.\n\n\u201cCongress and I have a long runway to get some things done for the American people,\u201d he said. He pointed to a potential criminal justice overhaul and congressional consideration of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact as areas ripe for cooperation.\n\nObama took questions as he closed out a turbulent year marked by successes on restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba, clinching a nuclear deal with Iran and finalizing an unprecedented global climate treaty. Those successes have been tempered by a lack of progress on the president\u2019s other priorities, like closing the Guantanamo Bay detention center.\n\nObama said he\u2019d present a long-delayed plan to close the prison to Congress early next year, then wait for lawmakers\u2019 reaction before determining whether to take action on his own to shut it. He predicted the prison population would dwindle by early next year to less than 100, a threshold his administration has been pushing for to bolster its argument that keeping the facility open isn\u2019t cost effective.\n\nAmid widespread fears about terrorism and extremists, Obama pushed back against critics questioning his strategy for overcoming the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much bombing you can do,\u201d he said, though he insisted anew, \u201cWe will defeat ISIS.\u201d\n\nHe also affirmed his longstanding position that Syrian President Bashar Assad must leave power for Syria to resolve its civil war, even though his administration has recently said it could accept an unspecified transition period during which Assad stayed.\n\nStill, Obama contended about Syria, \u201cFive years later, I was right.\u201d\n\nThe end of 2015 marks a major transition point for the president, who has one year left to try to finish as many of his projects as possible. He won\u2019t be rolling out sweeping new policy proposals that would be unlikely to get serious consideration amid the focus on electing his successor. The White House is promising Obama will deliver a \u201cnon-traditional\u201d State of the Union address in January laying out an agenda that includes further executive steps on climate change and gun control.\n\nObama plans to return to the White House in early January to begin a final year in office that will be increasingly overshadowed by the 2016 presidential campaign. Predicting success for his party, Obama said he was confident Democrats would nominate a strong candidate to replace him.\n\n\u201cI think I will have a Democratic successor,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd I will campaign very hard to make that happen.\u201d\n\nGuest", "article_metadata": {"description": "Barack Obama has traditionally held a comprehensive end-of-year event in which he answers questions from reporters \u2013 2015 will be no different.", "application-name": "WBUR: Here and Now", "og": {"site_name": "hereandnow", "description": "Barack Obama has traditionally held a comprehensive end-of-year event in which he answers questions from reporters \u2013 2015 will be no different.", "title": "President Obama Holds End-Of-Year Press Conference", "url": "http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2015/12/18/obama-end-of-year", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/11/files/2015/12/1218_obama-press-conference-624x416.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "President Obama Holds End-Of-Year Press Conference", "url": "http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2015/12/18/obama-end-of-year", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/11/files/2015/12/1218_obama-press-conference-624x416.jpg", "site": "@HereAndNow", "player": {"width": 360, "identifier": "https://embed.wbur.org/twitter-cards/hereandnow/2015/12/18/obama-end-of-year", "height": 140}, "card": "player"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-12-18", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "article_summary": "The White House has indicated Obama will sign it.\nObama plans to return to the White House in early January to begin a final year in office that will be increasingly overshadowed by the 2016 presidential campaign.\nPredicting success for his party, Obama said he was confident Democrats would nominate a strong candidate to replace him.\nThe White House is promising Obama will deliver a \u201cnon-traditional\u201d State of the Union address in January laying out an agenda that includes further executive steps on climate change and gun control.\nAfter the news conference, Obama was to depart for San Bernardino, California, where he planned to meet with families of the 14 victims of the recent mass shooting."}
