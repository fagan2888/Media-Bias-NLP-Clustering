It professes to believe that space photographs are faked along with all the tangible evidence of a spherical Earth. Nothing matters but what they feel beneath their feet, and that feels flat.\n\nAt least those people are few in number and harmless. Not so their political equivalent \u2014 the Republican Party.\n\nThe science of global warming \u2014 that it\u2019s happening, that it\u2019s bad, and that human activity is responsible \u2014 is virtually as settled as the proof that the world is round. The isolated kooks with doctorates who disagree resemble the \u201cexperts\u201d who said cigarettes were harmless. Not by coincidence, the conspiracy to deny global warming follows the tobacco lobby\u2019s old playbook: Deny, disparage, confuse.\n\nFrom statehouses like Florida\u2019s to both houses of Congress, the GOP is in deliberate denial. In Rick Scott\u2018s Florida, state employees are forbidden to utter \u201cclimate change\u201d or \u201cglobal warming.\u201d North Carolina\u2019s infamous legislature barred its scientists from factoring global warming into their assessments of coastal erosion. Nationally, the Environmental Protection Agency is up there with Obamacare on the GOP hit list.\n\nThe party line is so pervasive that Rep. David Jolly caused a stir when he renounced it recently to an audience at the University of South Florida.\n\n\u201cI think the climate\u2019s changing. I think man\u2019s had an impact, and we need to stop arguing about the science,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 I truly do not understand why members of Congress argue over science.\u201d\n\nActually, it\u2019s easy to understand. The explanation is in Jane Mayer\u2018s \u201cDark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires behind the Rise of the Radical Right.\u201d\n\nThe most important book so far in 2016, it explains in detail how successfully the billionaires have conspired against climate science, health care, environmental protection, campaign finance reform and just about everything else that matters.\n\nThe Tea Party, the best-known example of their success, wasn\u2019t exactly spontaneous combustion. It was fed and fanned from the outset by the petrochemical billionaires David and Charles Koch, their allies in the super-rich right-wing, their acolytes on talk radio, and the propaganda machine that calls itself Fox News.\n\nThe Kochtopus, as some describe it, owes its grip not just to the campaign contributions that elect, defeat and intimidate politicians. The Gilded Age\u2019s robber barons were comparative amateurs. The modern strategy is to manipulate public opinion and co-opt the grassroots. An example of that is in the history of Obamacare, which was popular when first proposed.\n\n\u201cIf there was a single ultra-wealthy interest group that hoped to see Obama fail as he took office,\u201d writes Mayer, \u201cit was the fossil fuel industry\u2026 And if there was one test of its members\u2019 concentrated financial power over the machinery of American democracy, it was this minority\u2019s ability to stave off government action on climate change as science and the rest of the world were moving in the opposite direction. While Obama\u2019s health-care bill was useful in riling up Tea Party protesters, his environmental and energy policies were the real target.\u201d\n\nThe strategy included personal attacks on climate scientists. Mayer, a New Yorker staff writer, got a taste of that. While she researched the book, a private investigator went after her and a smear campaign accused her, falsely, of plagiarism.\n\nMayer cites a seminal study by Greenpeace. From 2005 to 2008, the Kochs sent almost $25 million \u201cinto dozens of different organizations fighting climate reform.\u201d\n\nA subsequent study by Robert Brulle, a Drexel University professor, identified some 140 conservative foundations involved in a \u201ccorporate lobbying campaign disguised as a tax-exempt, philanthropic endeavor,\u201d waging a \u201cpermanent campaign to undermine Americans\u2019 faith in climate science and to defeat any effort to regulate carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nBrulle identified $558 million in 5,299 grants to 91 different nonprofit organizations. The subversion of American democracy has been financed out of the Treasury\u2019s back door.\n\nThe Koch influence, applied through charitable contributions as well as through such well-known fronts as Americans for Prosperity and such witless stooges as Sarah \u201cDrill, Baby, Drill\u201d Palin, extended even to corrupting the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History.\n\nAs Mayer describes an exhibit that opened in March 2010 at the David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins, \u201cthe message, funded by his fortune, was that the human race had evolved for the better in response to previous environmental challenges and would adapt in the face of climate change too.\n\n\u201cAn interactive game suggested that if the climate on earth became intolerable, people might build \u2018underground cities\u2019 and develop \u2018short, compact bodies\u2019 or \u2018curved spines\u2019 so that \u2018moving around in tight spaces will be no problem.'\u201d\n\nDemocrats have hardly been immune to the science deniers and their campaign money, but it\u2019s only the Republicans who have been thoroughly brainwashed.\n\nThere\u2019s this to say for the Flat Earth Society: It compares favorably to the Republican Party in one respect. According to that Huffington Science article, its leaders accept the evidence of global warming even though much of it comes from NASA, an arch villain in their conspiracy theology.\n\nThey also believe in evolution.\n\n***\n\nMartin Dyckman is a retired associate editor of the newspaper formerly known as the St. Petersburg Times.
