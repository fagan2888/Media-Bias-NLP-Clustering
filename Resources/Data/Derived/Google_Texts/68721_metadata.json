and who indicated they were going to be open and transparent - should bow be caught red-handed doing everything in their power to block access to public information,\" Associate Professor Coghill, a former Labor Speaker, said.\n\nGovernment spokesman Mark Lee said Mr Batskos was appointed by the previous Labor government as part of a panel of legal experts, and retained by the Coalition.\n\n\"In addition to providing legal advice to departmental FoI officers, Mr Batskos - along with others on the panel - has also represented government departments and agencies at VCAT hearings when departmental FoI officers have been unable to do so,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nBut the Opposition spokesman for government scrutiny, Martin Pakula, said the Coalition had gone beyond previous regimes in subverting access to information, despite former premier Ted Baillieu promising in Opposition \"ask and you shall receive\".\n\n\"The veil of secrecy has become a literal iron curtain and the Government has become so paranoid and so secretive, they want to let out as little information as possible,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A GATEKEEPER who advises public servants on exemptions to Freedom of Information requests has been paid almost $1 million by the Victorian taxpayer.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "HeraldSun", "description": "A GATEKEEPER who advises public servants on exemptions to Freedom of Information requests has been paid almost $1 million by the Victorian taxpayer.", "title": "Freedom of Information lawyer Mick Batskos has cost taxpayers $1m for advice to Victorian public servants", "url": "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/freedom-of-information-lawyer-mick-batskos-has-cost-taxpayers-1m-for-advice-to-victorian-public-servants/story-fni0fit3-1226724733944", "image": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2013/09/22/1226724/733917-d4fdf1d0-21aa-11e3-be3f-44d866e24c59.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2013/09/22/1226724/733917-d4fdf1d0-21aa-11e3-be3f-44d866e24c59.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@theheraldsun", "id": "@theheraldsun"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135469303148773}, "articleid": 1226724733944, "keywords": "government departments, literal iron curtain, governance expert, government scrutiny, government circles, public information, special expertise, Monash University, legal experts, Department of Justice, Martin Pakula, Ted Baillieu, public servants, Government spokesman, Ken Coghill, Mark Lee", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sun Sep 22 22:58:25 EST 2013", "modified_time": "Sun Sep 22 22:58:25 EST 2013", "author": "Angus Thompson"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee1c\"", "article_summary": "Freedom of Information lawyer Mick Batskos has cost taxpayers $1m for advice to Victorian public servantsA GATEKEEPER who advises public servants on exemptions to Freedom of Information requests has been paid almost $1 million by the Victorian taxpayer.\nMr Batskos is regarded in government circles as a \"guru\" with an encyclopedic knowledge of how best to use exemptions in the Act.\nGovernment spokesman Mark Lee said Mr Batskos was appointed by the previous Labor government as part of a panel of legal experts, and retained by the Coalition.\nThe Department of Justice spent almost $370,000, while the Department of Primary Industries (now DEPI) paid more than $250,000 for Mr Batskos' expertise.\nMr Batskos declined to comment when the Herald Sun provided his firm with a number of detailed questions about his work for the Government."}
