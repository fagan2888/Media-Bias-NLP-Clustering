Heuerman has allegiance to the Detroit Red Wings and Florida Panthers. He grew up playing hockey in Florida and Michigan, switching to football in the ninth grade because his triple-A hockey commitment proved too costly to his family life.\n\n\u201cHockey is a different world, especially in Naples, Fla.,\u201d said Heuerman, who was selected by the Broncos in Friday\u2019s third round of the NFL draft. \u201cYou can only get to a certain point before you have to move away to keep going. I got to that point.\u201d\n\nHeuerman played for Florida\u2019s first triple-A hockey program before moving to Michigan in eighth grade and playing for one of the country\u2019s triple-A heavyweights, Detroit Compuware. His two younger brothers stayed in Naples as Heuerman thought about advancing to the Ontario Hockey League, part of Canada\u2019s major-junior system.\n\n\u201cThey were going to grow up without me if I did that,\u201d Heuerman said. \u201cSo I chose to go home and be with them \u2026 And tried out for football. It all worked out.\u201d\n\nHeuerman excelled in high-school football in Naples and helped Ohio State win the national championship last year. He started 14 of 15 games as a senior, catching 17 passes for 207 yards and two touchdowns. He can bench press 225 pounds 26 times and run the 40-yard dash in 4.8-seconds. He\u2019s a similarly strong skater, but is focused on football.\n\n\u201cI honestly stay away from hockey as much as I can,\u201d Heuerman said. \u201cI grew up playing it for so long. It\u2019s like an ex-girlfriend, when you break up with her, you don\u2019t keep talking to her and hanging out with her. But I do miss it.\u201d\n\nHockey laid the groundwork for Heuerman\u2019s work ethic and discipline. He said some hockey practices began as early as 4 a.m. because of the lack of ice arenas and the growing popularity of the sport.\n\n\u201cHockey teaches you a lot,\u201d Heuerman said. \u201cIt teaches you hard work, dedication, what it takes to succeed. It teaches you toughness and I\u2019ve taken a lot of things from the game of hockey and brought it over to the game of football. Definitely helped in my success.\u201d\n\nElway is glad to have him. \u201cWe really believe he\u2019s got tremendous amount of upside, brings in the right mentality, tough, and is a great competitor,\u201d Elway said.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or Twitter: @MikeChambers.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hockey shaped work ethic of Broncos draft pick Jeff Heuerman", "title": "Hockey shaped work ethic of Broncos draft pick Jeff Heuerman", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/02/hockey-shaped-work-ethic-of-broncos-draft-pick-jeff-heuerman/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150502_011608_jeff-heuerman.jpg", "height": 459}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150502_011608_jeff-heuerman.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-02T13:08:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T04:28:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He grew up playing hockey in Florida and Michigan, switching to football in the ninth grade because his triple-A hockey commitment proved too costly to his family life.\n\u201cHockey teaches you a lot,\u201d Heuerman said.\n\u201cHockey is a different world, especially in Naples, Fla.,\u201d said Heuerman, who was selected by the Broncos in Friday\u2019s third round of the NFL draft.\nHis two younger brothers stayed in Naples as Heuerman thought about advancing to the Ontario Hockey League, part of Canada\u2019s major-junior system.\nI got to that point.\u201dHeuerman played for Florida\u2019s first triple-A hockey program before moving to Michigan in eighth grade and playing for one of the country\u2019s triple-A heavyweights, Detroit Compuware."}
