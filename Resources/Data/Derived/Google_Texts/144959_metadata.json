It would be a switch from assisting Tad Boyle at the University of Colorado.\n\nAnother is that Rudy Carey, the longtime Denver figure in boys basketball, was perhaps going to bid on the vacancy heading Cherry Creek\u2019s boys in Greenwood Village. However, Carey said on Saturday there\u2019s nothing to it and he\u2019s happy to remain at Denver East.\n\nCarey, second in state annals in career victories, did allow that he\u2019d like to see his son, David, get consideration for a college spot.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s qualified,\u201d Carey said. \u201cHe has coached the past three Mr. Colorado Basketball choices and he has a mind for the game. He knows how to handle himself.\u201d\n\nThe younger Carey, who played for his father at Manual and Denver East in the first part of the 1990s, has served as an assistant coach with the Angels and he headed the former Montbello. As an assistant with Denver East, he helped to tutor Dominique Collier, now at CU and a two-time Mr. Colorado Basketball (by The Denver Post) and the past season\u2019s winner, family relative Brian Carey, now at Texas Southern.\n\n\u201cDavid would be an asset to a college program both as an assistant and a recruiter, and he knows how to handle kids,\u201d Rudy Carey said. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to give them discipline and they need it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Prepped", "description": "Denver East coach hoping son has earned college appeal", "title": "Rudy Carey hoping son David will get college consideration", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/preps/2016/03/12/rudy-carey-hoping-son-david-will-get-college-consideration/19307/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/preps/files/2013/09/post-preps.png?fit=495%2C495", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Denver East coach hoping son has earned college appeal", "title": "Rudy Carey hoping son David will get college consideration", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/preps/2016/03/12/rudy-carey-hoping-son-david-will-get-college-consideration/19307/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/preps/files/2013/09/post-preps.png?fit=495%2C495", "creator": "@neildevlin", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "2015-16 boys basketball"}, "article_summary": "\u201cDavid would be an asset to a college program both as an assistant and a recruiter, and he knows how to handle kids,\u201d Rudy Carey said.\nCarey, second in state annals in career victories, did allow that he\u2019d like to see his son, David, get consideration for a college spot.\nAnother is that Rudy Carey, the longtime Denver figure in boys basketball, was perhaps going to bid on the vacancy heading Cherry Creek\u2019s boys in Greenwood Village.\n\u201cHe has coached the past three Mr. Colorado Basketball choices and he has a mind for the game.\nHowever, Carey said on Saturday there\u2019s nothing to it and he\u2019s happy to remain at Denver East."}
