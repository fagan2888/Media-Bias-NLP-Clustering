Apparently \u201crepeal and replace\u201d has been updated to \u201cmention the states and change the name.\u201d\n\nMr. Gingrich, a former House speaker, boasted of his idea that states can opt out of Obamacare, provided their replacement insurance product \u201coffer[s] coverage that is at least as comprehensive as the ACA\u2019s essential health benefits package; that is at least as affordable; that insures at least a comparable number of residents; and that maintains federal deficit neutrality.\u201d Also, the provisions requiring the coverage of patients\u2019 preexisting conditions must be maintained. The only change I can tell is that the individual mandate may be waived. But waiving it would cause insurance premiums to rise, which would violate the requirements above.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure why Mr. Daschle, a former Senate majority leader, would attach his name to this boastful Republican rebranding effort. It is clearly intended only to mollify opponents of Obamacare by changing the name but, because of a lack of any better ideas on the Republican side, not changing the policy much. Or, in other words, the same product in a different package.\n\nGregory Gertner, Bethesda", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "gregory gertner, newt gingrich, tom daschle, obamacare, affordable care act, health insurance", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Feb. 4 op-ed by Newt Gingrich and Tom Daschle, \u201cA bipartisan Obamacare solution,\u201d confirmed that the only problem with the Affordable Care Act is the president (and Congress) who passed it.\u00a0Appare...", "title": "Why is a Democrat on board with this rebranding of Obamacare?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-is-a-democrat-on-board-with-this-rebranding-of-obamacare/2016/02/05/62cddfea-cb7a-11e5-b9ab-26591104bb19_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/28/CapitalBusiness/Images/203455798.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-is-a-democrat-on-board-with-this-rebranding-of-obamacare/2016/02/05/62cddfea-cb7a-11e5-b9ab-26591104bb19_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "gregory gertner, newt gingrich, tom daschle, obamacare, affordable care act, health insurance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "62cddfea-cb7a-11e5-b9ab-26591104bb19", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "The Feb. 4 op-ed by Newt Gingrich and Tom Daschle, \u201cA bipartisan Obamacare solution,\u201d confirmed that the only problem with the Affordable Care Act is the president (and Congress) who passed it.\u00a0Appare..."}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m not quite sure why Mr. Daschle, a former Senate majority leader, would attach his name to this boastful Republican rebranding effort.\nThe Feb. 4 op-ed by Newt Gingrich and Tom Daschle, \u201cA bipartisan Obamacare solution,\u201d confirmed that the only problem with the Affordable Care Act is the president (and Congress) who passed it.\nIt is clearly intended only to mollify opponents of Obamacare by changing the name but, because of a lack of any better ideas on the Republican side, not changing the policy much.\nBut waiving it would cause insurance premiums to rise, which would violate the requirements above.\nThe only change I can tell is that the individual mandate may be waived."}
