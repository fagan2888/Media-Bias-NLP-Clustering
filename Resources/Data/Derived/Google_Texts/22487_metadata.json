But will Bernie feel the billionaire? Reuters has an exclusive interview with the man who rented out the Senate for a night from Harry Reid about his strategy in the 2016 election, and Steyer says Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t closed the deal on climate change. He\u2019s mulling whether he should back Bernie Sanders, whose socialist model comes closest to Steyer\u2019s desires:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s fully fleshed out everything she has to say about energy and climate,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cI think that as the campaign goes on I would imagine she will put out more detailed plans of exactly what she thinks. I don\u2019t find what she\u2019s said inadequate, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s complete yet.\u201d Sanders has a climate agenda that on its face appears to resonate more closely with Steyer\u2019s \u2013 an aggressive move away from fossil fuels, including a ban on hydraulic fracturing. But he has also railed against billionaire influence in politics and has pledged not to accept cash from big donors. Steyer said Sanders\u2019 views on big money \u201ccertainly wouldn\u2019t disqualify him for us, I can tell you that.\u201d \u201cWhat Bernie Sanders is talking about, which is trying to get back to a more perfect democracy, is something that we support too. We just think that the idea of \u2026 wishing the rules were different and then pretending they were, is something which, unfortunately, probably would be disastrous from the standpoint of energy and climate,\u201d Steyer said.\n\nReuters\u2019 Richard Valdmanis raises a good point. Would Sanders accept Steyer\u2019s billionaire support? The Democratic near-frontrunner has spent most of his time railing against the influence of the wealthy in politics. Maybe Bernie would decline based on Steyer\u2019s track record of futility, but somehow it seems much more likely that Sanders would embrace Steyer as the kind of billionaire whose influence he wants in politics \u2014 as long as it supports Sanders.\n\nSpeaking of near-frontrunner status, the Associated Press expresses shock over the real possibility that Sanders may sweep the first two states in the primary process:\n\nSanders\u2019 down-to-business demeanor on the campaign trail belies the youthful enthusiasm that\u2019s accompanied his unexpected rise in the Democratic race for president. With less than two weeks until voting begins, the 74-year-old self-described democratic socialist could win both Iowa and New Hampshire, a once unthinkable outcome in a primary campaign that was supposed to be tailor-made for Hillary Clinton. \u201cToday the inevitable candidate doesn\u2019t look quite so inevitable,\u201d Sanders told voters who braved icy roads and single-digit temperatures to see him speak Tuesday morning in Fort Dodge. \u2026 Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats on Capitol Hill, began his campaign with firm rules about what he was not willing to do to win the presidency. He\u2019s among the most vigorous critics of super PACs, political groups that can accept donations of any size, and frequently touts his campaign\u2019s reliance on small donations. He also vowed to avoid negative, personal attacks on his rivals.\n\nThat shows why embracing Steyer might actually do more damage than good for Sanders. He has built his dark-horse challenge into a contending campaign on the basis of his authenticity. In a populist cycle, I argue in my column for The Week, he has an abundance of authenticity while Hillary has none \u2014 and that might be enough:\n\nHillary Clinton had hoped to ride Obama\u2019s coattails to an easy nomination, but now she looks like she might lose both Iowa and New Hampshire to Bernie Sanders. In the debate this past weekend, Sanders pushed her into the position of declaring herself the most stalwart defender of ObamaCare, a program so unpopular that the last time a majority of voters supported it in any poll was three years ago. Clinton appears to have concluded that authenticity within the Democratic coalition depends on the closeness of the embrace with Obama, even though she began her run by trying to keep her distance from him. Sanders has a better grasp of the trend, and a political lifetime of single-minded pursuit of the left\u2019s class-warfare anger, in part fueled by the perception of ObamaCare as a corporate handout. This week, he offered some red meat to the progressive-populist base in his soak-the-rich, single-payer national healthcare proposal. That one comes with a price tag of $14 trillion, but as a signal of authenticity to the part of the base animating this cycle for Democrats, it\u2019s priceless. The common thread between the two parties? Very little of the attention in either party is on policy. Voters of both persuasions listened to policy arguments through multiple election cycles, only to find out that the leadership they elected had other priorities. This is a return to the more basic politics of trust: a vote of confidence in outsiders, and no confidence in the establishment. It\u2019s no longer business \u2014 it\u2019s personal, and it will stay that way to the conventions and all the way to November.\n\nHooking up with Steyer might undermine Sanders\u2019 entire raison d\u2019\u00eatre. If Steyer comes about the Bernie bus in a general election, it will be of no matter. For now, the best way Steyer can help Sanders is simply to not help Hillary. Don\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s exactly how it plays out, especially if Sanders wins in both Iowa and New Hampshire. There may be more than one One Percenter who gets back to the sidelines if and when that happens.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Authenticity.", "title": "Top progressive billionaire still not sold on Hillary", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/20/top-progressive-billionaire-still-not-sold-on-hillary/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-20T23:41:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-20T20:23:10+00:00"}, "keywords": "Bernie Sanders, climate alarmism, Hillary Clinton, Tom Steyer,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Would Sanders accept Steyer\u2019s billionaire support?\nTop progressive billionaire still not sold on Hillaryposted at 6:41 pm on January 20, 2016 by Ed MorrisseyTom Steyer may be feeling the Bern in 2016.\nBut he has also railed against billionaire influence in politics and has pledged not to accept cash from big donors.\nFor now, the best way Steyer can help Sanders is simply to not help Hillary.\nDon\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s exactly how it plays out, especially if Sanders wins in both Iowa and New Hampshire."}
