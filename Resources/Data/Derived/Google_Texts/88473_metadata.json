But this bloodletting is no longer the sideshow to reasoned debate \u2014 it has become the main attraction.\n\nLast week, someone using the Douglas County teachers union Twitter account posted during a school board meeting that a teacher looked like a \u201cpenis\u201d and then called him a derogatory name. The actual substance of the board meeting, however, did not get reported.\n\n(Union officials, incidentally, claim the account was hacked.)\n\nIt is noteworthy that neither of those colorful words, nor expressions like \u201ctotal loser,\u201d appears in the text of the Lincoln-Douglas debates.\n\nPolitical rhetoric has deteriorated through a kind of lurid verbal dialectic: Candidate A insults candidate B, candidate B counterpunches, and a new low in rhetoric is achieved. The cycle begins again, only louder.\n\nAnd yet it isn\u2019t just the junior high-style \u201cLook at that face! Would anyone vote for that?\u201d kind of invective that most debases democracy; it\u2019s the better cloaked fallacies and lies that do greater injury because they deceive voters.\n\nIt is time for the best to gain some conviction and say \u201cno more\u201d to the debasement of our elections. We must hold candidates and elected officials accountable for what they say. Fact-checking websites, though far from perfect and reflecting the biases of the checkers, do a fair job sorting candidates\u2019 claims. Logical fallacies in politicians\u2019 arguments are harder to spot. Keep an eye out for these:\n\n\u2022 The straw man argument mischaracterizes an opponent\u2019s argument so as to easily defeat it. Chelsea Clinton recently criticized Sen. Bernie Sanders for \u201cwant[ing] to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare and private insurance,\u201d and praised her mother\u2019s policies as a better alternative. When she omitted that Sanders wants to replace these programs with a nationalized health care plan, she made straw of his argument.\n\n\u2022 The false dilemma fallacy frames choices as strictly binary; you\u2019re for us or against us. When President Obama said last year, \u201cThe choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy\u201d (by which he meant the Iran Deal) \u201cand some form of war,\u201d he reduced all possible choices to two and painted the deal\u2019s opponents as warmongers. Opponents did not want war; they wanted a stronger deal.\n\n\u2022 The ad hominem arguer attacks the person rather than the substance of his argument, such as when Sen. Rand Paul jabbed Chris Christie during a recent primary debate: \u201cI don\u2019t trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead.\u201d\n\nData privacy was the issue, not post-hurricane comity. Harder to recognize is the ad hominem tu quoque. When Sen. Marco Rubio slammed Sen. Ted Cruz for criticizing New York values while still fundraising in the state, he used this type of false reasoning. The existence of New York values and their nature can be debated. Cruz\u2019s fundraising in the state is irrelevant to the argument.\n\n\u2022 The ad populum fallacy asserts that because many people believe something, it must be true. During one of the primary debates, Donald Trump defended his bankruptcies by asserting that \u201cpeople are very, very impressed with what I\u2019ve done, the business people.\u201d That\u2019s not a defense; that\u2019s an unsubstantiated assertion of popularity.\n\nUnfortunately, fallacies look like logical arguments. Along with exaggerations, mendacious insinuations, outright lies and evasiveness, fallacies distort public dialogue and negatively impact the outcome of elections. Unless the public demands better, the worst will win.\n\nKrista Kafer (tokrista@msn.com) is co-host of \u201cKelley and Kafer\u201d airing 1 to 4 p.m on 710 KNUS and a professor of communication at Colorado Christian University.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kafer: The public debate sideshow", "title": "Kafer: The public debate sideshow", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/22/kafer-the-public-debate-sideshow/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160122__20160124_Z00_OP24C_KAFERp1.jpg", "height": 441}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160122__20160124_Z00_OP24C_KAFERp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-22T13:24:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T08:19:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Keep an eye out for these:\u2022 The straw man argument mischaracterizes an opponent\u2019s argument so as to easily defeat it.\nBut this bloodletting is no longer the sideshow to reasoned debate \u2014 it has become the main attraction.\nAlong with exaggerations, mendacious insinuations, outright lies and evasiveness, fallacies distort public dialogue and negatively impact the outcome of elections.\nPolitical rhetoric has deteriorated through a kind of lurid verbal dialectic: Candidate A insults candidate B, candidate B counterpunches, and a new low in rhetoric is achieved.\nThere is nothing new about hurling insults at one\u2019s political opponents (Adams and Jefferson did it from time to time)."}
