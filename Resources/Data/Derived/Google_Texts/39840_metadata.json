She was allegedly hired as a business analyst, which qualified her for an H-1B visa. When the woman arrived in the United States, Richard Tinimbang put her to work full time as a nanny and housekeeper, the indictment states.\n\nThe couple allegedly attempted to force the woman to sign a servitude contract that stipulated a salary of $66 per day \u2013 regardless of the number of hours worked \u2013 for a term of seven years.\n\nThe contract further provided that if the woman quit before the seventh year, she would be required to pay $25,000 in damages, the indictment states. To force the woman to surrender her passport and sign the contract, the couple threatened to send her back to the Philippines without being paid for the work she had already performed, according to the indictment.\n\n[Also: Dallas doctor convicted in landmark $375 million fraud case, largest ever in home health]\n\nMeanwhile, the couple and Josephine Tinimbang allegedly used proceeds from the healthcare fraud to buy a 5,000-square-foot residence in Lincolnwood and purchase shares of stock, vehicles, real estate, and jewelry.\n\nThe case is part of a larger healthcare fraud investigation that previously resulted in charges against 13 others. Three defendants have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing, while the other ten, including Josephine Tinimbang, are awaiting trial.\n\nThe investigation found that several individuals who worked at three related home health care companies \u2013 Donnarich Home Health Care Inc., Josdan Home Health Care Inc., and Pathways Home Health Services LLC \u2013 conspired to commit healthcare fraud and laundered money to conceal the scheme.\n\n[Also: Running list of notable 2016 healthcare frauds]\n\nThe fraud started in 2008 and continued into 2014, resulting in a loss to Medicare of $45 million, according to the indictment.\n\nRichard Tinimbang, is charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud Medicare, one count of conspiracy to pay or receive health care kickbacks, two counts of paying kickbacks to induce referrals of Medicare beneficiaries, one count of money laundering conspiracy, one count of conspiracy to obtain forced labor, and one count of presenting false statements in an immigration document.\n\nMaribel Tinimbang, is charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud Medicare, one count of money laundering conspiracy, and one count of conspiracy to obtain forced labor.\n\nTwitter: @SusanJMorse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/chicago-couple-indicted-scheme-bilk-medicare-out-45-million-and-keep-filipino-housekeeper", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/GenericFraud2HFN.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "A Chicago couple used their healthcare business to bilk Medicare out of $45 million while also conspiring to force a housekeeper to work against her will, according to an indictment returned this week in federal court in Chicago.", "title": "Chicago couple indicted in scheme to bilk Medicare out of $45 million and keep Filipino housekeeper in servitude"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/GenericFraud2HFN.png"}, "description": "A Chicago couple used their healthcare business to bilk Medicare out of $45 million while also conspiring to force a housekeeper to work against her will, according to an indictment returned this week in federal court in Chicago.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Chicago couple indicted in scheme to bilk Medicare out of $45 million and keep Filipino housekeeper in servitude"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A Chicago couple used their healthcare business to bilk Medicare out of $45 million while also conspiring to force a housekeeper to work against her will, according to an indictment returned this week in federal court in Chicago.&#13; Richard Tinimbang, 38, and his wife Maribel Tinimbang, 40,\u00a0 were part of a $45 million fraud scheme involving three Lincolnwood-based home healthcare companies owned by Richard Tinimbang's mother, Josephine Tinimbang, according to the indictment.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The case is part of a larger healthcare fraud investigation that previously resulted in charges against 13 others.\nMaribel Tinimbang, is charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud Medicare, one count of money laundering conspiracy, and one count of conspiracy to obtain forced labor.\nA Chicago couple used their healthcare business to bilk Medicare out of $45 million while also conspiring to force a housekeeper to work against her will, according to an indictment returned this week in federal court in Chicago.\n[Also: Running list of notable 2016 healthcare frauds]The fraud started in 2008 and continued into 2014, resulting in a loss to Medicare of $45 million, according to the indictment.\nWhen the woman arrived in the United States, Richard Tinimbang put her to work full time as a nanny and housekeeper, the indictment states."}
