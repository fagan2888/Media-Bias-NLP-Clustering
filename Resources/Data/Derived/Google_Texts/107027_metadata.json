And just as in the past, speeches from big-name conservative figures will take place alongside some rather offbeat panels on conservative issues.\n\nFortunately, CPAC has cut down on some of the egregiously inflammatory panels, like 2012\u2019s infamous \u201cThe Failure of Multiculturalism: How the Pursuit of Diversity is Weakening the American Identity,\u201d hosted by Peter Brimelow, leader of VDARE, which the Southern Poverty Law Center calls \u201ca race-baiting hate group.\u201d Still, that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t a handful of truly unusual panels at CPAC this year. Here\u2019s your guide to some of the most offbeat.\n\nDoes the U.S. Congress Matter Anymore? Executive Orders AND the Hopelessness of EVER Curtailing Federal Spending\n\nHosted by former American Conservative Union chairman and former National Rifle Association president David Keene and Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., this panel asks the questions \u201cSince Congress can never cut federal spending, should we stop caring about who\u2019s elected to Congress?\u201d and \u201cPresident Obama is paving the way toward severely altering the balance of powers \u2013 can he be stopped?\u201d Expect plenty of talk about Obama overreaching his power via executive orders.\n\nHealthcare After Obamacare: A Practical Guide For Living When No One Has Insurance and America Runs Out of Doctors\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nWhile it seems unlikely that an individual mandate pressuring all Americans to purchase health insurance would somehow inspire millions of doctors to give up on their careers, host Amy Fredricks of the lobbying group the 60 Plus Association is here to walk CPAC through that scenario just in case.\n\nRocky Mountain High: Does Legalized Pot Mean Society's Going Up In Smoke?\n\nColorado Republican state Rep. Janak Joshi and HotAir.com editor-at-large Mary Katharine Ham discuss whether Colorado\u2019s legalization of marijuana is harming the state. Given that Joshi voted no on regulations for marijuana stores, it\u2019s a safe bet that his answer to the Cheech and Chongian question above is a resounding \u201cno.\u201d Ham seems to have a more lighthearted take on the matter, telling her Twitter followers that she was \u201cdebating on the subject of that pot-weed the kids are talking about these days.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the Deal with Global Warming?\n\nPerhaps unfortunately, this one isn\u2019t hosted by either Jerry Seinfeld or a Jerry Seinfeld impersonator. Instead, the panel will be hosted by a number of climate change deniers including Joseph Bast, president of the Heartland Institute. Bast is the author of Heartland\u2019s \u201cThe Myth of the 98 Percent,\u201d which argues that a majority of scientists do not actually believe that global warming is a man-made phenomenon. Fellow panelist Stephen Milloy has argued against the reality of climate change on Fox News and is currently director of external policy at Murray Energy Corp., America\u2019s largest privately owned coal company. Spoiler alert: The deal with global warming is that these guys don\u2019t believe in it.\n\nWhen the Fed Stops Building and the Mint Stops Printing: Rebuilding the American Economy after a Real Crash\n\nSteve Moore, chief economist at the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, is joined by Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., and Young Voices editor Cathy Reisenwitz in this Max Maxian panel on a potential Federal Reserve crash. Earlier this year, the Heritage Foundation published a report condemning the Fed\u2019s ineffectiveness. Reisenwitz, meanwhile, routinely writes about Bitcoin\u2019s superiority to the Federal Reserve\u2019s regulations. Presumably, conversations on the panel will cover everything from the Thunderdome to cryptocurrency.\n\nNot All Quiet on the Western Front: Conservatives Are Alive in Hollywood!\n\n\u201cHollywood\u201d might be a bit of a misnomer for this panel hosted by \u201c2016: Obama\u2019s America\u201d producer and director John Sullivan. The panel also features \u201c2016: Obama\u2019s America\u201d co-director Dinesh D\u2019Souza and Daniel Lusko, director of the Christian thriller \u201cPersecuted,\u201d but none of them have any filmmaking experience with the Hollywood studio system, only low-budget documentaries and Christian films. Former Tennessee senator and \u201cLaw and Order\u201d star Fred Thompson, who will also appear at the panel, at least has a tenuous link to the Hollywood elite CPAC is supposedly taking on here.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cpac, cpac 2014, cpac panel, cpac nra, cpac obamacare, conservative political action conference", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "The conservative conference has toned down some of its more outrageous panels this year, but there are still a handful of odd talks.", "title": "Your Guide To The 6 Most Bizarre Panels At CPAC 2014", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/your-guide-6-most-bizarre-panels-cpac-2014-1559987", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/03/06/tag-reut1ers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The conservative conference has toned down some of its more outrageous panels this year, but there are still a handful of odd talks.", "title": "Your Guide To The 6 Most Bizarre Panels At CPAC 2014", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/your-guide-6-most-bizarre-panels-cpac-2014-1559987", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/03/06/tag-reut1ers.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/03/06/tag-reut1ers.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2014-03-06T17:18:20-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-06T17:54:38-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The conservative conference has toned down some of its more outrageous panels this year, but there are still a handful of odd talks."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ce6\"", "article_summary": "And just as in the past, speeches from big-name conservative figures will take place alongside some rather offbeat panels on conservative issues.\n\u201cHollywood\u201d might be a bit of a misnomer for this panel hosted by \u201c2016: Obama\u2019s America\u201d producer and director John Sullivan.\nInstead, the panel will be hosted by a number of climate change deniers including Joseph Bast, president of the Heartland Institute.\nHere\u2019s your guide to some of the most offbeat.\nColorado Republican state Rep.
