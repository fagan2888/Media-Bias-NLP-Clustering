Germany Just Confirmed People’s Worst Fear Of The Refugee Crisis

Jacob Bojesson

Radical Islamist groups in Germany take advantage of the migrant crisis by offering food and shelter to refugees with the hopes of recruiting them down the line.

Federal officials recorded more than 100 cases of known radical Islamists initiating contact with refugees, according to The Wall Street Journal. They have an easy time getting through to the desperate refugees with shelters filled up and winter fast approaching.

The refugees are unaware of the real motives of the fundamentalists but get a sense of community from the mosques.

“They start by saying, ‘We will help you live your faith,’” says Torsten Voss, the head of a regional branch of the German domestic intelligence agency. “The Islamist area comes later—that is, of course, their goal.”

More than 40 people from a refugee shelter became regulars at the Ibrahim Al Khalil mosque in Berlin, known as a meeting spot for radical Islamists.

“We come here to do our Islamic duty,” 27-year-old Syrian Ali Kafri tells The Wall Street Journal. “We don’t care if it’s aSalafi or a Muslim Brotherhood mosque.”

The Office for the Protection of the Constitution warned politicians of jihadi groups’ plans back in September when the country announced it would let 800,000 refugees in.

Germany has taken in nearly one million refugees in 2015.
