Tim Neville cast his U.S. Senate bid in strong conservative terms Tuesday evening as he hosted an official kickoff event that drew about 100 people to his campaign headquarters in Littleton.\n\nThe first issue he listed in describing his motivation to run: abortion.\n\n\u201cWe all know we have a lot of problems in Washington. When an organization like Planned Parenthood ignores the law, kills the unborn, sells their body parts for profit and we have both parties that can\u2019t even come together to end this tragedy, we have an issue with leadership,\u201d he said referencing some of the debunked claims based on videos about the health care provider. Neville said he would support a bill to declare that life begins at conception and outlaw abortions.\n\nIn a roughly 20-minute speech, Neville went on to blast Democrats \u2014 particularly President Barack Obama and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet \u2014 on a litany of issues, including immigration, Iran, energy regulation, Obamacare, Common Core, unions, spending, religious freedom, gay marriage and the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely important that we never waver in our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms,\u201d the Littleton lawmaker said in the first stop of a statewide tour to kickoff the campaign.\n\nThe remark came on the day the White House announced new gun control measures, but the candidate didn\u2019t directly address the topic. His campaign is backed by Dudley Brown, the executive director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners (RMGO) and the president of the National Association for Gun Rights.\n\nThe state lawmakers at the event to support for Neville included Reps. Lori Saine, Steve Humphrey and Justin Everett and Sen. Laura Woods.\n\nNeville\u2019s focus is no surprise given his reputation as one of the most conservative members for the GOP-led state Senate. His son, state Rep. Patrick Neville, introduced him with this line: \u201cHe loves God, guns and babies, and his records proves it.\u201d\n\nNeville is one of a half-dozen candidates in the 2016 contest (or considering a bid) to challenge Bennet in a seat that polls suggest is a tough race. So far, no Republican candidate has established himself as the front-runner \u2014 and the national party is publicly staying out of the fray after its top picks bowed out of the race.\n\n\u201cAs Washington Republicans continue their scramble to find anyone to run for Senate in Colorado, far right anti-choice warrior Tim Neville is officially throwing his hat in the ring, making for an even more crowded and divisive primary,\u201d remarked Democratic Party spokesman Andrew Zucker.\n\nIn Colorado, Neville\u2019s voting record may prove difficult to sell to a middle-of-the-road voter, but the candidate is undeterred, vowing to repeat his 2014 state legislative campaign when he unseated a Democratic leader in a swing district.\n\n\u201cWe were able to prove the pundits wrong who said a conservative like me couldn\u2019t win a race like that in that district,\u201d he said, adding later, \u201cI know how to run tough races and I know how to win.\u201d\n\nIn an interview after his speech, Neville declined to commit to supporting U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell if elected, saying he \u201cwould have some questions.\u201d\n\nNeville debuted his campaign Oct. 1 and spent the last three months raising money. His campaign said it did not have its fundraising tallied, but Neville said he is encouraged. \u201cI think we are definitely going to attain our goals and a little more,\u201d he said.\n\nThe reports are due later this month.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "2016,Abortion,campaign fundraising,Dudley Brown,guns,Michael Bennet,Mitch McConnel,Patrick Neville,Planned Parenthood,Planned Parenthood videos,President Barack Obama,Republican primary,RMGO,Tim Neville,U.S. Senate", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Republican State Sen.
