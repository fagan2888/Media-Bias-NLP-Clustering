The rap trio added a bonus chant for the crowd: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a hand in one hand then clap them mothafuckas!\u201d And during \u201cClint Eastwood,\u201d Del The Funkee Homosapien spit his famous lines with renewed glee, making particular dramatic effect on the beat-dropping whisper \u201cjust remember\u2026that it\u2019s all in your head.\u201d The crowd roared in thunderous excitement at such a grand finale, demanding \u201cone more song!\u201d for a solid five minutes amid simultaneous cheers for \u201cSnoop! Snoop!\u201d \u2013 ultimately to no avail.\n\n\n\nSXSW: News, Reviews, Video | Top Photos From Austin\n\n\n\n\n\nThat Albarn saved such a special showcase for the Fader Fort, after playing previous South By sets for NPR, \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d and WFUV, was no coincidence. Fader\u2019s sister company Cornerstone opened its London office in partnership with Albarn in 2012, and Albarn has also collaborated with Fader Fort Converse on an original song with James Murphy and Andre 3000 as well as a whole suite of Gorillaz-themed apparel.\n\n\n\nThe guest stars were also Albarn\u2019s own cheeky way of addressing the challenge of playing the cerebral, methodically paced material from \u201cEveryday Robots\u201d live. Many of the songs are drily satirical rants against modern technology and social media, including the title track (\u201cwe are everyday robots on our phones\u2026in the process of getting old,\u201d Albarn sings in the opening verse), the plaintive \u201cLonely Press Play\u201d and another almost dirge-like ballad that includes the line \u201cthe photographs are taken now\u2026press send.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe did save additional guest stars for another \u201cEveryday Robots\u201d selection, however \u2013 locals Deric Lewis and the Austin Choir Band, who accompanied Albarn for a performance of the album\u2019s closing track. \u201cI did this song with Brian Eno, but he\u2019s not here so\u2026\u201d Albarn said, gesturing to his church-trained guest stars.\n\n\n\n\u201cEveryday Robots\u201d is due April 29 on Warner Bros.
