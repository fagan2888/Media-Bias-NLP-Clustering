Let me rephrase that. Boobs are a biological wonder among mammals, especially humans. Although only human males tend to develop a sexual fixation for their female counterpart\u2019s breasts, all mammals (from the word \"mammary\") get their nutrition at a young age from their mother\u2019s milk. But where does that milk come from?\n\nSurprisingly, the milk produced by a woman\u2019s breast actually starts in her blood supply. Breast milk is simply the product of proteins, sugars, and fats that are pulled from the mother\u2019s blood. When a baby does start nursing from their mother\u2019s breast, the milk is secreted through a number of tiny, little holes as opposed to one single orifice like many of us thought.\n\nNext let\u2019s talk about something a lot of women worry about, even though they shouldn\u2019t: their left boob being larger than the right. Breast asymmetry is actually pretty common \u2014 50 percent of the female population common. Here\u2019s the thing, scientists aren\u2019t really sure why. They speculate it\u2019s in part due to hormonal changes during puberty. And if that wasn\u2019t confusing enough, the production of estrogen and progesterone throughout the menstrual cycle causes the size of boobs to change from week to week.\n\nI can go on and on about the awesome power of a woman\u2019s boobs, but it's best you just listen to this woman from AsapSCIENCE, who probably knows a lot more about boobs than I do.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "everything, you, need, know, about, womens, breasts, according, science", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Let science explain the power behind a woman\u2019s breasts.", "title": "Boobs: Everything You Ever Needed To Know", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/everything-you-need-know-about-womens-breasts-according-science-364924", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/11/everything-you-need-know-about-womens-breasts-according-science.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Let science explain the power behind a woman\u2019s breasts.", "title": "Boobs: Everything You Ever Needed To Know", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/everything-you-need-know-about-womens-breasts-according-science-364924", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/11/everything-you-need-know-about-womens-breasts-according-science.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/11/everything-you-need-know-about-womens-breasts-according-science.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-12-11T11:27:18-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-11T11:27:17-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Let science explain the power behind a woman\u2019s breasts."}, "article_summary": "Breast milk is simply the product of proteins, sugars, and fats that are pulled from the mother\u2019s blood.\nSurprisingly, the milk produced by a woman\u2019s breast actually starts in her blood supply.\nAlthough only human males tend to develop a sexual fixation for their female counterpart\u2019s breasts, all mammals (from the word \"mammary\") get their nutrition at a young age from their mother\u2019s milk.\nBreast asymmetry is actually pretty common \u2014 50 percent of the female population common.\nI can go on and on about the awesome power of a woman\u2019s boobs, but it's best you just listen to this woman from AsapSCIENCE, who probably knows a lot more about boobs than I do."}
