She was the first female speaker in Utah\u2019s history. During her time in office she worked hard to improve education and transportation infrastructure in the state.\n\nLockhart passed away after a short battle with an incurable and rare neurodegenerative brain disease known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\n\nSenator Curt Bramble has been the family\u2019s spokesman throughout the illness. He was a long time friend of Lockhart and her family.\n\n\u201cI think I will remember her as a very close personal friend, a colleague, and someone who cared passionately for the state of Utah, for the institution of the Legislature, for the institution that we call America,\u201d Bramble says.\n\nHe also says Lockhart was Utah\u2019s Iron Lady. Many other legislators and acquaintances say they also remember her for her strong leadership, such as when she led the House into a costly investigation of then Utah Attorney General John Swallow.\n\n\u201cIt was a high cost, but we cannot put a price on public trust,\" Lockhart said as she received the final House Investigative Committee report. \"One does not cut corners when the very integrity of our justice system is in question.\u201d\n\nLockhart is survived by her husband, Stan, and three children. She was 46.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Former Speaker of the Utah House of Representatives Rebecca Lockhart died Saturday morning from a rare neurodegenerative brain disease.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kuer.org/post/former-speaker-rebecca-lockhart-dies-rare-neurodegenerative-disease", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuer/files/styles/medium/public/201501/Rep_Rebecca_Lockhart%28R%29-01.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Former Speaker of the Utah House of Representatives Rebecca Lockhart died Saturday morning from a rare neurodegenerative brain disease.", "title": "Former Speaker Rebecca Lockhart Dies From Rare Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "story_id": 377998610, "twitter": {"site": "@KUERNews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@briangrimmett"}, "author": "Brian Grimmett", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Former Speaker Rebecca Lockhart Dies From Rare Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "nid": 57306, "datePublished": "2015-01-17", "wordCount": 279, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Former Speaker of the Utah House of Representatives Rebecca Lockhart died Saturday morning from a rare neurodegenerative brain disease.\nLockhart passed away after a short battle with an incurable and rare neurodegenerative brain disease known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\nRebecca Lockhart served 16 years as a member of the Utah House of Representatives, serving the last four as Speaker of the House.\nShe was the first female speaker in Utah\u2019s history.\nHe also says Lockhart was Utah\u2019s Iron Lady."}
