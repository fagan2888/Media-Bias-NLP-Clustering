Sainsbury's meal contains 10 teaspoons of sugar\n\nNew proposed guidelines from the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommend we consume no more than 25g of sugar a day. We found supermarket ready meals that contain over 50g - that's 10 teaspoons.\n\nFollowing on from the new WHO guidelines, we looked at the sugar content in a total of 17 ready meals from major supermarkets Tesco, Asda, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Waitrose.\n\nSainsbury's Sweet and Sour Chicken with Rice contained the most sugar, with around 10 teaspoons per serving - that's almost double the sugar in a standard size Dairy Milk chocolate bar.\n\nA close second was Tesco Everyday Value Sweet and Sour Chicken with Rice, which contains 48.7g of sugar per serving.\n\nIf you're a Which? member you can check out the nutritional content of ready meals to see which popular supermarket meals - ranging from roast beef to chicken tikka masala - are the healthiest for the over 70s.\n\nNot a Which? member?

You'd expect these to be sweet, but you might be surprised at how much sugar they contain. The Sainsbury's meal, for example, contains three teaspoons more than a can of Coca-Cola.\n\nYou can't always tell by a product's name whether it contains a lot of sugar. Tesco Thai Chicken Pad Thai with Rice Noodles sounds like a fairly healthy option, but this meal contains 37.8g of sugar in a single serving.\n\nSainsbury's Sweet and Sour Chicken with Rice - 50.7g\n\nTesco Everyday Value Sweet and Sour Chicken with Rice - 48.4g\n\nWaitrose Sweet and Sour Chicken with Rice - 38.92g\n\nTesco Thai Chicken Pad Thai with Rice Noodles - 37.8g\n\nSainsbury's Crispy Sweet & Sour Chicken with Rice - 37.2g\n\nMarks & Spencer Cantonese Sweet & Sour Chicken with Rice - 33.6g\n\nAsda Sweet and Sour Chicken with Egg Fried Rice - 30.2g\n\nWhich? nutritionist Shefalee Loth said: 'Added sugar is the third or fourth ingredient in all these meals and the main source of sugar, and all contain in excess of the WHO proposed guidelines'.\n\nAll these meals contain added sugar in excess of proposed WHO guidelines. Shefalee Loth,\n\nWhich? food expert and nutritionist\n\nClear targets needed for calorie reduction\n\nThe high sugar content of these meals goes against the ethos of the government's responsibility deal, part of which asked manufacturers to cut calories.\n\nWe want the government to develop clear targets for calorie reduction as a priority. It's also important for manufacturers to cut fat and salt, too.\n\nMore on this...", "article_metadata": {"description": "Which? reveals the ready meals that contain the most sugar, including one that contains as much as two chocolate bars", "sectionName": "News", "og": {"url": "http://www.which.co.uk/news/2014/05/do-you-know-how-much-sugar-youre-eating-366851/", "image": "http://www.staticwhich.co.uk/media/images/in-content/ready-meal-infographic-367423.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Which? reveals the ready meals that contain the most sugar, including one that contains as much as two chocolate bars"}, "contentId": 366851, "robots": "NOODP", "categoryIds": "191885,", "omniturePageName": "home: news: 2014: May: do you know how much sugar you're eating?, 18 May 2014", "fb": {"pages": 141323599261898}, "timestamp": 160524150259, "keywords": "ready meals, tesco, sainsbury's, waitrose, morrisons, marks and spencer, world health organisation, sugar intake, nutrition guidelines, responsiblity deal", "omniturePageType": "news", "categoryId": 213176, "categories": "news,which?-home", "omnitureAccount": "whichdev"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccece\"", "article_summary": "Sainsbury's Sweet and Sour Chicken with Rice - 50.7gTesco Everyday Value Sweet and Sour Chicken with Rice - 48.4gWaitrose Sweet and Sour Chicken with Rice - 38.92gTesco Thai Chicken Pad Thai with Rice Noodles - 37.8gSainsbury's Crispy Sweet & Sour Chicken with Rice - 37.2gMarks & Spencer Cantonese Sweet & Sour Chicken with Rice - 33.6gAsda Sweet and Sour Chicken with Egg Fried Rice - 30.2gWhich?\nThe ready meals with most sugarThe ready meals that contained the most sugar were sweet and sour dishes.\nDo you know how much sugar you're eating?\nA close second was Tesco Everyday Value Sweet and Sour Chicken with Rice, which contains 48.7g of sugar per serving.\nSainsbury's Sweet and Sour Chicken with Rice contained the most sugar, with around 10 teaspoons per serving - that's almost double the sugar in a standard size Dairy Milk chocolate bar."}
