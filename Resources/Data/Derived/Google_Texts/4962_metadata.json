The Rams have gone from a team that hadn\u2019t won in consecutive weeks to being on a three-game roll heading into Saturday\u2019s Mountain West finale at Fresno State.\n\nA victory guarantees a winning record in coach Mike Bobo\u2019s debut season with the Rams. But to him, it\u2019s still a weekly battle.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is I want to be 1-0 this week. That\u2019s it,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we continue to talk about, trying to be 1-0 this week, and when the season is over, you\u2019ll go back and re-evaluate where you are.\u201d\n\nThe Rams (6-5, 4-3 Mountain West) are dinged up. Safeties Trent Matthews and Kevin Pierre-Louis were gimpy after last week\u2019s win, but they\u2019re expected to play against Fresno State. The running backs \u2014 Jasen Oden Jr., Dalyn Dawkins and Izzy Matthews \u2014 have avoided contact in practice the past three weeks, and Oden was limited to just one play last week. Offensive tackle Nick Callender\u2019s availability will be a game-time decision Saturday.\n\nThe injuries haven\u2019t slowed the Rams in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about playing for each other and using momentum,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous thing when you\u2019ve got momentum and it gets going in the right direction. It can also be dangerous if it\u2019s going in the wrong direction, and we were on that line right there.\u201d\n\nFresno State (3-8, 2-5) knows the feeling, having straddled it all season. A proud program that represented the West Division in the first three Mountain West title games is nowhere near that team this season, though many key players are still around.\n\nFresno State will honor its 18 seniors before Saturday\u2019s game against CSU kicks off. Marteze Waller is just 4 yards from becoming the fifth running back in Bulldogs history to rush for 3,000 yards in his career. Also, linebacker Ejiro Ederaine needs only 2\u00bd tackles for lost yardage to become the conference\u2019s career leader in that category.\n\nSenior day can be a powerful motivator, and the Rams know it.\n\n\u201cI feel like they\u2019re going to come out and play hard, especially the seniors,\u201d CSU linebacker Cory James said of the Bulldogs. \u201cWe really have to match that intensity and pay attention to details, and we\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d\n\nFresno State\u2019s season fell apart early, with five consecutive losses after a Week 1 win. Veteran coach Tim DeRuyter has had to play four quarterbacks (two of whom were lost for the season), and the Rams probably will see stints from both Zack Greenlee and Kilton Anderson.\n\nSaturday\u2019s area college games:\n\nNoon UNLV at Wyoming, ROOT\n\n12:30 p.m. Colorado at Utah, PAC-12\n\n7 p.m. Colorado State at Fresno State, CBSSN\n\n8:15 p.m. Air Force at New Mexico, ESPNU", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU football has attention on Fresno State for Mountain West finale", "title": "CSU football has attention on Fresno State for Mountain West finale", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/27/csu-football-has-attention-on-fresno-state-for-mountain-west-finale/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__93e4ac60774d6a34880f6a7067006c68p1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__93e4ac60774d6a34880f6a7067006c68p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-27T18:03:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T04:09:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "Saturday\u2019s area college games:Noon UNLV at Wyoming, ROOT12:30 p.m. Colorado at Utah, PAC-127 p.m. Colorado State at Fresno State, CBSSN8:15 p.m. Air Force at New Mexico, ESPNU\nFresno State will honor its 18 seniors before Saturday\u2019s game against CSU kicks off.\nThe Rams have gone from a team that hadn\u2019t won in consecutive weeks to being on a three-game roll heading into Saturday\u2019s Mountain West finale at Fresno State.\nSafeties Trent Matthews and Kevin Pierre-Louis were gimpy after last week\u2019s win, but they\u2019re expected to play against Fresno State.\nA proud program that represented the West Division in the first three Mountain West title games is nowhere near that team this season, though many key players are still around."}
