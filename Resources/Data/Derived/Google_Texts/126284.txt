Honorees “have implemented cutting edge programs to promote a healthy workplace and assist their employees to live healthier lives,” the council said in a prepared statement. Programs like on-site fitness and walking clubs earned praise in platinum, gold and silver award categories.

“Health is a business issue,” said Tanya Court, the council’s vice president, public policy. “As costs related to health and health care escalate business has responded in a variety of ways. By recognizing the efforts of employers to promote healthy lifestyles, we hope to serve as a catalyst for other employers in both the private and public sector to take action.”

The business council will host a forum March 12 on new rules that implement nondiscriminatory wellness programs under the Affordable Care Act. Its theme is the ACA-mandated report titled the “Workplace Wellness Programs Study.” Topics will include:

• characteristics and prevalence of current workplace wellness programs;

• evidence for program impact;

• incentives;

• facilitators of successful wellness programs;

• what the new rules mean for your employer wellness program; and

• how does your program compare with what others are doing?

Registration is 7:45 a.m.; the program runs 8 to 9:30 a.m. at The Tully Health Center’s Brace Auditorium, 32 Strawberry Hill Court, Stamford. Registration and payment online (BusinessFairfield.com) or pay at the door.
