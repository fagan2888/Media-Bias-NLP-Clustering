De La Fuente was the only presidential hopeful in the state for the democratic caucus. And he brought his campaign \u2013 with its dark horse ambitions \u2013 to Sitka.\n\nSixty-one-year old Rocky De La Fuente is the most determined Democratic candidate you\u2019ve never heard of. The Mexican-American businessman filed his candidacy on October 1st, months after Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. But it was another candidate who sparked his campaign.\n\n\u201cWhen Mr. Trump called everyone every name in the book, I was expecting to have a world wide contra reaction,\u201d De La Fuente said. \u201cI was expecting the President of the U.S., the president of Argentina, there wasn\u2019t one person who said A, B, or C. So the question is I said, somebody has to stand to that man.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s affront on the Latin-American community inspired De La Fuente. But the two men are similar in a few ways: both are wealthy businessmen with no political experience who want to shake up the establishment and appeal to working-class Americans. But De La Fuente\u2019s base is very different: immigrants, the homeless, and people of color. He was caucusing in Arizona and met a young girl named Renata, who started crying.\n\n\u201cShe says, I won\u2019t be able to see my grandfather. Why not? Somebody\u2019s building a wall,\u201d said De La Fuente.\n\nImmigration reform is at the top of his priority list.\n\n\u201cWe have 11 million people in this country that do not have their papers,\u201d De La Fuente said. \u201cI consider those 11 million people assets. I don\u2019t consider them liabilities. They\u2019re here. I didn\u2019t bring them here. But if we\u2019re going to grow this country and we\u2019re going to generate 34 million jobs, I need those 11 million here. I need them working. I need them legal. And I need them to pay taxes.\u201d\n\nDe La Fuente is pro-gun and supports the Affordable Care Act, but thinks it needs to be change. He endorses gay marriage and abortion, but thinks states should have the right to choose. He\u2019s an unusual blend of stances. And he thinks it\u2019s enough for him to be an alternative to front runner Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cThe lady thinks she\u2019s queen,\u201d said De La Fuente. \u201cThis is a democracy. This is not a dynasty. Do we have to elect the wife of a president?\u201d\n\nDe La Fuente has picked up zero delegates, but as far as fringe candidates go, he\u2019s doing okay. He appeared on more state ballots than former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley, who withdrew after a poor showing in Iowa.\n\nTo his disappointment, though, he did not appear on the ballot in Washington this weekend.\n\n\u201cEven though I qualified for 44 states, in Seattle they put me as other,\u201d De La Fuente said. \u201cSo the Democratic Party has said Washington, you cannot vote for this man because he doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nSo, he came to Alaska which he\u2019s visited numerous times on cruise ships \u2013 he even owned a 165-foot catcher-processor out of Dutch Harbor at one point \u2013 and took part in the District 35 caucus. For a state this large in size, there are few delegates up for grabs \u2013 just 20. De La Fuente would have needed at least 15% of the room to pick up any. He netted 11 votes, making him not viable. But he seemed undeterred. I asked De La Fuente why he keeps with it, given the odds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 56 kilometer race,\u201d said De La Fuente. \u201cSo you cannot judge a race just because somebody is leading the first 10 kilometers or the first 20 kilometers. The question is, \u201cWho is going to cross that finish line?\u201d\n\nDe La Fuente\u2019s campaign \u2013 which is entirely grassroots \u2013 even developed a game called \u201cRocky Run.\u201d Available on iPhone and Android, De La Fuente is a horse you can pit against horses \u201cHillary Pigton\u201d and \u201cDon Bulltromp.\u201d With the brush of a finger, you can jump over obstacles.\n\nAnd his eyes light up when he mentions that the Democratic National Convention will be in Philadelphia. Because as you may have noticed, he shares a name with another underdog, Rocky Balboa.\n\n\u201cAll my life, I\u2019ve been an underdog,\u201d De La Fuente said. \u201cAll my life, I\u2019m a minority. We have two type of people: we have the hard-working people that work and we have the government that\u2019s trying to do everything they can to stop us. Imagine if we can all be working with the same objective. And let\u2019s make America ten times greater than what it is today.\u201d\n\nAnd in his pursuit of greatness, De La Fuente has his eyes on the June 7th primary in California, where he does business in 45 cities. \u201cAt least,\u201d he says, \u201cMy employees can vote for me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "description": "While Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton marshaled support in Washington this weekend, a lesser known candidate - Rocky De La Fuente came to Alaska.
