The press briefings include Ukrainian military casualty reports and information about the ongoing flow of Russian weapons and troops into separatist territories.\n\nOn April 2, the Ukrainian military reported another Russian shipment of war materiel to the twin separatist republics, including 15 tanks and seven trucks with ammunition.\n\nThe report could not be independently confirmed, and Russia continues to deny arming Ukrainian separatists or sending Russian military personnel to participate in the conflict.\n\nCease-Fire Violations\n\nThe Ukrainian military is not the only group trumpeting warnings about a potential spike in the war.\n\nFor weeks, international monitors have reported a slight increase in cease-fire violations around the separatist stronghold of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, as well as sporadic fighting along the length of the 200-mile-long front lines in Ukraine\u2019s southeastern Donbas region, which borders Russia.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is headquartered in Vienna, is the multinational group responsible for monitoring the Ukraine cease-fire.\n\nTeams of OSCE monitors in telltale blue and white body armor and helmets plod along the potholed roads in Donbas in white SUVs. Their mission is to monitor the battlefield for cease-fire violations\u2014which include artillery shots, tank shots, rocket attacks, and small arms fire.\n\nThe OSCE also inventories heavy weapons on both sides of the conflict. According to the terms of the February 2015 cease-fire, weapons of 100 mm caliber and higher are supposed to be stored in locations at prescribed minimum distances from the contact line.\n\nThe work of the OSCE monitoring teams is difficult, often placing them in harm\u2019s way. Monitors frequently say they are turned back at separatist checkpoints, denying them access to key spots on the battlefield.\n\nSome in Kyiv claim that the presence of Russians on the OSCE monitoring teams compromises the objectivity of the group\u2019s reports\u2014a charge the organization denies.\n\nDespite the challenges, the teams produce reports almost daily on the Ukraine cease-fire. And according to the group\u2019s most recent reports, the daily tally of violations is increasing.\n\nIn a March 30 interview with Radio Free Europe, Alexander Hug, the OSCE\u2019s deputy chief of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, said: \u201cWe have seen in the past days and weeks a high number of cease-fire violations, namely in the Donetsk region.\u201d\n\nReflecting Kyiv\u2019s long-term assessment about the cease-fire\u2019s chances of holding, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko announced on March 22 a seventh mobilization wave to draft another 10,000 soldiers.\n\nThe Ukrainian military currently comprises about 250,000 active duty personnel; Russia\u2019s military fields about 800,000 active troops.\n\nPax Americana\n\nRussia\u2019s involvement in the Ukraine war has Eastern Europe and the U.S. taking the threat seriously.\n\nFor the past several years, Russia also has shown a pattern of testing NATO\u2019s defenses in Eastern Europe while building up its military presence in the region in places like the Kaliningrad enclave and the recently annexed Crimean peninsula.\n\nNATO declared last year that any hybrid warfare provocation on a NATO state would prompt the invocation of Article V, the alliance\u2019s collective defense protocol, underscoring a pathway to a major war in Europe should Russia overreach militarily.\n\n\u201cIf NATO sees foreign forces infiltrating its sovereign territory, and if we can prove it comes from an aggressor nation\u2014then that\u2019s Article V,\u201d U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO\u2019s supreme allied commander, said in an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt in August 2014.\n\nThe White House\u2019s 2017 defense budget suggests a partial military pivot back to Europe, which would reverse the post-Cold War U.S. drawdown on the Continent and highlight how seriously the Russian threat is perceived to be.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s budget request for 2017 includes $335 million in nonlethal military aid for Ukraine. Congress also appropriated $75 million as part of a combined State Department and Defense Department fund to train Ukrainian forces.\n\n\u2018Balanced Approach\u2019\n\nThe White House\u2019s budget also quadruples funding for the European Reassurance Initiative from $789 million to more than $3.4 billion.\n\nThe White House first announced the European Reassurance Initiative in 2014, the year Russia illegally annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula and launched military operations in eastern Ukraine.\n\nTotaling $1 billion in 2014, the initiative was meant to be a one-year emergency reinforcement of U.S. military forces in Europe.\n\nAn April 5 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a U.S. think tank, said the White House\u2019s 2017 budget increase for the European Reassurance Initiative \u201cindicates the administration\u2019s acknowledgement of the growing threat Russia poses to long-term U.S. national security interests in Europe and beyond.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Defense Department, the money will be used to pre-position U.S. military forces and military hardware across Europe, increase the number of U.S. troops stationed in Europe, and increase training and joint military exercises with European allies.\n\nDescribing the Pentagon\u2019s budget at a Feb. 2 event in Washington, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said: \u201cWe\u2019re taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression, and we haven\u2019t had to worry about this for 25 years. While I wish it were otherwise, now we do.\u201d\n\nSoft Power\n\nDespite the pledged increase in U.S. military spending to defend Europe, Obama\u2019s remarks in the April issue of The Atlantic spurred doubts among some in Ukraine about U.S. resolve to deter Russian aggression.\n\nThe article quoted Obama as saying: \u201cThe fact is that Ukraine, which is a non-NATO country, is going to be vulnerable to military domination by Russia no matter what we do.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier interview with The Daily Signal, Samus, the Ukrainian think tank official, said Obama\u2019s foreign policy stance incentivizes Russian aggression.\n\n\u201cPutin is trying to destroy Ukraine internally in this last year before the new American president comes to power,\u201d Samus said, reflecting a common opinion among Ukrainian military and political analysts.
