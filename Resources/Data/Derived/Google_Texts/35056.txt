BAYLOR 87, WESTERN KY. 74 In Waco, the freshman Nina Davis had 32 points and 10 rebounds in her N.C.A.A. tournament debut, and Odyssey Sims scored 31 points for Baylor (30-4) with Coach Kim Mulkey watching the game from her house while serving a one-game N.C.A.A. suspension for criticizing the officiating in last season’s tournament loss to Louisville. Western Kentucky (24-9) led only once, but that was for less than 30 seconds in the first half before Davis and Sims combined for all the Baylor points in a 14-4 run. The only Baylor player with a 30-point game in the tournament had been Brittney Griner, who had five of them.

OKLAHOMA STATE 61, F.G.C.U. 60 Tiffany Bias’s driving layup with 41 seconds remaining in overtime lifted No. 5 seed Oklahoma State (24-8) over No. 12 seed Florida Gulf Coast (26-8) in West Lafayette, Ind.

Florida Gulf Coast missed a shot with that would have given the Eagles the lead. Oklahoma State was fouled with three seconds left, but Liz Donohoe missed the free throw. Florida Gulf Coast had a chance, but Brittney Martin stole the inbounds pass with a second left. She, too, was fouled and missed her free throw, giving the Eagles one final chance, but they could not get a shot off.

Syracuse hit 24 of 31 free throws to seal the victory, which snapped Chattanooga’s 25-game winning streak.
