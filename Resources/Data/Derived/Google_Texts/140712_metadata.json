Also, lords and ladies upholding Victorian and Edwardian standards in a certain Yorkshire abbey.\n\n\u201cCommunity,\u201d Jan. 2, NBC. The meta-humor is intact. Judging by the first three episodes of the 13 this season, the series under Dan Harmon is as quirky as ever. Great to see Jonathan Banks as criminology professor Buzz Hickey, a tough-guy of a different order than his \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d character.\n\n\u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d Jan. 5, PBS. I\u2019ve seen the first five episodes of season four, and it\u2019s great to be back at the Abbey. The difficult end of season three (awkward due to an actor\u2019s decision rather than good writing) sets the tone at first, but soon new characters, problems and even job possibilities arise.\n\n\u201cJustified,\u201d Jan. 7 FX. Marshal Raylan Givens is back (in the form of Timothy Olyphant) in the series inspired by Elmore Leonard\u2019s stories. Arriane Alexander joins the cast as a guard at the Harlan County jail.\n\n\u201cChicago P.D.,\u201d Jan. 8 NBC. Dick Wolf\u2019s latest features the uniformed cops versus the undercover detectives. Jason Beghe, Jon Seda, Elias Koteas and more.\n\n\u201cEpisodes,\u201d Jan. 12, Showtime. The crazy-charming Matt Le-Blanc sitcom returns with transplanted British TV comedy writers Tamsin Grieg and Stephen Mangan finding ever more to mock \u2014 about Hollywood, TV networks and modern love. Big changes at the network will mean new challenges for Pucks!, the show they\u2019re trying to write. This is my go-to personal relaxation, mood lift comedy.\n\n\u201cTrue Detective,\u201d Jan. 12, HBO. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson in a creepy crime drama with psychological complications. The eight episodes skip back and forth in time among events in 1995, 2002 and 2012, all recounting a bizarre murder investigation and its effects on their lives. Judging by the compelling first two hours, sharp dialog and great acting will make this a DVR must.\n\n\u201cLooking,\u201d Jan. 19, HBO. a modern gay San Francisco tale, sort of a West Coast mix of \u201cGirls\u201d and \u201cSex and the City,\u201d with Jonathan Groff (\u201cGlee\u201d) and friends looking for love while approaching the end of youth. An update on \u201cQueer as Folk\u201d with a videogame programmer (Groff) adding a modern touch to the crises of love and sex. The first couple of episodes suggest it\u2019s less fun than that forerunner.\n\n\u201cSherlock,\u201d PBS, Jan. 19. How will the cliffhanger resolve? Benedict Cumberbach and Martin Freeman return as Holmes and Watson in three new 90-minute episodes, \u201cThe Empty Hearse,\u201d \u201cThe Sign of the Three\u201d (Jan. 26) and \u201cHis Last Vow\u201d (Feb. 2). The contemporary spin on the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle classic is created by Steven Moffat (\u201cDoctor Who\u201d) and Mark Gatiss.\n\n\u201cKlondike,\u201d Jan. 20, Discovery. The network\u2019s first scripted miniseries, a break from the reality TV fare of \u201cGold Rush,\u201d yet still centered on the quest for Yukon gold. Period drama set in a small frontier town features Richard Madden, Abbie Cornish, Tim Roth and Sam Shepard. \u201cYou either leave with the gold or with your soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican Masters: Salinger,\u201d PBS, Jan. 21. A documentary about the famously reclusive author J.D. Salinger. His childhood, his marriages, how he made his way to \u201cCatcher in the Rye\u201d and secrets he left behind.\n\n\u201cBlack Sails,\u201d Jan. 25, Starz. A pirate series from Michael Bay, with cable-ready sex, violence, crude language, wily wenches and intrigue. Intended as a prequel to Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s novel Treasure Island. Toby Stephens (\u201cDie Another Day\u201d and Maggie Smith\u2019s son) is killer as evil Captain Flint. A second season has already been ordered.\n\n\u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d Feb. 14, Netflix. Now things get nasty. The second season of the Emmy-winning, online-only political thriller starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright kicks off with all 13 episodes available at once. (It will also be in extra high-def, not that anybody owns a set equipped to watch that way.) \u201cThe butchery begins,\u201d Frank Underwood (Spacey) intones at the end of the season 2 trailer.\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ostrowdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Winter TV preview: \u201cDownton,\u201d \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and more", "title": "Winter TV preview: \u201cDownton,\u201d \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and more", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/26/winter-tv-preview-downton-true-detective-house-of-cards-and-more/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131226__20131229_E1_AE29TVWINTERTELEVISIONp2.jpg", "height": 452}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131226__20131229_E1_AE29TVWINTERTELEVISIONp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-26T17:06:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T08:50:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cEpisodes,\u201d Jan. 12, Showtime.\n\u201cSherlock,\u201d PBS, Jan. 19.\n\u201cYou either leave with the gold or with your soul.\u201d\u201cAmerican Masters: Salinger,\u201d PBS, Jan. 21.\nJudging by the first three episodes of the 13 this season, the series under Dan Harmon is as quirky as ever.\nI\u2019ve seen the first five episodes of season four, and it\u2019s great to be back at the Abbey."}
