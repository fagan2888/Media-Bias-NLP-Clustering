Egypt\u2019s deposed leader Hosni Mubarak and his two sons were sentenced Saturday to three years in prison and a fine in a retrial on corruption charges they faced earlier. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether it will include time he\u2019s already served since his country\u2019s 2011 revolt.\n\nCAIRO \u2014 A Cairo court sentenced Egypt\u2019s deposed autocrat Hosni Mubarak and his two sons to three years in prison on corruption charges on Saturday \u2014 a punishment that authorities may deem as having already been served but one which, if it withstands appeal, would officially establish Mubark as a convicted criminal years after the 2011 popular uprising that toppled him.\n\nThe case \u2014 dubbed the \u201cpresidential palaces\u201d affair by the Egyptian media \u2014 was a retrial charging that Mubarak and sons embezzled millions of dollars\u2019 worth of state funds over the course of a decade, diverting money meant to pay for renovating and maintaining presidential palaces to instead upgrade their private residences.\n\nMubarak had originally been sentenced to three years over the matter, and his sons to four, but they later appealed, sparking the retrial. As Egypt\u2019s political tides shifted in the wake of his overthrow, he had been convicted of bearing responsibility for the deaths of protesters but was later acquitted, although that ruling now faces an appeal by prosecutors.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nInside the courtroom at a sprawling, locked-down police academy on the outskirts of Cairo, a dozen Mubarak supporters shouted in anger as Judge Hassan Hassanin announced his verdict, standing up on benches and pumping their fists into the air. The three defendants stood in a courtroom cage soundproofed with a glass enclosure.\n\n\u201cWe believe in you! We trust Mubarak!\u201d supporters yelled, as some women began crying. Others wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the former leader\u2019s face waved and blew kisses when the 87-year-old entered the courtroom. A seated, suited Mubarak, wearing sunglasses and flanked by sons Gamal and Alaa, had no visible reaction to the verdict, which their lawyers say can be appealed.\n\nThe sentencing included a 125 million Egyptian pound ($16.3 million) fine to be paid among the three men, as well as the return of 21 million Egyptian pounds ($2.7 million) they embezzled. After the hearing, judicial and security officials said those amounts had already been paid by the Mubaraks following their first trial.\n\nMubarak returned to the military hospital in Cairo where he\u2019s been held amid his trials. Officials said his two sons were taken to Torah Prison as authorities determine whether their time served in detention would cover for the sentences Saturday. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to journalists.\n\nMany Egyptians view Gamal, Mubarak\u2019s one-time heir apparent, and his brother Alaa, a wealthy businessman, as key symbols of an autocratic and corrupt administration that struck an alliance with the mega-wealthy at the expense of the poor. Although father and son repeatedly denied any plans to have Gamal ascend to the presidency, that perception, along with endemic corruption, police brutality and poverty, fueled the 2011 revolt.\n\nImages of Gamal making public appearances have circulated on social media, first at a funeral last month and then last weekend with his family at the Giza pyramids. Amid the turmoil that followed the revolution, nostalgia over the relative stability of the Mubarak-era has been growing in Egypt.\n\nThe rise of Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who has vowed stability after four years of unrest and taken a tough line against dissent, has encouraged Mubarak supporters and upended the public perception and media depiction of the 2011 uprising. Political activists of all stripes are now most often cast as troublemakers or foreign agents, and hundreds of the young activists who sparked the 2011 revolt are now either languishing in prison on charges of breaking a harsh new protest law or have left the country.\n\nIslamist President Mohammed Morsi, Mubarak\u2019s elected successor, was himself overthrown by the military, led by el-Sissi, in 2013 after mass protests against his divisive rule. Saturday\u2019s hearing, a session of the Cairo Criminal Court held at the academy, took place in the same courtroom where Morsi was sentenced to 20 years in prison last month for using force against protesters.\n\nProsecutors last week filed an appeal against Mubarak\u2019s acquittal in the case involving the killing of protesters. An appeals court will decide on June 4 on whether to order a retrial.\n\nAfter Saturday\u2019s session, Mubarak supporter Mohamed Saadawi, whose group organizes demonstrations praising him under the banner \u201cWe are sorry, Mr. President,\u201d denounced the verdict and accused el-Sissi of interference with the judiciary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s politics and it\u2019s very sad. I keep telling Egyptians that el-Sissi hates Mubarak,\u201d he said outside the courthouse. \u201cMubarak for me is a hero.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cairo court sentenced Egypt's deposed autocrat Hosni Mubarak and his two sons to three years in prison on corruption charges on Saturday", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "AP", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Cairo court sentenced Egypt's deposed autocrat Hosni Mubarak and his two sons to three years in prison on corruption charges on Saturday", "title": "Court Sentences Egypt's Mubarak, Sons To 3 Years In Prison", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/court-sentences-egypts-mubarak-sons-to-3-years-in-prison/205476/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mideast-Egypt-Mubarak_Muha1.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cairo court sentenced Egypt's deposed autocrat Hosni Mubarak and his two sons to three years in prison on corruption charges on Saturday", "title": "Court Sentences Egypt's Mubarak, Sons To 3 Years In Prison", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mideast-Egypt-Mubarak_Muha1.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Prison", "published_time": "2015-05-09T13:34:46-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Court Sentences Egypt\u2019s Mubarak, Sons To 3 Years In PrisonThe sentencing included a 125 million Egyptian pound ($16.3 million) fine to be paid among the three men, as well as the return of 21 million Egyptian pounds ($2.7 million) they embezzled.\nThe sentencing included a 125 million Egyptian pound ($16.3 million) fine to be paid among the three men, as well as the return of 21 million Egyptian pounds ($2.7 million) they embezzled.\nEgypt\u2019s deposed leader Hosni Mubarak and his two sons were sentenced Saturday to three years in prison and a fine in a retrial on corruption charges they faced earlier.\nA seated, suited Mubarak, wearing sunglasses and flanked by sons Gamal and Alaa, had no visible reaction to the verdict, which their lawyers say can be appealed.\nOfficials said his two sons were taken to Torah Prison as authorities determine whether their time served in detention would cover for the sentences Saturday."}
