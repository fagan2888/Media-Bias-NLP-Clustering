JERSEY CITY, N.J. — There was playing for John Fox as he recovered from open-heart surgery in November.

And there’s winning one for Fox’s financial security. The Broncos head coach has an incentive in his contract that pays him a $1 million bonus for winning the Super Bowl.

Fox’s Broncos play in the Super Bowl today against the Seattle Seahawks.

Such incentives, which was first reported today by ESPN, are common in coaches’ contracts. Fox initially signed a four-year contract worth about $12 million when the Broncos hired him to replace Josh McDaniels after the 2010 season.

Win or lose the Super Bowl, Fox is expected to receive a contract extension. Next season will be the final year of his contract. Fox will turn 59 on Saturday but he says he feels better and has more energy than he did in the sixth months prior to his heart surgery on Nov. 4.

The expectation is Fox would have the final year of his existing contract torn up and he would sign a new three-year or four-year deal with the Broncos.
