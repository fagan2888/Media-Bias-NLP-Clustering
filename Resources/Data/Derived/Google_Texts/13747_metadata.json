Studies between 2005 and 2013 showed that medical debts are the single largest contributor to personal bankruptcy filings in the U.S. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, half of all overdue debt on credit reports is from medical debt; one in five credit reports contains overdue medical debt; and 15 million consumers have only medical debt on their credit reports.\n\nSarah O\u2019Leary, CEO of Exhale Healthcare Advocates, said there are protections in place to help consumers with their medical debt, and knowing what those protections are is key to properly handling the bills.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, know what your state\u2019s medical debt collection laws are,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cMany limit how collection agencies can approach you and what steps they can legally take. If the collector is threatening you, there are steps that can be taken to stop it.\u201d\n\nFree Credit Consultation - Call 844-346-3296 Repairing Your Credit With Lexington Law Can Help You Save Money Get Help Now\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nDealing With a Medical Debt\n\nIn most states, doctors and other healthcare providers are allowed to contact you about a debt, as are collection agencies. But you have the right to challenge the debt and can tell the providers and collection agents to stop contacting you, O\u2019Leary said.\n\n\u201cSince experts estimate 50% or more of all medical bills contain errors, it is prudent to challenge the bills with your healthcare provider,\u201d she said.\n\nAsk for an itemization of the bill, and request an internal audit. You can also visit free websites like healthcarebluebook.com, to see what a fair price for medical services should be based upon your ZIP code.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s key to realize that healthcare provider pricing is arbitrary,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cAn MRI on one side of Main Street may cost $3,000, and $300 a block away. Seeing what something should cost and pushing back on the healthcare provider can help you avoid paying $500 for the 50-cent Band-Aid.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Leary suggested patients also appeal any denial of claim by their insurer. \u201cMost patients can get the claim denial overturned after one appeal,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that you know the parameters of your policy and are willing to do the work necessary to challenge the debt.\u201d\n\nMedical debts are consumer debts that are covered by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and third-party debt collectors collecting medical debts fall within the protections of the FDCPA as long as the medical debt is in default, according to April Kuehnhoff, a staff attorney with the National Consumer Law Center.\n\n\u201cIt can be complicated to determine when a medical debt in default,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cEspecially when it can take months for insurance to determine what portion of the medical bill it will cover.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the FDCPA, according to Kuehnhoff, does not apply to collection by creditors collecting their own debt using their own name, for example a hospital\u2019s internal billing department collecting in the hospital\u2019s name.\n\nOther federal laws also may apply to medical debt collection, Kuehnhoff said, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Affordable Care Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Telephone Consumer Protection Act and numerous others. There are also relevant state laws that impact medical debt collection, so it is probably best to seek professional assistance if you feel there are errors and/or questionable collection actions taking place.\n\nHow to Pay Down Legitimate Medical Debt\n\nPatient protections are outlined on the CFPB\u2019s website. But the best way to get rid of medical debt, O\u2019Leary said, is to never accrue it in the first place. To do that, she recommends understanding your coverage fully.\n\n\u201cThe best step is to ask for upfront pricing and negotiate that cost prior to receiving any non-emergency test or procedure,\u201d she said. \u201cMake sure everyone who touches your case is in your network, and that you have all necessary pre-authorizations from your insurance company.\u201d\n\nFor those who end up in medical debt as a result of an unexpected accident or illness, O\u2019Leary offered the following tips.\n\nNever pay your medical bills before you know how much your insurance company is going to cover. Only pay the amount you owe based on the insurance coverage you have. If a healthcare provider tries to charge the insurer $300 for a Band-Aid and the insurer only pays $5, the healthcare provider might try to charge you the remaining amount of $295. This is called \u201cbalance billing\u201d and is illegal in some states. If you receive this type of bill, report it to your insurance company and contact the healthcare provider in writing (preferably by certified mail) informing them that you do not owe the amount they\u2019ve indicated. Contact the healthcare provider immediately if you receive bills that you legitimately owe (i.e., your policy does not cover, the itemized bill is correct and the service is competitively priced) but cannot pay in full. You can almost always work out a monthly payment plan that meets your financial limitations with your healthcare provider.\n\nAnd never deal with a collection agency directly if you can help it, O\u2019Leary said.\n\n\u201cInstead, approach the healthcare provider. They are often much more flexible in terms of lowering the debt and payment options,\u201d she said. That won\u2019t be possible for debts that have been purchased by a collection agency, but if the collection agency is working for the medical provider, you can still go directly to the provider.\n\nEven after the debts are sold, the medical provider may have ongoing obligations to the patient, Kuehnhoff said. For example, providing billing details or medical records.\n\n\u201cNonprofit hospitals also have ongoing obligations to provide information about financial assistance policies and are obligated to accept applications for financial assistance for 240 days after the patient\u2019s first billing statement is sent post-discharge from the hospital,\u201d Kuehnhoff said.\n\n\u201cFor those who are unable to pay the debt at all, there are governmental service agencies that may be able to help,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.\n\nHow Medical Debt Affects Your Credit\n\nA medical debt can appear on your credit report and hurt your credit score, but the credit scoring industry has taken some steps to make sure these bills don\u2019t unduly penalize a person\u2019s credit.\n\nFICO announced several months ago that medical bills that were paid off would no longer affect FICO 9, the latest version of its credit score. VantageScore 3 also ignores paid collection accounts of all types. And the three major credit reporting agencies, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, announced in early 2015 that they were going to change the way they investigated medical debt and would wait 180 days before adding the debt to consumers\u2019 credit reports.\n\n\u201cMedical debt is viewed differently than other forms of debt because it\u2019s often not a true reflection of your credit worthiness,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cIf you\u2019re socked with $180,000 in debt from a heart operation and the insurance company is slow to pay the healthcare provider, it could hurt your credit rating unjustly. If a collections agency or healthcare provider \u2018parked\u2019 the debt on your account while they were waiting for the insurance company to pay it, that would also be immediately removed once the insurance company pays the debt.\u201d\n\nStill, many lenders still use older versions of credit scores that do not give medical collections any special treatment. So, if you have outstanding medical bills, or even if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s a good idea to review your free annual credit reports for accuracy and dispute any errors you find.
