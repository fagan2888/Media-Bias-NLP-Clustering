More coverage tomorrow! mallen@politico.com\n\nAL HUNT interviews White House counselor JOHN PODESTA: \u201cWhen I asked him about [possibly chairing Hillary\u2019s campaign] in an interview for ... \u2018Charlie Rose\u2019 ... he replied: \u2018If she runs, as I hope she will, I will do whatever she asks me to do.\u2019 ... Asked if he has spoken with Clinton about his role in a campaign, he replied, \u2018I talk to her from time to time.\u2019 There may be no one in Democratic circles who commands more respect than Podesta. His standing is similar that of James Baker.\u201d http://bv.ms/1zpFMQA\n\n--\u201cBiden: Middle Class \u2018Was Declining\u2019 During Clinton Years\u201d -- Washington Free Beacon Staff: \u201cSpeaking before the American Federation of Teachers, Biden [said:] \u2018The fact is, the middle class started to get into trouble in the late \u201980s ... All through the \u201990s, with the exception of two years, the middle class was declining.\u201d http://bit.ly/1sOdo66\n\nTHE BIG IDEA -- JOHN HARRIS, \u201cThe Dark Art of Political B.S.\u201d -- the perils of long-range forecasting: \u201cDecades ago branches of journalism and political science developed that tended to view politics through the metaphors of geology. There were long-term factors of class and partisan identity that were like tectonic plates. Every generation or so, an earthquake would come along ... and a new set of political assumptions would shape the next couple decades. I suspect ... that the fluid nature of modern life\u2014the constancy of communication, more geographic and career mobility, weaker attachments to traditional institutions\u2014means that politics simply moves faster. We should be studying it not as geography but as something more like meteorology. ...\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s true that Republicans face huge problems if they don\u2019t improve their appeal among Hispanics and young people. But there is no reason to suppose the GOP will stand still, any more than Bill Clinton\u2019s Democratic Party stood still in the 1990s when his party faced problems with voters who thought Democrats were too soft on crime and foreign policy. Republicans like New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez challenge the notion that the GOP can\u2019t compete among women and Hispanics, just as Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is hoping to challenge the notion that the party can\u2019t improve its appeal to young voters.\u201d http://politi.co/14pzl6o\n\nTHE JUICE \u2013 New NRSC, DSCC executive directors:\n\n--WARD BAKER at NRSC, per James Hohmann: \u201cBaker is currently political director ...

I had been painting an ocean scene and was wearing cargo pants stained with oil paint. For a few peaceful minutes, we stared quietly at the sea. \u2018What are you thinking about, Dad?\u2019 I asked. \u2018It\u2019s just beautiful,\u2019 he said, still looking out at the ocean. ... \u2018Do those pants come in clean?\u2019 I laughed, something I have been doing with my father all my life.

Rather, it is a kind of suffering by a thousand cuts, each individually unnoticeable but collectively defeating. On the \u2018new\u2019 United, seats got smaller as the airline jammed more people into the same tube; upgrades, to escape the sardine effect, seemed to become harder to book. The number of boarding groups began to resemble something like a caste system; \u2018change fees,\u2019 which have always been outrageous, grew higher ... while baggage fees soared to as high as a hundred dollars.

This week, the RAND Corporation issued a report detailing the success and lessons of the coalition in increasing veteran employment opportunities. In a little more than 3 years, the coalition has grown to include over 175 companies and has hired over 190,000 U.S. military veterans into careers that span nearly every industry in the American economy. JPMorgan Chase is proud to be a part of the 100,000 Jobs Mission and remains committed to supporting servicemember reintegration into civilian life.
