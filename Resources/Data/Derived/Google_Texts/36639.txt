December 14, 2013 North Myrtle Beach, SC – Congressman Tom Rice, our representative from the newly created SC 7th District has introduced a resolution that would allow Congress to bring civil action against President Obama for not following the Constitution’s mandate that the President faithfully execute laws.



As of Friday, 30 house members have joined in sponsoring the resolution.



Rice wrote in a letter to fellow House members, "President Obama has adopted a practice of picking and choosing which laws he wants to enforce. In most cases, his laws of choice conveniently coincide with his Administration’s political agenda. Our Founding Fathers created the Executive Branch to implement and enforce the laws written by Congress and vested this power in the President. However, President Obama has chosen to ignore some of the laws written by Congress and implemented by preceding Presidents."



In his letter to fellow members, Rice enumerated the complaints as:



1.President Obama recently announced an “administrative fix” in regard to cancelled healthcare plans due to Obamacare. Of course he plans to provide a “fix” which will substantially alter his signature legislation without involving Congress.



2. Over the summer, President Obama’s Administration announced a one-year delay in Obamacare’s employer mandate without involving Congress.



3. Last year, President Obama’s Administration granted temporary status to illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children without involving Congress.
