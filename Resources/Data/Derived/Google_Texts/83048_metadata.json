Her parents\u2019 insurance plan has always covered her care, soaring to at least $100,000 per year in medical expenses.\n\nWith the new rules and surrounding confusion, that coverage hangs in the balance.\n\n\u201cI was in my daughter\u2019s hospital room when I was on the phone with the insurance company and they told me our plan would be terminated,\u201d Benthal said. Johanna was recovering from her latest brain surgery, a stay Benthal expects to cost around $30,000. Benthal started crying.\n\nShe and her husband have had a plan they purchase as a sole proprietorship, she being a freelance writer and he a marketer. Under one of the act\u2019s provisions, according to their provider, Oxford, they are no longer eligible for the plan.\n\nTheir only feasible option appears to be entry into the New York State Health Exchange, which Benthal\u2019s insurance agent said would cut Johanna\u2019s access to her current hospital in NYC and the other premium hospitals in the region, most of which do not participate in the plans available on the exchange. If they were to purchase another plan from Oxford for Johanna, it would be as an individual and would include a $6,000 deductible with copays. Their current plan has a $4,000 deductible without copays.\n\nThe shift also leaves the family\u2019s Medicaid assistance in the lurch, Benthal said. They had received reimbursements for their premiums, but the future of that arrangement is uncertain.\n\n\u201cAll these offices are in chaos and no one knows anything,\u201d she said of Medicaid and other agencies she\u2019s dealt with. \u201cWe had a relationship with New York State that worked. With our medically fragile child we can\u2019t afford to be without health insurance for a single day.\u201d\n\nBenthal said she is confident she will \u201cfigure something out,\u201d but says she fears the federal government will be less efficient at delivering the level of care she was used to receiving for her daughter. She feels the act lacks in practicability, having more to do with control of healthcare than its improvement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Family of Daughter Requiring 86 Brain Tumor Surgeries Loses Insurance Under Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Eileen Benthal isn't sure what to do.
