Frank Pallone (D-6), the Monmouth County Democrat.\n\n\u201cSomething must be happening today,\u201d acknowledged Menendez, New Jersey\u2019s senior senator. \u201cYou don\u2019t get us all in the room at the same time \u2013 unless it\u2019s a fundraiser.\u201d\n\nLaughs ensued.\n\nFor years, Pallone would amiably turn up in the carpeted corridors of Essex County and do little more than feed the political back story of how he scented a U.S. Senate seat. But today, as the powerfully effective ranking member of the House Subcommittee on Health, he could legitimately do a victory lap for having secured funding for the new health center.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to be opening our doors to provide much needed primary care to the residents of Newark and our surrounding neighbors,\u201d said Nicole Fields, president and CEO of Saint James Health. \u201cSaint James Health was founded in 2014 to fill the gap in primary care left by the closure of Saint James Hospital, to improve health outcomes and to guarantee access to culturally competent care, specifically in the East Ward.\u201d\n\nIn response to the praise from his Essex colleagues, Pallone credited the tag team of U.S. Rep. Donald Payne, Jr. (D-10) and U.S. Rep. Albio Sires (D-8).\n\nLeaned on aggressively locally by At-Large Councilman Luis Quintana, East Ward Councilman Augusto Amador, North Ward Councilman Anibal Ramos, Sires and Payne put the screws to Pallone on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. Pallone noted how Payne stands in the front of the House Chamber and Sires in the back. The two would put him in a sandwich, he said, and not let up until they got assurances that he was moving on the requisite applications to secure the hospital center funding.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t overstate how hard they worked,\u201d the Monmouth congressman said. The senator splayed a big role, too, their colleagues noted. Pallone, in fact, gave a special nod to Menendez; and \u201cCory was out traveling all over the place, but we got him,\u201d said Quintana.\n\n\u201cCommunities like Newark face incredible barriers to adequate health care, such as transportation, language, and inadequate access to information,\u201d said the junior senator, referring to a city wherein 45% of the population lacks health insurance. \u201cThis new federally qualified health center will help address these health inequities by bringing critical, high-quality health services into the community. I was proud to have worked closely with HHS to bring nearly $3.7 million in federal funding to New Jersey for community health centers, and stand committed to continue strengthening our underserved communities.\u201d\n\nWhen it was his turn to speak, Essex County Executive Joe DiVincenzo acknowledged Pallone\u2019s new role as \u201ca big shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get a call from me,\u201d said the executive, noting how health centers are the future, and critical here in Essex, which lost sis hospitals in the last six years.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/stjames.jpg?w=50", "description": "NEWARK - Confronting the East Ward closure of Saint James Hospital seven years after the fact, Democratic lawmakers this morning cut the ribbon on a new federally qualified health center that will expand health services in the Ironbound neighborhood thanks in part to $600,000 in Affordable Care Act (ACA) dollars.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "description": "NEWARK \u2013 Confronting the East Ward closure of Saint James Hospital seven years after the fact, Democratic lawmakers this morning cut the ribbon on a new federally qualified health center that\u2026", "title": "Lawmakers from All Levels Rally around St. James Health Center Opening", "url": "http://politickernj.com/2016/02/lawmakers-from-all-levels-rally-around-st-james-health-center-opening/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/stjames.jpg?w=1200", "height": 768}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/stjames.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@PolitickerNJ", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PolitickerNJ"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-01 16:46:40", "sailthru.title": "Lawmakers from All Levels Rally around St. James Health Center Opening", "fb": {"app_id": 710865528969413}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politickernj.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "keywords": "newark, ironbound, st. james, ras baraka, bob menendez, cory booker", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PolitickerNJ", "published_time": "2016-02-01T21:46:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T21:46:40+00:00", "author": "http://wordpress.com/author/max"}, "sailthru.description": "NEWARK - Confronting the East Ward closure of Saint James Hospital seven years after the fact, Democratic lawmakers this morning cut the ribbon on a new federally qualified health center that will expand health services in the Ironbound neighborhood thanks in part to $600,000 in Affordable Care Act (ACA) dollars.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/stjames.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Newark, Ironbound, St. James, Ras Baraka, Bob Menendez, Cory Booker"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis new federally qualified health center will help address these health inequities by bringing critical, high-quality health services into the community.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to be opening our doors to provide much needed primary care to the residents of Newark and our surrounding neighbors,\u201d said Nicole Fields, president and CEO of Saint James Health.\nBut today, as the powerfully effective ranking member of the House Subcommittee on Health, he could legitimately do a victory lap for having secured funding for the new health center.\n\u201cCommunities like Newark face incredible barriers to adequate health care, such as transportation, language, and inadequate access to information,\u201d said the junior senator, referring to a city wherein 45% of the population lacks health insurance.\nPallone noted how Payne stands in the front of the House Chamber and Sires in the back."}
