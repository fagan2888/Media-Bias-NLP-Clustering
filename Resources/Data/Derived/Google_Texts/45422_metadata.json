People check in with their family, friends or neighbors in order to navigate a system that they have no experience with,\" she said.\n\nThe SEIU, which represents healthcare, building-services and public-sector workers, has trained hundreds of union members to explain the law's benefits to families, friends, neighbors or people they meet at health fairs, she said.\n\nSome 300,000 of the union's workers who currently lack insurance could benefit from the law, either through an expansion of the Medicaid program for low-income Americans or through subsidized private insurance, Henry said.\n\nThe administration set up its website to enable uninsured Americans to easily find healthcare options and prices, but the site has been plagued by technical problems since its launch on Oct. 1. The process generally has worked more smoothly in the 14 states that have set up online exchanges of their own rather than relying on the federal government's site.\n\n'NOT THE HUGE DEBACLE'\n\nFor those who have spent their lives one costly hospital visit away from financial ruin, the law's shaky rollout has been dwarfed by the possibility of getting affordable health insurance, Henry said.\n\n\"It is not the huge debacle that you hear in Washington,\" she said. \"People want health coverage, and they're going to figure out how to get through the obstacles to make it happen.\"\n\nInsurance executives, policy specialists and former administration officials say the website's problems need to be sorted out by mid-November to ensure that large numbers of enrollees, especially young adults, can be processed by a Dec. 15 deadline for those seeking coverage starting Jan. 1.\n\nIn the meantime, the SEIU has resorted to paper forms to sign up those who are interested, or telephoning applications in to the government's call centers.\n\n\"We're running phone banks, much as we do in a political election, driving people to community centers. We're doing sort of group orientation because it's the way around the website,\" Henry said.\n\nThat approach could buy time for the Obama administration to fix the website, but it also could lead to complications in processing applications for coverage in the coming weeks.\n\nPaper applications must be mailed to the government, which matches applicants with available insurance programs. The results are supposed to be mailed back about two weeks later, and at that point applicants have to pick which type of coverage they want and mail their choices back to the government.\n\nHenry said that SEIU workers will have to ensure that applicants who they are helping take that second step of mailing in their insurance choices.\n\nIn the coming weeks, she said, the union will tout Obamacare's benefits before launching a big push to sign up people in the first part of December.\n\nThat could lead to crushing traffic at the healthcare.gov site. It's also unclear whether contractors handling paper and phone applications for the Obamacare program will be able to keep up with the volume if the website does not improve soon.\n\nSo far, most visitors to the online exchanges seem to be window shopping. About 58 percent of visitors said they just wanted to learn more about their coverage options, while 32 percent said they were looking to purchase healthcare insurance, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center.\n\nThe SEIU says it is talking to tens of thousands of Americans each week about the law. Union members in Illinois made 7,000 phone calls on Oct. 1 and activists in California have reached more than 100,000 households so far, SEIU officials said. Members also are knocking on about 1,800 doors a day in New York City.

Well, it's true that if you want the experience the pinnacle of medical care, you come to the United States. And if you want the pinnacle of haute cuisine, you go to Per Se. If you want the pinnacle of commercial air travel, you get a first class seat on British Airways. Now, naturally, you wouldn't let just anyone mess with someone's tasting menu or state-of-the-art air-beds. But like anything that's \"the best,\" the best health care in the world isn't for everybody. The costs are prohibitively high, the access is prohibitively exclusive, and the resources are prohibitively scarce. What do the people in America who \"fly coach\" in the health care system get? Well, at the time of the health care reform debate, they were participating in a system that was, by all objective measurements, overpriced and underperforming -- if you were lucky enough to be participating in it. As anyone who's fortunate enough to have employer based health care or unfortunate enough to have a pre-existing condition can tell you, health care for ordinary people already involved all of those things that we were told would be a feature of the Affordable Care Act -- long waits, limited choice, and rationing. When the Commonwealth Fund rated health care systems by nation , the top marks in the surveyed categories went to the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Ezra Klein examined the study, and observed : \"The issue isn't just that we don't have universal health care. Our delivery system underperforms, too. 'Even when access and equity measures are not considered, the U.S. ranks behind most of the other countries on most measures. With the inclusion of primary care physician survey data in the analysis, it is apparent that the U.S. is lagging in adoption of national policies that promote primary care, quality improvement, and information technology.'\" Share this slide:\n\nGetty", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Andy Sullivan                 WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - As the Obama administration  scrambles to fix a balky healthcare website that...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-10-24 18:24:00 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "By Andy Sullivan                 WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - As the Obama administration  scrambles to fix a balky healthcare website that...", "title": "Labor Union Bypasses Obamacare Webiste To Reach Uninsured", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/23/labor-union-health-care_n_4152235.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1423576/images/o-BARACK-OBAMA-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostPol", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1423576/images/o-BARACK-OBAMA-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "By Andy Sullivan                 WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - As the Obama administration  scrambles to fix a balky healthcare website that...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Labor Union Bypasses Obamacare Webiste To Reach Uninsured"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-23 18:24:00 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4152235", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "uninsured,insurance,obamacare,healthcare.gov,reuters,medicaid,service employees international union,Labor Unions,unions,health care,Barack Obama", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "uninsured,insurance,obamacare,healthcare.gov,reuters,medicaid,service employees international union,Labor Unions,unions,health care,Barack Obama", "published_time": "2013-10-23 18:24:00 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-12-23 05:12:02 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb7a7\"", "article_summary": "(Editing by David Lindsey and Will Dunham)Also on HuffPost: Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate1 of 12 Healthcare In America Is Already 'The Best In The World' One of the more positive sounding admonitions from health care reform opponents was that the United States had \"the best health care in the world,\" so why would you mess with it?\nEzra Klein examined the study, and observed : \"The issue isn't just that we don't have universal health care.\n\"People want health coverage, and they're going to figure out how to get through the obstacles to make it happen.\"\nBut like anything that's \"the best,\" the best health care in the world isn't for everybody.\nWhat do the people in America who \"fly coach\" in the health care system get?"}
