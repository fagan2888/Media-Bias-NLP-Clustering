James Comey, the nation\u2019s top cop, or politicians eager to curry favor with the black community?\n\nFBI chief James Comey earned himself a summons to the Oval Office last week by telling the truth about the war on crime. President Obama suggests that racial bias has led to too many black men being locked up and vows to combat \u201cdisparities in the application of criminal justice.\u201d Comey argues that tough policing in minority neighborhoods has saved thousands of black lives and that the recent upsurge in homicides may reflect the \u201cYouTube\u201d effect -- making police officers nervous to do their jobs. The good news is that Comey, imbued with an impressive independence streak, has another 8 years to serve. Even though Obama could presumably pressure him to resign, he can\u2019t fire him.\n\nRelated: How the FBI Could Derail Hillary Clinton\u2019s Presidential Run\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike have hopped aboard the criminal justice bandwagon, noting the large incarceration rate in the United States and the disproportionate number of prisoners of color. Hillary Clinton hit a common theme when she noted in a speech last spring, \u201cIt\u2019s a stark fact that the United States has less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population, yet we have almost 25 percent of the world\u2019s total prison population.\u201d She fails to note that the disparity stems from higher crime rates. Homicides in the U.S. run seven times the rate in other developed countries, according to a 2011 study from the Harvard School of Public Health and the UCLA School of Public Health.\n\nClinton also gets it backwards with her next statement: \u201cThe numbers today are much higher than they were 30, 40 years ago, despite the fact that crime is at historic lows.\u201d\n\nIn New York City, 2,000 homicides a year was considered the norm in the 1980s and 1990s. Last year there were 328.\n\nMany would suggest that crime is at historic lows because so many criminals have been put behind bars. Comey made that case recently, speaking at the University of Chicago Law School. He reminds us that not so long ago, urban crime, especially in minority neighborhoods, was horrific. In New York City, 2,000 homicides a year was considered the norm in the 1980s and 1990s; last year there were 328. As Comey notes, \u201cWhite people weren\u2019t dying; black people were dying. Most white people could drive around the problem. If you were white and not involved in the drug trade as a buyer or a seller, you were largely apart from the violence.\u201d\n\nNew York was not alone. Comey recalls his tenure as a prosecutor in Richmond, Virginia, where there was a \u201cplague of violence\u201d in that city\u2019s black neighborhoods. Drug gangs controlled the streets and were strangling the community. Only by sending dealers to prison did residents feel safe enough to once again sit on their porches and let their children play in the streets. Comey was asked then, \u201cWhy we were doing so much prosecuting in black neighborhoods and locking up so many black men. After all, Richmond was surrounded by areas with largely white populations. Surely there were drug dealers in the suburbs.\u201d His answer: \u201cWe are there in those neighborhoods because that\u2019s where people are dying.\u201d\n\nRelated: How to Stop the Next Urban Race Riot? Ask a Republican\n\nAs Comey points out, no one is speaking up for those not murdered or raped because the streets are safer \u2013 those whose lives have been saved don\u2019t speak to the press or march in the streets. Rather, activists join Clinton in blasting \u201cmass incarceration\u201d and back up Carly Fiorina\u2019s lament that \u201cTwo-thirds of the people in our prisons are there for nonviolent offenses, mostly drug-related.\u201d Though this is simply not true.\n\nLess than 1 percent of those punished for drug offenses in federal court in 2014 were convicted of merely possession.\n\nThe facts are that of the 2.2 million people held in U.S. prisons, less than 10 percent (200,000) are in federal lock-ups. Because the states handle prosecutions of most murders, rapes and other violent crimes, it is true that about half of those in federal prisons have been convicted of drug-related crimes. They are not, typically, \u201cyoung people who made mistakes that aren\u2019t that different from the mistakes I made\u2019, as President Obama suggested in a heavily publicized visit to a federal prison last July. Rather, they are usually traffickers or other repeat offenders who have pled down to lesser charges. Less than 1 percent of those punished for drug offenses in federal court in 2014 were convicted of merely possession.\n\nAt the state level, only one in 6 prisoners is in prison for drug-related crimes; only 3.6 percent were doing time for possession, often the outcome from a plea-bargain. More than half have been convicted of violent offenses. A study in 2004 from the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that 95 percent of those locked up in state prisons for \u201cnonviolent\u201d crimes had a long rap sheet, averaging more than 9 arrests and 4 convictions; nearly one third had previously been arrested for a violent crime.\n\nRelated: Crime Is Down Across the Country - Here Are 50 Reasons Why\n\nNone of this suggests that we should not be reviewing sentencing laws or that we do not have a crime problem in this country. Nor that there are some heart-breaking stories about those few individuals caught in the wrong place at the wrong time and, because of sentencing laws, locked up for far too long. But, any discussion of the matter should be based on facts, not politics.\n\n\u201cReducing drug admissions to 15 large state penitentiaries by half would lower those states\u2019 prison count by only 7 percent.\u201d\n\nIn their embrace of criminal justice reform, Hillary Clinton and other candidates have sought quick fixes like lighter sentencing. This approach will bear little fruit. As a report from the Urban Institute points out, \u201cReducing drug admissions to 15 large state penitentiaries by half would lower those states\u2019 prison count by only 7 percent.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama is advocating early release for non-threatening prisoners, as well as job training and employment help for those released, to reduce recidivism. Unhappily, a program with the same aim in several cities including Chicago and Detroit was evaluated by the Urban Institute and the University of Michigan, which found, \u201cThe transitional jobs programs did not significantly affect key measures of recidivism over the two-year follow-up period. About half of each group were arrested, and a similar number returned to prison.\u201d\n\nAll these initiatives appeal to those blacks and Hispanics convinced that their communities have been unfairly targeted by law enforcement officials. They will likely be less popular with their neighbors, who worry that their streets will again become unsafe for their children. Perhaps it is time for law-abiding citizens in those crime-threatened communities to make their voices heard. And to turn our law enforcement management back to the pros, like James Comey.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When it comes to criminal justice reform, whom are you going to believe?", "title": "FBI Chief Debunks Obama\u2019s Crusade for Criminal Justice Reform", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/11/04/FBI-Chief-Debunks-Obama-s-Crusade-Criminal-Justice-Reform", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-09-25T211203Z_2_LYNXNPEA8O0SF_RTROPTP_2_USA-FBI-COMEY.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/11/04/FBI-Chief-Debunks-Obama-s-Crusade-Criminal-Justice-Reform", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-09-25T211203Z_2_LYNXNPEA8O0SF_RTROPTP_2_USA-FBI-COMEY.jpg", "creator": "@lizpeek", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When it comes to criminal justice reform, whom are you going to believe?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Comey was asked then, \u201cWhy we were doing so much prosecuting in black neighborhoods and locking up so many black men.\nComey recalls his tenure as a prosecutor in Richmond, Virginia, where there was a \u201cplague of violence\u201d in that city\u2019s black neighborhoods.\nFBI chief James Comey earned himself a summons to the Oval Office last week by telling the truth about the war on crime.\nWhen it comes to criminal justice reform, whom are you going to believe?\nThe good news is that Comey, imbued with an impressive independence streak, has another 8 years to serve."}
