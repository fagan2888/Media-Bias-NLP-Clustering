The analyses \u2014 prepared by Beacon Economics, a respected Los Angeles-based consultant \u2014 make a powerful case that the focus of state anti-poverty efforts should be bringing down housing costs.\n\nBeacon reports that from 2005 to 2015, California ranked 49th out of 50 states in building new housing per capita. According to the latest data, it ranks 49th in homeownership and last in overall housing affordability. California renters also spend a higher percentage of their income on housing than their counterparts in all but one other state \u2014 even though Californians are far more likely to share apartments with non-family members than Americans in general.\n\nThese high costs are not daunting to the affluent. Net migration data show that from 2007 to 2014, 80,000 families with a household income of $150,000 or more moved to the Golden State. But during that span, 563,000 families with income of less than $50,000 left the state, as did 139,000 families with income from $50,000 to $99,999.\n\nThese trends are likely to continue, according to Beacon, unless state leaders change state laws \u2014 starting with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) \u2014 to make it easier to build new housing and less easy for opponents to tie up developers with demands and prolonged court battles. Without such changes, Beacon warned that the state could face worker shortages, depressed demand for goods and services, and increased welfare costs.\n\nThese reports should serve as a wake-up call to California\u2019s political establishment. After seeing similar circumstances in his city, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2014 one of the nation\u2019s leading progressive politicians \u2014 launched a push to add 80,000 new housing units. Vox executive editor Matthew Yglesias \u2014 one of the nation\u2019s leading progressive journalists \u2014 has expressed astonishment for years that there\u2019s not a broader appreciation of how much restrictive housing regulations hurt the poor and middle class. In his 2012 e-book, \u201cThe Rent Is Too Damn High,\u201d Yglesias wrote that high rent is \u201cbad for the environment; it promotes long commutes, traffic jams, misery and smog. What\u2019s more, high rent is not a fact of nature. It\u2019s the result of bad public policy, and it deserves to be taken seriously as one of the critical problems we face.\u201d\n\nEspecially in California. New Census Bureau measures that include cost of living show the state to be America\u2019s poverty capital, with nearly one in four residents barely able or unable to make ends meet. But to date, attempts to address poverty have focused on raising the minimum wage and adding money to affordable housing programs that amount to lotteries in which select few families gain access to subsidized homes.\n\nThese are policies that allow the state\u2019s most powerful forces to show sympathy for the impoverished without addressing the biggest cause of mass poverty. The millions of Californians who feel stricken by their monthly housing bills deserve far better.\n\nNext editorial: Thanks, San Diego police, for mandatory dog training", "article_metadata": {"description": "Housing costs are the primary reason for poverty and near-poverty in California, and without a Bill de Blasio-style approach that emphasizes adding housing stock to bring down these costs, the Golden State is certain to remain the most impoverished state in America.", "og": {"site_name": "The San Diego Union-Tribune", "description": "Housing costs are the primary reason for poverty and near-poverty in California, and without a Bill de Blasio-style approach that emphasizes adding housing stock to bring down these costs, the Golden State is certain to remain the most impoverished state in America.", "title": "How California should fight poverty: Add housing stock", "url": "http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/mar/06/housing-costs-too-high-california/", "image": "http://cdn.sandiegouniontrib.com/img/photos/2015/06/05/bed9024f1fb88d19780f6a7067007b70_tx201.JPEG?a7afd4f196cc87f88131a6d97e3ddf50b1644c7d", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 778414772, "app_id": 227086564005280, "pages": 133508396112}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msvalidate.01": "2AF9F2CAA01E4774AB920A8D645E9566", "google-site-verification": "JTkOa1fDuGoZnj1zAjCzaqA-xURAD0upoPOesFaeS3k", "verify-v1": "6ylWgY9aqB0mJpcLJKDC73u2SDU/3xlc3MH+PxXmLRY=", "\u201drobots\u201d": "\u201dnoodp\u201d", "y_key": "f9413f5ffc5479bd", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "affordable housing, poverty, California has the highest poverty rate, poverty capital, rent is too damn high, Bill de Blasio, Matt Yglesias, housing regulations"}, "article_summary": "Beacon reports that from 2005 to 2015, California ranked 49th out of 50 states in building new housing per capita.\nIn his 2012 e-book, \u201cThe Rent Is Too Damn High,\u201d Yglesias wrote that high rent is \u201cbad for the environment; it promotes long commutes, traffic jams, misery and smog.\nWhat\u2019s more, high rent is not a fact of nature.\nAccording to the latest data, it ranks 49th in homeownership and last in overall housing affordability.\nBut during that span, 563,000 families with income of less than $50,000 left the state, as did 139,000 families with income from $50,000 to $99,999."}
