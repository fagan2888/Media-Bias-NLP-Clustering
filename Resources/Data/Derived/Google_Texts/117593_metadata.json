Last, author of \u201cWhat to Expect When No One\u2019s Expecting: America\u2019s Coming Demographic Disaster,\u201d believes the U.S. is in for a rocky ride in the next few years \u2013 demographically.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a decline in fertility going back to the foundation of this country,\u201d said Last. \u201cThe only interruption we had was the Baby Boom.\n\n\u201cThis uninterrupted fertility decline has stabilized in recent years, but only because we had a massive influx of Mexican immigrants propping us up. We look much like Eastern Europe without them,\u201d said Last.\n\nHe lays out the case that fewer people are choosing to have children, and that means Social Security and Medicare will become less stable as more and more people draw benefits and fewer are paying in.\n\nMark Regnerus, who is associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin and is also a faculty research associate of the university\u2019s Population Research Center, said that whether the U.S. could experience a birth dearth depends on what birth rate you define as a \u201cdearth.\u201d\n\nFertility is lower among non-Latino American women, said Regnerus.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018fertility trap\u2019 experienced in some European and Asian countries does not seem forecast for the U.S. for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said part of the reason is that there seems to be a more latent pro-child orientation in the U.S. than appears in some European countries. Like Last, though, Regnerus said that American fertility is propped up, in part, by the immigration of Latinos.\n\nThe nation cannot count on immigrants to support population levels, though, according to Last, because the new generations tend to assimilate, become more like their hosts, and their fertility rates drop.\n\nLast said one only needs to look at Central and South America to see the massive fertility declines.\n\n\u201cWhen fertility declines, then they stop sending out immigrants,\u201d said Last.\n\nRight now, Mexico is just at or just below replacement rates.\n\n\u201cIt is entirely possible they may have a lower fertility rate than us in several years,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is important to note that no one can predict future population or fertility rates, said Last, but if current rates continue, the U.S. will experience a birth dearth that will affect the economy and culture adversely.\n\nThe Baby Boom in the middle of the 20th century is just one of those times in history demographers would have had a hard time predicting, according to Last.\n\n\u201cIf in 1944, I told you the fertility rate would double over the next couple of decades, people would have said [I] was crazy.\u201d\n\nWhat will the U.S. look like if the birth dearth Last predicts comes to pass? A lot like Florida, or perhaps Japan.\n\nAccording to Last, contraction in population is not the problem, as much as the ratio between young and old populations.\n\n\u201cYou look at the age structure of Florida \u2013 it\u2019s top-heavy \u2013 lots of old people. That creates a lot of problems when you have a major entitlement state like we do.\n\n\u201cJapan is 30 years ahead of us,\u201d said Last. \u201cThey sell more adult diapers there than baby diapers.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to have a thriving economy when people opt out of having children, said Last. Consumption and innovation dry up when people have fewer children, and the population begins graying.\n\n\u201cThe future is banking on there being people to populate it,\u201d said Regnerus. \u201cYoung-to-middle-age adults are economic drivers, creators, and frankly they pay the bill for the promises we\u2019ve made to our senior citizens and the poorest among us. The more we promise, and the longer we live, the larger labor force we need, or else the higher taxes need to be raised.\u201d\n\nBirth rates also aren\u2019t easily changed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to \u2018stimulate\u2019 fertility amply via public policy,\u201d said Regnerus. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there is much that can be done. Other countries have attempted various policies, including tax breaks and payments to new parents, but the results have not been profound. \u2018Do no harm\u2019 would be a good policy. I don\u2019t see the logic in offering state-funded contraception, for example.\u201d\n\nWhy is there a decline?\n\n\u201cThere are some things that are universal, like the fact that mortality rates have fallen,\u201d said Last. \u201cYou no longer have to have 10 children to ensure five of them will survive.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the cost of college having risen 1,000 percent over the years has had a big impact, according to Last. When young couples face huge college debt, many opt to delay childbearing. When those same couples are financially able to have children, they may decide to have fewer because they know they cannot afford to send them all to college.\n\nFinally, Last said that birth control, abortion and divorce have all contributed to Americans deciding to have fewer or no children.\n\nThe one bright spot, Last noted, is religious families.\n\n\u201cPeople who are having a lot of kids now are the ones who end up inheriting the earth,\u201d he said. Doesn\u2019t appear to matter what religion, Christian, Muslim, Jewish or Mormon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "By Leslie Fain China\u2019s got a shortage of workers, impacting its economy, because of the nation\u2019s years-long limit of one child per family and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin fears his nation may lose influence and power as a result of the declining population.
