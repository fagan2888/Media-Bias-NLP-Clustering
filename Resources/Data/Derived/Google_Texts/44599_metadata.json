Every time her family went apple picking at a nearby orchard, those sturdy baskets came in mighty handy. Plus, her mom, Florence, would have been lost without her bushel basket when it came time to do the weekly laundry. In addition, she often heard her dad, Mark, speak of how many bushels per acre their corn, barley, oats and pinto beans were yielding. So the unit of measure is quite familiar to her.\n\nThrough a collection of 44 short stories, Davis fills up many bushel baskets with memories. She harvested them from events that her family lived during the late 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s. Each of the stories follows through with a theme. She includes many ordinary items that were in style during those decades such as black-and-white televisions and drive-in movie theaters. Those two forms of entertainment have simply faded away like the setting sun and taken on a vintage flavor.\n\nReaders will take a nostalgic trip back to the time when sidewalks in downtown Sterling were lined with parking meters. On Saturdays lots of shoppers were out, and it was hard to find a parking place. Sundays were a different story, though. All of the businesses were closed, giving that day of the week a totally different feel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you remember when Sterling had an icehouse and a creamery? While those two businesses closed their doors many years ago, they played a role in the local folks' lives and Davis relates how her family benefited from them.\n\nAt one time, Padroni also had a school filled with lively students who enjoyed the large playground. There was a slide, merry-go-round, swing, wooden teeter-tooters and tetherball for them to enjoy. Along came the day when the green chalkboards didn't need to be erased anymore for the doors were boarded up, but not before lasting memories were made.\n\nWhile no two families lived exactly alike in those decades, plenty of common threads did exist. Thus, readers will be able to relate to those relics from the past, which are comforting to think about every once in awhile.\n\nThe 161-page paperback contains three black-and-white photographs. It is written in an easy-to-read style and is large print. To purchase a copy of Bushels of Nostalgia, send a check for a total cost of $15 to: Susan Davis, 948 Chisholm Road, Inman, KS 67546-8077.
