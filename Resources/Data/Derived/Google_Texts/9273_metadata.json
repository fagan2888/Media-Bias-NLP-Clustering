Having graduated from Notre Dame University he embarked on a career working for the US Government\u2019s embryonic social security programme.\n\nAfter his wife gave birth to a mentally handicapped daughter he campaigned for programmes to provide support for families in a similar position.\n\nMr Newman insisted that his advanced years should not prevent him running for office.\n\n\u201cAt what age does a person become too old to think and reason? At what age does a person no longer have a concern for society?\n\n\u201cAt what age does a person no longer have a responsibility to act when acting may help?\u201d\n\nCurrently the oldest member of Congress is Ralph Hall, a 91-year old Republican from North Texas who is serving his 17th term in office.\n\nHowever Mr Newman said he has no wish to emulate Mr Hall\u2019s congressional service.\n\n\u201cAt 101 years of age, a natural term limit exists and I have no designs on a lengthy political career that requires me to sell out my ideals, my values, or my constituents for a potential future payoff.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "worldnews", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02830/Joe-Newman_2830474k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Newman, Florida, congress, Buchanan, old, centurion, USA,North America,World News,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "News;World_News;North_America;USA;Active", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "news_keywords": "Newman, Florida, congress, Buchanan, old, centurion", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "Florida man running for congress at age of 101", "section-id": 2280, "GSAGenre": "northamerica", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-worldnews-northamerica-usa", "GSAMLC": "news/worldnews/northamerica/usa", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "DCSext.pd": 1, "WT.cg_s": "worldnews", "description": "A 101-year old great-grandfather is running for congress in Florida after \n  becoming disenchanted with the incumbent voting for tax cuts and against \n  ObamaCare", "tmgads.channel": "news", "article-id": 10654121, "DCSext.Category": "worldnews", "DCSext.Level": 5, "DC.date.issued": "2014-02-21", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-world_news-north_america-usa", "last-modified": "2014-02-21", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "World", "wordcount": 336, "embedcount": 2, "authorName": "David Millward", "tag": "Active", "subsection": "USA", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 2, "imagecount": 1, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 10654121, "tmgads.articleid": 10654121, "tmgads.level": 5, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Florida man running for congress at age of 101 \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10654121/Florida-man-running-for-congress-at-age-of-101.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02830/Joe-Newman_2830474k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"10654121\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-21T20:15:59Z\",\"section\": \"World\",\"authors\": [\"David Millward\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"News\",\"World News\",\"North America\",\"USA\",\"Active\"]}", "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "A 101-year old great-grandfather is running for congress in Florida after   becoming disenchanted with the incumbent voting for tax cuts and against   ObamaCare", "title": "Florida man running for congress at age of 101", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10654121/Florida-man-running-for-congress-at-age-of-101.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02830/Joe-Newman_2830474k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.Genre": "northamerica", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.worldnews.northamerica.usa", "DCSext.author": "David Millward", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2014-02-21 20:15"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf57a\"", "article_summary": "Mr Newman insisted that his advanced years should not prevent him running for office.\nHowever Mr Newman said he has no wish to emulate Mr Hall\u2019s congressional service.\nThe US constitution sets a minimum age of 25 to run for Congress, there is no maximum.\nAt what age does a person no longer have a concern for society?\nAt the age of 101 Joe Newman is has put himself up for election to Congress seeking to break the Republican grip on Florida\u2019s Congressional District."}
