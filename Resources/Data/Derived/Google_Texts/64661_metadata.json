During his reign, Graham has been viewed as something of a dreamer, most notably because of his push to get an on-campus football stadium built.\n\nGraham\u2019s predecessor with the Rams, longtime college administrator Paul Kowalczyk, had developed the reputation as a bean-counting realist.\n\nGraham, a quarterback for CSU during the early 1970s, is quick to point out that he spent 35 years in the private sector, where he formed, operated and, yes, capitalized businesses in the field of international insurance.\n\n\u201cThe way I would characterize myself as a business leader is, I do have a vision,\u201d Graham said in an interview with The Denver Post. \u201cThroughout my career, I have always thought big.\u201d\n\nThinking big in college athletics, and specifically at Colorado State, means having a top-25 football team, going to the NCAA Tournament in men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball, \u201cand doing what our women\u2019s volleyball team does: win,\u201d Graham said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why that can\u2019t happen in a place like Fort Collins, one of the nicest places in the world to live, and with Colorado State being such a great university,\u201d he added. \u201cFor us to limit the scope of our success, I think, is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nImmediately after his hiring by his alma mater, Graham announced that he would drive an initiative to replace the now 45-year-old Hughes Stadium, which is located 4\u00bd miles west of the university proper. The proposed 40,000-seat, on-campus facility carries a price tag of $227 million.\n\nThe first big fundraising goal, $100 million, must be reached by October 2014 in order to be able to host games beginning in 2016.\n\nCSU president Tony Frank said recently that the project\u2019s initial fundraising goal is about at the one-third mark.\n\nGraham said \u201cgreat progress\u201d is being made and the number of potential donors with relationships to the CSU athletic department has been increased from a small number when he arrived to almost 1,000.\n\n\u201cAnd people are giving, there is no question they\u2019re giving,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a linear type of effort, where the progress is linear. It\u2019s like a hockey stick, where the momentum really takes off. I think we\u2019re at the point where it really starts to take off. But there is a lot of work to be done.\u201d\n\nGraham believes an on-campus stadium would benefit the entire university as a vehicle for alumni \u201cto re-engage,\u201d allowing for, say, the business school or veterinary school to have functions for current, former and prospective students during football weekends. And, of course, it would also benefit recruiting by all CSU teams.\n\nCSU is averaging fewer than 20,000 fans per home football game this season, and just 15,234 showed up for the Nov. 9 home game against Nevada despite beautiful fall weather. But Graham believes low attendance at Hughes Stadium has \u201cno correlation\u201d to what would occur with the new facility. An on-campus stadium will, in itself, help boost attendance, he said.\n\n\u201cIt may not be the biggest venue,\u201d Graham said, \u201cbut people are going to come and have a fun time and see the great traditions at Colorado State. That attracts great coaches. It attracts great student-athletes. When you have those, the product goes through the roof.\u201d\n\nEven during his days in the business world, Graham said he has functioned by the mantra that three things matter most: people, capital and culture. His first order of business was to work on the people aspect. Graham has hired eight coaches. And he \u201cpretty much flipped\u201d the leadership team of the athletic department with more than half a dozen hires in upper management.\n\nCSU is becoming more competitive. The football team is in contention for its first bowl game in five years. The women\u2019s basketball team is competitive again. The women\u2019s volleyball team is ranked No. 10 in the nation.\n\nAs for the capital required to take Colorado State to new heights, Graham reverts to his business sense. His department has a $32 million budget this fiscal year. He believes CSU can do everything it needs by getting that budget up another $18 million or so.\n\n\u201cWe need about $50 million (annually) of revenue and budgetary dollars to enable us to compete at any level,\u201d Graham said. \u201cLet\u2019s have great traditions and highly functional facilities and the resources to enable our coaches to recruit effectively and to travel effectively.\n\n\u201cDo you really need $70 million or $90 million to run a successful athletics program? My answer to that is no, you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you have to have a plan,\u201d he added. \u201cWe do have a plan. It\u2019s people, capital and culture. We\u2019ve got the people. We\u2019ve got the culture. And we\u2019re working to raise the operating capital so that we can run this thing the way we want.\u201d\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado State athletic director Jack Graham: dreaming is believing", "title": "Colorado State athletic director Jack Graham: dreaming is believing", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/23/colorado-state-athletic-director-jack-graham-dreaming-is-believing/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131123__20131124_CC9_SP24FBCGRAHAMp2.jpg", "height": 476}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131123__20131124_CC9_SP24FBCGRAHAMp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-23T19:16:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T12:07:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22e8\"", "article_summary": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 The irony may have evoked a chuckle from Colorado State athletic director Jack Graham if he hadn\u2019t viewed the perception as off base.\nAs for the capital required to take Colorado State to new heights, Graham reverts to his business sense.\n\u201cIt may not be the biggest venue,\u201d Graham said, \u201cbut people are going to come and have a fun time and see the great traditions at Colorado State.\nDuring his reign, Graham has been viewed as something of a dreamer, most notably because of his push to get an on-campus football stadium built.\nThe football team is in contention for its first bowl game in five years."}
