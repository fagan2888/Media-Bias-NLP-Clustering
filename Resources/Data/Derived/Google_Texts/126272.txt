WASHINGTON — Ready to ring in the new year, Americans look ahead with optimism, according to a new AP-Times Square New Year's Eve poll. Their ratings of the year gone by? Less than glowing.

What the public thought of 2013:

GOOD YEAR OR GOOD RIDDANCE?

On the whole, Americans rate their own experience in 2013 more positively than negatively, but when asked to assess the year for the United States or the world at large, things turn sour.

— All told, 32% say 2013 was a better year for them than 2012, while 20% say it was worse and 46% say the two years were really about the same. Young people were more apt to see improvement: 40 % of people under age 30 called 2013 a better year than 2012, compared with 25 % of people age 65 or older.

— The public splits evenly on how the year turned out for the country, 25% saying it was better than 2012, 25% saying it was worse. As with most questions about the state of affairs in the U.S. these days, there's a sharp partisan divide. Democrats are more apt to say the U.S. turned out better in 2013 than 2012 (37%) than are Republicans (17%).

— Thinking about the world at large, 30% say 2013 was worse than 2012, while just 20% say it was better.

But the outlook for the new year is positive: 49% think their own fortunes will improve in 2014, 14 % are anticipating the new year to be a downgrade from the old: 34% say they don't expect much to change.

WHERE'S THE PARTY?

Most Americans — 54% — say they'll be ringing in the new year at home, while 1 in 5 are heading to a friend's or family member's house. Only 8% say they'll go to a bar, restaurant or other organized event.

— Younger Americans are least apt to spend the holiday at home: 39% of those under age 30 will celebrate at home, 33% at someone else's home, 13% at a bar or other venue.

— Regardless of their own time zone, nearly 6 in 10 say they'll watch at least some of the celebration from New York City's Times Square.

COUNTDOWN COMPANIONS

Wherever they're spending the holiday, most Americans prefer the company of family. Asked with whom they want to be when the clock strikes midnight, 83 % name a family member.

— On a holiday often sealed with a kiss, nearly 4 in 10 say they most want to be next to their spouse, and 13% cite a significant other or romantic interest as a preferred companion. Parents like to be with their children, more than the children like to be with their parents.

— Less conventional choices: 2% cite their pets, 3% God, Jesus or their religious congregation, and less than 1% said they wanted to ring it in with their co-workers.

— Of course, some opt out altogether: 18% say they're not planning to celebrate on New Year's Eve, and 9 % say there's no one with whom they'd like to party, preferring instead their pillow, TiVo or their own thoughts.

WHAT MATTERED IN NEWS

The implementation of the health care law topped the list of the most important news stories of 2013, with 26% citing it. In an Associated Press survey of news directors and editors, 45 of 144 journalists surveyed called the health care rollout their top story.

In the AP- Times Square poll, the death of Nelson Mandela occurred as the poll was underway. It rose quickly, with 8 % naming it as the most important news of the year, matching the share citing the federal government's budget difficulties or shutdown.

The budget fight, which led to a partial shutdown of the federal government in October, was rated extremely or very important by 60% of Americans, and prompted rare bipartisan agreement. About two-thirds in each major party, 65% of Republicans and 63% of Democrats, rated it highly important.

A majority said the Boston Marathon bombings were extremely or very important, and 47% considered the national debate over gun laws that important.

See what Americans think of the past year, how they plan to celebrate the holiday and what they will remember most about the year that is about to end.

Miley Cyrus's MTV Video Music Awards performance. The launch of "Lean In." Apologies from Paula Deen and Lance Armstrong. Walter White's exit and the entrance of the Netflix series "House of Cards." What do they all have in common? More Americans say these pop culture moments were more forgettable than memorable.

Just one pop culture moment was deemed more memorable than forgettable: The birth of Prince George to Britain's Prince William and his wife, Kate.

— Among men, 64% called the debate on work-life balance sparked by the book "Lean In" and other writings forgettable. About half of women agreed.

— About 1 in 5 younger Americans said the launch of original programming through streaming services like Netflix or Hulu was a memorable moment, about doubling the share among those age 50 and up.

— Residents of the West were more likely than others to consider memorable the San Francisco "Batkid" (31%) or the final season of the series "Breaking Bad" (19%).

The AP- Times Square New Year's Eve Poll was conducted by GfK Public Affairs and Corporate Communications from Dec. 5-9 and involved online interviews with 1,367 adults. The survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 %age points for all respondents.

The survey was conducted using KnowledgePanel, a probability-based Internet panel designed to be representative of the U.S. population. Respondents to the survey were first selected randomly, using phone or mail survey methods, and were later interviewed online. People selected for KnowledgePanel who didn't otherwise have access to the Internet were provided with the ability to access the Internet at no cost to them.
