But if you do it by Friday, January 15, there\u2019s the added benefit of the coverage starting on February 1.\n\n/ Download\n\nIt\u2019s not as exciting as the Powerball deadline, but will affect far more people.\n\nFriday is the last day to enroll in an Obamacare plan, if you want the coverage to begin by February 1.\n\nThe final deadline is January 31. If you\u2019re not signed up by then, enrollment is closed for the rest of the year.\n\nHelpful links Make an appointment with a Houston-area enrollment counselor: Enroll Gulf Coast National enrollment website Healthcare.gov or call (800) 318-2596 Find a licensed insurance broker or agent: National Association of Health Underwriters zip code search.\n\nMore than 11.3 million Americans have already signed up, according to Mary Wakefield, an acting deputy secretary with the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Of those, 1.1 million are Texans.\n\nIn the Greater Houston area, almost 300,000 people have picked insurance plans so far.\n\nWakefield says the website\u2019s previous flaws have been fixed. The healthcare.gov site now has a new online tool that makes comparing plans easier. The tool helps calculate and compare the total costs of insurance plans: not just the monthly premiums, but also the deductible and the tax credits available.\n\n\u201cWe have unprecedented traffic to that website this year, more than at any other time in the history of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Wakefield said.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have health insurance in 2016, and you don\u2019t have an exemption of some sort, you\u2019ll face a tax penalty. Depending on how it\u2019s calculated, it could go as high as $2,000 for some people.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Affordable Care Act", "description": "Uninsured Americans have until Jan. 31 to enroll in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.
