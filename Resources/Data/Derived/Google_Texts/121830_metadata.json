His next opportunity to do so came two days later at the Republican debate in Tampa, Florida, on January 23. Before the debate took place, Romney released his 2010 and 2011 tax returns\u2014the first returns he had released during the campaign. His failure to release them had been the subject of repeated news stories and attacks from his Republican opponents. At one point before the South Carolina primary, Gingrich said, \u201cIf you\u2019re a South Carolinian, you say, \u2018Wait a second, why don\u2019t you want me to know about it? Why are you going to wait until after I\u2019ve voted?\u2019\u201d Romney\u2019s tax return showed that he paid a relatively low tax rate\u2014just under 15%, or $6.2 million on $45 million in income\u2014but he did not shy away from defending this fact. At the debate he said, \u201cI pay all the taxes that are legally required and not a dollar more.\u201d Ultimately, releasing these returns was enough to shift attention away from the subject.\n\nHaving retained the counsel of veteran Republican debate coach Brett O\u2019Donnell, Romney came out swinging at Gingrich in the debate\u2014\u201ca far different demeanor than he displayed during two lackluster debates last week,\u201d wrote Dan Balz and Rosalind Helderman in the Washington Post. Gingrich, meanwhile, \u201cwas far more subdued.\u201d In the next debate, on January 26, Romney was judged similarly. Balz and Amy Gardner wrote that Romney \u201cstepped up at a critical time\u201d while Gingrich \u201cdid not have the kind of dominating performance\u201d that he did in the South Carolina debates. Romney was again aided by prominent Republicans, most notably former House majority leader Tom DeLay and former Senate majority leader and presidential candidate Bob Dole. DeLay called Gingrich \u201cerratic\u201d and \u201cundisciplined.\u201d Dole issued a statement that said, in part, \u201cHardly anyone who served with Newt in Congress has endorsed him and that fact speaks for itself.\u201d Just as in December, Gingrich could not translate his boomlets of media coverage and poll numbers into support among party leaders.\n\nFor Romney, these debates appeared to shift the tenor of news coverage about him, portending a similar pattern that would benefit him after the first general election debate in October. Although the volume and tone of Gingrich\u2019s coverage changed little between the South Carolina and Florida primaries\u2014despite the attacks of Romney, Dole, and others\u2014coverage of Romney became much more positive over these eleven days. This positive shift in news about Romney began before the polls in Florida started to shift in his direction, suggesting that it was driven more by events like the debates than the polls themselves.\n\nRomney had other advantages in Florida. One was the electorate, which was less tilted toward evangelicals than it was in South Carolina. Another was his superior campaign. It was better funded, better organized, and arguably more effective. This is readily evident in the volume of television advertising aired by both him and Gingrich. Although Gingrich was somewhat able to keep pace in South Carolina, thanks to an infusion of cash to his super-PAC from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, it was difficult for him to be in two places at once. Only in the week before the Florida primary, and after another infusion from Adelson, was Gingrich able to go up on the air. All told, Romney dominated the airwaves in Florida much more than in South Carolina. In South Carolina, his ads and those of his super-PAC aired almost twice as much as Gingrich\u2019s. In Florida, they aired over four times as often. In the week prior to the Florida primary, Gingrich closed the gap but still languished farther behind Romney than he did in South Carolina.\n\nDid Romney\u2019s advertising advantage help him in Florida, above and beyond the possible benefits of more positive news coverage? Some evidence suggests that the ads mattered. Two Survey USA Florida polls\u2014one taken on January 8, right before the New Hampshire primary, and one taken on January 27\u201329, right before the Florida primary\u2014showed a 14-point increase in the percent rating Gingrich unfavorably. But Gingrich\u2019s favorable rating did not drop by the same amount in every media market. It dropped in rough proportion to the balance of anti-Gingrich ads and pro-Gingrich ads. The more Romney\u2019s attacks outnumbered Gingrich\u2019s positive ads, the more Floridians came to dislike Gingrich. In fact, if we assume, hypothetically, that Gingrich had been able to match the ads attacking him with an equal amount of promotional advertising, his drop in favorability would have disappeared.\n\nThe main limitation of this analysis, however, is that there might have been factors other than anti-Gingrich advertising that drove these trends. Perhaps Romney ran his attack ads in markets where support for Gingrich was already weakening. If so, his ads piggybacked on a trend rather than caused that trend. But one other piece of analysis did suggest that anti-Gingrich advertising could have mattered. In early December 2011, the political communications firm Evolving Strategies conducted a randomized experiment in which people were shown no political ads, an ad promoting Gingrich and an ad attacking him, or ads promoting and attacking Romney. The ads about Romney had no effect, but the two ads focused on Gingrich did. Most important, the effect of the ad attacking Gingrich outweighed the effect of the ad promoting him: people who saw both ads were about 15 points less likely to prefer Gingrich as their first choice compared to someone who saw no ads. To be sure, this experiment was conducted almost two months before the Florida primary and did not involve the precise ads Romney and Restore Our Future aired in Florida. It also cannot explain by itself why the anti-Gingrich ads aired in Florida appeared more effective than those aired in South Carolina. But it suggested that Gingrich was vulnerable to the kinds of attacks he experienced in Florida.\n\nRomney\u2019s advantage extended beyond advertising to field operations. As was true in Iowa, Romney had a ground game that no other candidate could match. Knowing that a significant fraction of voters would vote early\u2014ultimately about 38% did\u2014Romney\u2019s team obtained lists of voters who had requested an absentee ballot and identified voters their statistical models predicted were likely supporters. The campaign then followed up with these voters via phone and mail to make sure they sent in their ballot. Ultimately Romney did much better than Gingrich among those who voted early\u2014something that suggests, although it cannot determine, that his campaign\u2019s tactics helped.\n\nMeanwhile, Gingrich\u2019s campaign organization had no well-developed infrastructure of field offices and volunteers. As late as January 23, the Washington Post reported that Winning Our Future had to step in and try to create this infrastructure. In Florida it was too little, too late. Gingrich did not have a field office in central Florida until January 13, only about two weeks before the primary. Like Romney\u2019s campaign, his campaign also obtained lists of voters who had requested absentee ballots, but the Gingrich campaign did not update its lists as diligently, meaning that volunteers were sometimes talking to Floridians who had already mailed in their ballot.\n\nPerhaps the Gingrich campaign organization would have been strengthened had Republican Party leaders stepped forward to endorse him, thereby generating additional donations or helping him bring onboard a larger group of seasoned campaign professionals. But this did not happen. In fact, Republican Party leaders were mostly leery of Gingrich\u2019s success, just as they had been during the first Gingrich surge in December 2011. According to one news report, which cited \u201cleading Republican figures,\u201d\n\nThey said that if Mr. Gingrich won Florida, they anticipated further efforts to pressure leading Republicans, including former governors like Jeb Bush of Florida and Haley Barbour of Mississippi, as well as officials who passed up presidential runs this year, like Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana, to help build a firewall around Mr. Romney. They predicted intensifying criticism of Mr. Gingrich\u2019s record and style, both through the Romney campaign and among conservative commentators who think having Mr. Gingrich as the nominee would sink the party\u2019s chances of winning the White House.\n\nIf there was ever \u201cfear and loathing on the campaign trail,\u201d Gingrich seemed to cause it.\n\nJust as it is hard to know how much the Romney campaign\u2019s professionalism helped him, it is hard to know how much the Gingrich campaign\u2019s amateurism hurt Gingrich. Nevertheless, Gingrich was not able to counteract this movement toward Romney. On election night in Florida, after Romney had trounced him by almost 15 points, Gingrich claimed to be \u201cputting together a people\u2019s campaign\u201d\u2014just as he had suggested after South Carolina. At this point, however, people were mostly leaving his campaign. Gingrich\u2019s high-water mark in the campaign had passed, and his poll numbers would never recover.\n\nThe Santorum Surge\n\nRomney seemed to be cruising after his Florida comeback. Four days later he won the Nevada caucuses handily, besting the runner-up, Gingrich, by almost 30 points. The following day, the Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake summed up the status of the race by saying that Romney had \u201cconfirmed his status as the prohibitive front-runner,\u201d while Gingrich had \u201cfallen quickly\u201d and Santorum \u201ccouldn\u2019t pick up the pieces\u201d after Gingrich\u2019s collapse. Blake went on to express amazement that Santorum had chosen to focus on Colorado and Missouri rather than Nevada, concluding that \u201cthe payoff is pretty minimal for Santorum even if it works out.\u201d\n\nWell, it did work out. On February 7, Santorum won the Colorado and Minnesota caucuses as well as the nonbinding Missouri primary. Santorum beat Romney by almost 6 points in Colorado and by almost 30 points in both Minnesota and Missouri. In Minnesota, Romney actually came in third behind Santorum and Paul. It was, said the Huffington Post\u2019s Jon Ward, \u201ca very bad night for Romney.\u201d He did far worse in these states than he did in 2008, when he won Colorado and Minnesota. Santorum, by contrast, \u201cstunned the political world.\u201d Was the outcome that surprising? Not entirely. Late polling showed Santorum in the lead in both Colorado and Minnesota. Perhaps the best signal of Romney\u2019s impending losses was his own behavior: he began to attack Santorum and worked to lower expectations about his performance in these states.\n\nHow did Santorum do it? Certainly the electorate in these states was more favorable to Santorum. These states\u2019 likely voters had larger concentrations of evangelicals. Pre-election polls also confirmed that evangelicals were more likely to support Santorum than Romney. For example, Santorum led Romney 37\u201327% among self-identified Colorado evangelicals, who were 45% of the poll\u2019s sample, but trailed 18\u201346% among non-evangelicals. Moreover, turnout, especially in the caucuses, was low, and therefore caucus-goers and primary voters in these states may have been disproportionately activist conservatives who preferred Santorum to Romney. In the Colorado pre-election poll, Santorum led Romney among those who identified as \u201cvery conservative\u201d but trailed him among those who identified as \u201csomewhat conservative\u201d or \u201cmoderate.\u201d Such statistics support the explanation offered by the Washington Post\u2019s Dan Balz: \u201cthe lack of enthusiasm for his [Romney\u2019s] candidacy among conservatives.\u201d\n\nWith so little pre-election polling and no exit polls in these three states, we cannot definitively establish how much their electorates were tilted toward evangelicals or any other constituency favorable to Santorum. But even if we assume that there was such a tilt, it alone was not sufficient to explain Santorum\u2019s success. After all, Santorum had received relatively little national media coverage since the New Hampshire primary, and he received very little immediately before the Colorado, Minnesota, and Missouri contests. These three states may have had a larger-than-average share of potential Santorum voters, but that could not explain why they became actual Santorum voters.\n\nCertainly part of the answer was that Gingrich\u2019s star fell so rapidly after Florida. This was evident in his lackluster fund-raising. It was also evident in his share of news coverage. When Gingrich was surging, as he was going into South Carolina, he\u2014and not Santorum\u2014was the first choice of groups like evangelicals and strong conservatives. He won both groups in South Carolina, according to the exit poll. But with Gingrich firmly in the \u201cdecline\u201d phase, this created something of a vacuum that Santorum could fill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's frightening how close Rick Santorum really came to upending Mitt Romney", "title": "The Republicans almost went insane: Santorum really could have beaten Romney", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "It's frightening how close Rick Santorum really came to upending Mitt Romney", "title": "The Republicans almost went insane: Santorum really could have beaten Romney", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/21/the_republicans_almost_went_insane_santorum_really_could_have_beaten_romney/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/rick_santorum3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's frightening how close Rick Santorum really came to upending Mitt Romney", "title": "The Republicans almost went insane: Santorum really could have beaten Romney", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/rick_santorum3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "John Sides and Lynn Vavreck", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2012 Elections, Conservatism, Editor's Picks, GOP, Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Writers and Writing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03cc\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 2012 Elections, Conservatism, Editor's Picks, GOP, Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Writers and Writing, Politics NewsAfter the South Carolina primary, Mitt Romney needed to turn things around quickly.\nOne was the electorate, which was less tilted toward evangelicals than it was in South Carolina.\nIn the week prior to the Florida primary, Gingrich closed the gap but still languished farther behind Romney than he did in South Carolina.\nAt one point before the South Carolina primary, Gingrich said, \u201cIf you\u2019re a South Carolinian, you say, \u2018Wait a second, why don\u2019t you want me to know about it?\nHe won both groups in South Carolina, according to the exit poll."}
