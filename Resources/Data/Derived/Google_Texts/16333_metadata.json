Lowe, who died on Oct. 19 at age 72 in Lake Forest, Ill., was the visionary engineer who made the IBM PC happen.\n\nIt was Lowe who pitched notoriously stodgy IBM on the idea of making a computer that ordinary folks could own and use. And he was the one who formed and ran the team that actually developed it in just a year, daringly bypassing IBM\u2019s traditional reliance on its own hardware and software to use parts made by other companies.\n\nHere are some intriguing facts about Lowe and his brainchild:\n\nLowe, a native of Easton, Pa., attended Lafayette College on a basketball scholarship and graduated with a degree in physics. He was the first member of his family to earn a college degree.\n\nLowe was the director of IBM\u2019s Boca Raton Labs in 1980 when Atari approached IBM about manufacturing one of its brand of personal computers. According to Cnet.com, Lowe instead went to his bosses and suggested that IBM buy Atari and develop a PC under its own brand. They reportedly called his pitch \u201cthe dumbest thing we\u2019ve ever heard of.\u201d But ultimately, then-chief executive Frank Cary assigned him to develop such a product.\n\nThe team of 12 engineers Lowe recruited became known inside IBM as \u201cThe Dirty Dozen,\u201d after the 1967 movie in which a group of prisoners is recruited to perform a dangerous mission during World War II.\n\nLowe\u2019s team faced plenty of skepticism. One analyst, for example, was quoted as saying that \u201cIBM bringing out a personal computer would be like teaching an elephant to tap dance.\u201d\n\nIBM advertised its new product with this TV commercial featuring actor Billy Scudder as Charles Chaplin\u2019s little tramp character. He beat out 100 other Chaplin wannabes for the role.\n\n>> Get discounts on electronics with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nThe IBM PC was so successful that at one point in the mid-1980s, the company controlled 80 percent of the personal computer market. But the company eventually became a victim of the IBM-compatible standard, because other makers were able to develop cheaper, faster machines that ran the same software.\n\nIBM sold its personal computer business to Lenovo in 2004, and refocused on software and business services.\n\nLowe was modest about his achievement, despite its enormous impact. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any expectation that we were going to change the world,\u201d he said in 2001. \u201cWe could see that the world was changing.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Ruben de Rijcke via Wikipedia\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Remember your first car?
