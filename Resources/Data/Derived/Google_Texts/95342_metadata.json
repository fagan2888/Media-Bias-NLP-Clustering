But why the endless fixation with the yin and yang of these two NFL quarterbacks? Luck looks nothing like Manning, plays nothing like Manning, acts nothing like Manning.\n\nWhen Luck breaks the huddle late Sunday afternoon in Denver, however, pardon me for a sense of deju vu. Luck is eerily reminiscent of another Broncos quarterback you might remember.\n\nFrom his lumberjack strength to his 100 mph fastball to his no-worries goofiness, the 25-year-old Luck brings back memories of John Elway at the same age.\n\nWith Luck, who has provided Indianapolis a dozen victories by leading a fourth-quarter, game-winning drive in only three seasons, no opponent can breathe easily until the final second the clock expires.\n\nThe Colts desperately need Luck to do it all, and rely on their hero too much, because it\u2019s hard to fathom how Indianapolis would be anything close to a .500 team without him.\n\nAnd Luck feels the burden of a city\u2019s football fortunes on his shoulders. Luck presses his luck too often. In love with his big arm, Luck sees windows of opportunity that are in reality interceptions waiting to happen. As the scouting service Pro Football Focus has documented, 4.3 percent of the passes thrown by Luck this season were such poor decisions they were classified as game-losers. His proclivity for taking bad risks ranks Luck near the bottom of the league, alongside Jay Cutler, when it comes to making knucklehead throws.\n\nRemind you of any quarterback who wore No. 7, Broncos Country?\n\nWhen the Colts take the field for an AFC playoff game, I will have a flashback to the Broncos of Elway in the 1980s. The quarterback is amazing. His teammates? Not so much.\n\nWhen seeking a championship, all the Colts can count on is Luck.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s magic,\u201d Colts owner Jim Irsay recently told reporters in Indianapolis, lauding Luck for his instincts, arm strength and quick feet. And then Irsay did something else: He compared Luck to Elway.\n\nAt age 38, Manning is no longer asked to be Denver\u2019s best player on the field on every snap. Heck, we\u2019ve even heard Manning mention these \u2013 gulp \u2013 words: manage the game.\n\nBut in this case, against a Colts team that is not nearly as well-rounded or as formidable as New England or Seattle, managing the game might be a smart way to go for Manning in the Broncos.\n\nWhy?\n\nYes, Luck is capable of beating any NFL team all by himself. Here\u2019s the caveat: Against a Denver defense capable of a fierce pass rush from Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware, plus the slam-that-window-shut coverage skills of cornerbacks Chris Harris and Aqib Talib, it\u2019s also within the realm of possibility that Luck could throw Indianapolis right out of contention by pressing the issue and commiting mistakes.\n\nMuch like a young Elway, the one flaw I see in Luck is so much trust in a powerful arm and legs that sometimes the brain shuts down. Gunslingers go down shooting.\n\nWhen Luck drops back in the pocket, is there such a thing as a window too small for him to thread a pass to an Indianapolis receiver?\n\n\u201cThere are definitely times when you don\u2019t throw it because the window is too small and the risk outweighs the reward,\u201d Luck said on a conference call last week. \u201cBut understanding where you are situationally in the game \u2014 what has transpired, the score, down and distance \u2014 affects it.\u201d\n\nEvery year, when the Super Bowl tournament begins, much is made of Manning\u2019s playoff record, which is 11-12, including eight times in the postseason when he was one and done.\n\nIn three seasons with the Colts, the playoff record of Luck is a solid but unspectacular 2-2.\n\nThe point? A great quarterback can get his team 10 regular-season victories and a spot in the tournament. But a great quarterback alone isn\u2019t enough to win a championship.\n\nHere\u2019s a toast to the great individual talent of Luck.\n\nBut the Colts aren\u2019t a team; they\u2019re a one-man band.\n\nThat\u2019s no way to win a Super Bowl.\n\nAsk Elway.\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or twitter.com/markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: Andrew Luck has gunslinger moxie of young John Elway", "title": "Kiszla: Andrew Luck has gunslinger moxie of young John Elway", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/10/kiszla-andrew-luck-has-gunslinger-moxie-of-young-john-elway/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150108_113628_andrew-luck.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150108_113628_andrew-luck.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-10T13:03:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T07:19:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf9b5\"", "article_summary": "But a great quarterback alone isn\u2019t enough to win a championship.\nA great quarterback can get his team 10 regular-season victories and a spot in the tournament.\nWhen Luck breaks the huddle late Sunday afternoon in Denver, however, pardon me for a sense of deju vu.\nFrom his lumberjack strength to his 100 mph fastball to his no-worries goofiness, the 25-year-old Luck brings back memories of John Elway at the same age.\nWhen the Colts take the field for an AFC playoff game, I will have a flashback to the Broncos of Elway in the 1980s."}
