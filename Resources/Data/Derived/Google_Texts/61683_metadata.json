Despite yet-another round of shrill Thought Leader predictions of doom and gloom after Donald Trump\u2019s three-day spat with debate moderator Megyn Kelly, the billionaire businessman has actually widened his first place lead over the rest of the field and, more importantly, on a number of key issues.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn fact, the only candidates who noticeably benefitted from the debate are outside the Republican Establishment.\n\nIn the horse race, Trump currently enjoys a commanding lead over second place Jeb Bush, 24% to 13%. Prior to the debate, in this same poll, Trump was ahead of Bush by just 4 points, 19% to 15%.\n\nThird place Ben Carson jumped 4 points, from 4% to 8%; 7th place Carly Fiorina jumped 4 points, from 1% to 5%. She is tied with John Kasich (who gained only 1 point) and leading Chris Christie (4%), Ted Cruz (who lost -2 points and now sits at 4%), Mike Huckabee ( who lost -1 point and now sits at 4%), and Rick Perry (who lost -1 point and now sits at 2%.\n\nThe numbers almost certain to make the GOP Establishment lash out with even more impotent rage can be found in the poll\u2019s internals.\n\nTrump \u2018s favorability rating with all registered voters (not just Republicans) is higher than Jeb\u2019s, 38% to 35%. Trump\u2019s unfavorable rating is only 1 point higher than Jeb\u2019s, 58% to 57%. It should be noted that both men by far have the highest unfavorable rating with all registered voters. Other Republican candidates polled don\u2019t rise above 32% (they are also less well-known).\n\nTrump\u2019s earns positive ratings from 60% of Republican women and 57% of men.\n\nTrend-wise, Jeb\u2019s unfavorables have exploded since May, rising from 40% to 56%. His lack of energy and utter inability to put forth a cohesive answer on the question of Iraq have undoubtedly played a role in this.\n\nTrump\u2019s unfavorables, while still high, have actually decreased since April, from 64% to 59%.\n\nTrump is absolutely thumping the rest of the field on any number of key issues. On the issue of the economy, 45% of GOP voters trust Trump, up from +19% last month. His closest rival on this question is Bush, who earns just 9% support.\n\nOn illegal immigration, Trump holds a commanding 44% lead over Bush\u2019s 12%. This is a +31 point jump for Trump.\n\nOn ISIS, Trump sits at 24% to Bush\u2019s 16%. Cruz comes in third at 6%. On social issues \u201csuch as abortion and same-sex marriage,\u201d Trump leads with 18%. Bush and Carson sit at 14% and 12%, respectively.\n\nWith Trump\u2019s favorables within the GOP climbing into the high fifties and his near 50% rating on key issues, the bottom line is that Trump has room to grow. All this Thought Leader talk about his ceiling being stuck at 25% is belied by these internals.\n\nWhile 58% of Republicans believe the Party has a better chance of winning the presidency without Trump, that means that 42% disagree.\n\nAnd in a field of more than two candidates, 42% is more than enough to with the nomination.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "CNN Poll: Establishment Stumbles, Trump Widens Lead; Carson Fiorina Rise", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "CNN Poll: Establishment Stumbles, Trump Widens Lead; Carson Fiorina Rise", "title": "CNN Poll: Establishment Stumbles, Trump Widens Lead; Carson Fiorina Rise - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/donald-trump-family-leadership-summit-Reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-08-18T05:56:30-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/18/cnn-poll-establishment-stumbles-trump-widens-lead-carson-fiorina-rise/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CNN Poll: Establishment Stumbles, Trump Widens Lead; Carson Fiorina Rise", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/donald-trump-family-leadership-summit-Reuters.jpg", "title": "CNN Poll: Establishment Stumbles, Trump Widens Lead; Carson Fiorina Rise - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 GOP Primary, 2016 Polls, CNN, Donald Trump, Gov.
