The deadline for gaining coverage Jan. 1 is Dec. 15, a week away, and Patterson told the committee he hopes to see 179,000 to 190,000 people insured through the exchange.\n\n\u201cThe super majority of people have not signed yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey make decisions as close to the payment date as possible.\u201d\n\nThe exchange, which serves as a middleman between people wanting health insurance and insurance providers, knows a large pool of people lost their policies.\n\nThat\u2019s because the state Division of Insurance is shutting down Colorado HealthOP, the cheapest and most popular insurance provider on the exchange, as of Jan. 1. Its decision left about 83,000 people hunting for alternatives.\n\nPatterson told legislators he does not know yet how many of the 42,000 new enrollees came from the cooperative.\n\nRep. Dan Nordberg, a Colorado Springs Republican and vice chairman of the committee, praised Patterson after the hearing but questioned the future of the exchange.\n\n\u201cIf more people are coming off the marketplace than coming on, you\u2019re not sustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a question for all the state exchanges.\u201d\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group, handed in 1,300 form letters wrapped in a red bow afterward, calling for an expedited state audit of the exchange.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a top priority,\u201d said Michael Fields, the group\u2019s state director.\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or @dolingerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado health exchange has 42,000 enrollees, hoping for 190,000", "title": "Colorado health exchange has 42,000 enrollees, hoping for 190,000", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/07/colorado-health-exchange-has-42000-enrollees-hoping-for-190000/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151011_111259_connect-for-health-colorado-file.jpg", "height": 466}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151011_111259_connect-for-health-colorado-file.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-07T17:57:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:35:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The leader of Colorado\u2019s health insurance exchange is hoping for a busy week.\nPatterson told legislators he does not know yet how many of the 42,000 new enrollees came from the cooperative.\nKevin Patterson, chief executive of Connect for Health Colorado, told the state Legislative Audit Committee on Monday that about 42,000 people have signed up for 2016 health insurance coverage through the exchange so far.\n\u201cThey make decisions as close to the payment date as possible.\u201dThe exchange, which serves as a middleman between people wanting health insurance and insurance providers, knows a large pool of people lost their policies.\nThat\u2019s because the state Division of Insurance is shutting down Colorado HealthOP, the cheapest and most popular insurance provider on the exchange, as of Jan. 1."}
