But Maine\u2019s Republican Sen. Susan Collins, the very model of moderation, spoiled the Democrats\u2019 piety charade by demonstrating its insincerity when she suggested this compromise:\n\nRepublicans would support a continuing resolution that funds the government for six months at the \u201csequester\u201d levels of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which was produced by that year\u2019s debt-ceiling negotiations. Republicans would also support raising the debt ceiling to enable the government to borrow enough to finance the substantial deficit spending involved in even sequester-level spending. (The sequester\u2019s supposed severity does not come close to balancing the budget.) Republicans also would grant agencies greater flexibility in administering the sequester\u2019s cuts.\n\nIn exchange, Collins asked for only two things. First, a mere delay, and for just two years, of Obamacare\u2019s medical-device tax, which is so \u201cstupid\u201d \u2014 Sen. Harry Reid\u2019s characterization \u2014 that bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress favor outright repeal. Second, enforcement of income-verification criteria for those seeking Obamacare\u2019s insurance subsidies \u2014 criteria the administration wrote but waived.\n\nHere Collins was asking not for alteration of, but for enforcement of, Obamacare. Just as many Republicans believe the Democrats\u2019 primary goal regarding immigration reform is to turn as many immigrants as possible into voters as quickly as possible, many Republicans also believe the Democrats\u2019 primary goal regarding Obamacare is to turn as many people as possible into subsidy recipients as quickly as possible. Hence Democrats\u2019 aversion to income criteria to prevent fraud.\n\nAs of early Monday evening, Democrats had refused Collins\u2019s bargain, giving several reasons but really having only one important one: They loathe the sequester, which prevents them from opening the spending spigot. Their knees ache from genuflecting before the altar of a \u201cclean\u201d continuing resolution and a \u201cclean\u201d debt-ceiling increase. They insist it is a sin against good government to attach any conditions to either.\n\n1 of 7 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The best of jokes about the government shutdown View Photos In trying to make the best of a bad situation, late night comics have used Obama impersonators, mourned the loss of the panda cam and mocked Fox News\u2019s coverage.

They favored attaching to a government funding or debt-ceiling measure a change in the Budget Control Act intended to weaken the sequester.\n\nBarack Obama, who says you did not see and hear him draw a \u201cred line\u201d regarding Syrian chemical weapons (\u201cthe world\u201d drew it), insists: \u201cThe sequester is not something that I\u2019ve proposed. It is something that Congress has proposed.\u201d This neon fib, made during last year\u2019s campaign, matters because the sequester has become the main bone of contention in the shutdown and debt-ceiling dramas.\n\nAccording to Bob Woodward\u2019s meticulously reported book \u201cThe Price of Politics,\u201d in the summer of 2011, with Republicans refusing to raise the debt ceiling unless spending were cut an equal amount, Obama and his principal economic advisers blundered by not recognizing how the Republican Party has changed. Obama proposed that if Republicans would not agree to tax increases as well as spending cuts, the sequester would take half the cuts from defense. Republicans, Obama and his aides thought, would flinch at this.\n\nNow Obama knows how wrong he was. Liberals, having long reviled Republicans as obsequious servants of big business and the military, are living miserably with the sequester cuts because Republicans now are resistant to business and military entreaties to open the government and raise the debt ceiling without preconditions.\n\nEarly in the Cold War and in the Air Force\u2019s existence as an independent service, during fierce inter-service competition for scarce resources, Gen. Curtis LeMay, head of the Strategic Air Command, was briefed by a junior officer who repeatedly referred to the Soviet Union as \u201cthe enemy.\u201d LeMay supposedly interrupted to say, \u201cYoung man, the Soviet Union is our adversary. Our enemy is the Navy.\u201d\n\nThose House Republicans who dislike the Obama administration but detest Senate Republicans should understand how the moderate Collins forced Democrats to drop their mask of moderation. And all House Republicans should understand that the victory won in the summer of 2011 \u2014 the sequester, achieved by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2014 still torments Democrats.\n\nAs House Speaker John Boehner struggles to manage his turbulent House caucus, he should remember Casey Stengel\u2019s advice about managing a baseball team: \u201cKeep the guys who hate you away from the guys who are undecided.\u201d No Republicans hate Boehner, but many are undecided about him because they do not understand the hammer \u2014 the sequester \u2014 he wields.\n\nRead more from George F.
