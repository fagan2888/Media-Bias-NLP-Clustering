I should have plenty of company, since open enrollment for 2015 begins Oct. 15.\n\nAs a reporter and editor on the health-care beat, I\u2019ve been explaining Medicare to the public since 1976. So people assume that I understand it thoroughly.\n\nBut writing about Medicare is one thing; living it is another. For advice, I called Barbara Katz, a former reporter and lawyer who recently moved to Longboat Key from another state. She enrolled in Medicare and a supplemental plan six years ago.\n\n\u201cOh my God, It was an absolutely awful process,\u201d Katz said. \u201c I can read, I can understand, I can analyze, and yet I found the Medicare explanations and choices almost impossible to figure out. I tried making charts, and I was getting nowhere.\"\n\n\u201cDid you get a booklet --it\u2019s called \u201cMedicare & You\u201d? Absolutely I pored over it. Yes, I studied it as though I were going to have to take a test on it,\" she said. \"I thought, you know, they\u2019ve laid it out in nice type and whatever, I should be able to figure this out. And guess what, I could not!\u201d\n\nShe eventually turned to an insurance expert for help. So did I, sitting through four hours of Medicare 101 given by a free state-sponsored information program for seniors called SHINE. Here is Polk County's SHINE coordinator, Jean Berken of Lakeland.\n\n\u201cThe nice thing about our program is it\u2019s made up of volunteers,\" Berken said. \"Our services are free and confidential, and the best thing of all we don\u2019t sell anything. We\u2019re unbiased.\u201d\n\nShe offered lots of advice to me and about 30 other newbies to Medicare.\n\n\u201cThose of you who have been talking to all your friends now they know that you\u2019re turning 65 \u2013 happy birthday, by the way \u2013one size does not fit all, \" Berken said.\n\nNew enrollees need to decide what\u2019s most important. Which plans include your drugs? How important is keeping the same doctors? Is that flexibility worth the price?\n\nTo weigh the options, beneficiaries must understand Medicare\u2019s alphabet soup: Part A for hospital bills, Part B for doctors, and Part D for drugs. (Part C is the official name for Medicare Advantage plans, but hardly anyone calls it that).\n\n\n\nThe federal government charges a premium for Part B, just over $100 a month. Even then, Medicare Parts A and B cover just 80 percent of the bills. How to cover the other 20 percent?\n\nOne solution, says SHINE volunteer Bill Ferrari of St. Petersburg, is to buy a Medigap plan and a prescription drug plan.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the \u201cCadillac coverage\u201d for people that might have issues about their health, concerns about their health,\" he said. \"It provides the most coverage, the most flexibility in terms of seeing providers, and it\u2019s something they should consider.\u201d\n\nThat is, if they can afford it. A state Insurance Department website shows Medigap supplements range in price from about $2,000 to $6,000 a year (depending on how many services they cover, and the applicant\u2019s age, county and whether they smoke).\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of money, but some beneficiaries are willing to pay it just to avoid managed care.\n\n\u201cFor somebody new coming in, one of the first things I ask: How do you get your coverage now? Just to get a feel for what you\u2019re comfortable with,\" Ferrari said. \"You\u2019re in an HMO, so that definitely should be in the list of what we look at. Whereas other people say \u2018I don\u2019t trust HMOs, what else are my options?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhatever the choice, SHINE volunteers say, it\u2019s important for beneficiaries to check their options every year because they often change prices, drugs, and hospital or doctor networks.\n\nBut a lot of people don\u2019t. That includes Barbara Katz.\n\n\u201cWell, I found the initial process so onerous, so unpleasant, that I have basically chosen not to look into it again ever since then,\u201d she said.\n\nWith that cheery thought, I set out to look at my choices. I\u2019ll report on how that works out later.\n\nMeanwhile, those who are already enrolled in Medicare should keep in mind that open enrollment -- the opportunity to get better coverage or save money -- is set for Oct. 15 through Dec. 7.\n\nHealth and drug plans are listed by zip code at www.Medicare.gov.\n\nFloridians can get free unbiased advice from SHINE (Serving Health Insurance Needs of Elders). A free program operated by the Florida Department of Elder Affairs and regional Agencies on Aging, SHINE volunteers offer unbiased advice on Medicare plan options, both in community meetings and one-on-one.\n\nSee a list of SHINE\u2019s community events at its website, www.FloridaShine.org.
