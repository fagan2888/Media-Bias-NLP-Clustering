While Winter Storm Juno might not have brought as much snow as some forecasters were predicting, parts of New England weren’t spared, with some locations suffering power outages and blizzard conditions. Elderly and disabled residents are struggling with snow removal, and one volunteer group wants to help them.

Serve Rhode Island, a community service organization, is seeking volunteers to shovel and plow snow for those in need. They promise they will help as many people as they have volunteers to serve.

Those who volunteer to plow and shovel snow must pass a background check and sign a liability waiver.

The Times Union reports that parts of Rhode Island received up to two feet of snow in Tuesday’s storm.

Bernard Beaudreau, the executive director of Serve Rhode Island, wrote that volunteerism has many benefits not just for Rhode Island, but for the nation.

“Increasing our volunteer spirit and civic engagement will also create a more informed public, with greater awareness of the needs in the community,” he wrote.

According to NECN, Serve Rhode Island was able to help 150 people with snow removal last winter.
