The Daily Caller has a transcript about what Paul said when asked whether he would go out of his way to talk about abortion during the presidential campaign nd if he thought abortion should be handled by the states or federal government.\n\nThe comments come after Paul did a remarkable job turning a media question about abortion on its head by asking if Democrats would support aborting a 7 pound baby.\n\n\u201cYou know \u2026 I will answer the question as honestly as I can,\u201d Paul replied. \u201cI didn\u2019t run for office because of this issue. It wasn\u2019t what got me to leave my practice. And I ran for office mainly because I became concerned that we\u2019re going to destroy the country with debt. That we would borrow so much money that we would just destroy the currency.\u201d \u201cI think best by the states,\u201d Paul replied. \u201cI think the question that still divides us, and it\u2019s a difficult question, is when does life begin,\u201d Paul, an eye doctor, added. \u201cI think we go down all kinds of rabbit holes talking about other stuff, but I\u2019m an ophthalmologist, and I see one, two-pound babies in the neonatal nursery. I look into their eyes to try to prevent a form of blindness that is now preventable.\u201d \u201cAnd everybody agrees that that one-pound baby has rights,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone were to hurt that one-pound baby in the neonatal nursery, it\u2019s a problem. That baby has rights. But we somewhat inconsistently say that seven-pound baby at birth or just before birth has no rights. And so I think these are questions we have to sort out. We just have to figure when we agree life begins.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Paul has made some curious comments about abortion and his pro-life position.\n\nPaul made pro-life activists curious when he said that Republicans should agree to disagree on social issues. Then, in an April interview, Paul says he doesn\u2019t anticipate changing the laws on abortion and added that his belief that life begins at conception is a personal and religious one, not a scientific viewpoint.\n\n\u201cThe country is in the middle (and) we\u2019re not changing any of the laws until the country is persuaded otherwise,\u201d he says.\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nHe seems to think America is not pro-life enough to ban abortions, never mind that a majority of Americans have been consistently pro-life in polls for decades \u2014 so much so that Gallup recently called the pro-life majority on abortion the \u201cnew normal.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to pro-life issues, there is little doubt Paul is pro-life and, on 10 votes on pro-life issues cast in the Senate during his tenure, Paul has a 100% pro-life voting record \u2014 voting against Obamacare, to stop abortion funding with taxpayer dollars, and protecting the conscience rights of pro-life people. Paul has said \u201cpersonal religious belief\u201d is that life begins at conception.\n\nOn his campaign web site, Paul makes his pro-life views very clear.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe in the sanctity of life. I believe that life begins at conception and that abortion takes the life of an innocent human being. Under the 14th Amendment, it is the government\u2019s duty to protect life as defined in our Constitution,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a physician, one of the first things we learn is to \u2018Do no harm.\u2019 Since Roe v. Wade decision, over 50 million children have been killed in abortion procedures. As President, I would strongly support legislation restricting federal courts from hearing cases like Roe v. Wade, in an effort to stop harming the lives of the unborn.\u201d\n\nPaul continues: \u201cOur government should not be responsible for funding abortions, and as President, I will attempt to stop the flow of taxpayer dollars to groups who perform or advocate for abortion. I believe we may be able to save millions of lives, and do no harm, by allowing states to pass their own anti-abortion laws. By giving this power to the states, I sincerely believe we would save hundreds of thousands of lives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rand Paul Makes Curious Abortion Comment That May Make Some Pro-Life Voters Nervous", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "There is no doubt that Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is pro-life on the issue of abortion, but he has made some curious remarks over the years about may make some", "title": "Rand Paul Makes Curious Abortion Comment That May Make Some Pro-Life Voters Nervous", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/05/19/rand-paul-makes-curious-abortion-comment-that-may-make-some-pro-life-voters-nervous/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/randpaul2.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "rand paul makes curious abortion comment that may make some pro-life voters nervous", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That we would borrow so much money that we would just destroy the currency.\u201d \u201cI think best by the states,\u201d Paul replied.\nThere is no doubt that Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is pro-life on the issue of abortion, but he has made some curious remarks over the years about may make some pro-life voters doubt how fervently pro-life he really is.\nPaul made pro-life activists curious when he said that Republicans should agree to disagree on social issues.\nWe just have to figure when we agree life begins.\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time Paul has made some curious comments about abortion and his pro-life position.\nI believe that life begins at conception and that abortion takes the life of an innocent human being."}
