Michael Collins said, adding that new samples showing decreased levels of toxins in the water are a positive sign.\n\nToledo officials issued the warning early Saturday after tests at one treatment plant showed two sample readings for microcystin above the standard for consumption, possibly because of algae on Lake Erie. The city also said not to boil the water because that would only increase the toxin\u2019s concentration. The mayor also warned that children should not shower or bathe in the water and that it shouldn\u2019t be given to pets.\n\nLong lines quickly formed at water distribution centers and store shelves were emptied of bottled water. The warning effectively cut off the water supply to Toledo, most of its suburbs and a few areas in southeastern Michigan.\n\nCity and state officials monitoring the water were waiting for a new set of samples to be analyzed Sunday at a federal lab in Cincinnati, Collins said.\n\nWorried residents told not to drink, brush their teeth or wash dishes with the water waited hours for deliveries of bottled water from across Ohio as the governor declared a state of emergency.\n\nGov. John Kasich pledged that state agencies were working to bring water and other supplies to areas around Toledo while also assisting hospitals and other businesses affected.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more important than water? Water\u2019s about life,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s difficult. We know it\u2019s frustrating.\u201d\n\nThe governor said it was too early to say how long the water advisory will last or what caused toxins to spike suddenly in the drinking water.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want to speculate on this,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cWhen it comes to this water, we\u2019ve got be very careful.\u201d\n\nFamilies toting empty coolers, milk jugs and even cookie jars topped them off with well water funneled out of the back of a pickup truck.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio has delcared a state of emergency, and more tests are needed to ensure the water's safety", "author": "John Seewer", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ohio has delcared a state of emergency, and more tests are needed to ensure the water's safety", "title": "400,000 people in Ohio told to avoid drinking tap water containing toxins", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/03/400000_people_in_ohio_told_to_avoid_drinking_tap_water_containing_toxins/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/toledo-water-problems.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ohio has delcared a state of emergency, and more tests are needed to ensure the water's safety", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/toledo-water-problems.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "400,000 people in Ohio told to avoid drinking tap water containing toxins", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "400,000 people in Ohio told to avoid drinking tap water containing toxins", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, algae bloom, Drinking Water, lake erie, Ohio, toldeo, Toxins", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd121a\"", "article_summary": "Topics: algae bloom, Drinking Water, lake erie, Ohio, toldeo, Toxins, Sustainability News, NewsTOLEDO, Ohio (AP) \u2014 More tests are needed to ensure that toxins are out of Toledo\u2019s water supply, the mayor said Sunday, instructing the 400,000 people in the region to avoid drinking tap water for a second day.\nWe know it\u2019s frustrating.\u201dThe governor said it was too early to say how long the water advisory will last or what caused toxins to spike suddenly in the drinking water.\nThe city also said not to boil the water because that would only increase the toxin\u2019s concentration.\n\u201cThis is not over yet,\u201d Mayor D.
