This becomes 'bad debt' for the hospital,\" which is paid for by taxpayers, she said\n\nKim Russell, outreach director for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, an organization founded after the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., told Al Jazeera in an email that the public health care costs of gun violence could be curbed by stronger gun legislation.\n\n\"Background checks on every gun purchase would significantly help to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands time and time again,\" she wrote. \"This is absolutely a public health crisis, no doubt about it.\"\n\nHowell also framed the issue as a \"public health prevention issue\" that reaches beyond the purview of the criminal justice system regulating gun legislation.\n\nStates with gun-friendly laws have higher rates of gun-related emergency care hospital visits, the study found. The South and Midwest have the highest rates of both emergency care visits and gun ownership, the study said.\n\nStill, some gun rights advocates argue that guns make the nation safer. Yet in a study published Wednesday by The American Journal of Medicine, the authors say they have evidence that \"debunks the widely quoted hyptothesis.\" The researchers concluded that there exists a strong link between the number of firearm-related deaths in the U.S. and the number of guns per capita, the highest in the world.\n\nThe National Association for Gun Rights declined to comment for this story.
