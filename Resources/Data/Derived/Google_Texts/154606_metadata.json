VA Secretary Bob McDonald recently aided Maddow\u2019s agenda by claiming during his appearance on her show that the VA was becoming \u201ctransparent\u201d and desires \u201csunshine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hunting season at the VA,\u201d VA Secretary Bob McDonald told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review on April 24, announcing a special medical advisory group to fix the VA\u2019s problems. \u201cNobody wants to talk about the good things. We\u2019re the largest medical system in the country, so when something goes wrong, it becomes news.\u201d\n\nMore than a few \u201csomethings\u201d are going wrong at the VA if the ongoing scandals in Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Denver, Phoenix and Tomah, Wisconsin are any indication. Yet, as I noted in a previous column, when President Obama recently traveled to Phoenix, Arizona he asserted that \u201cthere were deficits with the way the VA is being run\u201d but then called this a \u201ccase of bad apples and systems run awry.\u201d\n\nSecretary McDonald has presented similar talking points to the media, and some, such as Maddow, seem to be buying this narrative.\n\nIn reality, the VA scandal represents an insidious form of government corruption and mismanagement which will not cease until those responsible are held accountable. But accountability is the one thing lacking in Obama\u2019s Washington largely due to a complicit media. They fail to hold President Obama accountable for government corruption and malfeasance by blaming low-level civil servants or ignoring ongoing scandals entirely.\n\nThe New York Times deserves credit for a recent story outlining the lack of accountability in the continuing VA crisis. However, it relegated this breaking and relevant news to page A16.\n\nSecretary McDonald, who replaced disgraced former VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press in February that \u201cthe department had fired 60 people involved in manipulating wait times to make it appear that veterans were receiving care faster than they were,\u201d reports Dave Phillips for the Times. Then the VA clarified that \u201conly 14 people had been removed from their jobs, while about 60 others had received lesser punishments,\u201d he writes.\n\n\u201cNow, new internal documents show that the real number of people removed from their jobs is much smaller still: at most, three,\u201d writes Phillips. Sharon Helman, \u201cthe only person fired\u201d was \u201cremoved not for her role in the manipulation of waiting lists but for receiving \u2018inappropriate gifts,\u2019\u201d continues Phillips.\n\nIn the meantime, VA employees feel empowered to retaliate against whistleblowers within the VA, likely because of these weak accountability measures.\n\n\u201cOnce you talk to the media, you are on your own\u2026The VA does not support you, and you are not representing the organization,\u201d declared a Denver, Colorado VA Medical Center Director, as I pointed out in March. She continued, \u201cThe only thing you are representing is yourself, and then, once you are in hot water, nobody will help you.\u201d\n\nCNN also reported in March that a Los Angeles, California VA representative, Dr. Sky MacDougall, actually lied to Congress about wait times at the Greater Los Angeles Medical Center, and that Congress was investigating this incident based on their CNN report.\n\nVA crises are spreading throughout the country like a wildfire. On March 30 Congressional members traveled to Tomah to hold a joint field hearing to discuss a death resulting from the over-medication of one patient, the over-prescription of drugs to other patients, and the neglect of an older veteran who came in and suffered from a stroke while waiting for care at the Tomah VA. The older veteran, Thomas Baer, died from complications due to a stroke after delays at the VA Urgent Care center, an unavailable CT machine, no helicopter, and after being driven by ambulance to a new facility long after the initial onset of his symptoms.\n\nOne of the witnesses, Ryan Honl, a combat veteran who suffers from PTSD, was a whistleblower at the Tomah VA Medical Center. Honl testified about how his electronic medical file was accessed by multiple persons at the VA. \u201cHowever, as soon as I blew the whistle, I started hearing about my instability from other employees,\u201d he writes in his official testimony. \u201cIn an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, [Dr. David Houlihan\u2019s] attorney alluded to my mental health status,\u201d he states. \u201cShortly after while VA investigators were in the Tomah VA, Police Chief Huffman directed that a police report be done on me by my former supervisor\u2026and two coworkers\u2026four months after I resigned over a supposed \u2018threatening incident\u2019 that took place while I was an employee before I resigned.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly, my mental health diagnoses are being used by those I reported in order to discredit me,\u201d he writes.\n\nSpecial Counsel Carolyn Lerner told Congress earlier this month that \u201cThe number of new whistleblower cases from VA employees remains overwhelming,\u201d according to Joe Davidson of The Washington Post. In fact, Davidson reports that her testimony revealed that \u201cwhistleblower cases reviewed by her office are almost 150 percent higher than historical levels. Nearly 40 percent of her office\u2019s incoming cases are from VA, although her office takes cases from across the government.\u201d\n\nIf VA whistleblower cases are up 150 percent when compared to \u201chistorical levels,\u201d why aren\u2019t the media questioning President Obama\u2019s leadership on this issue?\n\n\u201cMonday\u2019s session demonstrated that VA\u2019s entrenched culture of retaliation against whistleblowers endures, a year after revelations exploded over poor service and the covering up of long patient wait times,\u201d writes Davidson.\n\nThen he defends Secretary McDonald, writing, \u201cThe retaliation continues despite the solid efforts of the current VA secretary, who replaced one driven out by the scandal.\u201d\n\nAccountability and professional standards are set by those at the very top. Secretary McDonald was confirmed last July, yet it appears that little change has happened at the VA under his leadership, nor that of his boss, President Obama.\n\nIn previous articles covering the ongoing VA scandal I pointed to the media\u2019s reluctance, if not outright refusal, to implicate the Obama administration for its role in facilitating the ongoing corruption at the VA.\n\nBut in some far-left circles this has been taken to the furthest possible conclusion, that the scandal is about to be exploited by the \u201cright wing\u201d for its own purposes.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Maddow recently minimized the poor treatment received by veterans at the VA, warned that the right wing would soon push to privatize the VA, and gave Secretary McDonald a platform to claim that the administration was actually being \u201ctransparent\u201d on this issue.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I want you to be here tonight, Mr. Secretary [Robert McDonald], is because I do feel like VA is about to have political challenges that it has not faced in at least a generation, if not more, and veterans groups have been able to hold off some of those challenges in the past,\u201d said Maddow on her April 15 show. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m not sure that VA has the political backup right now to fight those battles. And honestly, I\u2019m here partly because I want to sort of raise the flag that this is coming.\u201d\n\nThe graphic on the MSNBC broadcast read, \u201cV.A. Secretary on Right-Wing Efforts to Privatize VA.\u201d\n\nSecretary McDonald responded to her by emphasizing the VA\u2019s alleged transparency and desire for \u201csunshine.\u201d He said:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here. We want to get out. We want to be transparent. We now publish our data every two weeks online. Sunshine is a great, transparency is a great benefit to us. We\u2019re gonna do our share. We\u2019re gonna improve the results of the VA. We\u2019re working very hard to do that, and hopefully veterans will be happy with the care we provide them. It\u2019s the most exciting mission that we could possibly have.\u201d\n\nBoth participants in this highly disingenuous interchange may have wished to assure the public about the VA\u2019s integrity, but the growing news about corruption at the VA, prompted in part by Congressional hearings held by Rep. Jeff Miller\u2019s (R-FL) House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, makes it less and likely that the public can be fooled by such false assurances.\n\nVeterans actually served by the VA certainly aren\u2019t being fooled, and a number of them have contacted me after reading my articles on this continuing scandal to say that things are bad, and in some cases even worse than I described.\n\nAs is true for most MSNBC shows, Maddow\u2019s presentation of this scandal was highly misleading as well. Veterans groups are now actively asking for change themselves. For example, the price tag for the VA Medical Center in Denver, Colorado has ballooned from $328 million to $1.73 billion. As a result, \u201cThe American Legion in Colorado held a protest last year in which members held up \u2018JUST BUILD THE DAMN THING\u2019 signs and carried shovels, symbolically ready to build it themselves,\u201d reported The Washington Post\u2019s Emily Wax-Thibodeaux in March.\n\nThere is no doubt that the VA is a behemoth of a bureaucracy, and McDonald seems like a sincere and capable manager. But regrettably he also seems to have been captured by the Obama administration\u2019s culture of deceit, of punishing whistleblowers, and of failing to hold people accountable. Hopefully, for the sake of America\u2019s veterans, of which he is one, that culture will change, and change fast. McDonald was caught exaggerating his service history earlier this year, which may have contributed to skepticism about whether he is the right man for this job.\n\nRachel Maddow\u2019s transparent attempt to cast the VA scandal as the fabrication of right-wing political forces bent on destroying an embattled institution serves as a red herring designed to provide Secretary McDonald, and thereby this administration, with a platform to praise the past successes of this corrupt, mismanaged bureaucracy\u2014at the expense of those veterans who have died or been neglected. But MSNBC and other complicit media aren\u2019t interested in accountability, they\u2019re interested in covering for the Obama administration.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Accuracy In Media", "description": "Secretary McDonald has presented similar talking points to the media, and some, such as Maddow, seem to be buying this narrative.", "title": "Media\u2019s Ongoing Attempts to Downplay VA Scandal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/privatizingVAsoughtagain.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-27T11:23:34+00:00", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/medias-ongoing-attempts-to-downplay-va-scandal/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AccuracyInMedia/", "section": "AIM Column", "published_time": "2015-04-27T11:23:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-27T11:23:34+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Secretary McDonald has presented similar talking points to the media, and some, such as Maddow, seem to be buying this narrative.", "title": "Media\u2019s Ongoing Attempts to Downplay VA Scandal", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/medias-ongoing-attempts-to-downplay-va-scandal/", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/privatizingVAsoughtagain.jpg", "site": "@AccuracyInMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddbea\"", "article_summary": "In previous articles covering the ongoing VA scandal I pointed to the media\u2019s reluctance, if not outright refusal, to implicate the Obama administration for its role in facilitating the ongoing corruption at the VA.\nIn reality, the VA scandal represents an insidious form of government corruption and mismanagement which will not cease until those responsible are held accountable.\nOne of the witnesses, Ryan Honl, a combat veteran who suffers from PTSD, was a whistleblower at the Tomah VA Medical Center.\nFor example, the price tag for the VA Medical Center in Denver, Colorado has ballooned from $328 million to $1.73 billion.\nVA Secretary Bob McDonald recently aided Maddow\u2019s agenda by claiming during his appearance on her show that the VA was becoming \u201ctransparent\u201d and desires \u201csunshine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hunting season at the VA,\u201d VA Secretary Bob McDonald told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review on April 24, announcing a special medical advisory group to fix the VA\u2019s problems."}
