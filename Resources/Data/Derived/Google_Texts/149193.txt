Once again, the private sector – not government regulation or Obamacare – is making life easier for people in need of healthcare.

A New York-based startup, backed by actor Ashton Kutcher, that brings doctors to your door using a smartphone app, can now make a trip to the pharmacy a thing of the past.

Pager – an app that is aimed at reviving the practice of house calls by medical doctors – has formalized a partnership with New York based Zipdrug, an app that allows prescription medication to be delivered right to the patient, according to the New York Post.

“We’ve always been able to supply the first dose,” Pager General Manager Toby Hervey told The Post. “But the missing step was if a prescription was required in the course of treatment.”

“No one wants to wait in line [at the pharmacy] if they’re worse for wear,” said Stu Libby, a former Google exec who launched Zipdrug in July.

Pager, co-founded by Uber co-founder Oscar Salazar, was boosted this summer by a $14 million funding round led by Kutcher, and is already available on smartphones and the Apple Watch in New York and San Francisco. The app even allows consultations and doctor advice via video chat.

No more waiting rooms, no more day trips to the doctor’s office, and now no more long lines at the pharmacy.

Let’s see Obamacare try to match that.
