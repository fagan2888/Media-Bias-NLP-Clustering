Cruz speaks in Barrington, New Hampshire. New Hampshire mom: Cruz didn't scare my daughter

Sen. Ted Cruz startled a 3-year-old girl during a speech Sunday in which he slammed President Barack Obama’s domestic and foreign policies and evoked images of biblical proportions.

“The Obama economy is a disaster, Obamacare is a train wreck and the Obama-Clinton foreign policy of leading from behind — the whole world is on fire,” the Texas Republican said in Barrington, New Hampshire, according to the Concord (N.H.) Monitor.

“The world is on fire?” piped up 3-year-old Julie Trant, who was sitting with her mother.

The senator answered in the affirmative: “The world is on fire. Yes! Your world is on fire. But you know what? Your mommy’s here and everyone’s here to make sure that the world you grow up in is better.”

Cruz did not scare her daughter, her mom Michelle said in an interview with WRKO Radio in Boston.

“There was no tears,” Trant said, telling the show she told her daughter that ”Ted Cruz is the one that will put this fire out. And then she then looked at him as a hero.”

“I’m telling you: She was quite happy,” Trant added. “She was like, ‘oh? you’re going to put that out? We’re good. We’re good here.’”

Cruz also bashed “out of control” government regulators that are “descending like locusts” on small businesses across the country.

“We need to repeal every word of Obamacare,” he said, repeating one of his common applause lines. “We’ve got to get back to defending our constitutional liberties.”
