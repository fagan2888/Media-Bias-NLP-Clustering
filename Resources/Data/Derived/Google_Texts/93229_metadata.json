people here interact with teachers, access their healthcare records, transfer money, vote and pay taxes quickly \u2014 all online.\n\n\u201cAll of these things are an example of moonshot kind of thinking, going way beyond where you are,\u201d Bush told reporters afterward. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned from these trips and that\u2019s what I think the United States needs a lot more of.\u201d\n\nBush made sure to contrast the Estonian story with the seemingly dysfunctional government in Washington.\n\n\u201cThey transformed their country,\u201d Bush said. \u201cIn anticipation of technological changes that are now commonplace, they embraced using information technology the right way.\n\n\u201cWe have a static government on top of our dynamism that\u2019s choking us off,\u201d Bush continued, pointing out the technological struggles of the federal health insurance marketplace created under President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. \u201cI mean, $800 million to build a website that didn\u2019t work?\u201d\n\nEstonia was tacked on to this trip that also included stops in Germany and Poland to highlight the Bush tour\u2019s central theme: the need for a more engaged U.S. and NATO to contain Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, just across the border.\n\nBush was briefed on cyber security at an undisclosed NATO-contracted cyber defense site on Friday before he dined with Estonian President Toomas Ilves.\n\nWhen asked Saturday morning about how many additional American or NATO troops he might be willing to permanently station here, Bush said he would rely on military advice to decide that while advocating additional troops generally as part of an overall strategy of \u201cdeterrence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe notion that somehow by showing support, of having troops here, is somehow a provocation when it\u2019s for defensive purposes has to be rejected out of hand,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI think the best way to make sure countries like Estonia are safe is to send a clear signal that we have their back, we\u2019re engaged as a leader over the long haul.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the right strategy; the particulars of troop levels, I think that\u2019s a little premature.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He's flying back to Miami ahead of Monday's campaign launch.", "title": "socialHeadline", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/jeb-bush-2016-european-tour-talinn-estonia-118966.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/13/20150613_jebbushestonia_1160x629-min.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Vladimir Putin,2016 Elections,2016,Europe,Jeb Bush,NATO,Estonia,Russia", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He's flying back to Miami ahead of Monday's campaign launch.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c7f\"", "article_summary": "Jeb Bush speaks to journalists at the e-Estonia Showroom during his visit in Tallinn, Estonia.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the right strategy;
