Ted Cruz isn\u2019t happy with the Supreme Court. Reacting to the King v. Burwell decision handed down Thursday, the Republican senator from Texas and presidential candidate called the healthcare ruling \u201cjudicial activism\u201d and agreed with Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s dissent that the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, should be renamed \"SCOTUScare.\"\n\n\u201cAs Justice Scalia rightfully put it: Words no longer have meaning,\u201d Cruz, a lawyer who has litigated before the Supreme Court and started his career as a law clerk for former Chief Justice William Rehnquist, protested from the Senate floor. \u201cToday\u2019s decision in King vs. Burwell is judicial activism, plain and simple.\u201d Cruz praised Rehnquist's court, a sentiment he obviously does not feel for the court of Chief Justice John Roberts, whom Cruz recruited to the legal team of President George W. Bush in 2000 before Roberts was a justice on the court.\n\nCruz said that the two landmark decisions -- the first coming in 2012 -- to support the Affordable Care Act were acts of magic on the part of the Supreme Court justices. \u201cThe first time the court ignored federal law and magically transformed a statutory penalty into a tax. Today, these robed Houdinis have transmogrified a federal exchange into an exchange, quote \u2018established by the state.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe decision handed down Thursday was a decisive 6-3 ruling. It means that federal subsidies are allowed under the ACA no matter if they are distributed through state-established healthcare exchanges or through the federal exchange at Healthcare.gov. Had the Supreme Court voted the other way, many thought that it could have spelled the end for the healthcare law, as the subsidies help lower-income families making less than $50,000 afford healthcare. Should those subsidies have been taken away, it was expected that those families would drop their plans en masse, cutting a significant pool from the exchanges and raising premiums.\n\nThe last major Supreme Court ruling on the ACA came in 2012 when the court ruled 5-4 that individuals could be required to enroll in healthcare or face a fine for abstaining.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nCruz has long been a vocal opponent of Obamacare. In 2013, he led a charge that shut down the federal government and made a national name for himself in the days before the shutdown with a 21-hour filibuster in protest of the healthcare law, during which he read Dr. Seuss\u2019 \"Green Eggs and Ham.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone was moping Thursday morning. During his victory lap, U.S. President Barack Obama recognized that the ACA hadn\u2019t been a complete success, but that it had been doing its job.\n\n\u201cThis was a good day for America,\u201d Obama said. \"Let\u2019s get back to work.\u201d And there\u2019s much to do, he said, like improving preventive care, the quality of hospital visits and lowering healthcare costs. \u201cWith this case behind us, let\u2019s be clear: We\u2019ve still got work to do to make healthcare in America even better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ted cruz, rehnquist, health care, obamacare, scotuscare, john roberts, scalia, justice antonin scalia, chief justice rehnquist, obama, 2012, affordable care act, aca, robed houdinis, magic, words have no meaning,ted cruz, rehnquist, healthcare, obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Sen.
