The Baltimore Ravens, one of Pittsburgh\u2019s biggest rivals, signed on to help boost enrollment in Maryland\u2019s exchanges in early September.\n\nThe Obama administration has made partnering with sports leagues and teams to promote the law a priority, given their ability to reach large populations and the demographics that will benefit most from the law and that are crucial to Obamacare\u2019s ultimate success. When Maryland Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown announced the Ravens\u2019 partnership with the administration, he cited research showing that 71 percent of Maryland\u2019s uninsured population had watched, attended, or listened to a Ravens game in the past year. Given the Steelers\u2019 fan base in both Pennsylvania and beyond, similar or even higher numbers from its fans wouldn\u2019t be shocking.\n\nThose partnerships also make sense for the administration because Obamacare\u2019s enrollment fight isn\u2019t a short one: Americans have six months to enroll in the law\u2019s health care exchanges, so stringing out these events throughout football and basketball seasons \u2014 the White House also wants to partner with NBA teams \u2014 gives it a chance to keep those enrollment opportunities in the news.\n\nMore significant, though, is that Thursday\u2019s event will include former Steelers players, giving Sebelius and the administration a chance to put a face on Obamacare\u2019s benefits. Though it\u2019s unclear from the release which players will attend, there\u2019s a possibility some of them could benefit from the law themselves. Because the NFL\u2019s health coverage for former players expires after five years for most eligible recipients, and due to high uninsured rates for former athletes because of pre-existing conditions, Obamacare could give many former NFL players a chance to access insurance that will cover the myriad problems that result from years of playing football. Showing fans that some of their heroes are benefiting from this law can only help Obamacare\u2019s chances of reaching the people \u2014 and Steeler fans \u2014 who need it most.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Steelers will help promote enrollment in Obamacare's health care exchanges.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Steelers will help promote enrollment in Obamacare's health care exchanges.", "title": "Pittsburgh Steelers Owner, Former Players To Help Promote Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/sports/2013/10/09/2743711/pittsburgh-steelers-owner-former-players-to-help-promote-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/obamasteelersap.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Steelers will help promote enrollment in Obamacare's health care exchanges.", "title": "Pittsburgh Steelers Owner, Former Players To Help Promote Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/obamasteelersap-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Travis_Waldron", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-sports", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/obamasteelersap.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/obamasteelersap.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-09T11:07:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2fa\"", "article_summary": "Sports Pittsburgh Steelers Owner, Former Players To Help Promote Obamacare CREDIT: AP President Obama with Steelers president Art Rooney and chairman Dan Rooney (right).\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers are set to become the second National Football League team to help promote the Affordable Care Act when chairman Dan Rooney and former Steelers players join administration officials at a Heinz Field event Thursday.\nThe Steelers will be the second NFL team to promote the law since the NFL decided not to partner with the Obama administration.\nMore significant, though, is that Thursday\u2019s event will include former Steelers players, giving Sebelius and the administration a chance to put a face on Obamacare\u2019s benefits.\nShowing fans that some of their heroes are benefiting from this law can only help Obamacare\u2019s chances of reaching the people \u2014 and Steeler fans \u2014 who need it most."}
