A man is in jail after attacking another man with a machete Saturday evening in downtown Wichita.

Police said a witness called 911 at about 5 p.m. after seeing a 57-year-old man go after the victim with the knife. It happened in the 700 block of N Broadway.

Police said multiple witnesses reported seeing the attack. Witnesses told officers the attack was unprovoked.

The suspect was later found at The Lord's Diner -- about two blocks south of the incident -- with the machete still in his possession. He was booked into Sedgwick Co. Jail for aggravated assault.

Police said the nature of the two men's relationship is unclear.

The victim was not hurt.
