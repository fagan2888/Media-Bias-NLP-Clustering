He wonders why the producers of Old School, a black comedy miniseries which starts this week on ABC1, typecast him as the criminal and Sam Neill as the detective.\n\n\u201cThey never came to me and said \u2018Which one do you want to play?\u2019\u201d he reflects. \u201cThey just said \u2018We\u2019d like you to play Lenny\u2019 and they said to Sam \u2018We\u2019d like you to play Ted\u2019. Why was it obvious to them that I should be the crim? I could have played the cop. Probably wouldn\u2019t have been anywhere near as good as Sam, but I could have played the cop.\u201d\n\nTaylor is now a three-time loser, having been in axe victims Charlie's Angels and 666 Park Avenue\n\nThe explanation may be that one of the writer/directors of Old School is Gregor Jordan, Australia\u2019s answer to Quentin Tarantino. Jordan was the writer/director of one of Brown\u2019s great triumphs, the 1999 black comedy Two Hands. In that film Brown played a crime boss called Pando. How is Pando different from Lenny?\n\nTed and Lenny in Old School\n\n\u201cPando was down deep a very nasty man,\u201d says Brown. \u201cLenny\u2019s a bit of a loser. Pando was never a loser until he got his brains blown out. Pando was power-hungry. Lenny\u2019s far more vulnerable. Lenny\u2019s just trying to work out where\u2019s a safe he can get some money out of, and why he\u2019s having such trouble with women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI caught up with Brown as he came out of filming a scene for a US blockbuster called Gods of Egypt on the sound stages at Sydney\u2019s Fox Studios. He revealed that there was no question of typecasting there: \u201cI play King Osiris, the God of Nature, which is appropriate. We speak with English accents, not American and not Australian. What\u2019s lovely is that Geoffrey Rush plays my father. So I\u2019m a youngster.\u201d\n\nAge seems to be an issue with Brown, who is 66. Asked if he had seen the final form of Old School, he said: \u201cI watched the first couple of episodes with my son. He\u2019s 21. Half way through, he said \u2018I love this, I love the characters, I love seeing Sydney\u2019. He asked me what I thought. I said \u2018I think I\u2019ve never looked so old in my life. I\u2019m very confronted, and I can\u2019t even get involved in the story. Lenny is such a loser and I\u2019m so old.\u2019\n\nRachael Taylor ... axed\n\n\u201cThen I watched it again and I went \u2018Oh, that\u2019s quite clever, and I see the relationships are rather good relationships, and so people will probably warm to it.\u2019\u201d\n\nBrown admits he should have learned long ago not to be disturbed by first impressions of his own work. He was terribly embarrassed by one of his earliest films, Breaker Morant, in 1980.\n\n\u201cI saw a rough cut and I thought \u2018Oh my god, I\u2019ll never get another job in my life. I should never wear a moustache, why\u2019d I let Bruce (Beresford) talk me into that?\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to go and see the movie. Then it came out and everybody said \u2018Gees I love your character\u2019. People round the world started asking me to act. So I went \u2018Ah f---, I must be alright.\u201d\n\nKieren Perkins, banker Photo: Getty Images\n\nFor Brown, work choices these days are mostly about strong characters and interesting relationships, and modern television is more likely to offer them than movies (though he doesn\u2019t mind the occasional Osiris, just for fun). He\u2019d jump at the chance to do another series of Old School.\n\nIf that happens, it will be because of the relaxed way the two mates Brown and Neill interact, even when punching and insulting each other. But they have different approaches to their acting, Brown revealed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not playing a friendship, we\u2019re just playing the script, but there is some level of comfort there.\n\n\u201cWe do have different ways of approaching a script, that\u2019s for sure. Sam\u2019s always on my back about \u2018Come on, lets go over our lines\u2019. I really like to know my lines, don\u2019t get me wrong, and I put in time to learn them, but he never thinks I do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got discipline but I don\u2019t show it. So he thinks I don\u2019t know, and when we get on the set, I\u2019ve got it on the first take, and he can\u2019t work it out. That\u2019s just a little game I play with him.\u201d\n\nOld School is on ABC1 at 8.30pm Friday\n\n\n\nAxe and it will be given\n\nLast month this column interviewed Marg Helgenberger, one of the stars of Seven\u2019s new sci-fi series Intelligence. At the time, she was waiting to hear if the show would be renewed for the US 2014-2015 season. That news has now arrived, and it\u2019s bad. Intelligence has been cancelled after 13 episodes. The ratings here have followed the same trajectory as in the US -- big at the start but halving after just three weeks.\n\nThree other US shows which received a visit from the axeman last week have not even started here yet: Nine\u2019s sitcom Friends With Better Lives, GO\u2019s sci fi drama Almost Human and Ten\u2019s thriller Crisis, starring our own Rachael Taylor (who is now a three-time loser, having been in axe victims Charlie's Angels and 666 Park Avenue). They are joined in the newly-junked bin by The Crazy Ones (shown here on Foxtel); Suburgatory (GO!); The Carrie Diaries (Foxtel); and Community (SBS2).\n\n\n\nBut another Aussie got good news last week \u2013 Simon Baker\u2019s series The Mentalist, shown here on Nine, has been renewed for another season (along with Seven\u2019s Resurrection and Agents of SHIELD, Nine\u2019s Mom and Arrow, and Ten\u2019s New Girl and Elementary).\n\nThe Mentalist\u2019s showrunner, Bruno Heller, has been commissioned to run a second series, Gotham, an origin story about the teenage Batman, Catwoman and Penguin. Hopefully he\u2019ll offer the suddenly unemployed Rachael Taylor a job.\n\nRight and wrong movers\n\nThe ABC\u2019s most successful documentary series is Australian Story, which usually takes half an hour to cover the life of a special person. Recently the life of Kerry Packer proved to be too big for 30 minutes, and was shown over two weeks. Now the swimmer Kieren Perkins is getting the same VIP treatment, in a two-parter the ABC is calling All The Right Moves.\n\nPerkins is an Olympic gold medalist who has managed the transition from sporting glory to banking obscurity while mostly staying out of the gossip columns (apart from when his marriage broke up in 2012). So the extended time is a bit puzzling \u2013 until you learn that the show is introduced by another golden boy, Grant Hackett. The tabloids were all over Hackett earlier this year when he went to an addiction treatment centre in the US after being photographed in a hotel lobby wearing a towel and searching for his four year old son.\n\nThe ABC may be hoping some viewers will watch on the expectation that Hackett will reveal a little of his own complex story in comparing his career with that of his one time rival.\n\nAustralian Story is on ABC1 at 8pm this Monday and next\n\nThe Tribal Mind column, by David Dale, appears in a printed form every Sunday in The Sun-Herald and The Sunday Age and also as a director's cut on this website, where it welcomes your comments.\n\nDavid Dale teaches communications at UTS, Sydney.
