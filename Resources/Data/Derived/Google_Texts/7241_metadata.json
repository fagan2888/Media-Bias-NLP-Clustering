I\u2019ve followed a lot of these coaches for a long time, followed the programs, so I know they\u2019re all excellent coaches, great programs, and, arguably, it\u2019s been the best league in the country the last four or five years.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s tough for the Terrapins to argue with the preseason poll that slotted them as the preseason pick to finish 10th in the conference. Maryland went 17-15 overall and 9-9 in conference play last season in its ACC finale and subsequently had five players transfer to other schools over the summer.\n\nBut a new season means a fresh start, and the change of scenery adds an additional layer of unknowns, from scouting to logistics. Turgeon pointed out Thursday that while the uniforms and venues have changed, lines can still be drawn between styles of play, and that\u2019s what matters on the court.\n\n\u201cInstead of playing Virginia, you might be playing Wisconsin, instead of playing Clemson, you might be playing Purdue, and I can go on and on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s teams we played in last year\u2019s league that play the same way as teams in the Big Ten. There\u2019s going to be finesse teams, there\u2019s going to be real physical teams, there\u2019s going to be fast teams, there\u2019s going to be slow teams. You\u2019ve just got to figure out who they are and adjust and play against those teams.\u201d\n\nThe same, of course, goes for the Terrapins\u2019 new set of conference opponents. But considering they only have to adjust to two new teams in Maryland and Rutgers, they\u2019re more focused on the off-court ramifications.\n\nWisconsin coach Bo Ryan said expansion \u201ccan only help\u201d the league and will benefit the Midwestern teams when it comes time to recruit. They\u2019ll have an easier time making pitches to high school players along the Eastern seaboard with those kids and their families knowing games will be easier to see on television and a trip or two close to home to play at Maryland or Rutgers awaits. The same principle applies to the Terrapins and Scarlet Knights mining talent in the Midwest, he noted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s opened up more recruiting areas for the teams that have been added and for the teams that have already been in existence in the Big Ten,\u201d Ryan told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve expanded our horizons, and I think it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nThough it\u2019s hardly a natural fit geographically, Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany told reporters Thursday that he believes the additions make sense.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Rutgers and Maryland, the kind of institutions they are, they fit,\u201d Delany said. \u201cWe talk the same language. It\u2019s high graduation, it\u2019s great research, it\u2019s comprehensive education.\n\n\u201cI believe that in all sports but in particular in football and basketball, because of the great students in that corridor, because of the great high schools in that corridor, we\u2019re going to get our fair share of athletes. They\u2019re going to get them, our [other] schools are going to get them.\u201d\n\nThe flip side, though, is tougher and more expensive travel for all sports \u2014 particularly those that don\u2019t bring in revenue like football and men\u2019s basketball \u2014 and an unwieldy scheduling model that was a topic of discussion in many coaches\u2019 interview sessions Thursday.\n\nNow that the league has swollen to 14 schools, there\u2019s no logical way to assemble an 18-game conference schedule for basketball. That has led to a rotation system that will keep some longtime rivals from more frequent visits than they\u2019d like, but that\u2019s the way the sport has trended nationally as conferences continue to grow.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t your dad\u2019s Big Ten anymore,\u201d Purdue coach Matt Painter said. \u201cIt\u2019s different. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new season means a fresh start, and the change of scenery adds an additional layer of unknowns, from scouting to logistics.
