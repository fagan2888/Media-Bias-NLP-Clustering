The president and his advisors have criticized the Russian effort there, which has been more focused on propping up the Assad regime than on fighting the terror group ISIS, despite claims to the contrary from the Kremlin. The Russian effort, they said, was doomed to fail.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s New Missiles Dial Up the Tension with Turkey\n\nObama on Tuesday seemed to suggest that an end might be coming sooner than expected. According to wire service reports, he told reporters, \u201cI think it is possible over the next several months that we see \u2026 a recognition [in Moscow] that it's time to bring the civil war in Syria to a close.\u201d\n\nHe said that memories of Russia\u2019s ill-fated war in Afghanistan in the 1980s are still painful among the Russian people.\n\n\u201cI think Putin understands that \u2014 with Afghanistan fresh in the memory for him \u2014 to simply get bogged down in an inconclusive and paralyzing civil conflict is not the outcome that he\u2019s looking for,\u201d Obama said.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t exactly square with a report from Fox News Tuesday that quotes unnamed Pentagon officials confirming that rather than looking to draw down its presence in Syria, the Kremlin appears to by bulking up. Lucas Tomlinson said that Russia has begun operating helicopters out of a second air base in Shayrat, Syria and is believed to be preparing to use it for fixed wing aircraft. The network also reported that Russia appears to be increasing the number of forward operating bases it uses to mount helicopter attacks on the rebels fighting Assad.\n\nRelated: Obama Paid a High Price to Get Turkey to Fight ISIS\n\nTomlinson quotes one unidentified official saying that the move can\u2019t be seen as defensive or otherwise explained away. \u201cThis is an expansion,\u201d he said.\n\nIn response to the downing of one of its bombers by Turkish fighter jets last week, Russia has also been moving more anti-aircraft missile batteries into Syria. Yesterday, the Kremlin announced that some Russian fighter-bombers were now being outfitted with air-to-air missiles. This is unquestionably a message to Turkey, because neither ISIS nor the Syrian rebels have the ability to challenge Russian planes in the air.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On the same day that President Obama told reporters at the global climate change summit in Paris that he expects Russia to end its involvement in Syria in the near term, officials at the Pentagon are reportedly telling Fox News that Russia is close to opening another airbase in the war-torn country.", "title": "Obama Says Russia Wants Out of Syria.
