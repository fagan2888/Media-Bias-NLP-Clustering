Najari estimated that the increase translated to roughly 125,000 more vasectomies each year.\n\nThe researchers have yet to publish their findings in a medical journal, but they argue that their findings highlight the economy\u2019s impact on family planning.\n\nAccording to economists, the Great Recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009.\n\nTo test their hunch, Goldstein, Najari and Dr. Peter Schlegel consulted the National Survey for Family Growth, which interviewed more than 9,000 single and married men, ages 18 to 44, from 2006 to 2010.\n\nAmong other things, they found that 5.8% of the surveyed men had undergone vasectomies before the recession. The rate jumped to 7.5% after the downturn \u2014 a 35% increase.\n\nThey also found that the men were more likely to report a lack of full-time work and insurance in the wake of the recession, as well as a drop in annual income.\n\nNajari said the urologists inferred that men were seeking vasectomies on the basis of economics.\n\n\"It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a specific survey question that asks, 'Did you get a vasectomy because you were concerned about your financial status?'\" Najari said.\n\nFellow urologists said they believed economics certainly played a role, but noted that there were probably other reasons for the increase.\n\nDr. Mary Katherine Samplaski, an associate professor of urology at Keck Medicine of USC, who did not participate in the study but listened to the presentation, said growing acceptance of the procedure also played a role.\n\n\"There\u2019s some cultures that believe when you have a vasectomy, it takes away some sexual function or virility,\" Samplaski said. \"There\u2019s no truth to that, but there\u2019s still a fear.... As more men talk to other men about having the procedure, they become more educated.\"\n\nTraditionally, men who seek vasectomies have higher incomes, so the researchers' argument is somewhat counterintuitive. The procedure, which involves cutting or blocking the vas deferens \u2014 the duct that carries sperm from the testes to the urethra \u2014 costs an average of $750, the urologists said.\n\nNajari and his colleagues did not investigate the economy\u2019s effect on other forms of birth control. However, the National Center for Health Statistics reported last year that the pregnancy rate for women in 2009 was the lowest in 12 years, or 102.1 births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44.\n\nWhile the doctors\u2019 conclusions appeared to confirm the anecdotes of urologists, not everyone was convinced of the connection.\n\nGladys Martinez, a statistician at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who did not participate in the study, said the question the urologists set out to answer was a complicated one.\n\n\"The factors that go into a man\u2019s decision to have a vasectomy are many and complex,\" Martinez wrote in an email message. \"When analyzing a research question there are a set of assumptions that are made, and your results are as good as your assumptions.\"\n\nNajari said the findings had implications for national health policy. He noted that the Affordable Care Act covered birth control for women without a co-pay, while procedures for men involved an out-of pocket expense.\n\nHe said this could make it even more likely that the burden of contraception would be further weighted toward women.\n\n\"What we\u2019re seeing is that family planning is sensitive to financial pressures,\" Najari said.\n\nmonte.morin@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @montemorin\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Economic worries may have spurred rise in vasectomies since recession", "date": "2014-10-23", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "It started with an offhand comment from a urologist\u2019s secretary: More men than usual were calling to discuss sterilization or to schedule a vasectomy.", "title": "Economic worries may have spurred rise in vasectomies since recession", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-na-recession-vasectomy-20141023-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5449ec80/turbine/la-na-recession-vasectomy-20141023", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp10.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "vasectomy, recession, birth control, family planning", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81763497", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "vasectomy, recession, birth control, family planning", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "It started with an offhand comment from a urologist\u2019s secretary: More men than usual were calling to discuss sterilization or to schedule a vasectomy.
