Jay Nixon confident in St. Louis as \u2018NFL city\u2019\n\nST. JOSEPH, Mo. (AP) \u2013 Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon says he is confident in St. Louis as an NFL city, even if Rams owner Stan Kroenke succeeds in moving his franchise back to Los Angeles.\n\nAfter visiting Chiefs practice Wednesday, Nixon was asked about the Rams. NFL owners had met in suburban Chicago a day earlier and discussed the relocation of at least one team to the West Coast, and the Chargers and Raiders joined the Rams in presenting proposals.\n\nNixon said regardless of what happens, the city and state feel good about the future of the NFL in St. Louis. The proposal for a new, $998 million open-air stadium to be built along the riverfront was announced in January.\n\nSeat licenses, state tax credits and other incentives would help pay for it. About half the money would come from the team owner and an NFL loan program.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nBy DAVE SKRETTA, AP Sports Writer", "article_metadata": {"description": "ST.
