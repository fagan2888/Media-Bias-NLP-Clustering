Kristie Canegallo, adviser to White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, has been named White House deputy chief of staff and will oversee the overall implementation of the Affordable Care Act and supervise the management of healthcare.gov, the federal health insurance marketplace website, FCW reported Monday.

Adam Mazmanian writes Canegallo will also oversee related federal government technology acquisitions.

“Given our experience with HealthCare.gov, we have determined we need more senior-level focus on implementation and execution,” said McDonough.

Canegallo previously served as the National Security Council‘s defense policy and strategy director prior to her role as McDonough’s senior adviser, FCW reports.
