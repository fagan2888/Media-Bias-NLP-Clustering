The once-a-week drawing grows into a plethora of drawings and scratch-off games.\n\n1981: U.S. Supreme Court affirms Seminole Tribe\u2019s right to high-stakes bingo. Tampa bingo hall opens, now the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Money is addictive, and a cool $200 million or so a year is usually impossible to resist.\n\nBut that\u2019s what your state lawmakers could be passing up if they choose to expand gambling in Florida.\n\nThe state\u2019s deal with the Seminole Tribe of Florida guarantees it a minimum $1 billion cut of revenue from the tribe\u2019s gambling income over five years. The tribe operates Tampa\u2019s Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino and other gambling facilities across the state.\n\nBut the agreement, known as the Seminole Compact, also guarantees the Seminoles exclusive rights to offer Las Vegas-style gambling outside Miami-Dade and Broward counties. If they lose that exclusivity through expanded gambling, the Seminoles don\u2019t have to pay another dime.\n\nTheir 2013-14 payment alone is estimated at $233 million, with $226 million going to the state and $7 million to local governments.\n\nWith a new study suggesting a minor economic lift overall from more gambling in Florida, lawmakers may have to think hard before pulling the trigger on new gambling.\n\nThe study and comments from upcoming public workshops are supposed to be blueprints for a big gambling bill during the 2014 legislative session, including whether to allow Las Vegas-style destination casino-resorts.\n\nLast year, a bill died in the Legislature that would have permitted the construction of three destination hotel-casinos in South Florida.\n\nThe Senate gaming committee is scheduled to meet Monday to discuss a working draft of the gambling report, authored by New Jersey-based consultant Spectrum Gaming Group. The final version is due Nov. 1. The public workshop closest to Tampa is 3 p.m. Oct. 30 at the George Jenkins High School auditorium in Lakeland.\n\n***\n\nSpectrum suggests \u201cthat the introduction of casinos, whether standalone destination resorts, or addition of slot machines at existing parimutuels, will lead to modest economic benefits,\u201d its report said.\n\nThe part of the compact that gives the Seminoles the right to offer certain card games, such as blackjack, expires in 2015 unless reauthorized. They do not want to let it go and are willing to spend big to keep it, recently contributing $500,000 to Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s re-election, for example.\n\n\u201cThe Seminole Tribe worked for two decades to secure a gaming compact with the state of Florida that provided a more stable future for the Tribe and its members and allowed for significant sharing of gaming revenue with the state,\u201d tribal spokesman Gary Bitner said. \u201cThe tribe wants to maintain that steady, stable course through 2015 and beyond.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Bill Galvano, a Bradenton Republican who represents parts of Hillsborough County, sits on the gaming committee and worked on the compact when he served in the House.\n\n\u201cThese issues are so complex and there are so many competing interests; it\u2019s not something you can rush,\u201d Galvano said. \u201cThe idea is to really understand the gaming industries within the state of Florida and their potentials. Also, the gaming laws are not uniform; they\u2019ve been put together piecemeal.\u201d\n\nThe problem with cleaning up the regulations is that any changes could run afoul of the compact.\n\n\u201cA change to the compact is not something that can be accomplished overnight,\u201d Galvano said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a negotiation between two sovereigns \u2026 and (it) has to have federal approval.\u201d\n\nBut plenty of interests beyond this tight group want a piece of the action.\n\nCampaign contributions in Florida from gambling concerns totaled more than $2.8 million for the 2012 election cycle, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics. Hartman and Tyner Inc., which runs Mardi Gras Casino on Broward County\u2019s Hollywood Beach, gave $67,400 alone.\n\n***\n\nDan Adkins, Hartman and Tyner\u2019s chief operating officer, said he doesn\u2019t envy lawmakers. His business could benefit by adding games besides the slots, poker and dog racing it now offers, but he acknowledges the allure of the Seminoles\u2019 easy money.\n\n\u201cIf I were in the Legislature, that\u2019s a tough one,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cCash on the table is hard to turn away from.\u201d\n\nThe money train first tried to get rolling in 2007. The Seminole Tribe and then-Gov. Charlie Crist inked a deal that was later challenged by the House of Representatives on separation-of-powers grounds and ultimately invalidated by the state Supreme Court.\n\nCrist and the Seminoles signed a revised agreement in 2010, bumping up the state\u2019s guaranteed share. The compact allows slots and card games, but prohibits roulette or craps.\n\nThe federal law governing Indian gambling defines three classes of play: The first is \u201csocial games solely for prizes of minimal value;\u201d the second is made up of bingo and some card games; the third includes \u201cbanked\u201d card games, such as baccarat and blackjack with house dealers, as well as slot machines and virtually everything else.\n\n\u201cClass III,\u201d as insiders call it, is where the money is.\n\n\u201cWhy should we have a disadvantage in product with what the tribe has?\u201d Adkins said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a competitive market; let us compete.\u201d\n\nAdkins added that though he thinks any new gambling should be approved by voters on a county-by-county basis, he\u2019d be \u201cready in a heartbeat\u201d for full-blown Vegas-style play.\n\n\u201cGive me a level playing field and I\u2019ll give you a business plan,\u201d he said.\n\nPeter Berube, Tampa Bay Downs\u2019 general manager, would be happy with slot machines to boost his thoroughbred track\u2019s purses \u2014 the money paid out to the owners of horses.\n\nThe compact allows for slots only at other pari\u00admu\u00adtuels \u2014 dog and horse tracks \u2014 in Broward and Miami-Dade counties.\n\n***\n\nSlots revenue would help him attract better horses from across the country \u2014 and presumably would stoke more wagers. Only about 20 percent of horses racing at Tampa Bay Downs come from within Florida, he said.\n\n\u201cMoney talks,\u201d Berube said. The Florida \u201csunshine is good, but at the end of the day, money is what the drives the horsemen on where they decide to race.\u201d\n\nEven though Tampa Bay Downs already brings a lot of economic muscle to the area, he added, \u201cwe\u2019d just like the opportunity to offer Class III gaming and determine what the makeup of that would be.\u201d\n\nBerube figures that income from slots could increase his purses from $175,000 to $275,000 over the track\u2019s main season from Dec. 4 to May 4.\n\nMeantime, lawmakers are mindful that whatever they do is likely to fuel a lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThe competition among gaming entities, historically, has risen to the level of legal challenges and regulatory challenges, and that\u2019s something we also have to be mindful of as we navigate this issue,\u201d Galvano said.\n\nAnd the Seminoles have too much to potentially lose.\n\nThe Hard Rock in Tampa has undergone multiple expansions over the past few years, Bitner said, with the latest being \u201ca new high-limit area of the casino and another created especially for our Asian guests.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is now the fourth- largest casino in the United States, based on the number of gaming positions (seats at table games and slot machines), and the sixth-largest in the world,\u201d Bitner said. \u201cExecutives at Seminole Gaming are always considering opportunities to expand the Tribe\u2019s Tampa casino complex.\u201d\n\nSo the likelihood of putting together a plan and having it universally accepted isn\u2019t high, Galvano said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that there\u2019s a quick and easy resolution,\u201d he said.\n\njrosica@tampatrib.com\n\n(850) 765-0807\n\nTwitter: @jlrosicaTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 05 Oct 2013 01:00:00 -0400", "Description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 Money is addictive, and a cool $200 million or so a year is usually impossible to resist.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 Money is addictive, and a cool $200 million or so a year is usually impossible to resist.", "title": "State eyes gambling expansion gingerly, fears losing Seminole money", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/business/state-eyes-gambling-expansion-gingerly-fears-losing-seminole-money-20131005/", "image": {"width": 3968, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131005/ARTICLE/131009550/AR/0/AR-131009550.jpg", "height": 2832}, "updated_time": "2013-10-05T00:12:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 Money is addictive, and a cool $200 million or so a year is usually impossible to resist.", "title": "State eyes gambling expansion gingerly, fears losing Seminole money", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131005/ARTICLE/131009550/AR/0/AR-131009550.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-10-05T01:00:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-10-05T00:12:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc3c\"", "article_summary": "The tribe operates Tampa\u2019s Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino and other gambling facilities across the state.\nThe state\u2019s deal with the Seminole Tribe of Florida guarantees it a minimum $1 billion cut of revenue from the tribe\u2019s gambling income over five years.\nBut the agreement, known as the Seminole Compact, also guarantees the Seminoles exclusive rights to offer Las Vegas-style gambling outside Miami-Dade and Broward counties.\nBut that\u2019s what your state lawmakers could be passing up if they choose to expand gambling in Florida.\nThe Seminole Tribe and then-Gov."}
