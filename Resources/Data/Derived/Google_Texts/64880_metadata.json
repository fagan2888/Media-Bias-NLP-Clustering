To qualify for the dividend, one must have been a resident of the state for the preceding calendar year.\n\nThe state is expected to dismiss charges against other members of the family who had faced charges in the case.\n\nIn November, Superior Court Judge Philip Pallenberg rejected plea agreements from Billy and Joshua Brown because they called for suspended jail sentences. Pallenberg said he thought there should be some jail time involved.\n\nThe terms outlined during Monday\u2019s hearing were in line with those in the rejected agreements, except they allowed for Pallenberg to impose jail time. He sentenced each man to 180 days in jail, with 150 days suspended.\n\nThe sentences also include community service, probation and fines, and neither man will be eligible for dividends in the future.\n\nRestitution paid or expected to be paid by members of the family totals nearly $21,000, according to the Department of Law. Prosecuting attorney Lisa Kelley said the state is being made whole by getting the restitution.\n\nBilly Brown\u2019s attorney, James McGowan, asked the judge to take Brown\u2019s health into account, saying Brown suffers from a seizure disorder, among other things. He said there was no need to incarcerate Brown, but the judge wasn\u2019t swayed.\n\nPallenberg said the sentencing goal of deterrence generally requires, in his view, jail time in dividend fraud cases.\n\nIn brief comments, Billy Brown apologized. Joshua Brown also made comments, though they were difficult to hear. The Brown family appeared telephonically.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two members of the family featured on the reality TV show \"Alaskan Bush People\" were sentenced Monday to 30 days in jail after they were accused of applying for checks from Alaska's oil wealth fund even though they weren't entitled.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/11/2-members-of-alaskan-bush-people-family-sentenced-/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Two members of the family featured on the reality TV show \u201cAlaskan Bush People\u201d were sentenced Monday to 30 days in jail after they were accused of applying for checks from Alaska\u2019s oil wealth fund even though they weren\u2019t entitled.", "title": "2 members of \u2018Alaskan Bush People\u2019 family sentenced to jail"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Two members of the family featured on the reality TV show \"Alaskan Bush People\" were sentenced Monday to 30 days in jail after they were accused of applying for checks from Alaska's oil wealth fund ev", "card": "summary", "title": "2 members of \u2018Alaskan Bush People\u2019 family sentenced to jai"}, "Author": "BECKY BOHRER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The Brown family appeared telephonically.\nThe state is expected to dismiss charges against other members of the family who had faced charges in the case.\nIn November, Superior Court Judge Philip Pallenberg rejected plea agreements from Billy and Joshua Brown because they called for suspended jail sentences.\nJoshua Brown also made comments, though they were difficult to hear.\nHe sentenced each man to 180 days in jail, with 150 days suspended."}
