The announcement was made January 8 at the winter meeting of the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The combined efforts are part of the Obama administration plan to end veteran homelessness.\n\n\u201cThis groundbreaking new effort is going to help 500 military heroes get back on their feet and help them move into secure housing and connect them to ongoing clinical services in case management,\u201d said HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro during a national press call following the announcement.\n\n\u201cFulfilling a commitment to end homelessness is a national responsibility,\u201d Castro said. \u201cIt\u2019s also in our national interest. An America that is more inclusive and honors the dignity of all citizens is a nation that is stronger and more secure. Today, by extending the benefits of HUD-VASH to more Native American veterans, we\u2019re building a more inclusive nation.\u201d\n\nCastro acknowledged the high level of contribution of both male and female Native veterans, and that \u201cexpanding HUD-VASH to Native communities will help our nation honor the service and the sacrifice of these brave Americans,\u201d he said.\n\nCastro also said that HUD has joined with seven other federal agencies \u201cto lay out a comprehensive plan to end homelessness among American Indians and Alaska Natives. It\u2019s the first time the federal government has ever made a focused effort to address homelessness for tribal communities.\u201d\n\nVA Secretary Robert McDonald was also part of the national press call, where he spoke of the ongoing collaboration that VA has held with both HUD and with the Department of Labor. According to McDonald, \u201chomelessness is much more than just needing an apartment or a house,\u201d he said, with the HUD-VASH vouchers offering a chance for creating stability to get what he referred to as \u201cwrap-around\u201d services. McDonald specifically mentioned these as being health care, substance abuse treatment, mental health care, GI bill funding, disability services and counseling.\n\nThe funding will be for this upcoming fiscal year, according to Castro. However, the funding will not be divided evenly among the tribes. Instead, the funding will vary \u201cdepending on the need,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one set amount that is being given to each tribe. It\u2019s based on the number of homeless veterans.\u201d Initially, 30 tribes were selected to participate.\n\nWhile Castro offered HUD commitment for the continuation of the program in following years, he said that it would depend on \u201ccongressional appropriation.\u201d Upon continuation, funding would come \u201cmore swiftly\u201d to get to Native veterans in following fiscal years.\n\nEligibility for HUD-VASH would be determined by the verification of veteran status by the VA. Once funds are disbursed to tribes, it would then be up to each tribal government to determine the implementation of the funds.\n\nMcDonald said that HUD-VASH is, ultimately, a way to get veterans on an initial path to services. He said that it is not meant to be shelter or transition housing. Instead, HUD-VASH is meant to be a two-to-three year residence in which the wrap-around services can begin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Departments of Housing and Urban Development and the Veterans Affairs announced nearly $6 million in HUD-VASH vouchers for 26 tribal governments.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/01/09/va-and-hud-fulfilling-commitment-end-native-veteran-homelessness-163018", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/homeless_vet_-_istock.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "VA and HUD \u2018Fulfilling a Commitment\u2019 to End Native Veteran Homelessness"}, "abstract": "The Departments of Housing and Urban Development and the Veterans Affairs announced nearly $6 million in HUD-VASH vouchers for 26 tribal governments.", "dc": {"title": "VA and HUD \u2018Fulfilling a Commitment\u2019 to End Native Veteran Homelessness"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/01/09/va-and-hud-fulfilling-commitment-end-native-veteran-homelessness-163018", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Veterans\u2019 Affairs, Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, Department of Veterans Affairs, HUD-VASH, Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes, Veteran Homelessness, Native Veteran Homelessness, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Robert McDonald, Native American Veteran Homelessness, American Indian Veteran Homelessness, Brian Daffron", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2016-01-09T09:00-05:00", "dcterms.title": "VA and HUD \u2018Fulfilling a Commitment\u2019 to End Native Veteran Homelessness"}, "article_summary": "\u201cFulfilling a commitment to end homelessness is a national responsibility,\u201d Castro said.\nThe combined efforts are part of the Obama administration plan to end veteran homelessness.\nCastro also said that HUD has joined with seven other federal agencies \u201cto lay out a comprehensive plan to end homelessness among American Indians and Alaska Natives.\nMcDonald specifically mentioned these as being health care, substance abuse treatment, mental health care, GI bill funding, disability services and counseling.\nThe Departments of Housing and Urban Development and the Veterans Affairs announced an award of nearly $6 million in HUD-VASH (the HUD and VA supported housing program) vouchers for 26 tribal governments."}
