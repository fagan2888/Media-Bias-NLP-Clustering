Washington, D.C. — Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden released to following statement after former CAP Senior Fellow Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-PA) was confirmed to be undersecretary of the U.S. Army today:

Today, the Army and the nation are lucky to have former Rep. Patrick Murphy confirmed as undersecretary of the U.S. Army. When he was a member of Congress, CAP was proud to work with Rep. Murphy on issues he championed, such as the Affordable Care Act, and as he led the repeal of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell. As a Senior Fellow, Murphy contributed greatly to our work by leading on issues that affect 21st-century fighters, and he will no doubt do the same for the Army. Murphy served the country twice, first in the Army and later as the first Iraq War veteran to serve in Congress, and we know he will bring the same service to the Army once again.
