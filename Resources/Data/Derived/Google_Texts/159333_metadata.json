Using color-coded software on his computer, he monitors weather, atmosphere, humidity and wind speed.\n\n\u201cIn the old days you would look at a vine and say, \u2018Yeah, it looks like it needs water,\u2019 and 60 percent of the time those decisions were probably the wrong thing to do,\u201d said Fernandez of Shafer Vineyards, which is in Yountville, Calif., an hour north of San Francisco. \u201cToday, with this, you can actually get into what the vine is sensing.\u201d\n\nThanks to the monitoring devices supplied by Oakland-based Fruition Sciences, Shafer Vineyards says it has saved more than 160,000 gallons of water in the past year.\n\nDana Estates and Silver Oak Winery have also started using the sensor-software combo to keep an eye on their vines. Cameron Vawter, the director of winemaking at Dana Estates, says he has saved more than 2.5 million gallons of water annually across all three of Dana\u2019s vineyards since adapting Fruition Sciences\u2019 technology in 2006.\n\nFruition Sciences\u2019 sensors can also apply to other crops, such as tomatoes and avocados. The company says the tech is in trials in perennial crop fields throughout the state.\n\nFor some forward-thinking winemakers and other early adopters, the jump-start on these methods couldn\u2019t have been more auspicious, as California suffers from a historic drought that is leaving farms parched and fallowed. But the water saved in these cases is still a drop in the bucket compared with the greater water needs of the state. California supplies over a third of the country\u2019s vegetables and nearly two-thirds of the country\u2019s fruits and nuts, according to the state\u2019s department of food and agriculture. And the vast majority of the state\u2019s water goes to agriculture.\n\nThere are also barriers to widespread adoption. It is unclear how effective newer technology can be on a wide scale, making some farmers reluctant to experiment with new equipment while near-future crop yields look uncertain. Investment in water-conservation tech is still relatively small, with less than one percent of all venture capital going into the sector, according to Scott Bryan, the chief operating officer of a San Francisco nonprofit called Imagine H2O.\n\nAnd then, of course, there\u2019s cost. Fruition Sciences charges $50 per \u201csmart point,\u201d with farmers selectively applying the sensors to certain vines. Elias Fernandez of Shafer Vineyards says the technology is costing him around $20,000 a year.\n\n\u201cThe margins can be so slim in agriculture and investing in equipment can be a relatively tall task,\u201d Bryan said.\n\nBryan\u2019s organization, Imagine H2O, looks to bolster new water-conservation technologies through an annual business competition. Its winner in 2011 \u2014 Union City-based mOasis \u2014 just began shipping its product.\n\nUnlike Fruition Sciences\u2019 vine sensors, crop-science startup mOasis is tackling water conservation at the roots \u2013- literally. The company has created a gel that absorbs excess water in soil at the time of planting, and then re-releases the water as the soil dries out.\n\nThe product, called Aquamer, costs farmers $150 per acre and is targeted at California staple crops like tomatoes, lettuce, broccoli and tomatoes. During trials, it was used by about a dozen farmers on the western side of the Central Valley. mOasis claims its technology can reduce water usage by more than 20 percent and create 25 percent higher crop yields by maximizing the soil\u2019s water retention and putting less stress on crops.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in the product right now, and there has been even since before the drought,\u201d said mOasis CEO Steve Hartmeier. Still, he recognizes that his product alone can\u2019t solve California\u2019s water woes.\n\n\u201cI think California is going to be in a drought for the next 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still have to develop a program that addresses long-term supply issues in the state.\u201d\n\nStrawberry grower Apolinar Yerena runs a family strawberry farm in Watsonville, Calif., just south of Santa Cruz along the Pacific Coast. He says he\u2019s aware of instruments that can help control or monitor moisture in soil, but doesn\u2019t use them.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t used any new methods, any new technologies,\u201d since the drought became a state of emergency, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a small farm \u2026 But now, I think we have to consider it.\u201d\n\nBob Blanchard raises grass-fed cattle for slaughter, goats and lamb, as well as Valencia oranges and Haas avocados at Old Creek Ranch in Cayucos, Calif., in the San Luis Obispo valley. At a recent Sunday Farmers\u2019 Market in Palo Alto, he lamented the toll the water shortage is taking on farmers like him.\n\nDrip irrigation machines and mini-sprinklers \u2014 technology that has been available for decades \u2014 are helping him grow his fruit. The trouble has been finding enough water to grow grass to feed his livestock.\n\n\u201cOver the twelve months, we\u2019ve had to reduce our livestock inventory by fifty percent,\u201d Blanchard said.\n\nWhile recent storms buoyed the hopes of many farmers in the Central Valley and northern part of the state, the drought still persists. Last year was reported to be the driest year on record in California, and in January, Gov. Jerry Brown declared the drought to be a state of emergency. In Northern California, some rural communities are potentially facing a shortage of drinking water, while hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland are fallow.\n\nIn mid-February, President Barack Obama visited parts of California\u2019s drought-stricken areas and pledged up to $100 million in aid to farmers who had lost their livestock due to the drought. Obama also allocated $15 million to help farmers with water conservation methods.\n\nTo incentivize prudent water use, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is awarding $20 million in grants for California growers actively conserving water.\n\nBut shortly after Obama\u2019s visit, U.S. officials said that Central Valley farmers wouldn\u2019t be receiving any irrigation water from the federal government this year, because of a lack of runoff water in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nJay Famiglietti, a professor of earth sciences at University of California, Irvine, and a leading hydrology expert, says there seem to be \u201cpromising advances\u201d in water conservation solutions, and that it\u2019s a good thing that emergency funding has been identified.\n\nUltimately, though, drought problems are \u201cnot going to go away,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we need short-term plans, and long-term ones.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "#CAdrought,California drought,Dana Estates,drought,Environment,farmers,Lauren Goode,Napa,Napa Valley,Napa winemaker,Shafer Vineyards,Silver Oak Winery,Technology,vineyard,vineyards,water,winery,Science & Tech,Frontpage Featured", "description": "Traditionally, Napa winemakers monitored vines the old-fashioned way: going into the fields and checking on them once a week.
