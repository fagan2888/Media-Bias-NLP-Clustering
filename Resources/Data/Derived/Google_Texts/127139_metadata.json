Most plans also come with perks that don\u2019t directly involve medical care, including help with weight loss and tobacco cessation. By taking advantage of these benefits, you can live a healthier life while maximizing the value of your health insurance.\n\nThere are many different perks and benefits available, and you don\u2019t need to use them all to get healthier, says Wendy King, director of health and performance at HUB International, one of the largest insurance brokers in America. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of using the right benefits for your life right now. It\u2019s all about saving time, saving money, and improving your quality of life,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen it comes to health care, she says, that means reducing your health risks and staying vital as long as possible. By utilizing some of these lesser-known perks, you may be able to do just that.\n\nFree preventive care\n\nPreventive care has been shown to improve people\u2019s health and lower their costs. Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), certain preventive services must be covered by all health insurance, whether you get it from an employer or an online marketplace. \u201cPreventive care on the recommended schedule will help to save you money in the long run, and help you to really modify your risk factors over time,\u201d King says.\n\nThese services include recommended vaccines for adults and children, and several screenings, such as those for:\n\nalcohol misuse\n\nhigh blood pressure\n\ndepression\n\ndiabetes\n\nhepatitis B or C\n\nlung cancer\n\nThose services are available to all adults, and additional screenings are available for women, children, individuals at higher risk for certain conditions and people over 50. Taking advantage of them can help you detect and control a chronic illness or lower health risks through lifestyle changes, King says. Check your insurance policy to find out what other preventive services are available to you and your family.\n\nREAD MORE: What Counts as Free Preventive Care?\n\nWeight loss programs\n\nBeing overweight is hazardous to your overall health; it can complicate or raise your risk developing chronic diseases. Most health insurers have free online health coaching and help for weight management. If your weight is causing or complicating other conditions, your health insurance will cover nutritional counseling and weight loss programs. Some insurers also provide Weight Watchers discounts and will cover weight loss surgery if your doctor thinks it would be beneficial.\n\nFree or discounted gym memberships\n\nEven if you don\u2019t need to lose weight, your health insurer may support your efforts to live a more active lifestyle. Most major insurers offer discounted membership rates to many athletic club chains, or reimbursements for those who keep a gym commitment. If you have a Medicare Advantage plan through a private insurer, your gym membership could be completely free.\n\nREAD MORE: How to Get in Shape on the Cheap\n\nHelp quitting tobacco\n\nIf you use tobacco and want to stop, you\u2019re in luck\u2014 your health insurer wants you to quit, too. That\u2019s because as one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in America, tobacco use is also responsible for millions spent on health care services. If you quit, you can prevent some of those costs, as well as the tribulations of tobacco-related illness.\n\nWhile programs vary by insurer, most have some resources to help you kick the habit. Some offer free, over-the-counter aids like gum or patches to help you quit smoking, or offer reimbursement for such products. Most other insurers offer free, personalized coaching with a counselor hotline to help you cope with the stress of quitting.\n\nREAD MORE: How Much Money Can You Save by Quitting Smoking?\n\nTelehealth services\n\nTo receive proper care, you don\u2019t always need to be in the same room as your doctor. In an effort to reduce unnecessary doctors\u2019 visits and bills, more insurers are offering telehealth services.\n\nTelehealth, or telemedicine, can include free nurse hotlines or a phone call or video chat with a doctor or pharmacist. This might seem geared for young, tech-savvy people, but it\u2019s especially beneficial for elderly or disabled patients who don\u2019t get around easily. Nurse hotlines are free, and telemedicine video chats are usually $50 or less.\n\nREAD MORE: Surprising Ways to Lower Medical Bills\n\nHealth cost calculators\n\nYou may already know about your health insurer\u2019s member portal, where you can access policy documents and claims.
