But top party leaders readily confess their deeper motives. \u201cWe have to show that we can be a productive party, and that, I think, will have a direct effect on whether we\u2019re able to elect a Republican as president in 2016,\u201d said Senator John McCain, the party\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee. New Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell was even more blunt: \u201cI don\u2019t want the American people to think that, if they add a Republican president to a Republican Congress, that\u2019s going to be a scary outcome.\u201d\n\nSo there you have it. The primary objective for congressional Republicans over the next two years is to live by the partisan-electoral version of the Hippocratic oath: Do no harm to the party\u2019s chances to establish unified control of Washington in January 2017.\n\nIf the past six decades are any guide, however, this is an ambitious goal. Indeed, by the end of the Obama presidency, the federal government will have been divided for nearly 70 percent of the previous 64 years. But as I argue in my new book, The Stronghold: How Republicans Captured Congress but Surrendered the White House, Republicans, and conservatives in particular, should be rather pleased with their congressional domination in the quarter century since the end of the Reagan-Bush (41) era\u2014even if the GOP\u2019s congressional successes were attended by, and in many ways the cause of, the struggles of its presidential nominees. In this protracted era of divided government, controlling Congress makes a lot more sense for Republicans than occupying the Oval Office.\n\nTo understand why, let\u2019s return to the moment of conception for today\u2019s Republican majorities on Capitol Hill, and the seminal Republican figure of the past half-century: the 1994 \u201cRepublican Revolution\u201d and Newt Gingrich. Despite conservatives\u2019 unabated veneration of Ronald Reagan, the truth is that the Gipper left a far less indelible imprint on recent American politics than the Georgia speaker. Yet, the onset of the 114th Congress has occasioned surprisingly few mentions of the arrival, 20 years ago this week, of the historic 94th Congress that put the GOP in control of both chambers of Congress for the first time in 40 years.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 path to power was paved by the \u201cContract with America.\u201d In retrospect, the \u201cContract\u201d was notable for two reasons.\n\nFirst, as my political science colleague Ron Rapoport has shown, it was designed to appeal especially to the reformist impulses of the nearly one in five Americans who voted for Ross Perot in the 1992 presidential election. As I remind readers in my book, the Contract\u2019s second notable feature, very much related to the first, was its avoidance of specific policy proposals in favor of institutional reforms proposed as an indirect means to delivering good policy. Slightly condensed here for brevity\u2019s sake, the document\u2019s eight key tenets were:\n\nRequire all laws that apply to the rest of the country also apply to the Congress;\n\nHire an independent firm to audit Congress for waste, fraud, or abuse;\n\nCut the number of House committees, and reduce committee staff by one-third;\n\nLimit the terms of committee chairs;\n\nBan proxy voting in committees;\n\nOpen all committee meetings to the public;\n\nRequire a three-fifths majority vote to pass a tax increase; and\n\nImplement zero- base-line budgeting for the federal budget.\n\nAlthough the audit, tax increase supermajority and zero-base-budgeting provisions offer a vague promise of fiscal restraint, the Contract was not a policy agenda so much as it was a broad political indictment of how Congress does business packaged as a laundry list of proposed reforms. Given their four-decade hegemony to that point, perhaps Democrats deserved the indictment and the public\u2019s ire toward Congress.\n\nTen federal elections and 20 years of mostly Republican rule in Congress later, however, the GOP can no longer shift blame across the partisan aisle for a Congress that, just last year, saw its public approval sink into single digits. But then again, Republicans never really promised to deploy congressional power to fundamentally change national policy. The elevation of procedural and political reform over substantive policy agendas can be traced right back to the Republicans\u2019 original Contract.\n\nThat said, Democrats, liberals and other cynics tempted to scoff at congressional Republicans\u2019 pledges to use their 114th Congress majorities to solve national problems and govern soberly should remember that the two parties approach the business of governing very differently. To Republicans, modern governing means to slash, slow, cut or otherwise impede federal functions, programs and growth. Here, Hippocrates is turned on his head: The GOP\u2019s principal policy objective is to do ample harm.\n\nDebt-ceiling shenanigans; Ted Cruz-led government shutdowns; more than four dozen futile Republican House caucus votes to repeal or otherwise gut Obamacare\u2014these actions reveal the GOP\u2019s governing mindset and helped make the 113th Congress the most unproductive in history. Because a \u201cproductive\u201d Congress means something entirely different to Republicans than it does to Democrats, Speaker John Boehner should be taken at his word when he said on national television that Congress \u201cshould not be judged on how many new laws we create [but] on how many laws we repeal.\" Or as anti-tax guru Grover Norquist told me in an interview for The Stronghold, \u201cyou can govern with just the House.\u201d Delivered without a hint of irony, Norquist\u2019s maxim at first seemed absurd to me\u2014until I considered the fundamental asymmetries between the two major parties\u2019 governing philosophies, especially at the national level. Adding Republican control of the Senate to their House majority only solidifies the GOP\u2019s ability to govern by obstruction.\n\nAs the Prospect\u2019s own Paul Waldman has observed, Mitch McConnell\u2019s goal as the new Senate majority leader is \u201cpretty clever;\u201d it\u2019s to make his caucus look \u201ca little more sober and responsible\u2014not so much that they actually do a lot of legislating and make substantive compromises with Obama\u201d but to protect the party\u2019s 2016 nominee. It\u2019s actually more than that: It\u2019s very smart politics, both ideologically and practically. Having rarely suffered electoral blowback from this strategy over the past 20 years, why would\u2014and given their view about federal power, why should\u2014Republicans change now?\n\nSo don\u2019t be surprised a year from now when, as the presidential primary season begins and the television trucks and field operatives collectively descend upon Des Moines, Capitol Hill reporters are reflecting back on a year marked by few legislative achievements from the 114th Congress. Some bills will surely pass both chambers and die on President Obama\u2019s desk, if only to make claims that Obama is the leader of the real \u201cparty of no.\u201d But the GOP may not produce much because it doesn\u2019t intend to\u2014and for the past two decades never really has.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Prospect", "description": "Republicans never really promised to deploy congressional power to fundamentally change national policy.", "title": "Key to Understanding the New Congress: Gingrich's Contract With America", "url": "http://prospect.org/article/key-understanding-new-congress-gingrichs-contract-america", "image": "http://prospect.org/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/ap9504070450.jpg?itok=UoM8o_MS", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "4dItj6FrXn-I63uD7pcvQKf3n3Qc6AIxiwwzo0_G4zk", "fb": {"admins": 431364, "app_id": 107113422697949}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0, width = device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f1e\"", "article_summary": "New Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell was even more blunt: \u201cI don\u2019t want the American people to think that, if they add a Republican president to a Republican Congress, that\u2019s going to be a scary outcome.\u201dSo there you have it.\n\u201cGOP agenda for Congress: Challenge Obama, prove they can govern,\u201d CNN blared the next day.\nIn this protracted era of divided government, controlling Congress makes a lot more sense for Republicans than occupying the Oval Office.\nYet, the onset of the 114th Congress has occasioned surprisingly few mentions of the arrival, 20 years ago this week, of the historic 94th Congress that put the GOP in control of both chambers of Congress for the first time in 40 years.\nGiven their four-decade hegemony to that point, perhaps Democrats deserved the indictment and the public\u2019s ire toward Congress."}
