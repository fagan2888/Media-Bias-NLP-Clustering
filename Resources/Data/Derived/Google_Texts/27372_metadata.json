A bookseller and buyer at The Bookies, Yoder, 70, is the kind of guy who hands \u201d Divergent\u201d to parents and persuades them to take a chance on a title some might mistake as kid lit.\n\nProudly, he boasts that a lot of parents take the bait. With some customers coming in his doors looking for reads with low time commitments and gripping stories, Yoder says many of his adult patrons are turning more frequently to Young Adult books.\n\n\u201cYou know what the difference between a good adult book and a good young adult book is? A hundred pages,\u201d Yoder quips. \u201cWhen they want entertainment, if they can get something compacted that has entertaining aspects to it, [adults] will go to the YA book.\u201d\n\nCirculation data from the Denver Public Libraryshows that between January and May, 68 percent of YA check-outs came from readers above the age of 18 (in 2013 it was near 70 percent, too). And according to a 2012 market research study, 55 percent of YA book consumers were older than 18, with the biggest segment slotted in the 30-44 age range.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had so many YA books,\u201d says Judy Bulow, the children\u2019s book buyer for the Tattered Cover book stores. \u201cOver the years it\u2019s grown because I think that aspect of childhood has grown.\u201d When Bulow was 17, \u201cyou were off working; you\u2019d given up the things of a child by 18. But now, I think you\u2019re considered young for a long, long time.\u201d\n\nAlongside the adult crossover craze into YA fiction \u2014 thanks to the fan bases behind such best sellers-turned-blockbusters as \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d \u201cTwilight,\u201d \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d and \u201cDivergent\u201d \u2014 is a rising stigma attached to adults reading down their age ladder.\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment that has been the subject of online screeds plastered on news sites such as Slate, where writer Ruth Graham, in a piece titled \u201cAgainst YA,\u201d last week wrote:\n\n\u201cFellow grown-ups, at the risk of sounding snobbish and joyless and old, we are better than this. \u2026 [I]f people are reading \u2018Eleanor & Park\u2019 instead of watching \u2018Nashville\u2019 or reading detective novels, so be it, I suppose. But if they are substituting maudlin teen dramas for the complexity of great adult literature, then they are missing something.\u201d\n\nFort Collins-based author Lauren Myracle doesn\u2019t think the material is infantilized; she believes the stories strive to be more immediate and less jaded without sacrificing writing quality. They can also give adults a sense of nostalgia or pleasure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always pushing [YA] on people, saying, \u2018No, you don\u2019t understand, forget the cover, forget the age,\u201d read the story, she says.\n\nLafayette-based middle-grade author Ingrid Law wants readers of all ages to shed any embarrassment or prejudices. Not only are there good stories in every age demographic, she says, but younger stories can also serve as gateways to niche adult genres, which might be engendering certain aversions.\n\n\u201cYA can give them a place to start multiple genres in one safe place,\u201d Law says, citing Orson Scott Card\u2019s \u201cEnder\u2019s Game\u201d as an example of an introduction to science fiction.\n\nGraham concedes some of these points in her article, but she says the very ways YA books aim to be pleasurable are at odds with adult fiction\u2019s goals.\n\n\u201cYA books present the teenage perspective in a fundamentally uncritical way,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt\u2019s not simply that YA readers are asked to immerse themselves in a character\u2019s emotional life \u2014 that\u2019s the trick of so much great fiction \u2014 but that they are asked to abandon the mature insights into that perspective that they (supposedly) have acquired as adults.\u201d\n\nWith this viewpoint in mind, Yoder says he narrows his customers down into two categories: staunch narrative advocates, for whom a good story trumps all, and literary stylists, for whom taste depends on what is deemed artistically praise-worthy. The latter group can be a tougher sell in terms of YA, he says.\n\nMyracle adds that YA authors sometimes struggle for artistic legitimacy because the way their stories are marketed can create the false assumption that their work is somehow trivial. But Law and Yoder insist there are crossover stories that can not only nab money in multiple demographics, but can also make readers of any age \u201cfeel something.\u201d\n\nThe original publicity and marketing behind J.K. Rowling\u2019s \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series, Bulow and Yoder say, had a lot to do with kick-starting the crossover phenomenon of bringing adults to the YA sections of bookstores and libraries.\n\nBut even before then, with what started as a categorization of books rooted in early reading and innocence \u2014 with such titles as \u201cThe Hardy Boys\u201d and \u201cNancy Drew\u201d \u2014 Bulow recalls a blossoming of ideas taking hold in the \u201950s and \u201960s \u2014 with \u201cCatcher in the Rye,\u201d \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d and \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d among others \u2014 that muddied the waters and brought mature themes to young audiences. Thus, the lines became blurred between what was intended for a young adult and what should be read by adults.\n\nA constant ebb and flow of classics over the last few decades has continued to wash hits ashore in the forms of coming-of-age tales, fantasies, dystopias and mysteries. But now, Bulow says YA dystopias, which have been popular for the last handful of years, might be on their way out, as publishers are looking for more teenage realism stories a la John Green\u2019s \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars.\u201d\n\nAs much as YA is expanding into new territory, the market is also fragmenting into the beginnings of a risque offshoot dubbed New Adult, or Young Adult Mature, in some bookstores.\n\nYoder says dovetailing off the craving for coming-of-age realism are stories with 18- to 24-year-old protagonists wielding themes of sexual discovery, careerism and survival, hoping to net crossover readers who connect with multiple age demographics.\n\n\u201cAs one person here once said, \u2018These are a bunch of young readers and young writers who never read Harlequin and now want to,\u2019 \u201d Yoder says. \u201cThey want bodice rippers!\u201d\n\nMany of the biggest New Adult hits have come in the form of self-published best sellers, such as Cora Carmack\u2018s \u201cLosing It\u201d e-book series, which deals with love and sexuality after high school.\n\nRegardless of trends, Joyce Meskis, longtime owner of the Tattered Cover book stores, rolls her eyes at people who say certain genres have age caps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that people read across many genres,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an enlightening experience.\u201d\u2018\n\nPerhaps the biggest advocate of that stance is Yoder, who often can be found at The Bookies\u2019 sci-fi-fantasy crossover shelf \u2014 his favorite. He might hand you the latest biography on Robert E. Lee or he might convince you that Paolo Bacigalupi\u2019s \u201d Ship Breaker\u201d will give you enough deep, dark themes to chew on.\n\nIf you argue with him, he\u2019ll probably shake his head and hands, and then tell you something you might have already heard: A good story is a good story, no matter where it comes from.\n\nSean Fitz-Gerald: 303-954-1211, sfitz-gerald@denverpost.com or twitter.com/srkfitzgerald", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe178c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou know what the difference between a good adult book and a good young adult book is?\nThus, the lines became blurred between what was intended for a young adult and what should be read by adults.\n\u201cAs one person here once said, \u2018These are a bunch of young readers and young writers who never read Harlequin and now want to,\u2019 \u201d Yoder says.\nWith some customers coming in his doors looking for reads with low time commitments and gripping stories, Yoder says many of his adult patrons are turning more frequently to Young Adult books.\n\u2026 [I]f people are reading \u2018Eleanor & Park\u2019 instead of watching \u2018Nashville\u2019 or reading detective novels, so be it, I suppose."}
