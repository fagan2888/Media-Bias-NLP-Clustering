The government\u2019s partners are the crony capitalists who saw a deal they could not resist.\n\nWhen President Obama and the entire liberal establishment insisted that something must be done to bring health insurance coverage to \u201c46 million uninsured Americans,\u201d insurance companies saw an opportunity. Instead of fighting the government takeover of private health care, they said, \u201cLet us help.\u201d And boy, did they!\n\nThis monstrous government scam could never have been enacted into law without the support of crony capitalists who joined Obama and the Democratic Party in selling this socialist scheme to the American people.\n\nThe companies in health insurance industry and the medical professions were among the leaders in this fools\u2019 parade in 2009 and 2010. It is small comfort to the Americans now losing their insurance coverage or seeing their premiums double to see Obama now throwing the insurance companies under the bus.\n\nWhy is anyone surprised? The complete destruction of the private insurance marketplace has been the goal of every single-payer proposal for the past 50 years. Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and other Democrats are now openly admitting that Obamacare has always been understood as a step toward the eventual adoption of government-run and government-provided health care. \u201cSure, there will be a few bumps in the road, a few glitches, some Web page delays, some detours and blind alleys. But be patient. We will get there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the capitalists will help us get there,\u201d is the unspoken password in the hallways of the Obama White House.\n\nWe now see liberal Democrats from Massachusetts to Colorado, from Elizabeth Warren to Mark Udall, telling their angry constituents that it\u2019s the insurance companies who are to blame for the Obamacare train wreck. If we can persuade Obama and Sebelius to extend the period of enrollment in Obamacare, all will be well. Democrats point out that it\u2019s the insurance companies who are sending out the cancellation notices or the premium hikes. Never mind that they are merely obeying the law\u2013 in the eyes of Obamacare apologists and the mainstream media, they are the only villains, not the authors of the legislation.\n\nWhy did the insurance industry not see this from the beginning? Who can have much sympathy for them as \u201cvictims\u201d when they helped design the scheme? Critics of the plan tried to tell them that the left sees private insurance as an obstacle that must eventually be replaced, but they were willing dupes.\n\nYes, the insurance companies can say and are saying, \u201cObamacare made me do it.\u201d But let\u2019s remember and let\u2019s remind them that they helped bring this beast into our world. In medical terms, they were the sperm donors.\n\nThe lesson here is actually an old one: Crony capitalism is nothing new and is not confined to \u201cgreen energy\u201d subsidies, municipal urban renewal projects, or tax increment financing for a new sports stadium. The passage of the \u201cPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u201d demonstrated that the health insurance industry knows how to play this age-old game, a game as old as politics.\n\nIt was Karl Marx who famously said that the capitalists would sell the communists the rope with which they would be hanged. In 21st century America, they will also give political donations to the politicians who enact the laws to drive them out of business.\n\nIn Colorado, business lobbyists were nearly unanimous in supporting the 2011 legislation that created the Colorado Health Benefits Exchange. Supposedly, this would allow Coloradans to control their own health insurance plans instead of letting the federal government determine their fate. Shall we ask the 250,000 Coloradans who this month lost their insurance coverage how that\u2019s working out for them? How do the plans available to them in the \u201cExchange\u201d compare to the private plans they lost?\n\nWhat is today called \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d is simply a modern type of exploitation of government power for private gain. While a few companies may benefit in the short run, we all lose in the long run. Ronald Reagan got it right when he reminded business audiences that \u201cWhen you get into bed with government, you will always get more than a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d\n\nWhat Obamacare illustrates is that the most dangerous and expensive form of crony capitalism is not \u201cinsider trading\u201d or sweetheart contracts that give an advantage to one company over others. The most far-reaching damage to our prosperity and our freedom occurs when whole industries join with government to carve out \u201cnew markets\u201d and new customers for regulated and government-provided products. Obamacare is crony capitalism on steroids.\n\nConcerned about the impact of illegal aliens on the United States?
