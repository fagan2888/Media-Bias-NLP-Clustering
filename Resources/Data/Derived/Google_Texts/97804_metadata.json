Everybody wants to peg Barton as somebody else.\n\n\u201cHe reminded me a little bit of Gilbert Arenas when he was in college,\u201d said interim Golden State Warriors coach Luke Walton.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s our Vinnie Johnson-type player,\u201d said Nuggets coach Michael Malone.\n\nMight as well throw in a Bob McAdoo analogy or a John Havlicek comparison while you\u2019re at it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard all kinds of comparisons,\u201d Barton said. \u201cWe won\u2019t even get into them. There\u2019s been so many. But I\u2019m not going to let anybody put me in a box. I\u2019m going to be me. That\u2019s the only player I want to be.\n\n\u201cNo disrespect, but I don\u2019t want to be like anybody else.\u201d\n\nBarton, seemingly out of nowhere, is having a breakout season for the Nuggets. He is averaging 15.8 points per game, trailing only Danilo Gallinari among the Nuggets, and 6.3 rebounds, behind only Kenneth Faried.\n\nBarton isn\u2019t even a starter. The 6-foot-6 string bean has become the Nuggets\u2019 best bench player since Corey Brewer \u2014 whoa, there\u2019s another comparison \u2014 and he is an early leading candidate for the NBA\u2019s sixth man of the year award.\n\nBarton\u2019s rise \u2014 in his fourth NBA season and less than a year after Denver acquired him from the Portland Trail Blazers in the Arron Afflalo trade \u2014 has helped the Nuggets tread water in the Western Conference.\n\nAnd he is Denver\u2019s strongest link to a run-and-gun, high-tempo past. Malone, in his first season here, would like to get his team to play at a higher tempo. Barton, more than any other, revs up the Nuggets.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t run a ton of plays for Will Barton, which speaks to his ability and effectiveness that much more,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHe\u2019s at his best when the game is up-tempo, when it\u2019s open court, because in transition he\u2019s a load to handle. He can get to the rim, he can finish, he can make plays for others.\u201d\n\nWednesday, in one of the Nuggets\u2019 best regular-season victories since they took down Michael Jordan\u2019s 72-win Bulls in 1996, Barton went shot for shot in the fourth quarter with Stephen Curry, the league\u2019s reigning MVP. After Curry drained a 3-pointer with less than two minutes remaining to draw the Warriors within four, Barton immediately countered with a 3.\n\nAnd on Golden State\u2019s final possession, Barton drew the defensive assignment on Curry. Malone wanted Barton\u2019s length to get in Curry\u2019s way. Curry never got the ball. The Nuggets went on to hand Golden State only its third loss in 39 games.\n\nLast season, with Portland, Barton wouldn\u2019t get that shot.\n\n\u201cWho knows if I\u2019m even on the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m a guy who wants the ball in his hands, especially in the clutch, in the closing minutes. I pride myself on making the right play and making big shots. Any time I\u2019m on the floor.\u201d\n\nBarton\u2019s PIE number, the NBA statistic that measures the percentage impact a player has on a game, is 14.5, best among the Nuggets. The league average is 10. In other words, Barton gets the Nuggets cranking. It\u2019s why, even as a bench player, his 29.5 minutes per game are third-most among Nuggets.\n\n\u201cIf we can defend and run with Will in the game, whether he handles it or runs the floor, he\u2019ll make stuff happen,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHe can create something when you may not think something is there. He has an ability to break down a defense.\u201d\n\nBefore he scored 21 points against Golden State, Barton was in a four-game slump, averaging just 7.0 points. But with his shot not falling, he hit the boards, averaging 6.3 rebounds per game. He is grabbing more rebounds this season than each of Denver\u2019s 7-foot centers.\n\nBarton\u2019s breakout season was years in the making. A second-round pick of the Trail Blazers in the 2012 draft after playing two seasons at the University of Memphis, Barton rarely had an opportunity to shine until this season, because he usually was deep on the bench.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s figuring out how to play at the next level now,\u201d said Walton, who was an assistant coach at Memphis when Barton was there. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you\u2019re not a top draft pick, because you don\u2019t get the same opportunities. You\u2019re constantly pressing to prove you can play. And when that happens, you normally make mistakes.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not mentally strong and you don\u2019t figure it out, you\u2019ll find yourself out of the league before you even realize what happened.\u201d\n\nBarton survived long enough to get his chance, even if he had to push the door open. When the Nuggets sent Afflalo to Portland, their primary interest was the Blazers\u2019 first-round pick in the 2016 draft. They took on Barton as part of the package.\n\nAnd now he is among Denver\u2019s most valuable players.\n\n\u201cI knew I\u2019d have a big opportunity to play, so I wanted to make sure I was ready and prepared. I knew it could happen as long as I kept faith and stayed humble,\u201d Barton said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a good space. I\u2019m in a great city. I feel like I\u2019m going to be here for a long time.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke\n\nBarton\u2019s breakout season\n\nNuggets guard Will Barton, a 6-foot-6, 175-pound fourth-year pro, is an early leading candidate for the NBA\u2019s sixth man of the year award, an amazing ascension for a relatively unknown player.\n\n\u2022 He attended four Baltimore-area high schools in five years \u2014 including a senior year at Brewster Academy, where ESPN rated him the best prep shooting guard in the nation, ahead of Dion Waiters, among others.\n\n\u2022 He was picked 40th overall by the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2012 NBA draft, 20 slots behind Nuggets selection Evan Fournier and two behind Quincy Miller, neither of whom plays for Denver now.\n\n\u2022 He has played in all 40 games this season but has made only one start. He ranks second in points (averaging 15.8), behind only Danilo Gallinari, and second in rebounds (6.3), ahead of each of Denver\u2019s centers.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Will Barton powers into NBA sixth-man award running for Nuggets", "title": "Will Barton powers into NBA sixth-man award running for Nuggets", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/16/will-barton-powers-into-nba-sixth-man-award-running-for-nuggets/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__BN20160117_Z00_BNSP17BKNNUGGSBARTONp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__BN20160117_Z00_BNSP17BKNNUGGSBARTONp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-16T17:32:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T23:55:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The 6-foot-6 string bean has become the Nuggets\u2019 best bench player since Corey Brewer \u2014 whoa, there\u2019s another comparison \u2014 and he is an early leading candidate for the NBA\u2019s sixth man of the year award.\nHe is averaging 15.8 points per game, trailing only Danilo Gallinari among the Nuggets, and 6.3 rebounds, behind only Kenneth Faried.\n\u201cNo disrespect, but I don\u2019t want to be like anybody else.\u201dBarton, seemingly out of nowhere, is having a breakout season for the Nuggets.\nAsk around about Will Barton, and you will get more player comparisons than LeBron James draws double-teams.\n\u201cHe\u2019s our Vinnie Johnson-type player,\u201d said Nuggets coach Michael Malone."}
