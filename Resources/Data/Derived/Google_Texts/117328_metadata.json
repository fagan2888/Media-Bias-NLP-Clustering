In neither period is there much grounds for hope that saving for retirement is actually possible.\n\nWhatever presidents and pundits may say, the overwhelming majority of American households know that \u201cprogress\u201d does not occur when incomes fall, costs rise, and savings shrink, even as central banks suppress interest rates and governments spend with abandon.\n\nIs America past a tipping point, where fundamental changes wrought by the Obama administration since 2009 cannot be redressed?\n\nThe thrill is gone\n\nSpinning false positives only works so long \u2014 here on Earth, gravity remains a potent, immutable force.\n\nNo one now recalls with fondness the 2012 campaign fable that America\u2019s economy was supposedly roaring back because General Motors was fixed and \u201calive.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in dread, we watch the surging advance of al Qaeda who are not cowed by the dispatch of Osama bin Laden.\n\nAcross the Middle East, there is wreckage, starting in Iraq, and there\u2019s more devastation coming soon in Afghanistan.\n\nSomehow, since 2008, the Obama administration has lost America many valiant friends, while emboldening a raft of rising rivals.\n\nToday, we can only guess how well the president will do on his forthcoming trip around Europe \u2014 his inept stumbling gives little ground for optimism.\n\nWe approach a historic milestone \u2014 the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings and the fierce battles when American and allied military forces turned the tide of history. President Reagan marked the 40th anniversary in solemn, dignified fashion \u2014 inspiring realistic hope afterwards for most Americans and across the Western world.\n\nDoes anyone sensible truly believe President Obama learned from President Reagan, or that Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin is fearful watching America \u201clead from behind?\u201d\n\nThose of us who remember the pain brought on by the inept economic and foreign policies of Jimmy Carter see history repeating itself under Mr. Obama \u2014 it can\u2019t be long before dollar-based interest rates rise towards (and possible past) historic averages.\n\nNothing man-made lasts forever \u2014 certainly not a Pax Americana built on shrinking after-tax incomes, a staggering mountain of debt and a president hooked on spin.\n\n\u2022 Charles Ortel serves as managing director of Newport Value Partners (newportvalue.com), which provides economic research to executives and to investment firms.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The adults among us remember the joys we had as children spinning tops \u2014 watching an ungainly gadget on a tiny point whir upright against the odds, seemingly rigid, stable and secure.", "Author": "Charles Ortel", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The adults among us remember the joys we had as children spinning tops \u2014 watching an ungainly gadget on a tiny point whir upright against the odds, seemingly rigid, stable and secure.", "title": "ORTEL: A wobbly U.S. economy may be heading for a fall", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/1/ortel-a-wobbly-us-economy-may-be-heading-for-a-fal/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/23/wall-streetjpeg-09715.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/23/wall-streetjpeg-09715.jpg", "title": "ORTEL: A wobbly U.S. economy may be heading for a fall", "description": "The adults among us remember the joys we had as children spinning tops \u2014 watching an ungainly gadget on a tiny point whir upright against the odds, seemingly rigid, stable and secure.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34ed\"", "article_summary": "What holds each of us up are our after-tax incomes \u2014 these allow us to sustain ourselves and permit the fortunate among us to squirrel away savings.\nNothing man-made lasts forever \u2014 certainly not a Pax Americana built on shrinking after-tax incomes, a staggering mountain of debt and a president hooked on spin.\nInformation just out from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Expenditure Survey leads to damning conclusions concerning what is happening to after-tax incomes across the full spectrum of the economy.\n\u2022 Charles Ortel serves as managing director of Newport Value Partners (newportvalue.com), which provides economic research to executives and to investment firms.\nWe also remember that first jerk, when the top fell off kilter, signaling the beginning of the end of its run, its clattering and fall."}
