The results also came as the corporation was investing heavily to implement the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be overstated: This is an incredibly challenging time in health care,\u201d Loepp said. \u201cThis level of financial performance allows us to continue to transform our business, work to make our operations more efficient and customer-responsive, and make the changes necessary to compete in the new health insurance market created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt is gratifying to see Blue Cross continue to perform strongly \u2014 growing membership, maintaining the financial strength our members rely upon, and maximizing income from investments to take as much pressure as possible off our health insurance members.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line for 2013 equated to a margin of 1 percent, which is within the range of 2 percent to negative 2 percent the corporation targets, said Paul Mozak, the insurer\u2019s vice president for finance.\n\nMozak attributed the lower consolidated net income to lower earnings from investments that were affected in 2013 by higher interest rates. The $417 million in investment income for 2013 compares with $488 million in 2012. Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s consolidated revenues totaled $21.3 billion in 2013, versus $20.9 billion in 2012, and include the health insurance business, the HMO subsidiary Blue Care Network, and the Accident Fund worker\u2019s compensation and LifeSure long-term care insurers.\n\nIn the health insurance business, Blue Cross Blue Shield lost $85.9 million on revenues of $6.6 billion for 2013. The results included a net underwriting loss of $267.9 on health policies, primarily in the individual market and net investment earnings of $168.9 million.\n\nThat compares with a net loss of $2.5 million on revenues of $6.4 billion, net investment earnings of $252.8 million and a net underwriting loss of $220.9 million in 2012.\n\nThe 685,000-member Blue Care Network earned lower net income of $120.2 million in 2013, versus $167.2 million in 2012.\n\nThe insurer posted its third straight year of membership growth, adding 3,283 members. It now has more than 4.45 million members statewide.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan recorded net income of $265 million last year, driven largely by earnings from its subsidiaries.
