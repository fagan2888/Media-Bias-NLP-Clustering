I know that there are a lot of people out there who are incredibly frustrated with what\u2019s going on, and they don\u2019t see anything being done about it. This is particularly true, amongst conservatives. you know, you look at the omnibus bill that was passed just recently, and you have, you know, a Republican congress. And yet there is climate change, and resettlement of refugees, and Obamacare, and Planned Parenthood, and sanctuary cities, and on and on it goes. And they say nobody represents us. And then at least, you know, you have somebody who may be bombastic and maybe isn\u2019t 100% accurate, but at least they say, it\u2019s different. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s drawing people. I hope that those same people over the course of time will start listening very carefully to what\u2019s being said by all of the candidates, and make a very appropriate choice.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Carson said that the controversy over Democratic candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saying ISIS is using Trump as a recruiting tool is \u201cmuch to do about nothing. You know, we have some really important things to talk about, and, you know, whether there are things that are used, and that you can prove that there are things that there are used, there\u2019s no question that they use anything that they can against us. They use anything that they can possibly get their hands on to try to make their case, and particularly to go after the disaffected people of the world. And what we need to be thinking about is how do we give them a different message, the disaffected ones, so that they won\u2019t be so attracted to those kinds of messages.\u201d\n\nHe added, after Tapper brought the controversy of Trump\u2019s claims of Muslims in the US celebrating on 9/11 and Republican candidate Carly Fiorina\u2019s description of the Planned Parenthood videos, \u201cI think we maybe tend to rely too much on videos. What we really ought to be talking about is, what are the real issues. Are there people in this country who are Muslims who celebrate things like that? And if there are, why is that the case? And what are we doing about it? That probably is a more important question. Are we saying and doing things that inflame the Muslim communities all over the world? And if the answer is yes, should we be talking about those things, and should we be trying to cut back on those things, and send a different message? So, I\u2019m a big picture type of person. Let\u2019s look at the real issues and go after those, rather than fanning the flames of things that really don\u2019t matter that much.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carson: Not 'Necessary' For Obama To Bring Race Into Trump's Appeal", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Carson: Not 'Necessary' For Obama To Bring Race Into Trump's Appeal", "title": "Carson: Not 'Necessary' For Obama To Bring Race Into Trump's Appeal - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Carson-1221-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/12/21/carson-not-necessary-for-obama-to-bring-race-into-trumps-appeal/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Carson: Not 'Necessary' For Obama To Bring Race Into Trump's Appeal", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Carson-1221-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Carson: Not 'Necessary' For Obama To Bring Race Into Trump's Appeal - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, Ben Carson, Donald Trump, President Obama,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Obama,Carson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "President Obama", "published_time": "2015-12-21T14:06:05-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Obama,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Let\u2019s look at the real issues and go after those, rather than fanning the flames of things that really don\u2019t matter that much.\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\nyou know, you look at the omnibus bill that was passed just recently, and you have, you know, a Republican congress.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRepublican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson argued it wasn\u2019t necessary for President Obama \u201cto bring race into it\u201d while discussing GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s appeal and that the controversy over whether ISIS is using Trump to recruit is \u201cmuch to do about nothing\u201d on Monday\u2019s broadcast of CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCarson stated, \u201cI really don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to bring race into it.\nAnd yet there is climate change, and resettlement of refugees, and Obamacare, and Planned Parenthood, and sanctuary cities, and on and on it goes.\nAre we saying and doing things that inflame the Muslim communities all over the world?"}
