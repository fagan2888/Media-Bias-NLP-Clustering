The program partners with local emergency medical services divisions, including ambulance agencies throughout Utah, according to the article.\n\nWasatch County has seven ambulances, which responded to 1,300 calls in 2013, a higher number than ever because of the increase in outdoor races and activities requiring emergency care, KLS reported. Now, these ambulances will include a critical care nurse from a local hospital, in addition to the emergency medical technicians who normally ride in the rig.\n\nHaving the nurse involved with patient care from the beginning will eliminate the gap in service, hospital officials said. Intermountain plans to train at least 10 emergency department nurses at each of the seven participating hospitals in Idaho and Utah to provide the intensive care needed during critical transports, according to the article. \"This will raise the level of care and provide the expertise patients require in their time of need,\" Kemp told KLS.\n\nNurses in ambulances might help improve survival rates of ground transportation. A 2012 study found adults with serious injuries are more likely to survive if transferred to a top-level trauma center by helicopter rather than by ground transport, FierceHealthcare previously reported. Patients transported by helicopter had a 16 percent better chance of survival, as compared to ground transport.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCostly helicopter transport linked with higher survival rates\n\nCritical access hospitals post higher transfer rates after surgery\n\nStabilizing patients before transfer could cost lives\n\nCosgrove: Patient experience key to healthcare quality", "article_metadata": {"description": "Intermountain Healthcare launched a new emergency ground transportation program that places specially trained nurses in ambulances carrying critically injured patients,\u00a0KLS.com\u00a0reported.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Intermountain Healthcare launched a new emergency ground transportation program that places specially trained nurses in ambulances carrying critically injured patients,\u00a0KLS.com\u00a0reported.", "title": "Intermountain Healthcare puts critical care nurses in ambulance transports", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/intermountain-healthcare-puts-critical-care-nurses-ambulance-transports/2014-08-11", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,critical care nurses,emergency transport,ground transport,Helicopter Transport,HR & Workforce Management,Intermountain Healthcare,Patient Care & Outcomes,rural hospitals", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0878\"", "article_summary": "Intermountain Healthcare launched a new emergency ground transportation program that places specially trained nurses in ambulances carrying critically injured patients, KLS.com reported.\nThe program partners with local emergency medical services divisions, including ambulance agencies throughout Utah, according to the article.\nHaving the nurse involved with patient care from the beginning will eliminate the gap in service, hospital officials said.\nNow, these ambulances will include a critical care nurse from a local hospital, in addition to the emergency medical technicians who normally ride in the rig.\nPatients transported by helicopter had a 16 percent better chance of survival, as compared to ground transport."}
