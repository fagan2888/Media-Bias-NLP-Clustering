Oliver building next door was 70 percent vacant, and the former Lord & Taylor department store and the James H. Reed office building were empty.\n\nToday it\u2019s a different story.\n\nThe upper floors of the Oliver building are being converted into an Embassy Suites hotel. Lord & Taylor is now a PNC Bank call center with about 700 employees, and the James Reed building is being turned into an upscale 249-room Hotel Monaco. Saks is being redeveloped for retail and parking, and the upper half of the former Alcoa building is becoming apartments.\n\nAdd to it the rehabbed square and Mayor Bill Peduto\u2019s interest in making Smithfield a \u201cgrand boulevard of Pittsburgh\u201d filled with small shops and boutiques, and it\u2019s easy to see why some think better days are ahead for the corridor.\n\n\u201cIf you fast-forward 18 months to two years from now, the whole Mellon Square corridor will be unrecognizable given all of the redevelopment going on, in and around the square,\u201d Mr. Pollock predicted.\n\nDavid Glickman, director of retail services for the Newmark Grubb Knight Frank real estate firm, believes Market Square, with its piazza and teeming restaurant scene, is unique in Downtown, but he sees the potential for Smithfield to generate as much, if not more, retail.\n\n\u201cI can see it being just as much of a destination but in a different way. Market Square is basically an area to hang out, see events and eat. You can\u2019t really compare it to Smithfield and Wood [streets], which are more corridors, but if the right streetscapes are done and the roads are paved and made attractive, [Smithfield] will attract more retail. It\u2019s not a matter of if; it definitely will,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Pollock said he is negotiating with several \u201cmarquee\u201d restaurants that are interested in the Saks redevelopment, which will feature 25,000 square feet of retail space on Smithfield and Fifth Avenue. They are among five or six restaurants looking at or negotiating for space near the Mellon Square area, he said.\n\nThe Davis Companies, the new Boston-based owner of the Union Trust Building on Grant Street, is preparing a redevelopment plan for the property, with one its goals to revive its first-floor retail space, most of which now is vacant.\n\nPart of the building is at the south end of Mellon Square, and the new retail could provide another spark for the corridor, Mr. Pollock said.\n\n\u201cThe Davis Companies has very ambitious plans for the overall redevelopment of the Union Trust Building, and we are about to embark on both office and retail plans that will forever reshape that building,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Pollock also reported substantial interest from retailers in the former Office Depot space on Smithfield in the Heinz 57 building, the former Gimbels department store. At one time, discount fashion retailers such as T.J. Maxx and Marshalls were eyeing it.\n\nOxford Development Co. is mulling whether to rehabilitate its existing office building at 441 Smithfield or build a new high-rise. With either option, about 12,000 to 15,000 square feet of street-level retail space will be available.\n\nNear Mellon Square, the 24,860-square-foot building that housed the former Smithfield Cafe for decades sold last month for $900,000 to 635 Smithfield Street LLC, a New York City investment group. Elizabeth Judge, a Realtor involved in the sale, said she\u2019s not sure what the new owners intend to do with the building but expects the first floor will be dedicated to retail or a restaurant.\n\nJohn Valentine, executive director of the Pittsburgh Downtown Community Development Corp., has counted at least 14 vacant spaces on Smithfield that could play host to retailers or restaurants.\n\nHe believes the corridor\u2019s revival hinges on Mr. Peduto\u2019s plans to restore the street, bring in regional retail, upgrade sidewalks and lighting and make other improvements.\n\n\u201cI think once the mayor implements his plan for Smithfield being a shopping destination, I think the potential for Smithfield is enormous,\u201d he said.\n\nIzzy Rudolph, project manager for McKnight Realty Partners, which owns the Oliver and Heinz 57 buildings, said the Mellon Square rehab already is having an impact. A year ago, prospective office tenants at the Oliver Building, which overlooks the square, did not want to be on the same side as the park, as it was still under construction. That has since changed.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to be near the park now. It\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he said.\n\nLike Mr. Pollock, he believes great things are ahead for the area. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the magnet in the center [of Downtown],\u201d he said.\n\nSome predict Wood Street also will become more retail-centric in the future. Rich Beynon, president of the Beynon & Co. real estate firm, said a lot of restaurants and retailers now want to be in or near Market Square and that Wood Street can benefit from that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see it as a secondary location because of the demand. You just can\u2019t get into the square anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nAdding to Wood Street\u2019s potential prominence is the fact that Point Park University and the cultural district anchor its two ends, he said. The construction of the 33-story Tower at PNC Plaza high-rise between Fifth and Forbes avenues and the Gardens at Market Square mixed-use development on Forbes also will enhance it.\n\nWood already is seeing signs of improvement, with Eat\u2019n Park planning to open a Hello Bistro in the Italian Sons and Daughters of America building on Forbes. The Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation is marketing first-floor retail space in two renovated buildings across the street.\n\nMr. Pollock said one thing that could hold Wood Street back is the limited availability of additional retail space in the corridor. He said the new PNC building essentially eliminated three blocks of retail. The new skyscraper will have minimal retail.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, PNC missed an opportunity to further enhance Wood Street given [its]lack of attention to retail in [its] new building,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason Mr. Pollock sees Smithfield as better situated for a retail renaissance. For Jack Cohen, owner of S.W. Randall Toyes and Giftes on Smithfield, it can\u2019t come soon enough.\n\nWhile his business has been good, he said others have struggled and the street has long been overlooked.\n\nRedevelopment \u201ccould only help. It can\u2019t hurt,\u201d said Mr. Pollock.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some believe the area around the newly restored park could be primed to become one of Downtown\u2019s next hot spots for restaurants and retail.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "Could Mellon Square become the next Market Square?
