(Photo: FILE PHOTO )Buy Photo\n\nPolice have recovered a black Toyota Corolla that was hijacked from a food delivery man at gunpoint Friday night, officials have confirmed.\n\nThe vehicle was found abandoned near a playground on Hearthstone Drive Monday afternoon, said Sgt. Kevin Doyle. The Ocean County Sheriff Department's K-9 unit was brought in to search the car for clues, however Doyle said police have no suspects in custody at this point.\n\nThe vehicle was stolen from Laurel Avenue when two male suspects \u2014 one black and one Hispanic \u2014 robbed a Chinese food delivery man with a gun sometime after 7 p.m. Friday, according to police.\n\nThe 31-year-old delivery man from Hackensack told police the black man placed him in a choke hold and pointed the gun at his side as he was trying to deliver food. The Hispanic man then told the delivery man to be quiet and took his food and money, police say.\n\nRead more Jersey mayhem stories\n\nThe suspects then demanded the victim walk away from the area and the pair drove away in his black 2011 Toyota Corolla. They were last seen driving eastbound on Laurel Avenue.\n\nLakewood Detective Sgt. Greg Staffordsmith said it doesn't appear the two men were associated with the house the delivery man was taking food to.\n\n\"We don't know if they were originally intended to receive the food,\" Staffordsmith said.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call Staffordsmith at 732-363-0200 ext. 5318.\n\nDan Radel: 732-643-4072; dradel@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1ugG9fY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The vehicle, a black Toyotoa, was found abandoned near a playground on Hearthstone Drive", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "The vehicle, a black Toyotoa, was found abandoned near a playground on Hearthstone Drive", "title": "Lakewood police find stolen car in Chinese food heist", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2014/11/10/lakewood-police-find-stolen-car-chinese-food-heist/18826457/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The vehicle, a black Toyotoa, was found abandoned near a playground on Hearthstone Drive", "title": "Lakewood police find stolen car in Chinese food heist", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4d478ebdf44710cd79eace5f95065847043d2708/c=186-0-837-651&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/11/11/police.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Police have recovered a black Toyota Corolla that was highjacked from a food delivery man in Lakewood at gunpoint Friday night, officials have confirmed.\n(Photo: FILE PHOTO )Buy PhotoPolice have recovered a black Toyota Corolla that was hijacked from a food delivery man at gunpoint Friday night, officials have confirmed.\nThe Hispanic man then told the delivery man to be quiet and took his food and money, police say.\n\"We don't know if they were originally intended to receive the food,\" Staffordsmith said.\nGreg Staffordsmith said it doesn't appear the two men were associated with the house the delivery man was taking food to."}
