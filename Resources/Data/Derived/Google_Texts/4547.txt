It's been about a few weeks since one of Panama City's popular electronics and appliance stores shut down due to smoke damage from a small fire.

Sunday, customers from all around the area filled Best Buy on 23rd street as employees reopened the store for business.

"I mean now, you've got your store back open, you can go in and purchase your items and we're back to normal," Carolyn Cook, a customer from Vernon said.

"It looks like it's coming together all over again," Hector Rodriguez, a customer from Callaway said. "It seems they're back in business in Panama City."

Best Buy officials said they're extending their holiday return policy, and also gave out coupons to customers while the store was closed.
