He is married to another Real World alum, Rachel Campos.\n\nThe interview got its start with Mitchell raising the disturbing issue that the Pentagon, as it stands now, won\u2019t be sending benefits to the families of brave soldiers who died in battle in Afghanistan during the government shutdown.\n\nAccording to AP, \u201cThe Pentagon typically pays out $100,000 within three days of a soldier\u2019s death. But it says the shutdown means there is no authority now to pay the money.\u201d\n\nDuffy said the House will pass a bill tomorrow that will reauthorize the continuance of those payments to the families who have lost loved ones in combat. Mitchell criticized piecemeal spending bills of this kind, and Duffy agreed with her, but pointed out that President Obama has announced that he won\u2019t negotiate an end to the impasse between the House and the Senate. Mitchell pushed back, claiming the GOP was making a non-negotiable demand about Obamacare, a.k.a. the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn response, the congressman raised two issues about Obamacare. Republicans want a one-year delay in Obamacare for individuals similar to what the administration granted to big business, and that the president \u201cinstead of his gold-plated healthcare plan\u201d should go into the Obamacare health marketplace to obtain coverage just like members of Congress and the rest of America.\n\nDuffy then chided Mitchell and the rest of the media other than Jon Stewart for failing to ask the president why families are being treated differently than big business as far as a delay in the Obamacare mandate. Duffy added that any individual can sign up on a voluntary basis now \u2014 assuming the online health exchange websites work \u2014 but that the mandatory nature of Obamacare should be delayed for consumers as it already has for business.\n\nThe lawmaker also insisted that all members of Congress and their staffs are covered by Obamacare, which seemed to come as a surprise to Mitchell. \u201cWhy should members of Congress be under Obamacare and not the president. Isn\u2019t that fair? Can you defend that?\u201d asked Duffy.\n\nMitchell was unable to muster much of a response. Watch the video below and decide for yourself who got the better of the MSNBC segment.\n\nIt\u2019s been previously reported that the president granted an Obamacare waiver to Congress. According to the Washington Post, that is inaccurate, as Sean Duffy contended. \u201c\u2026 congressional lawmakers and their staff are being kicked off of their longtime federal health-benefits plan and being set loose on the famous exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act\u2026 Congress and its staffers will be booted from the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program effective Dec. 31 of this year. They\u2019ll then have to shop on the exchanges, with the help of the employer contribution that they now enjoy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Was the ex-Real World star \"keeping it real\" on MSNBC?
