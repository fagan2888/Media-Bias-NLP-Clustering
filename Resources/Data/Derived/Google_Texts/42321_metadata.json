Another 17 percent say they want the law to remain as is.\n\nRelated: GOP Strategy on Obamacare: Repair or Repeal?\n\nThe poll comes as both parties are strategizing about how to use Obamacare to their advantage in the upcoming midterm elections. The veteran pollsters, Democratic strategist Peter Hart and Republican strategist Bill Mcinturff, said the results are particularly challenging to the GOP\u2014since voters want to keep the law and some Republicans are still pushing to repeal it. Just yesterday the House voted for the 50th time to repeal or dismantle the president\u2019s health care law.\n\nHart warned that if Republicans pursue Obamacare too aggressively they could alienate voters. \u201cIf Republicans go too far overboard\u201d attacking Obamacare \u201cthe public will just back away,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they become the force against fixing this, it could put them in a negative position.\u201d\n\nStill, the pollsters say the midterm election season is already shaping up in favor of the Republicans. But they cautioned that it is far too early to tell how the president\u2019s health care law will influence Americans in the voting booth.\n\n\u201cThere are still 235 days to go until Election Day\u2014still plenty of time for voters\u2019 opinions on Obamacare to change,\u201d Hart said.\n\nRelated: How Obamacare Could Affect Your Taxes This Year\n\nThe survey found that health care is the second most important issue to voters this year, right behind the economy. Just 9 percent of respondents said health care is the most important issue.\n\nThe pollsters said things that are still likely to determine how the law will impact voters include premiums and out of pocket costs, how state exchanges are shaping up and how many people have lost coverage because of the law.\n\nAlthough several surveys have found that premiums under Obamacare policies are cheaper than employer sponsored care, the plans\u2019 out-of-pocket costs tend to be more expensive.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Sticker Shock Found in Deductibles, Not Premiums\n\nMcIntruff said the biggest challenge to Democrats is that there is not enough time to repair negative impressions of the health care law. He said Republicans will likely be highlighting the costs associated with implementing the new law.\n\n\u201cThe federal government spent more than $300 million to get people signed up on Oregon\u2019s state exchange. Where the hell did the money go? People will see we spent $50,000, $80,000 per person to sign them up for coverage,\u201d McIntruff said. \u201cThe disaster in a handful of states is something you\u2019ll be hearing about in the next couple of months.\u201d\n\nThe White House has been on the defensive ahead of the midterms in order to quash negative stories surrounding the law\u2019s nightmarish rollout. Just yesterday, the Obama administration announced new Obamacare delays allowing insurers to continue offering plans that are noncompliant with the new law. Though the White House says the change was made to help ease the transition into the new law, many speculate that it was politically motivated to help Democrats in November.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Though the majority of Americans have an unfavorable view of Obamacare\u2014most say they w", "title": "Americans Want to Fix, Not Repeal Obamacare", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/06/Americans-Want-Fix-Not-Repeal-Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11072013_Obamacare_Cast_Girl.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/06/Americans-Want-Fix-Not-Repeal-Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11072013_Obamacare_Cast_Girl.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Though the majority of Americans have an unfavorable view of Obamacare\u2014most say they w", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb2ea\"", "article_summary": "Just yesterday the House voted for the 50th time to repeal or dismantle the president\u2019s health care law.\nRelated: GOP Strategy on Obamacare: Repair or Repeal?\nBut they cautioned that it is far too early to tell how the president\u2019s health care law will influence Americans in the voting booth.\nJust 9 percent of respondents said health care is the most important issue.\nRelated: Obamacare Sticker Shock Found in Deductibles, Not PremiumsMcIntruff said the biggest challenge to Democrats is that there is not enough time to repair negative impressions of the health care law."}
