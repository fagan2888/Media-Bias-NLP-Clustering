Accenture projects that total enrollment will reach 40 million by 2018.\n\nAccenture highlighted factors it sees as driving enrollment growth, and one of those factors was the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's \"Cadillac tax,\" which is a 40 percent excise tax on high cost health insurance plans that some employers offer their workers. The tax is set to go into effect in 2018. According to Accenture, the tax could affect as many as 38 percent of large employers and 17 percent of all U.S. businesses if insufficient action is taken. Accenture projects that private health insurance exchange enrollment will spike in 2017 as employers look to avoid looming penalties for \"Cadillac\" plans.\n\nAdditionally, Accenture pointed to employers' drive to meet the expectations of consumers, who want choice and flexibility.\n\nThis was the third analysis and projection of U.S. enrollment in private health insurance exchanges conducted by Accenture. Accenture focused on individuals and dependents under the age of 65 who receive group health insurance through an employer, and calculated current 2015 enrollment by assessing enrollment activity in private health insurance exchanges through March 2015. Where relevant, findings are included from an Accenture survey of 2,709 U.S. employees, between the ages of 18 and 64, who receive health benefits from their employer. The research was conducted in March 2015.\n\nMore articles on healthcare finance:\n\nSentara Healthcare net surplus falls to $359.9M\n\n13 recent hospital outlook and rating actions\n\n10 hospital CFOs in the headlines this week\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
