Streeter is the program director for Operation My Hometown, and his job is to help Hindenburg get a good start outside prison walls.\n\nRelease is a challenging time for formerly incarcerated people. In California, 65 percent of people return to prison within the first three years of leaving. Usually, they recidivate within the first year, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. To counter those daunting numbers, the Federal Justice Department funded Operation My Hometown in 2011 to target inmates at high-risk of returning to jail.\n\nStreeter is already strategizing about what he\u2019ll do when he meets Hindenburg.\n\n\u201cUsually they\u2019re hungry,\" he says. \u201cHe was probably awakened at three o'clock in the morning, brought to a holding cell, shifted to another holding cell, and then brought to the final place where he\u2019s going to leave.\u201d\n\nStreeter tells me Hindenburg was picked up for a probation violation in Berkeley and sent back to jail.\n\n\u201cHe had a knife on him, and it was a pocket knife, and he was violated for that. I do believe he had to do six months, which did not sound right to me that he would do so long,\" he says.\n\nStreeter is not clear on the specifics of Hindenburg\u2019s crimes, because even though Operation My Home Town is financed through the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Department, it has very little to do with the courts. In fact, Streeter says he doesn\u2019t pay much attention to the specific offenses his clients committed.\n\n\u201cIf I was concerned about the crimes he did, I wouldn\u2019t be able to work with them, because it would fall into a judgment class, and that is not what my position and capacity is based on,\" Streeter says.\n\nWhat Streeter knows is that Hindenburg is in his forties and homeless. And Streeter is worried about his future.\n\nSteps to self-reliance\n\nWe arrive at the jail around 10:30 a.m. As we walk from the parking lot to the jail lobby, Streeter points to some men waiting at a bus stop.\n\n\u201cYou will have, on average, 75 to 100 people coming and going daily. So they\u2019ll bring a busload of people, and then they can ship out a busload of people,\" he says.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear where those at the bus stop will be heading to next.\n\nWhen we enter the lobby of the jail, Streeter disappears to retrieve Hindenburg, who is waiting for him, while I wait in the lobby with family members, case workers, and lawyers.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, they emerge.\n\nHindenburg is wearing an oversized white shirt and carrying a plastic bag with all of his belongings. The heavy-set man follows closely behind Streeter as they walk outside.\n\nStreeter asked Hindenburg how he feels.\n\n\u201cI feel really happy to be released, you know what I mean?\u201d he asks.\n\nBut he\u2019s tired too. He tells us that he woke up at 4:00 a.m., had a little breakfast, and has been mostly waiting since. It\u2019s now nearly 11:00 a.m.\n\nI ask what he did in the past after getting released from a stint in jail.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be homeless. I just go back to Hayward and fall back to whatever I was doing. Drugs, you know what I mean?\u201d he asks. \u201cI want to stay out of that right now. I want to see if I can get my daughter. My daughter Maria, I really love her, and ever since I've been here she\u2019s been in CPS.\u201d\n\nMaria is six years old. Hindenburg says she came to visit once from Child Protective Services while he was in jail last November.\n\nEvery one of Streeter\u2019s 14 clients has a different goal that might keep them on track. For some, it\u2019s going back to school. For others it\u2019s avoiding an overdose. Streeter is going to do his best to help Hindenburg meet his goal of getting his daughter back, but it will take time.\n\nWe walk back to the car. Before driving to San Leandro, we grab lunch. Then it's on to the headquarters of Operation My Hometown.\n\nAt the headquarters, where three other case managers work, Streeter runs into the manager of Dig Deep, a local organic farm that employs formerly incarcerated people.\n\nTogether, they find a slot for Hindenburg to interview for a job later in the day.\n\nIn his small office, Streeter walks Hindenburg through a packet of documents he needs to sign in order to enroll in Operation My Hometown. The Affordable Care Act now reimburses Operation My Home Town for many of the services it provides, making the program more sustainable long term.\n\nNext, Hindenburg gets his interview with Dig Deep Farms and lands the job. Things are going smoothly. That's not always the case.\n\n\u201cThis is extremely unusual for him to be released from jail, and then walk right into an interview that is a full time position,\u201d he says. \u201cUsually, it\u2019s a process. It can take three or four weeks.\u201d\n\nStreeter is piecing together the steps for Hindenburg. Since he will have an income from his work at Dig Deep, he\u2019s on the road to being able to get get his own place eventually.\n\nBut for now, Hindenburg will be staying at a place called Crossroads. It's a temporary shelter in East Oakland that also helps people get medical treatment, housing, and jobs. Streeter arranged for Hindenburg to stay there before picking him up from the jail. The handoff is quick, and Streeter and I are back on the road.\n\nSuccesses and failures\n\nWhile Streeter drives me back to BART, he rattles off stories of former and current clients who have had varying degrees of success. One woman he worked with got kicked out of her first shelter before getting on her feet.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s back with her husband, she graduated from a two-year college, they\u2019re ready to buy a house,\u201d Streeter says. \u201cI also worked with her husband. He was a career criminal.\u201d\n\nBut, it turns out Hindenburg is not one of those successes, at least not yet. Three days after we drop him off, he leaves Crossroads and doesn't come back.\n\n\u201cBut you know the door is always open,\u201d Streeter says, optimistically. \u201cIf you want to live. Come on, you can do it. We can help you.\u201d\n\nOperation My Hometown is just three years old. Streeter tells me that of the 150 people they\u2019ve served so far, about a quarter have accomplished the goals they established at the beginning.\n\nThe rest follow a path more like Hindenburg. That doesn\u2019t mean they end up back in jail, but they lose track of what they set out to do and stop working with Streeter.\n\nThese men and women have spent years cycling in and out of jail with little or no support in between. The process of remedying that will likely take longer than an afternoon, but it\u2019s where Alameda County is starting right now.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Cops & Courts", "description": "Arthur Streeter is taking me to meet an inmate who\u2019s going to be released from jail today. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to pick him up and get something to eat,\u201d", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "Crosscurrents", "og": {"url": "http://kalw.org/post/antidote-time-served-alameda-county-s-operation-my-hometown", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kalw/files/styles/medium/public/201408/9625827374_2b63cd9dd9_o.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Arthur Streeter is taking me to meet an inmate who\u2019s going to be released from jail today. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to pick him up and get something to eat,\u201d", "title": "An antidote to time served: Alameda County\u2019s Operation My Hometown"}, "story_id": 342015039, "twitter": {"site": "@kalw", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Charlotte Silver", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "An antidote to time served: Alameda County\u2019s Operation My Hometown"}, "nid": 48235, "datePublished": "2014-08-20", "keywords": "Reentry, alameda county, realignment, CDCR", "wordCount": 1669, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdffe\"", "article_summary": "Streeter tells me that of the 150 people they\u2019ve served so far, about a quarter have accomplished the goals they established at the beginning.\nStreeter is the program director for Operation My Hometown, and his job is to help Hindenburg get a good start outside prison walls.\nTo counter those daunting numbers, the Federal Justice Department funded Operation My Hometown in 2011 to target inmates at high-risk of returning to jail.\nIn his small office, Streeter walks Hindenburg through a packet of documents he needs to sign in order to enroll in Operation My Hometown.\nThen it's on to the headquarters of Operation My Hometown."}
