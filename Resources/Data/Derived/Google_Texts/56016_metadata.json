The symbolic loss of innocence springs from the idea that a woman is no longer a virgin when her hymen, or \u201ccherry,\u201d has been \u201cbroken.\u201d The myth, however, is false since the hymen does not break; it stretches open.\n\nWhen a girl is born, her hymen is thick and contains a small opening, which allows for menstrual flow when the time comes. The membrane thins out over the years as she reaches adolescence, while the opening enlarges. Some of the tissue is worn away or torn during strenuous exercise, tampon use, and masturbation, among other forms of penetration. By the time a young woman loses her virginity, the hymenal tissue\u2019s elasticity and widened hole allow for stretching when the male enters.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that the hymen almost never covers the entire vagina. When it does \u2014 a rare condition known as imperforate hymen \u2014 a doctor must surgically remove excess tissue. Therefore, for most women, the membrane is simply stretched out or torn. The idea of the hymen \u201cbreaking,\u201d then is just a poor choice of words. So is \u201ccherry\u201d and \u201cdeflowering,\u201d for that matter.\n\nWatch the video below for a detailed breakdown of what happens to the hymen when a girl loses her virginity:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pop, your, cherry, myth, false, hymens, stretched, open, not, broken", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Contrary to long-held belief, the hymen does not \"break\" but instead stretches, as it already has an opening.", "title": "Why The Phrase \u2018Pop Your Cherry\u2019 Doesn't Make Sense [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pop-your-cherry-myth-false-hymens-stretched-open-not-broken-271196", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/13/shutterstock168088331.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Contrary to long-held belief, the hymen does not \"break\" but instead stretches, as it already has an opening.", "title": "Why The Phrase \u2018Pop Your Cherry\u2019 Doesn't Make Sense [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pop-your-cherry-myth-false-hymens-stretched-open-not-broken-271196", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/13/shutterstock168088331.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/13/shutterstock168088331.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-03-14T10:04:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-14T10:04:39-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Contrary to long-held belief, the hymen does not \"break\" but instead stretches, as it already has an opening."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc7a5\"", "article_summary": "Contrary to long-held belief, the hymen does not \"break\" but instead stretches, as it already has an opening.\nBy the time a young woman loses her virginity, the hymenal tissue\u2019s elasticity and widened hole allow for stretching when the male enters.\nThe symbolic loss of innocence springs from the idea that a woman is no longer a virgin when her hymen, or \u201ccherry,\u201d has been \u201cbroken.\u201d The myth, however, is false since the hymen does not break; it stretches open.\nWatch the video below for a detailed breakdown of what happens to the hymen when a girl loses her virginity:\nSome of the tissue is worn away or torn during strenuous exercise, tampon use, and masturbation, among other forms of penetration."}
