It's a real happening,\u201d Crocker said, still beaming.\n\nThis is the 16th year the Tampa Theatre has hosted a night for the Oscars. Sunday's event, dubbed Hollywood Awards Night, is billed as Tampa's longest running Academy Awards viewing party.\n\nLast year, Crocker and her then 89-year-old mother, Jo Devo, were the ones whooping and hollering behind the red rope as others popped from the limo.\n\nThis time around, Crocker, who has been to the event six previous times, wanted a different perspective. She spent the night with a couple of friends, giving her feet a rest.\n\n\u201cI am a movie-goer and I definitely appreciate the Oscars,\u201d Crocker said. \u201c(But walking the red carpet), this absolutely is the best.\u201d\n\nIn past years, the annual event was known as Oscar Night America because it was sanctioned by the Academy of Motion Pictures and Arts and Sciences. The academy took a year off from sanctioning events, but allowed the parties to continue without the word \u201cOscars.\u201d\n\nFor Jaimes Southworth, 10, and her sister, Jordyn Southworth, 13, the name of the night didn't matter. They walked the red carpet with their father, Levi, in tow \u2014 recording everything with his phone.\n\n\u201cIt's very exciting because I have never been here (for the Oscars),\u201d Jaimes Southworth said.\n\nAs she walked the carpet into the theater, the night's emcee, Roan Jivers, a spoof of comedienne Joan Rivers, pretended Jaimes was Emma Watson.\n\nJordyn Southworth was certainly in her element. She got a taste of what could be in her future.\n\n\u201cI want to be an actress when I grow up,\u201d she said. \u201cI think this is a lot of motivation. I love the photographers and the autographs.\u201d\n\nTampa Theatre CEO and President John Bell stood at the front of the venue, taking in all of the raucous.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to it every year and there's a chance for us to have fun with Tampa's audiences and film fans,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThey get to come down and we replicate the red carpet experience. We know we're not in Hollywood, but we have a lot of fun with it. In many ways, we have so much fun with it, it's almost a cheesy event.\u201d\n\nSome of that cheese, no doubt, came from Jivers as she interviewed people on the carpet. She also provided a little stand-up comedy.\n\nWhile admiring one woman's dress, she quipped: \u201cTaylor Swift wore dresses longer than her last three relationships.\u201d\n\nShe moved on to another fan, asking who she was wearing, meaning what designer.\n\nThe response: \u201cLeonardo DiCaprio.\u201d\n\nThe slip up drew a chorus of laughs from the crowd.\n\nNewton Linebaugh, a member of the New York Yankees front office staff, attended the event with Kelly Bilger.\n\n\u201cIt's always a nice evening here,\u201d Linebaugh said, adding it was about his fourth time at the event. \u201cIt's quite a lot of fun. This is a big night for America.\u201d\n\nBoth found themselves in front of Jivers' microphone on the way in and had fun with it.\n\n\u201cYou feed off the vibe of the audience,\u201d Bilger said, \u201cand it's all about the charity inside.\u201d\n\nThe charity was in the silent auction taking place inside. Items ranging from dinner to a wine basket were up for grabs. The proceeds from the auction go to help fund the theater, Bell said.\n\nedaniels@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 371-1860\n\nTwitter: @EDanielsTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 02 Mar 2014 20:54:35 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Grinning, her eyes tucked behind a pair of large, black-framed glasses, Sandy Crocker climbed out of a limousine, crossed the red carpet and went directly to a line of screaming \u201c", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Grinning, her eyes tucked behind a pair of large, black-framed glasses, Sandy Crocker climbed out of a limousine, crossed the red carpet and went directly to a line of screaming \u201c", "title": "Tampa Theatre rolls out red carpet for Oscars viewing party", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/events/tampa-theatre-rolls-out-red-carpet-for-oscars-viewing-party-20140302/", "image": {"width": 319, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140302/ARTICLE/140309838/EP/1/2/EP-140309838.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2014-03-03T05:47:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Grinning, her eyes tucked behind a pair of large, black-framed glasses, Sandy Crocker climbed out of a limousine, crossed the red carpet and went directly to a line of screaming \u0336", "title": "Tampa Theatre rolls out red carpet for Oscars viewing party", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140302/ARTICLE/140309838/AR/0/AR-140309838.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-03-02T20:54:35Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-03-03T05:47:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Oscar viewing,Tampa"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24b1\"", "article_summary": "This is the 16th year the Tampa Theatre has hosted a night for the Oscars.\nThey walked the red carpet with their father, Levi, in tow \u2014 recording everything with his phone.\n\u201cThey get to come down and we replicate the red carpet experience.\nIt's not everyday life, but when you're at the Tampa Theatre to watch a live feed of the 86th Academy Awards, that's what you do.\nSunday's event, dubbed Hollywood Awards Night, is billed as Tampa's longest running Academy Awards viewing party."}
