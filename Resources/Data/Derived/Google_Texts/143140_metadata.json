Since his arrest this week, the public has speculated what has driven such a successful artist to consistently engage in high-risk, dangerous behavior. Well, as the NY Daily News suggests, maybe the young singer is hooked on \u201csizzurp,\u201d a drink that produces a \u201cslowed down, sleepy high.\u201d But he\u2019s not the only one who indulges in the party drink. Many American teens take the drug, too.\n\n\u201cThis is a very dangerous drug,\u201d said Dr. Robert Glatter of Lenox Hill Hospital, according to NBC News' Today.com. \u201cIt can lead to seizures and essentially lead you to stop breathing.\u201d\n\nSizzurp, also known as \u201cpurple drank,\u201d \u201csyrup,\u201d and \u201clean,\u201d is a liquid mixture that usually contains jolly rancher candy, soda, and prescription-strength cough syrup. The active ingredients in prescription cough syrup are codeine and promethazine. Codeine is a pain reliever. Promethazine is a sedative antihistamine. The strongest versions of sizzurp contain codeine and hydrocodone. Sometimes, if the drink is mixed with alcohol or other prescription drugs like Xanax, users\u2019 breathing slows down so much that it can be fatal. \"There have been some reports of people dying because they stopped breathing,\" said Dr. Joseph Lee, according to the Daily News.\n\nThough there are few concrete studies on sizzurp use, The Hollywood Reporter says that a 2012 survey found that 5.5 percent of American 12th graders admitted to getting high from consuming cough medicine in various forms. Recent reports suggest that Bieber\u2019s management team is urging the singer, who is just 19 years old, to go to rehab for prescription drug abuse and overuse of sizzurp. Sizzurp is \u201cquite addictive,\u201d Glatter said, according to Today.com. \u201cThe sweetness of the soda and candy combined with the drug itself makes people want to have this all day long. ... They just don\u2019t know how much they\u2019ve had throughout the day and by then, it\u2019s almost too late.\u201d\n\nAnd apparently sizzurp is growing in popularity. Most notably, superstar rapper Lil' Wayne praised the dangerous drink in songs and interviews. However, since enduring a series of health problems last March, the drinker has publicly said that he no longer indulges in the drink. \u201cI had been taking pain pills and those have codeine in them,\u201d Wayne told the Young, Black and Fabulous gossip blog. \u201cI can't do that anymore. Because the doctors said so.\u201d\n\nIn any case, hopefully Bieber will get the help for his addiction if he needs it. For now though, he\u2019s still partying it up in Miami.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "justin bieber, sizzurp, drugs, codiene cocktail", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Justin Bieber may be addicted to a codeine cocktail commonly called \"sizzurp.\" The drink is growing in popularity among American teens, but just how unhealthy is it?", "title": "More And More Teens Are Indulging In Justin Bieber\u2019s Dangerous Codeine Cocktail", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/justin-bieber-drinks-sizzurp-and-hes-not-only-one-your-teen-may-be-sipping-codeine-cocktail-too", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/24/7156664925a8304a481az.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Justin Bieber may be addicted to a codeine cocktail commonly called \"sizzurp.\" The drink is growing in popularity among American teens, but just how unhealthy is it?", "title": "More And More Teens Are Indulging In Justin Bieber\u2019s Dangerous Codeine Cocktail", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/justin-bieber-drinks-sizzurp-and-hes-not-only-one-your-teen-may-be-sipping-codeine-cocktail-too", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/24/7156664925a8304a481az.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/24/7156664925a8304a481az.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-24T17:40:47-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-24T17:40:46-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Justin Bieber may be addicted to a codeine cocktail commonly called \"sizzurp.\" The drink is growing in popularity among American teens, but just how unhealthy is it?"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is a very dangerous drug,\u201d said Dr. Robert Glatter of Lenox Hill Hospital, according to NBC News' Today.com.\nThe active ingredients in prescription cough syrup are codeine and promethazine.\nMost notably, superstar rapper Lil' Wayne praised the dangerous drink in songs and interviews.\nRecent reports suggest that Bieber\u2019s management team is urging the singer, who is just 19 years old, to go to rehab for prescription drug abuse and overuse of sizzurp.\nBecause the doctors said so.\u201dIn any case, hopefully Bieber will get the help for his addiction if he needs it."}
