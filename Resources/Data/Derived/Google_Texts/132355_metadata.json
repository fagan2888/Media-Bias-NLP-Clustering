A supercomputer that contains all kinds of data on everybody, a \u201cjust machine that makes wise decisions.\u201d Some people act like it\u2019s still a good idea, and yet such a Brave New World has never worked. The problem boils down to the imperfections in knowledge and character that plague humankind. Centralization of control is a bad idea because none of us is as smart as all of us. It is also scary because the few in power might become unstable. And so it is worrisome that this country\u2019s government is strong-arming people into becoming dependent on it for food and medicine.\n\nWe continue to hear about problems with the Obamacare program. It has been said that government software is no stranger to glitches. In 2004, a glitch required persons to have a driver\u2019s license from Guam to be eligible for food stamps. In 2013, an oopsie in Georgia\u2019s food stamp software failed to issue renewal notices, terminating benefits for 66,000 people.\n\nPoor people have learned to live with delays in food and services, commonly referred to as \u201cprocessing.\u201d Now that the working and educated classes are becoming reliant on government programs, they are complaining.\n\nNorth Carolina has its own examples. According to one study, between 2004 and 2013, only 5 percent of state IT projects were successful. The other 95 percent of the time, projects were overbudget, delayed, or abandoned. The analysis of 84 projects concluded they were, on average, double the contracted cost and one year late. Commenting on the 5 percent, State Auditor Beth Wood remarked, \u201cBut then they work horrible and are not even close to what the citizens need.\u201d Wood went on to explain the problems as due to poor planning, poor monitoring, insufficient IT support, and contracts that don\u2019t hold programming firms accountable.\n\nBack in 2013, North Carolina made national headlines for sending 49,000 Medicaid cards for children to the wrong address. More recently, the state has had problems with NC FAST, the new name for food stamps. Just about everybody enrolled in the program suffered some form of setback, but 30,000 families were without benefits for over a month because the new software used by case workers was either timing out while processing or rejecting or losing applications. In July, the program crashed for a few weeks. The mess-ups were so bad, USDA Regional Administrator Donald Arnett remarked, \u201cThese delays are completely unacceptable, and a serious failure on the part of North Carolina.\u201d\n\nAt the time, North Carolina passed the buck. DHHS Secretary Aldona Wos explained, \u201cThe counties that were prepared, the counties that the county commissioners had authorized more staff for departments, where the departments were on top of that training, where their staff were working with us \u2013 those counties had relatively very little problems. . . . So it\u2019s not computer glitches.\u201d\n\nWhile counties went through the motions to convince the state the problem was not on their end, the firm hired to write the software came under fire. The state contracted with Accenture to convert some software used in Ireland into NC FAST. Accenture is viewed by some to be politically-connected. After all, it spent $87,000 lobbying the state in 2010, the year the firm won the contract.\n\nAccenture landed a $90 million contract to write software for Obamacare after Texas cut their contract with them for CHIP, food stamps, and Medicaid. Reasons cited included, delays, inaccuracies, and a $100 million overrun. Upon awarding the contract to another firm, Maximus, the problems were resolved. To date, Colorado, Florida, Wyoming, Kansas, Wisconsin, and Texas have cancelled their contracts with Accenture, due to computer problems.\n\nIn North Carolina, it is estimated that 10 percent of the government\u2019s caseload was picked up by food banks, while the DHHS authorized the hiring of 160 temporary employees and transferred others to the help desk. Eventually, it was discovered that a lot of the problems with the software could be solved if case workers used only Google Chrome for their browser. But problems persist.\n\nThe federal government was able to hire top-notch tech support from Google and Oracle to work out the bugs. States do not have that level of resources to deal with problems caused by trying to comply with federal mandates.\n\nAt the last meeting of the Buncombe County Commissioners, County Manager Dr. Wanda Greene rued the predicament the county faced with NC FAST. Not too long ago, the problems were widespread. One could hardly go anywhere without finding somebody who did not get their food stamps at one time or another. People getting assistance for food were sharing their food stamps as they became available. Many did without.\n\nThis year, the county will spend an additional $3.6 million on social services. The county will increase its budget by $3.7 million for public service, but that includes the cost of building the new courthouse. The county plans to spend $45 million of its own tax collections on public assistance as it collects $373 million from other governments.\n\nCurrently, somewhere around 90 percent of the county\u2019s budget is mandated by state or federal government. Requirements come not only from legislators, but regulatory agencies as well. \u201cThe cost of providing mandated services frequently outpaces growth in revenues,\u201d lamented Greene.\n\nGreene did what representatives of government like to do these days, and explained how the money the state gives to one person is passed to vendors of goods and services, and so on, and so on. Groceries, and the county\u2019s large medical community are dependent on the money that flows from the federal and state government to those in need.\n\nThen, Greene got to what she called \u201cugly trends\u201d in welfare. Among these, the \u201cgreatest challenge\u201d was NC FAST. Since 2008, the county\u2019s need to provide food and nutrition services has increased 98 percent. During the same time, demand for Medicaid benefits has only increased 19 percent.\n\nNC FAST is the new food stamps program. It is computerized, because the federal government says it must be. States have selected a variety of software programs, but, responding to a question from Commissioner Holly Jones, Greene said that North Carolina is pretty much stuck with it my now.\n\nWhen \u201cglitches\u201d in the program were all over the news, and representatives from state government were blaming the counties. Greene reminded the commissioners that she and other members of staff had appeared before them multiple times during the crisis asking for budget amendments.\n\nThe county spent $460,000 trying to fix a problem that wasn\u2019t on their end. They expanded their wireless bandwidth, they upgraded the computer system, and they upgraded 300 computers. \u201cWe had to make the investment to prove we weren\u2019t the problem,\u201d Greene explained.\n\nThe federal government also requires that the program used to enroll people for food stamps be the gateway by which all other benefits may be received. Programs used to be administered in silos. Economic Services Director Phillip Hardin explained the county had been using at least fifteen DOS-based systems written with code developed in the 1980s. The systems were not interoperable, and so, \u201cWe may have had the same family receive benefits from three programs, and we were keying into three different systems to issue those benefits by three separate workers.\u201d\n\nThe new system was supposed to be efficient, and so county leadership is giving it time. Greene told how, when the county used the old system, it would only take 55 minutes to enroll somebody. Now it takes 109. Recertification of applicants used to only take 23 minutes. Now it takes 45. Last year, the county processed 20,000 applications and 24,000 recertifications. Greene showed a flow chart that was too small to see from the audience just to illustrate the increase in complexity. What used to be done in ten steps now required 17.\n\n\u201cWe had to hire fifteen new people working at a high level just to put the applications through NC FAST,\u201d said Greene. The intention was to become more efficient. In reality, it has become more cumbersome.\u201d To make matters worse, the federal government required the new hires to be \u201cfulltime\u201d and \u201cmerited.\u201d They also dictate staffing ratios.\n\nEven so, over the last eight months, the county has had to appropriate an extra $15 million to, in Greene\u2019s words, \u201cwork around NC FAST.\u201d Ingles provided $35,000 in gift cards, and MANNA Food Bank also stepped up to help make sure people could eat. \u201cThe county was very proactive in making sure that families did not go without,\u201d explained Hardin.\n\nThe problem is the state invested in a multimillion-dollar computer system, funded largely through federal grants. Greene said that even if the county had the money to buy an entirely new system that worked, the federal government would still require it to use NC FAST.\n\nAssistant County Manager Mandy Stone elaborated. NC FAST is a lot of old programs lumped into one. Each of those programs was complex as a standalone. Behind each of them are ten thousands of pages of policy. When a legislator decides to change the way the government does things, such as changing an age for eligibility, there will be major trickle-down.\n\nAdded to that are the \u201ccontinual changes in guidelines\u201d the large scope of the combined programs and the amount of data that must be collected on each citizen that enrolls. \u201cWe have to capture 31 new data points [for each citizen],\u201d Stone explained.\n\nTo date, the only programs up and running in the county\u2019s NC FAST system are food and nutrition services, Medicaid, and Work First. The federal government expects the county to get all its welfare services integrated into the program, and the program had to be rewritten some more to comply with a federal mandate that it be compatible with the Obamacare computers.\n\nSince the onset of Obamacare, 160,000 North Carolinians have enrolled in the federal marketplace. Stone told how the federal government requires applicants to first apply for Medicaid, because the law requires rejection by Medicaid before they may be considered for other programs. As it turns out, only about 7 percent of the 160,000 applicants in the state have been eligible, and so a lot of bandwidth has been gummed up only for the sake of going through the motions.\n\nAccording to Hardin, who believes everything will work out in time, \u201cTo some extent, it was like a perfect storm that happened all at one time, a new complex system, the ACA, and already increased caseloads over the past five years because of the economy.\u201d He added, \u201cI was in New Mexcico recently and was reading the paper about the problems they were having in delivering benefits, and it was like reading a newspaper in North Carolina: a new system, the ACA, and increased caseloads.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe had to hire fifteen new people working at a high level just to put the applications through NC FAST,\u201d said Greene.\nAt the last meeting of the Buncombe County Commissioners, County Manager Dr. Wanda Greene rued the predicament the county faced with NC FAST.\nMore recently, the state has had problems with NC FAST, the new name for food stamps.\nTo date, the only programs up and running in the county\u2019s NC FAST system are food and nutrition services, Medicaid, and Work First.\nAmong these, the \u201cgreatest challenge\u201d was NC FAST."}
