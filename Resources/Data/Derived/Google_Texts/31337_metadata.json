That has been the guiding light of the Hippocratic Oath for the physician-patient relationship for 2,500 years.\n\nIt takes on a broader meaning in modern medicine.\n\nAnd that\u2019s certainly the case for Dr. Michael Henderson, new chief medical officer for the University of Mississippi Medical Center.\n\nHis emphasis for the past decade in his long, prestigious career has been to limit what are called \u201chospital acquired conditions.\u201d\n\nThose include things such as infections, blood clots and bed sores, Henderson said. Some can even be fatal.\n\n\u201cMany of the things that we used to think were inevitable we can prevent,\u201d he said. While the goal is the ideal zero occurrence, that hasn\u2019t been achieved \u201cyet,\u201d Henderson observed.\n\nThe other side of the coin is improving performance.\n\n\u201cThe national movement is getting away from . . . getting paid for volume of stuff we do to getting paid for the value. Are we getting good outcomes?\u201d Henderson said.\n\nThe hospital achieved a world-class outcome in 1963, when Dr. James Hardy carried out the first successful lung transplant ever.\n\nUMMC celebrates that achievement with the annual Hardy Lecture, which this year happened to be the day before Henderson sat down for an interview.\n\nHenderson attended the University of St. Andrews at St. Andrews, Scotland, where his father was dean of the medical school.\n\nFrom there, he completed his surgical training at the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburg, Scotland before taking a position in 1978 at Emory University in Atlanta, where he started a liver transplant program.\n\nAfter 14 years at Emory, he moved to the renowned Cleveland Clinic, where he was chairman of surgery \u2014 and put together a transplant center. \u201cIt stimulated me to get involved in the transplant field nationally,\u201d Henderson said in a UMMC in-house publication.\n\nThe clinic, as a member of the Ohio Transplant Consortium, \u201cwas in the forefront of the nation\u2019s first efforts to create a database for organ donation and guidelines for allocation to patients,\u201d according to the UMMC article.\n\nDuring the second half of his 22-year tenure at the clinic, Henderson \u2014 now chairman of the advisory committee on surgical quality improvement for the American College of Surgeons \u2014 shifted to overseeing quality and safety outcomes, an emphasis he brings to UMMC.\n\nDr. Charles O\u2019Mara, associate vice chancellor for clinical affairs, was quoted in a UMMC publication on Aug. 18, 2014 as saying that patient care and safety were the most important things facing the institution.\n\nDr. William H. Cleland, then UMMC chief medical officer, was quoted as saying: \u201cWe want good outcomes for our patients, regardless of financial outcomes. We certainly aren\u2019t trying to tackle this because of the financial implications.\u201d Cleland retired on Aug. 31.\n\nThe implications at that time, according to the article, were penalties imposed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which began withholding 1 percent of all Medicare payments during the fiscal year that started Oct. 1.\n\nThe penalty is required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sometimes referred to as Obamacare.\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst rating, UMMC has a score of 8.05, which means a loss of $1.5 million in this federal fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. Additionally, private insurers have refused to pay $1.5 million in as all or part of bills of patients who suffered an HAC, the article said.\n\nRatings by the agency for some other institutions in the Southeast are as follows: University of Tennessee Regional Medical Center, 10; University of Alabama Hospital, 8; Emory University Hospital, 8; University of Arkansas Medical Center, 10, and Vanderbilt University Hospital, 3.\n\nHenderson, who took his new position on March 1, declined to comment on whether the recent controversy over the state College Board and its contract dispute with Dr. Dan Jones, chancellor of the University of Mississippi system, including UMMC, is having any effect on recruitment.\n\nHe said that whereas the first half of his tenure at the Cleveland Clinic involved recruitment of surgeons, that is not the case at UMMC.\n\nJones has accepted a position at the medical center as director of clinical and population sciences at the Mississippi Center for Obesity Research. He is a tenured professor at UMMC and a physician.\n\nHenderson said he decided to stay in the United States and not return to Scotland simply because of the wealth of opportunities in America. \u201cSupport for research for an academic was better in the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n\nThe National Health System in Great Britain is state-run and is truly socialized medicine, a fearsome specter to those who see Obamacare as a step in that direction.\n\nScotland was about a decade ahead of the United States in terms of quality, safety and outcomes, Henderson said. He said later in an email in response to a question that the NHS does have drawbacks, including longer wait times for surgery and more-restricted access to some specialty care.\n\nEmphasis on the three-part approach is crucial to bringing U.S. health-care costs under control. \u201cThe cost of health care in the United States is out of control,\u201d amounting to 18 percent of the gross national product, and growing, he said. But reports say that the increase has slowed in recent years.\n\n\u201cIt used to be every doctor had their way of doing it,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, because of strides in medicine and resulting complexity, the team approach \u2014 starting with the physician and including other professionals as well as the patient \u2014 is the new and evolving paradigm.\n\nThat means that a playbook is needed, a standardization of the best approach to treating an illness, he said.\n\nStandardization means better individualized care, he said. \u201cWho should go down this path or that path?\u201d Say that if an oncologist sees 50 cancer patients a year, perhaps the care should take one direction for five of them and 45 another.\n\n\u201cHow do we agree to get the five from 10 different doctors going down that smaller path?\u201d Henderson said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to date is that all 50 patients would probably all get the same treatment. They all didn\u2019t need the same treatment, as we learn more about the cancers.\u201d\n\nOn the macro level, the big picture is to focus on quality, safety and outcomes, he says.\n\nHenderson, 70, was asked if this is last medical assignment. He chuckled and said, \u201cI\u2019ve said that before,\u201d paused and said, \u201cProbably.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Mississippi Business Journal", "description": "By JACK WEATHERLY\u00a0\r\n\r\nDo no harm.
