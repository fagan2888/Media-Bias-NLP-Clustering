Frey tells FoxNews.com she\u2019s at her wit\u2019s end trying to decode what she needs to do to be able to see the doctor who diagnosed her lung cancer two years ago.\n\nShe also wants to be able to get referrals to see specialists in Manhattan and approval for six-month checkups, which include CAT scans and pulmonary function tests.\n\nBut so far, she hasn\u2019t been able to.\n\nFrey, now a small business owner, was forced to wait weeks to find out if she would even be able to see her primary care physician.\n\nShe was then repeatedly told one thing by her doctor\u2019s office, promised another by her insurance provider and left in limbo while trying to untangle the contradicting information on her own. Stuck in a cycle of misinformation, Frey has made close to 200 calls looking for services she says were promised when she signed up through the New York state exchange.\n\nNew York\u2019s exchange, called NY State of Health, allows customers to pick from dozens of plans offered by 16 insurance companies operating through it.\n\nFrey chose the most expensive one.\n\n\u201cI signed up for United Healthcare specifically because of the doctors I needed that were \u2018in network\u2019 \u2013 something I went to great lengths to verify before signing up,\u201d she told FoxNews.com.\n\nBut Frey says there was almost immediate confusion over which doctors and hospitals were actually participating in the plan. The lists of providers and services, she says, weren\u2019t matching up.\n\n\u201cTrying to make an informed choice with this insurance was virtually impossible,\u201d she said.\n\nFrey, who has worked in the health care field for 15 years, said she tried to contact doctors listed in the exchange to verify their participation only to be told they weren\u2019t in the network.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not stupid. I did my homework,\u201d she said. \u201cI called the doctors and they would say, \u2018We are absolutely not taking that insurance.\u2019\u201d\n\nUnited Healthcare says that Frey's case is unique and doesn't reflect how the company supports its members.\n\n\"Our New York State of Health Marketplace network is evolving in real-time,\" United Healthcare said in a written statement to FoxNews.com. \"Ms. Frey\u2019s doctor has opted not to participate in individual exchange networks. We apologize to Ms. Frey for any inconveniences she experienced as this does not reflect how we like to support our members.\"\n\nBounced back and forth between doctors, the Department of Financial Services and even New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s Albany office -- which she called twice in an act of desperation -- a frustrated Frey said not knowing if she was insured was taking its toll.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people understand the stress,\u201d she said. \u201cMy insurance is making me sick. I can\u2019t do this every time I need to see a doctor.\u201d\n\nAs one of millions dropped by her previous insurance company in October due to the health law, Frey was forced to find a new policy.\n\n\u201cI cried,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a tough New Yorker but I cried.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nTo date, more than 6 million individual and small business policies have been canceled in what has been one of the most politically damaging hits ObamaCare has had to absorb. Last fall\u2019s wave of cancellations came as the troubled federal website HealthCare.gov debuted to a list of technical glitches, some so severe the site had to be shut down for hours at a time.\n\nThe insurance cancellations undercut President Obama\u2019s oft-repeated pledges that people would be allowed to keep their doctors and their insurance plans if they were satisfied with them. Obama tried to address the situation by letting state insurance commissioners and insurers re-offer canceled plans. New York, though, did not go along with that reprieve.\n\nThe administration also announced last week that some of those who had their policies canceled could now qualify for a \u201chardship exemption\u201d through 2016, meaning they would not pay a penalty for failing to buy insurance.\n\nFrey says she decided to go with United Healthcare because of its big-brand name. But she claimed the \u201cinsurance -- the most expensive one in the exchange \u2013 was almost unusable.\u201d\n\nIn addition to having trouble finding in-network physicians, Frey says the locations listed were also wrong.\n\n\u201cThey have doctors signed up at locations, they don\u2019t even work or see patients, and others whose location is correct but they still are not actually in the exchange insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big mess and there seems no end in sight.\u201d\n\nOnce she picked a plan that included her primary care physician in late December, she was then told she couldn\u2019t actually use the insurance for several weeks. When Frey pushed back, she was then told she would be able to see her doctor for a Jan. 8 appointment.\n\n\u201cI was assured that everything was ok,\u201d she said. \u201cI said I needed confirmation I was insured and could see the doctor and that I needed to know that to be able to sleep at night.\u201d\n\nShe says she was given that assurance and on Jan.8 she went to see her doctor.\n\nBut following the visit, she received a notice from United that denied her claim, once again saying her doctor, the one whose name was now printed on the insurance card they sent her, was not in-network. That dispute remains unresolved.\n\nUnited Healthcare says its involvement with the exchanges are a work in progress.\n\n\"We are in active negotiations with hospitals and physicians to participate in the exchange network and will continue to update our directories to reflect those changes,\" the insurance company said. \"We also will continue to review our processes to ensure that we avoid issues like Ms. Frey had.\"\n\nMultiple calls to NY State of Health were not returned.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-12-17
