The Jim Starkey Music Center was robbed of eight instruments valued up to $10,000 early Saturday morning.

Police were called to the building in the 1300 block of west 18th Street around 5:50 A.M. Someone busted the front window of the business, setting off an alarm.

Dee Starkey is the owner of the 60-year-old business, he thinks that the store was targeted citing a suspicious man snooping around on Friday.

Three student violins, four intermediate violins and one student cello were stolen; the student versions of the instruments are not as expensive as the intermediate. Some of the violins had individual values of $1,700.

Starkey says the neighborhood where his business resides is usually quiet and is thankful that no one was hurt. "We feel fortunate that no people were hurt, no guns were involved," he said, "it was just stuff, it is replaceable and life will go on."

The suspect broke the exterior lighting of the building to mask his identity. Police do not have any suspect description or person of interest in the case.
