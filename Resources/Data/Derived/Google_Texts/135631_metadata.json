Some were torn down. Others were covered in graffiti, including devil\u2019s horns drawn on candidates\u2019 heads in black marker.\n\nOne vandalized poster was yards away from a newsstand. Within the stacks of periodicals and newspapers on sale was the Dec. 3 issue of the weekly news magazine Le Point. The title of the cover story was \u201cPutin. Our New Friend.\u201d\n\nThe reference was to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The article, citing the terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 130, read:\n\nSince Nov. 13, Putin is almost France\u2019s best friend. Ukraine? The unconditional support for [Syrian dictator] Bashar al-Assad? Anti-European rhetoric? Elys\u00e9e forgot about all of that in the name of the war against terrorism[.] \u2026 The war against Daesh has reshuffled the deck.\n\nDaesh is a pejorative Arabic acronym for the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL.\n\nSome political analysts argue that the attacks also reshuffled the deck on domestic French politics, again to Russia\u2019s benefit.\n\nThe National Front\u2019s campaign platform taps into French Euroskepticism as well as voter anxieties about the Syrian refugee crisis and radical Islamic terrorism. Polling suggested that the terrorist attacks in Paris boosted the party\u2019s support.\n\nAnd although the National Front is a purely French creation, it has received financial backing from Moscow. Its leader is a declared ally of Putin as well as an apologist for the Kremlin\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cMoscow has a double reason to be satisfied with the terrorist attacks in Paris,\u201d Marcel Van Herpen, director of the Cicero Foundation, a Dutch think tank, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cIt made the National Front the biggest party of France, and it completely changed the attitude of the French government vis-\u00e0-vis Moscow,\u201d he said.\n\nRussian Mouthpiece?\n\nThe National Front has been a longtime outlier in French politics, best known for the Nazi-sympathizing, anti-immigrant missives of its founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen.\n\nThe party has grown steadily in popularity for several years, propelled by fears of terrorism linked to Muslim immigration and a gathering anti-EU movement that has flourished across Europe due to financial crises such as the Greek debt bailout.\n\nIn 2014, the National Front won mayoral elections in 12 cities and finished first with about 25 percent of the vote for France\u2019s European Parliament election, taking 24 of France\u2019s 74 seats. It was the first nationwide election victory since the party\u2019s founding in 1973.\n\nThe National Front overturned the French political order almost overnight Sunday, proving itself to be a viable third political party and legitimizing the 2017 presidential ambitions of its current leader and daughter to the party\u2019s patriarch, 47-year-old Marine Le Pen. (The elder Le Pen was kicked out of the party in August, sparking a family feud in which he \u201cdisowned\u201d his daughter.)\n\nAs National Front\u2019s leader, Le Pen has made several trips to Moscow to meet with government officials, including a meeting with Putin in February 2014, one month before Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, according to the French investigative news site Mediapart.\n\nIn March 2014, Russian officials invited Le Pen to Crimea to observe the Ukrainian peninsula\u2019s referendum to join the Russian Federation, which since has been discredited by the EU and the United States as illegitimate. Le Pen turned down the offer, sending her foreign affairs adviser at the time, Aymeric Chauprade, in her place.\n\nLe Pen, however, later supported Russia\u2019s takeover of Crimea and criticized U.S. policy on Ukraine. In an interview with the Polish news site Do Rzeczy, she said, \u201cRegarding Ukraine, we behave like American lackeys,\u201d adding that \u201cthe aim of the Americans is to start a war in Europe to push NATO to the Russian border.\u201d\n\nIntercepted text messages released by the hacker group Anonymous International and published by Mediapart in April were said to prove that a Kremlin official wanted to reward Le Pen for supporting Russian policy in Ukraine.\n\nIn November 2014, Le Pen admitted that the National Front had received a 9-million-euro ($9.8-million) loan from the Russian-owned First Czech-Russian Bank. French news reports claimed it was the first installment of a request that was four times larger.\n\nShe subsequently pushed back against accusations that the Moscow-financed loan was a reward, arguing it was \u201cridiculous to suggest that gaining a loan would determine our international position.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Front National acts today with Putin\u2019s Russia the way the French Communist Party did with the USSR: a party under control of a foreign power,\u201d Edmond Huet, a French engineer and arms expert, told The Daily Signal.\n\nHuet assisted the Ukrainian government in identifying the weapons used against protesters in Kyiv during the 2014 Ukrainian revolution.\n\nHe said of the French Communist Party: \u201cPCF was ideologically Moscow\u2019s mouthpiece and opinion relay in France. Front National does the same for both ideological reasons, real or not, and financial reasons.\u201d\n\nUtilitarianism\n\nThe National Front\u2019s success Sunday spooked France\u2019s political establishment, spurring an unprecedented proposal by French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s Socialist Party to ally with the center-right opposition party, Les R\u00e9publicains, in regions where the National Front leads voting.\n\nLes R\u00e9publicains, under the leadership of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, rejected the offer. Spurned by their longtime foes and willing to defeat the National Front at all costs, the Socialists subsequently urged some of their candidates to withdraw from the race, hoping to divert votes to R\u00e9publicain contenders.\n\nThe 2017 presidential elections are dictating much of the political maneuvering in the days ahead. Sarkozy, who is expected to run in 2017, declared his position as \u201cneither merger, nor retreat,\u201d implying that any cooperation with Socialists to defeat the National Front is unlikely for the time being.\n\nEuroskeptic, anti-immigration parties like the National Front are on the rise across Europe. Russia has loaned money to many of them, including Greece\u2019s neo-Nazi Golden Dawn, Belgium\u2019s Vlaams Belang, Italy\u2019s Northern League, Hungary\u2019s Jobbik, and the Freedom Party of Austria.\n\nSome analysts argue that the Kremlin is maneuvering to weaken the EU and NATO and diminish U.S. influence on the continent.\n\nVan Herpen argues that that by financing the National Front, the Kremlin is pursuing four of its key foreign policy goals:\n\nIn the first place, an overt anti-EU policy. In the second place, an anti-American policy. In the third place, an anti-NATO policy, which follows from the second. In the fourth place, the attempt to forge a tripartite Moscow-Berlin-Paris axis. In particular, the last goal is interesting, because such an axis would realize all the other goals; it would undermine the EU, NATO, and the transatlantic relationship.\n\nAnton Shekhovtsov, visiting senior fellow at the British Legatum Institute think tank, echoed Van Herpen\u2019s analysis in a May 2 article for The Interpreter. Shekhovtsov wrote:\n\nThe scope of the cooperation between the French far right and the Russian authorities, which started long before the annexation of Crimea, indicates that it is one of the many elements, albeit a significant one, of the Kremlin\u2019s long-term strategy to support all the anti-EU and anti-U.S. forces in Europe in order to undermine the transatlantic cooperation and ultimately weaken the West.\n\nRapprochement\n\nTensions over Ukraine have strained the Franco-Russian relationship.\n\nIn August, Hollande canceled the sale of two Mistral warships to Russia due to sanctions over the Ukraine war and pressure from Washington. The cancelation was a blow to the Kremlin\u2014Russian sailors were already in the French port city of Saint-Nazaire for training, and port facilities were under construction in Vladivostok.\n\nAccording to Defense News, France negotiated a settlement to repay the 893 million euros ($981 million) in cash Russia paid in advance for the warships,which Egypt later purchased.\n\nUltimately, Hollande\u2019s differences with Putin over Ukraine took a back seat to the war on the Islamic State, or ISIS, after the terrorist attacks in Paris. On Nov. 26, the French president flew to Moscow to ask for Putin\u2019s help in fighting the Islamist terrorist army. Hollande\u2019s entreaty was part of a broader effort to unite Russia\u2019s military efforts with those of France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.\n\nYet Franco-Russian rapprochement isn\u2019t limited to the National Front or Hollande\u2019s post-Nov. 13 diplomatic trade-offs. A delegation of 10 French MPs\u2014nine from Sarkozy\u2019s center-right R\u00e9publicains\u2014visited Crimea in July under a Kremlin invitation to gauge whether citizens there were happy with joining the Russian Federation.\n\nThe French entourage lauded Russia\u2019s takeover of Crimea, claiming that the Ukrainian peninsula was \u201chappy to be back in Russia.\u201d\n\nA media firestorm ensued in France (and in Ukraine), highlighting a quietly growing pro-Russian bloc among mainstream French conservative leaders. Even Sarkozy, who famously said he would \u201crather shake [George W.] Bush\u2019s hand than meet with Putin,\u201d apparently has warmed to the Russian leader, making a controversial visit to Putin\u2019s Moscow residence in October.\n\n\u201cIsolating Russia makes no sense. \u2026 We need to choose rapprochement and dialogue,\u201d Sarkozy told a group of Russian students during the trip, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nIt is not clear how popular this rapprochement will be with French voters. An August poll by the Pew Research Center found that 70 percent of French respondents had an \u201cunfavorable\u201d opinion of Russia. And 85 percent had \u201cno confidence\u201d that Putin would \u201cdo the right thing regarding world affairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe National Front program, if implemented\u2014exit of Euro, exit of EU, exit of NATO\u2014would be a total victory for Putin and the last nails in France\u2019s coffin, the loss of hope for recovery,\u201d Huet said.\n\nThe front lines of the Ukraine war also reflect the complicated diversity of French opinions about Russia. Former French special operations troops and former French foreign legionnaires have fought on opposite sides of the war, joining the ranks of pro-Ukrainian volunteer battalions as well as pro-Russian separatist units.\n\n\u201cI came here to fight Russia,\u201d a French special operations soldier fighting with the pro-Ukrainian Azov Battalion told The Daily Signal during an interview in Kyiv in June. He spoke on condition of anonymity due to security concerns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s abominable what Russia has done here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just invade another country. That\u2019s not how Europe works anymore.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Polling suggests the terrorist attacks Nov. 13 boosted voter support in France for the National Front, a far-right political party", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Polling suggests the terrorist attacks Nov. 13 boosted voter support in France for the National Front, a far-right political party", "title": "French Party's Breakout Looks Like Win for Kremlin Too", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151209_Upheaval_Peterson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-09T22:15:54+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1lPhYnS"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Polling suggests the terrorist attacks Nov. 13 boosted voter support in France for the National Front, a far-right political party", "title": "French Party's Breakout Looks Like Win for Kremlin Too", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151209_Upheaval_Peterson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2015-12-09T17:24:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-09T22:15:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Russia, Putin, Le Pen, National Front, Paris, France, ISIS"}, "article_summary": "Le Pen turned down the offer, sending her foreign affairs adviser at the time, Aymeric Chauprade, in her place.\nThe anti-EU, anti-immigration party\u2019s electoral breakout upheaved France\u2019s political order, and its success Sunday was not universally well received.\nThe National Front has been a longtime outlier in French politics, best known for the Nazi-sympathizing, anti-immigrant missives of its founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen.\n(The elder Le Pen was kicked out of the party in August, sparking a family feud in which he \u201cdisowned\u201d his daughter.)\nIn November 2014, Le Pen admitted that the National Front had received a 9-million-euro ($9.8-million) loan from the Russian-owned First Czech-Russian Bank."}
