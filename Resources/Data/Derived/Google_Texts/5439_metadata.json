But now, patients understand they also play an important role in their health care. By advocating for themselves and getting involved in the decision-making process, they can reap numerous benefits.\n\n\u201cThere has been a solid, steady push over recent years toward patient empowerment,\u201d says Linda Adler, CEO of Pathfinders Medical Advocacy and Consulting. \u201cIt\u2019s been largely encouraged by dedicated patients and some providers who believe that health care isn\u2019t only a right, but that people should have greater control over what happens to their own bodies.\u201d\n\nBy being involved in your own health advocacy, you not only gain a greater sense of control, but also an increased confidence over your decisions, greater medical literacy, better treatment adherence and even better health outcomes.\n\n1. Understand how your health insurance works.\n\nMany Americans don\u2019t understand the basics of their coverage, and understandably so \u2013 health insurance is complicated. A recent survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that more than 4 in 10 respondents don\u2019t understand basic health insurance terms, and even fewer could calculate how much a patient would owe under certain hospitalization circumstances. Knowing how your insurance works helps you navigate the health care system with less chance of ending up with costly, unexpected medical bills.\n\n2. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions.\n\nAdler says patients should prepare for their doctor\u2019s appointments, making a list of questions and concerns ahead of time. Though many patients are nervous their questions may disrupt an amicable doctor-patient relationship, she says this isn\u2019t the case.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re typically not going to have a lot of time with your provider,\u201d she explains, \u201cso it\u2019s in your interest to know what you want going in.\u201d\n\nShe recommends patients even rehearse their questions, with the ultimate goal of nurturing a partnership with your doctor. Eventually, you can get past a one-way, they talk, you listen relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely possible to have a respectful conversation, even a negotiation, without feeling any discomfort or alienation.\u201d\n\n3. Maintain your own records.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever switched doctors or seen a specialist, you know what a hassle it can be to have your records transferred. With the growing prevalence of electronic health records, maintaining your own copies is easier than ever. By keeping tabs on your own documents, you won\u2019t have to worry as much about them getting lost in the shuffle, and you can see exactly what your doctors are seeing.\n\n4. Review your medical bills for errors.\n\nAn estimated 8 in 10 medical bills contain errors \u2013 errors that go undetected without the sharp eye of an empowered patient. Medical bills can be difficult to decipher. Adler recommends patients ask questions as they arise, even if they seem \u201cobvious or ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to your medical bills, play defense. Assume that if something can go wrong, it will, and take every possible step to make sure nothing does,\u201d she says. \u201cRemember, it\u2019s your money, so you\u2019re in charge.\u201d\n\n5. Know when a second opinion is appropriate.\n\nOne in 20 Americans fall victim to outpatient diagnostic errors, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. And even if you\u2019re comfortable with your doctor\u2019s diagnosis, seeking the input of another physician could save you from unnecessary medical costs and unnecessary stress.\n\nGenerally, any recommendations for major non-emergency surgery, any questions about the validity of your diagnosis and any concerns you may have about not being heard are good justifications for a second opinion. Just make sure to check your insurance coverage before you make that additional appointment.\n\n6. Take advantage of free preventive care under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWith the ACA came access to free preventive care. If you\u2019re insured under an ACA-compliant plan \u2013 and if your health insurance began after March 31, 2010 you likely are \u2013 you can take advantage of at least 15 free health screenings and services. Additional preventive services are available for women, children and older adults. These free services give you an additional reason to visit your doctor, keep the lines of communication open and stay on top of any potential health concerns.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to feel intimidated by your medical providers. They work for you, not the other way around. And when the common ground in these relationships is your health, it\u2019s in your best interest to be as empowered as possible.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"A woman\u2019s average heartbeat checks in nearly 8 beats a minute faster than a man\u2019s.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Don't be afraid to ask questions, maintain your records and seize control of your health.", "zone": "patientadvice/articles", "author": "Elizabeth Renter", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Don't be afraid to ask questions, maintain your records and seize control of your health.", "title": "6 Ways to Be Your Own Health Advocate", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2015/02/02/6-ways-to-be-your-own-health-advocate", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/a6/fc/95f7cb174deea803901ea0c6df55/150116-nurse-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "6 Ways to Be Your Own Health Advocate - US News", "description": "Don't be afraid to ask questions, maintain your records and seize control of your health.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "keywords": "health,LTHealth [Consumer Advice],patients,patient safety,doctors,health care,patient-advice-include [Consumer Advice],patient advice,healthwellness [Consumer Advice],healthandwellness [Consumer Advice],Elizabeth Renter", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z69qzi", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2015-02-02", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-02-02"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/4b92113/2147483647/crop/559x559%2B209%2B0/resize/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2Fa6%2Ffc%2F95f7cb174deea803901ea0c6df55%2F150116-nurse-stock.jpg", "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8909\"", "article_summary": "If you\u2019re insured under an ACA-compliant plan \u2013 and if your health insurance began after March 31, 2010 you likely are \u2013 you can take advantage of at least 15 free health screenings and services.\nMany Americans don\u2019t understand the basics of their coverage, and understandably so \u2013 health insurance is complicated.\nBut now, patients understand they also play an important role in their health care.\nUnderstand how your health insurance works.\nKnowing how your insurance works helps you navigate the health care system with less chance of ending up with costly, unexpected medical bills."}
