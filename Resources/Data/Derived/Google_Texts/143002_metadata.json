They're less likely to pose problems that private business areas are going to pose as polling places. And so the closing of schools is really causing a crisis in a lot of areas.\"\n\nDelaware election commissioner Elaine Manlove told the commission eight schools in her state are out of the elections business.\n\nShe asked state legislators to impose a solution: Make the state's primary election day an \"in-service day\" for teachers, so they can have voters in the building when students are home. There's been resistance, she thinks, because an in-service day in the middle of the week isn't so appealing.\n\n\"I'm giving them a Tuesday, and they're looking for a Monday or a Friday,\" Manlove said. \"Outside of that, I can't find a reason why they would want to have all these voters come into the school while the children are there.\"\n\nManlove said she couldn't get her proposal to a vote in the last legislative session. She'll try again.\n\nVirginia's elections chief, Don Palmer, said he's excited about new computer software designed to monitor turnout at every polling place on Election Day and detect problems as they develop..\n\n\"They're able to predict that a line may be forming based on the turnout that they have, and they'd be able to use additional resources, send additional poll workers,\" he said.\n\nAnother issue in future elections, Persily said, is cutbacks in the postal service as more people use mail-in ballots. The commission will make recommendations to Obama when it's finished its work.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A presidential commission aimed at cutting long lines at polling places and improving the voting experience held a hearing in Philadelphia Wednesday the third of four planned across the country", "title": "Presidential panel meets in Philly as part of effort to improve voting experience", "og": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/nw_logo_fb.png", "site_name": "Newsworks.org", "description": "A presidential commission aimed at cutting long lines at polling places and improving the voting experience held a hearing in Philadelphia Wednesday, the third of four planned across the country.\r..."}, "twitter": {"description": "A presidential commission aimed at cutting long lines at polling places and improving the voting experience held a hearing in Philadelphia Wednesday, the third of four planned across the country.\r...", "title": "Presidential panel meets in Philly as part of effort to improve voting experience", "image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_voter_hearing1200.jpg", "creator": "@NewsWorksWHYY", "site": "@NewsWorksWHYY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-04", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"page_id": 115829381793481}, "url": "http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/politics/59346-election-commission-holds-hearing", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "author": "Dave Davies @davedavieswhyy", "keywords": "election, polling, commission, persily, places, people, state, elections, there, schools, problems, school, service, lines, manlove, officials, million, waiting, voting, turnout", "google-site-verification": "zlKVThgI_7CsCilHyAeJraRojXxR5nL5CZqBEZJMJNw", "st": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_voter_hearing1200.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png"}, "article_summary": "Another issue in future elections, Persily said, is cutbacks in the postal service as more people use mail-in ballots.\nPresident Barack Obama appointed the Presidential Commission on Election Administration after long lines plagued some polling places last November.\nA presidential commission aimed at cutting long lines at polling places and improving the voting experience held a hearing in Philadelphia Wednesday, the third of four planned across the country.\n\"And schools are often the best polling places because they're ADA accessible -- those with disabilities can vote there,\" Persily said.\nThey're less likely to pose problems that private business areas are going to pose as polling places."}
