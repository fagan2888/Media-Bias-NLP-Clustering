This could lead to a Fed-induced recession, which is clearly the worst outcome for the Fed.\n\nKelly also thinks the economy could overheat if the unemployment rate drops below \"full employment,\" thus causing wages to spike with inflation following shortly after. \"There is an extreme risk that we get back to full employment before the interest rates get back to neutral,\" said Kelly.\n\nPointing to the Fed's own economic outlook, Kelly noted that in the past three years GDP growth has been between 2.2% and 2.4% while the unemployment rate has fallen by around 1% annually. In its latest release, the Fed still expects GDP to stay in the same range but for the unemployment rate to only drop only 0.2%-0.4%.\n\n\"That is just a wrong forecast,\" Kelly said. \"The unemployment rate will come down more than the Fed expects and that will keep their feet to the fire for more rate hikes.\"\n\nAnd overall, Kelly thinks that the Fed is simply so afraid of upsetting the market with rate hikes that it will ultimately let the economy run too hot.\n\n\"In the past five tightening cycles, we usually see an [interest rate] increase of 2.5% per year,\" Kelly said. \"And now the Fed is saying they will move at 40% of the usual rate and the markets are assuming just 20% of that.\"\n\n\n\nAnd Kelly said he wouldn't be surprised if the Fed capitulated to the market's expectations and go at that slower pace. \"This is a nervous Fed. It doesn't take much for them to be pushed off their plan and reverse course.\"\n\nThough no matter what the Fed ultimately does, Kelly does not think there will be likely be a clean ending for the economy.\n\n\"All I would say is that every one should buckle up.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Bob Bryan", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "The Federal Reserve may have just hiked rates, but one JP Morgan strategist says they have no idea what they're doing.", "creator": "RobertBryan4", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-strategist-says-the-fed-cant-fly-the-plane-2015-12", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5674733b2340f840008b6e3f-506-253/strategist-the-fed-is-flying-this-plane-and--the-people-at-the-controls-dont-know-how-to-fly.jpg", "title": "STRATEGIST: 'The Fed is flying this plane and ... the people at the controls don't know how to fly'", "site": "themoneygame", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "moneygame,clusterstock", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Federal Reserve, JP Morgan, Interest Rate, Bob Bryan", "description": "The Federal Reserve may have just hiked rates, but one JP Morgan strategist says they have no idea what they're doing.", "author": "Bob Bryan", "sailthru.date": "2015-12-19", "sailthru.title": "STRATEGIST: 'The Fed is flying this plane and ... the people at the controls don't know how to fly'", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5674732a2340f8e0008b6d88-50-50/strategist-the-fed-is-flying-this-plane-and--the-people-at-the-controls-dont-know-how-to-fly.jpg", "news_keywords": "Federal Reserve, JP Morgan, Interest Rate, Bob Bryan", "tbi-image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5674732a2340f8e0008b6d88/strategist-the-fed-is-flying-this-plane-and--the-people-at-the-controls-dont-know-how-to-fly.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-12-19", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/bob-bryan"}, "sailthru.description": "The Federal Reserve may have just hiked rates, but one JP Morgan strategist says they have no idea what they're doing.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "The Federal Reserve may have just hiked rates, but one JP Morgan strategist says they have no idea what they're doing.", "title": "STRATEGIST: 'The Fed is flying this plane and ... the people at the controls don't know how to fly'", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-strategist-says-the-fed-cant-fly-the-plane-2015-12", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5674733b2340f840008b6e3f-1190-625/strategist-the-fed-is-flying-this-plane-and--the-people-at-the-controls-dont-know-how-to-fly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "STRATEGIST: 'The Fed is flying this plane and ... the people at the controls don't know how to fly'", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5674732a2340f8e0008b6d88/strategist-the-fed-is-flying-this-plane-and--the-people-at-the-controls-dont-know-how-to-fly.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "moneygame"}, "article_summary": "Now that the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates off of zero, there are fears that they will join that ignominious group.\n\"The unemployment rate will come down more than the Fed expects and that will keep their feet to the fire for more rate hikes.\"\nThough no matter what the Fed ultimately does, Kelly does not think there will be likely be a clean ending for the economy.\n\"In the past five tightening cycles, we usually see an [interest rate] increase of 2.5% per year,\" Kelly said.\nIn its latest release, the Fed still expects GDP to stay in the same range but for the unemployment rate to only drop only 0.2%-0.4%."}
