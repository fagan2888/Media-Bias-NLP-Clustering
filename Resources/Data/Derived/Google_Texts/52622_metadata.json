In a blog post, researcher said, \u201cWhen the relationship starts (\"day 0\"), posts begin to decrease. We observe a peak of 1.67 posts per day 12 days before the relationship begins, and a lowest point of 1.53 posts per day 85 days into the relationship. Presumably, couples decide to spend more time together, courtship is off, and online interactions give way to more interactions in the physical world.\u201d\n\nJosh Constantine, social media reporter for Mashable, says that while many gripe about the lack of privacy online, few users will actually stop using a product or service over data mining.\n\n\u201cPeople talk a lot about who they care about privacy, but we ultimately won\u2019t give up services over it,\u201d Constantine says. \u201cThey may think its creepy how much Facebook knows about us, but the more data Facebook has, the more accurate those ads will be.\u201d\n\nConstantine is referring to the targeted ads on the social media site, which rely on data mining to reach the right audiences. In 2012, Constantine says Target (TGT) was using customer buying behavior to monitor pregnancy among its web shoppers.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn some cases, they could determine if a woman was pregnant before their family even knew\u2014if they were buying nutritional supplements or purses big enough to double as diaper bags,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they would send them coupons in the mail, and found it was extremely good for revenue. The data companies collect on us is nothing new.\u201d\n\nAnd many companies, like Facebook, like to show off how interesting their data are, and try to recruit workers by showing they have a \u201cfun data set to play with,\u201d Constantine says.\n\n\u201cIf Facebook knows you are about to get into a relationship with someone, you will see more of that person in your News Feed, and you will probably enjoy that even more,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-07 11:15:41 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "The social networking giant is now playing cupid, claiming
