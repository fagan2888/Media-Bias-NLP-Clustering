Members are fed up with the style of politics from recent years and want something bigger.\n\nWhy did you join the Labour Party?\n\nBecause we live in a country where the postcode of the bed you are born in determines where you end up in life. I will fight all my life to change that.\n\nWho is you closest friend in politics?\n\nSteve Rotheram MP.

We must fight Tory plans to cut tax credits, hit trade unions and cut 40% from public services. Our plan must be to create two million more high-tech jobs, to bring in universal childcare, to build affordable housing and end child poverty.\n\nWhat Tory act would you repeal first?\n\nWhere to start? The NHS and Social Care Act followed by the Bedroom Tax, and the new Trade Union Bill.\n\nWhat have you learned from the campaign?\n\nThat the Labour Party is still strong, energetic and determined despite our defeat. There are also so many people who were devastated the Tories got back in and who were depending on a Labour government to abolish the bedroom tax, save their Sure Start or tackle the zero hours contracts that we have to fight and win the next general election.\n\nWhy did you join the Labour Party?\n\nAs the granddaughter of a miner and daughter of a trade unionist I\u2019ve always believed in strong Labour values.

I believe in a country in which people are happier, more fulfilled, secure in their work, home and with the opportunity to further themselves.

A government that supports people in achieving their collective aspirations through providing strong public services, access to lifelong learning and a prosperous, more balanced economy propped up by world-leading infrastructure.\n\nWhat Tory Act would you first repeal?\n\nThe pernicious Health and Social Care Act. The Labour Party would restore the principle of publicly funded, publicly delivered, fully accountable social services available to all, free at the point of use and based on need.\n\nWhat have you learnt in this campaign?\n\nAcross the UK there is a desperate thirst for a real alternative and a different kind of politics.\n\nWhy did you join the Labour Party?\n\nI joined as a 16-year-old wanting to see a more peaceful and just world.
