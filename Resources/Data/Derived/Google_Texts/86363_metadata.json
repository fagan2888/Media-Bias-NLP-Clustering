Theater owners say conversions escalated quickly in 2013 and will help keep the drive-ins in business for now, promising news for an industry that peaked in the 1950s and \u201960s, then with more than 4,000 drive-in theaters nationwide.\n\nSome drive-ins are raising money using crowd-funding platforms such as Kickstarter while others are taking advantage of financing programs or renting out their theaters as flea markets during off-hours.\n\nRy Russell, general manager of Saco Drive-In, launched a social-media campaign to win an $80,000 digital projection system in a contest sponsored by Honda. His drive-in theater in Saco is celebrating its 75th anniversary by welcoming hundreds of cars to its giant roadside screen to watch the latest films on a new digital projection system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just seeing Darwinism kind of take over,\u201d Russell said. \u201cThe ones that survive will prosper.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a story that\u2019s playing out at drive-ins all over the country, where conversion to digital is the key to survival, said John Vincent Jr., president of the United Drive-In Theatre Owners Association. Studios are phasing out 35mm film prints as Hollywood moves toward all-digital distribution. Even older movies are difficult to obtain on film because many repertory companies have gone digital, said Vincent, noting that people in the industry expect this season to be \u201cthe last summer of film.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drive-ins use creativity to afford digital switch", "author": "Patrick Whittle", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Drive-ins use creativity to afford digital switch", "title": "Drive-ins use creativity to afford digital switch", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/12/drive_ins_use_creativity_to_afford_digital_switch/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/aptopix-digital-drive-ins.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Drive-ins use creativity to afford digital switch", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/aptopix-digital-drive-ins.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Drive-ins use creativity to afford digital switch", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Drive-ins use creativity to afford digital switch", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd03b0\"", "article_summary": "Ry Russell, general manager of Saco Drive-In, launched a social-media campaign to win an $80,000 digital projection system in a contest sponsored by Honda.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsSACO, Maine (AP) \u2014 Many in the movie industry feared the need to convert to digital could be the death knell for drive-ins, but drive-in operators are finding creative ways to afford the switch.\nDrive-in movie theater operators say more than 200 of the remaining 348 drive-ins in the country have made the expensive conversion from film to digital, which typically costs more than $70,000.\nHis drive-in theater in Saco is celebrating its 75th anniversary by welcoming hundreds of cars to its giant roadside screen to watch the latest films on a new digital projection system.\nEven older movies are difficult to obtain on film because many repertory companies have gone digital, said Vincent, noting that people in the industry expect this season to be \u201cthe last summer of film.\u201d"}
