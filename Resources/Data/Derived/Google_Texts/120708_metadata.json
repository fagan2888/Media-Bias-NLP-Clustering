And this week is already offering plenty of examples in the art of getting things wrong.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the most clearcut case of making a bad thing definitely not better, courtesy of Connecticut newspaperman Michael Schroeder. Schroeder recently attained a degree of Internet fame via Bristol Press reporter Steve Majerus-Collins\u2019 feisty and public Christmas Eve declaration he was quitting his job. As he explained at the time, \u201cI have learned with horror that my boss shoveled a story into my newspaper \u2013 a terrible, plagiarized piece of garbage about the court system \u2013 and then stuck his own fake byline on it.\u201d Majerus-Collins was referring to a December story in the Bristol Press by one \u201cEdward Clarkin\u201d regarding how \u201cstate economies remain competitive,\u201d one that favorably mentioned Sheldon Adelson. It was heavily critical of Nevada District Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez, who, as the Washington Post notes, \u201cis presiding over a case involving Adelson\u2019s Sands Casino.\u201d What it didn\u2019t mention was that until this week, Schroeder was the manager of the News & Media Capital Group, \u201cthe company through which the billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and his family bought The Las Vegas Review-Journal for $140 million.\u201d As Majerus-Collins wrote in his farewell, \u201cWhen enterprising reporters asked my boss about it, he claimed to know nothing or told them he had no comment. Yesterday, they blew the lid off this idiocy completely, proving that Mr. Schroeder lied, that he submitted a plagiarized story, bypassed what editing exists and basically used the pages of my newspaper, secretly, to further the political agenda of his master out in Las Vegas. In sum, the owner of my paper is guilty of journalistic misconduct of epic proportions.\u201d\n\nIn a Tuesday \u201cnote to our readers\u201d in the Bristol Press, Schroeder gently said that \u201cLike most newspapers, I believe we mostly get it right, but sometimes we can get it wrong.\u201d He then admitted that parts of the article had been \u201ctaken from related Internet sites and were not credited.\u201d He went on to explain, \u201cA part of the story involved a matter concerning the buyer of the Las Vegas Review-Journal. There should have been a tagline indicating that I had a business relationship with that person\u2026.It was a combination of writing and reporting from multiple sources, with anonymity promised, in this case, inappropriately. That\u2019s why a pseudonym \u2014 \u2018Edward Clarkin,\u2019 which had been used before \u2014 was used in this instance.\u201d He concluded, \u201cI personally apologize to you, our readers, for the concern caused by this story.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Newspaperman Michael Schroeder let himself off the hook, while Hasbro's finally including Rey in Star Wars Monopoly", "title": "How not to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d: 2016 is already full of weak apologies, from the dumbest answer to #WheresRey to \u201csometimes we can get it wrong\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Newspaperman Michael Schroeder let himself off the hook, while Hasbro's finally including Rey in Star Wars Monopoly", "title": "How not to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d: 2016 is already full of weak apologies, from the dumbest answer to #WheresRey to \u201csometimes we can get it wrong\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/06/how_not_to_say_im_sorry_2016_is_already_full_of_weak_apologies_from_the_dumbest_answer_to_wheresrey_to_sometimes_we_can_get_it_wrong/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/star_wars_rey2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Newspaperman Michael Schroeder let himself off the hook, while Hasbro's finally including Rey in Star Wars Monopoly", "title": "How not to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d: 2016 is already full of weak apologies, from the dumbest answer to #WheresRey to \u201csometimes we can get it wrong\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/star_wars_rey2.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alexander Nazaryan, aol_on, Michael Schroeder, Sheldon Adelson, Star Wars, star wars: force awakens, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ae1\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Alexander Nazaryan, aol_on, Michael Schroeder, Sheldon Adelson, Star Wars, star wars: force awakens, Ted Cruz, Life News, Entertainment NewsWe all screw up, both intentionally and inadvertently.\nSchroeder recently attained a degree of Internet fame via Bristol Press reporter Steve Majerus-Collins\u2019 feisty and public Christmas Eve declaration he was quitting his job.\nLet\u2019s start with the most clearcut case of making a bad thing definitely not better, courtesy of Connecticut newspaperman Michael Schroeder.\nWe all have moments we look back on and think, Wow, I did not nail that one.\nAnd this week is already offering plenty of examples in the art of getting things wrong."}
