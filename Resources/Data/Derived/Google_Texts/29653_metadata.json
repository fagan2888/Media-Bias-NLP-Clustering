Repeated calls for bipartisanship and common ground in Congress weren\u2019t heeded, and Republican resistance to the new health-care law, Obamacare, forced a federal government shutdown in October. It was the first in 17 years. A budget deal brokered earlier this month has offset fiscal gridlock for the next two years, but that deal has not bridged the ideological canyon between the two major parties on the nation's most pressing issues/problems.\n\nPhoto: Reuters\n\nPhoto: Reuters Previous Next\n\nNeither party had a smooth year, but here are some of the Democrats\u2019 most embarrassing and disappointing moments of 2013:\n\nObamacare Rollout\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nWhen Vice President Joe Biden congratulated Obama on signing the controversial health-care law in 2010, he said it was \u201ca big [expletive] deal.\u201d Fast forward three years later and it still is. A botched roll out of the HealthCare.gov website -- a vital part of implementing the landmark legislation -- sent critics into overdrive and kept the public wondering if Republicans were right all along about Obamacare being a bad policy that is just unworkable. Technical glitches at health insurance exchanges prevented hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Americans from signing up and getting covered at the outset, and many insured people were also dropped from their coverage because their existing plans did not meet the standards of Obamacare.\n\nA slight majority of Americans were always skeptical of the law and disapprove of it. Still, on Oct. 1, the website was just not ready, and the administration has made several deadline extensions; many glitches have been fixed, but bugs remain. The worst part of it all was that the nation\u2019s chief executive didn\u2019t know about the website problems before it went live.\n\nIn order to save the signature policy initiative of his presidency, Obama implemented a public relations campaign and did some damage control. In speeches thereafter, the president defended the law against critics, saying, \u201cThe product is good. People want it.\u201d\n\nSnowden/NSA Leak\n\nIn June, the White House was totally blindsided when Edward Snowden, a defense contractor employee, leaked classified documents to the British daily The Guardian that cast a large spotlight on the National Security Agency. U.S. surveillance practices were revealed, including the collection of metadata on millions of Americans' and foreigners\u2019 calls, and spying on foreign allies. Let\u2019s just say neither Americans nor traditional allies were happy about that.\n\nAnd as for Snowden, he told the media, \u201cI already won.\u201d He is facing felony charges in the U.S., but his whistle-blowing forced lawmakers to take a critical look at the NSA, which could face operational reforms in the year ahead.\n\nSyria And Those Blurred Red Lines\n\nOn this subject, the quotes are very telling.\n\nAt a press conference last August, Obama said that if chemical weapons were used in Syria then that would be crossing a \u201cred line for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.\u201d\n\nThis September, a United Nations report confirmed that sarin gas was used in an Aug. 21 attack in Syria, but it didn\u2019t say which group was responsible. Things got a little complicated for Obama, who was faced with a tough decision. Some U.S. lawmakers said the red line was crossed and called on the president to inform Congress how he would act if he chose to do so. He urged Congress to debate and vote on a possible strike. Still on Sept. 4, the president insisted, \u201cI didn\u2019t set a red line; the world set a red line.\u201d\n\nEventually, Russian President Vladimir Putin stepped in and kind of diffused the situation by coming to an agreement with the U.S. to help get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give up the chemical weapons.\n\nIRS Scandal\n\nA top official at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) basically ratted out the agency in May, when she admitted that staffers targeted conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status and placed them under additional scrutiny. Lois Lerner apologized for the IRS\u2019s behavior, but Democrats and Republicans were both calling for heads to roll in the federal tax-collection organization.\n\nThis was, of course, unwelcome news for the Obama administration, as the IRS is the agency that\u2019s responsible for determining who is eligible for Obamacare subsidies, and the amount. The president condemned the agency\u2019s behavior, saying, \u201cThere is no place for it, and they have to be held fully accountable, because the IRS, as an independent agency, requires absolute integrity, and people have to have confidence that they are applying the laws in a nonpartisan way. You should feel that way regardless of party.\u201d\n\nCarlos Danger\n\nAfter resigning from Congress in 2011 amid a sexting scandal, Anthony Weiner found himself tangled in another scandal while running for mayor of New York City. Weiner sent a 22-year-old woman explicit photos under the alias \u201cCarlos Danger.\u201d Suffice it to say that the Weiner campaign died after that.\n\nBob Filner\n\nThe former San Diego mayor, 71, was given a 90-day home confinement sentence and three years\u2019 probation for assaulting three women while he was in office. According to CNN, he admitted to forcibly kissing or grabbing three women either at a campaign event or City Hall. In all, 19 women accused Filner of harassment while he was mayor and as a congressman.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obamacare enrollment, obamacare website, obamacare exchanges, bob filner san diego, 2013 comprehensive immigration reform, 2013 immigration reform, carlos danger anthony weiner, gun control debate, background checks, obama syria red line", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Obamacare website problems, an intrusive NSA and sex scandals added to a drama-filled year for the Democrats this year.", "title": "Obamacare Website, Carlos Danger: Democrats\u2019 Most Embarrassing Moments Of 2013", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/obamacare-website-carlos-danger-democrats-most-embarrassing-moments-2013-1521332", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/12/02/obamacare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare website problems, an intrusive NSA and sex scandals added to a drama-filled year for the Democrats this year.", "title": "Obamacare Website, Carlos Danger: Democrats\u2019 Most Embarrassing Moments Of 2013", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/obamacare-website-carlos-danger-democrats-most-embarrassing-moments-2013-1521332", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/12/02/obamacare.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/12/02/obamacare.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2013-12-27T14:00:09-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-27T14:46:12-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Obamacare website problems, an intrusive NSA and sex scandals added to a drama-filled year for the Democrats this year."}, "article_summary": "Lois Lerner apologized for the IRS\u2019s behavior, but Democrats and Republicans were both calling for heads to roll in the federal tax-collection organization.\nSome U.S. lawmakers said the red line was crossed and called on the president to inform Congress how he would act if he chose to do so.\nAccording to CNN, he admitted to forcibly kissing or grabbing three women either at a campaign event or City Hall.\nAfter being re-elected for a second presidential term last November, U.S. President Barack Obama found himself with the same prescription for policy failure: a divided government.\nWeiner sent a 22-year-old woman explicit photos under the alias \u201cCarlos Danger.\u201d Suffice it to say that the Weiner campaign died after that."}
