What Trump\u2019s candidacy has managed to do is reveal fault lines in the media that usually are buried beneath the typical journalistic blather, the groupthink and the feigned objectivity of the mainstream media \u2014 and the reflexive lockstep partisanship in the right-wing media. (The liberals, with a pox on both Trump and his GOP rivals, get to sit this one out.)\n\nThanks to Trump, there are civil wars now erupting within the mainstream media between the business side and the editorial side, and within the right-wing media among the establishment Republicans, the populist renegades, and the so-called moderate, intellectual neoconservatives. What it really shows is just how craven, self-serving and self-involved our media are.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the MSM. As I wrote here several weeks back, CBS head Les Moonves was mercenary enough to crow over how much money Trump coverage was pouring into his network\u2019s coffers. Trump is a veritable gold mine, which is one reason why the media have given him so much free coverage \u2014 by one account $1.9 billion worth , which is nearly two-and-a-half times as much as the next highest candidate, Hillary Clinton, and more than five times as much as Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz each.\n\nIn his inaugural column as the late David Carr\u2019s successor, The New York Times\u2019 new media maven, Jim Rutenberg, examined just how big a stake the media have in Trump \u2014 especially CNN, which was nearly on life support before Trump applied CPR. So far during this campaign, Rutenberg writes, CNN\u2019s prime-time ratings have soared 170 percent, and CNN head Jeff Zucker boasted to Rutenberg that on debate nights the network gets $200,000 for a 30-second ad. This gives Trump a tremendous amount of leverage, and he isn\u2019t afraid to use it to make sure he is treated respectfully. I can\u2019t recall a situation in which a network was so dependent on a candidate. Usually, it\u2019s the other way around.\n\nCNN is so fawning to Trump it\u2019s embarrassing, and its primary night coverage a disgrace. Sitting at desks are representatives for all the candidates, each given equal weight, with every Trump criticism parried by the Trump supporter, lest the network lose Trump\u2019s favor. Anderson Cooper might as well be Trump\u2019s apprentice for all the steely journalistic probing he gives him. But at least now you know how cable television news would have treated Hitler were it around in Germany back in the early \u201930s. (Note to TV execs who still have a conscience, if any exist: Instead of out-of-work, old political operatives and partisan hacks giving us their tired takes on the primary results, why not have political scientists and historians do analysis? Just a thought.)\n\nYet amid the glut of Trump coverage, here is something that has gotten far too little attention in the media, for obvious reasons. According to Kyle Blaine at BuzzFeed, Trump not only gets uncritical coverage; he has actually negotiated with the networks as to how they shoot his rallies. If you want to know why the press is kept in a pen and not allowed to mingle at Trump events, it is, according to Blaine, because the press conceded that to Trump. They are not even allowed to provide cutaways of the crowd\u2019s reaction. Again, I can\u2019t recall the press ever capitulating to a candidate in this way, but, then, there was never a candidate who gave the press as much revenue as Trump. Nixon assiduously staged his events; he didn\u2019t tell the press how it could cover them. In any case, can you imagine the howls of protest if the media agreed to the same sort of terms with Clinton or Sanders or even Cruz?\n\nTrump coverage is the smoking gun and CNN is the corpse. And yet, again according to Kyle Blaine, there are some in the media who are actually discomfited by the surrender to Trump. As he puts it, \u201cConversations with more than a dozen reporters, producers, and executives across the major networks reveal internal tensions about the wall-to-wall coverage Trump has received and the degree to which the Republican frontrunner has \u2014 or hasn\u2019t \u2014 been challenged on their air.\u201d\n\nBut TV reporters are not likely to put their jobs on the line to take on Trump. In the mainstream print media, where the tensions between the public\u2019s apparent desire for Trump news (and the desire of papers and magazines to satisfy it) and reporters\u2019 disdain for him are in daily full view, there\u2019s more of a full-blown war. The Washington Post, to cite one prominent example, runs dozens of Trump stories one after another, but just about every one of those stories is hostile.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Also: David Brooks, Ross Douthat and the intellectual right gyrate to pretend Trumpism wasn't always part of GOP", "title": "CNN\u2019s Donald Trump disgrace: Trump coverage is the smoking gun, CNN is the corpse", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Also: David Brooks, Ross Douthat and the intellectual right gyrate to pretend Trumpism wasn't always part of GOP", "title": "CNN\u2019s Donald Trump disgrace: Trump coverage is the smoking gun, CNN is the corpse", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/03/cnns_donald_trump_disgrace_trump_coverage_is_the_smoking_gun_cnn_is_the_corpse/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/trump_cooper_television.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Also: David Brooks, Ross Douthat and the intellectual right gyrate to pretend Trumpism wasn't always part of GOP", "title": "CNN\u2019s Donald Trump disgrace: Trump coverage is the smoking gun, CNN is the corpse", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/trump_cooper_television.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Neal Gabler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Anderson Cooper, chuck todd, CNN, David Brooks, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Les Moonves, Media Criticism, Ross Douthat", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Trump coverage is the smoking gun and CNN is the corpse.\nAs I wrote here several weeks back, CBS head Les Moonves was mercenary enough to crow over how much money Trump coverage was pouring into his network\u2019s coffers.\nYet amid the glut of Trump coverage, here is something that has gotten far too little attention in the media, for obvious reasons.\nCNN is so fawning to Trump it\u2019s embarrassing, and its primary night coverage a disgrace.\n(The liberals, with a pox on both Trump and his GOP rivals, get to sit this one out.)"}
