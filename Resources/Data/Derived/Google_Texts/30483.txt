Family and friends gathered in Punta Gorda Sunday to remember baby Chance Walsh.

The nine-week-old's body was found in a wooded area near North Port two weeks ago. His parents, Kristen Bury and Joseph Walsh, are jailed in Sarasota and charged in his death. ABC7 learned Sunday that charges for both have been reduced from first-degree murder. Bury is now charged with manslaughter, and Walsh with second-degree murder.

About 50 people gathered Sunday for a short funeral. His grandmother, Sally Susino, talked about the area where Chance's body was found and how the memory of that place is fresh in her mind.

"Where he was buried was not a beautiful place, and we were very distraught and upset from seeing the site," Susino said.

Deputies made the tragic discovery after Chance's mother told investigators where she and Walsh buried their son's body.

Susino said the one thing that brought her comfort when she visited the site was seeing butterflies.

"It was looking right at me and opening and closing his wings and I realized that it was Chance and started to feel peaceful," she said.

Butterflies were released following Sunday's ceremony, not only in honor of Chance, but in honor of his brother Duane, who passed away two weeks after being born in 2014.

"I took it as a beautiful sign from God. He was showing me that 'here's your two boys. They are peaceful, they are happy, and they have wings,'" Susino said.

"It has brought us a lot of peace. He is still with us. He's flying around there watching over us. Chance is going to be well known, his voice is going to be heard."
