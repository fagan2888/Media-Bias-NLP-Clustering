Uncertainty over the impact of health care reform on their businesses has created plenty of anxiety among HR managers and those in the C-Suite. A recent survey by ADP found almost half of large-company finance managers aren\u2019t fully confident that they understand their responsibilities under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. At small companies, the study found, just 28 percent of those surveyed have developed any sort of plan for controlling their health benefits costs in the wake of health care reform.

Know the requirements and deadlines: Don\u2019t wallow in fears that are groundless with respect to your company. ADP says you should \u201cinvest the time and resources needed to clearly comprehend the act\u2019s legal requirements and time frames in order to accommodate its tax implications and avoid penalties for non-compliance.\u201d Establish a timeline with key milestones to help guide your process. 2. Determine administrative impact on your company: How will oversight of changes mandated by the PPACA increase administrative burden? \u201cA prime example of an ACA provision with potentially large administrative impact is Shared Responsibility. Beginning in 2015, it requires tracking each employee\u2019s full-time or part-time status every month, and maintaining that information as part of employee tax records.\u201d Those kinds of requirements will clearly add to HR\u2019s tasks, and may require additional manpower, at least while systems are being set up.\n\nEDUCATE 4. Create a written summary of benefits and coverage for employees: This is a four-page (or less) summary of your plan you must provide your employees with. It must be clearly written. Make sure you obtain acknowledgement of receipt of the SBC from employees. 5. Notify your employees of public exchanges: This is the notification of insurance options due Oct. 1. Is this required? Yes. Will you be fined if you don\u2019t do it? Maybe not. Do it anyway. It\u2019s a great way to communicate with your workers.\n\nENROLL\n\n\n\nSign \u2019em up: If you have at least 50 full-time employees, you have to offer them affordable health coverage. Make sure you offer the opportunity to enroll to all eligibles. Then develop a system to track, update and report on employee eligibility and enrollment to maintain ongoing compliance.

Enroll employees\u2019 dependents: The law requires employers to offer coverage to qualifying dependent children of full-time employees up to age 26. You may also want to consider conducting a dependent eligibility audit, which typically show as many as 15 percent of dependents claimed by employees are not qualified for benefits.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Dan Cook", "description": "ADP offers a list of suggestions to help employers get a better handle on the act\u2019s requirements.", "og": {"url": "http://www.benefitspro.com/2013/09/25/13-things-employers-must-do-to-be-ppaca-ready", "image": "http://media.benefitspro.com/benefitspro/article/2013/09/25/wellness hhs rules.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "ADP offers a list of suggestions to help employers get a better handle on the act\u2019s requirements.", "title": "13 things employers must do to be PPACA-ready"}, "twitter": {"description": "ADP offers a list of suggestions to help employers get a better handle on the act\u2019s requirements.", "creator": "@Benefits_Pro", "image": {"src": "http://media.benefitspro.com/benefitspro/article/2013/09/25/wellness-hhs-rules-crop-120x120.jpg"}, "title": "13 things employers must do to be PPACA-ready", "site": "@Benefits_Pro", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-25", "keywords": "Employer-paid, Compliance, C-Suite, healthcare, FSA, health insurance premiums, ADP, insurance carrier, insurance options, health insurers, healthcare services, public insurance exchanges", "sailthru.tags": "benefitspro, article, 52430779150ba0555500007a, News, Employer-paid,Compliance,C-Suite", "sniply-options": "block", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.benefitspro.com/benefitspro/article/2013/09/25/wellness hhs rules.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbbb7\"", "article_summary": "Enroll employees\u2019 dependents: The law requires employers to offer coverage to qualifying dependent children of full-time employees up to age 26.\nENROLLSign \u2019em up: If you have at least 50 full-time employees, you have to offer them affordable health coverage.\nIf you have at least 50 full-time employees, you have to offer them affordable health coverage.\nSign In X Sign in with your ALM Account Remember Me Or...
