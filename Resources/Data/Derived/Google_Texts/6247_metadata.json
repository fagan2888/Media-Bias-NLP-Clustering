We need to make a moral, not just practical or statistical, case.\u201d But by the time he was Mitt Romney's vice presidential candidate in 2012, Ryan was ferociously wiping the sweat of his reputation as a Rand-lover off his fevered brow.\n\nAnd as Doherty wrote in 2012:\n\nRyan began denying Rand earlier this year. Here's what he said to National Review in April: \u201cI reject her philosophy,\u201d Ryan says firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s an atheist philosophy. It reduces human interactions down to mere contracts and it is antithetical to my worldview. If somebody is going to try to paste a person\u2019s view on epistemology to me, then give me Thomas Aquinas,\u201d who believed that man needs divine help in the pursuit of knowledge. \u201cDon\u2019t give me Ayn Rand,\u201d he says. Ryan, from his twisty TARP endorsement, is the worst sort of Rand villain: a man whose knowledge and understanding embrace free markets, but who traduces them for reasons of phony \"practicality\" or belief that one has to go against one's values to defend them.... Alas, making a moral case for capitalism--which is the same as the moral case for human liberty--requires a voting record that shows an actual belief in the notion that government has, if any, only the powers that the individual can rightly grant them. That's the power to defend one's individual right to life and justly acquired property. That does not include many, many things Ryan as congressman has supported, from TARP to Medicare Part D to auto bailouts (as un-Randian as you could imagine, as Conor Friedersdorf noted in his article rightly dubbing Ryan a Rand villain) and the Patriot Act. By the time someone runs for high office, trying to suss out what they sincerely believe is impossible. But I suspect that a young Ryan did indeed think of himself as a Rand devotee (while always rejecting the atheism) but the \"realism\" of being a congressman and running for vice president beat it out of him. In its way, then, another variation on Branden's \"afraid of what the neighbors will think\" motive for Rand apostasy.\n\nFor more Paul Ryan, deep dive into Reason's archive.\n\nPancakes via Ken Layne.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Celebrate the libertarian-leaning congressman's new gig with this amazing painting of Ryan with Rand and pancakes.", "title": "Paul Ryan Is the New Speaker of the House.
