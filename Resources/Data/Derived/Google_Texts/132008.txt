People are smoking less today than they ever have, and the rates are only continuing to fall. When the Surgeon General made his first announcement in 1964 that cigarettes are toxic to human health, about 40 percent of the U.S. population smoked. Today, that rate is nearly under 18 percent.

Still, the occasional visual aide can be a helpful way to inject a dose of reality that smoking is bad for you. In May, we saw how smoke affects the lungs after only 60 seconds of exposure. The once pink trachea turned black with smoked tar, the deep tissues of the lung flecked yellow and brown. Even the outside of the lungs, after the equivalent of 60 cigarettes, or three packs, was discolored and tough.

The latest in anti-smoking awareness makes a similar comparison, but after the fact. Two sets of lungs are inflated. The plump, pink set of lungs inflates in an instant, almost as if it were proud of itself. Then the blackened, shriveled lungs inflate. Struggling, they barely swell to a quarter the size of the healthy lungs — visual proof of what is silently and secretly going on inside each smoker’s body every second of every day.
