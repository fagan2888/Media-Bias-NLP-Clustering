And in keeping with Mercedes tradition and the concept's \"luxury in motion\" theme, the post-modern passenger space is trimmed in walnut veneer, nappa leather, polished aluminum and glass, with soft blue LED lighting.\n\nThe F 015 can be operated autonomously or manually. When the vehicle is in fully driverless mode, the four motorized lounge chairs can be rotated to allow face-to-face conversations. When required for manual operation, the driver's chair swivels back to face forward.\n\nTo facilitate connectivity with the outside world, the F 015 is equipped with six digital display screens throughout the cabin. The screens can be activated via gestures, eye-tracking or touch.\n\nRelated: Google's Driverless Car - A Chaffeur for Bad Drivers\n\nMercedes wrapped all that fancy hardware and software in a lightweight, impact-resistant structure of carbon-fiber, aluminum and high-strength steel. The concept was also designed to accommodate an electric motor and hydrogen fuel cell.\n\nThe F 015 represents a huge leap forward conceptually and stylistically from the Mercedes-Benz S 500 Intelligent Drive research vehicle that piloted itself on a 100-kilometer journey from Mannheim to Pforzheim in August 2013.\n\nThe 2013 journey, made in a specially modified S-Class sedan equipped with various automated systems, traced the path driven 125 years earlier by Bertha Benz, wife of company co-founder Karl Benz, in one of the world's first gasoline-powered automobiles.\n\nMercedes currently equips several of its production vehicles with a variety of semi-automated systems, including parking assist, traffic jam assist and steering assist. The company's forward vision, embodied in a project titled \"City of the Future 2030+\", sees self-driving cars as a springboard for redesigning traffic-dense urban spaces with unique \"safety\" zones accessible only by autonomous vehicles.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Germany's Daimler AG wants to reset consumers' expectations about self-driving cars wi", "title": "The Concept Car as a Living Room on Wheels", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/06/Concept-Car-Living-Room-Wheels", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01062015_ConceptCar.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/06/Concept-Car-Living-Room-Wheels", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01062015_ConceptCar.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Germany's Daimler AG wants to reset consumers' expectations about self-driving cars wi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd662\"", "article_summary": "The F 015 luxury sedan concept, with its spacious cabin and lounge-like seating for four, explores new possibilities for self-driving cars that can double as virtual living rooms on wheels.\nTo facilitate connectivity with the outside world, the F 015 is equipped with six digital display screens throughout the cabin.\n\"The car is growing beyond its role as a mere means of transport and will ultimately become a mobile living space.\"\nGermany's Daimler AG wants to reset consumers' expectations about self-driving cars with its futuristic Mercedes-Benz F 015 concept, unveiled Monday evening at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\nThe F 015 can be operated autonomously or manually."}
