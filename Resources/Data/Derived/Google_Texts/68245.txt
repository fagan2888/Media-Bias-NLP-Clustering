Sen. James Inhofe James InhofePaul blocks chemical safety bill in Senate GOP senators propose sending ISIS fighters to Gitmo Overnight Defense: VA chief 'deeply' regrets Disney remark; Senate fight brews over Gitmo MORE (R-Oka.) on Wednesday predicted senators would be able to quickly pass a long-term highway bill, as soon as it wraps up its work on its No Child Left Behind overhaul.

"I anticipate that we will have actually passed in the next few days ... a long-term, maybe a six-year highway reauthorization bill," said Inhofe, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee.

ADVERTISEMENT He made the remarks after the House approved a five-month extension of federal transportation funding, but Senate Republicans have suggested they won't just accept the legislation.

Inhofe sought to downplay any conflict between House and Senate lawmakers over the issue, saying that "people may think there's some type of an adversarial relationship between our bill in the Senate and the House bill â€” there isn't."

"We'll go to conference with the House and it will be business as usual," he added. "I just want to make sure, in case there's a fire looming out there that we put it out early."

He added that based on conversations he's had with House lawmakers, he believes they'll "be very excited over there that we're going to have, and have the funding for, a six-year bill."

The Senate has been working on a six-year, $275 billion transportation funding measure, though it's unclear how that would be paid for.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) paved the way Tuesday for the proposal, setting up a procedural vote on a House-passed bill that would allow businesses to exclude some veterans from ObamaCare's employer mandate. The Senate will use the bill as its vehicle for the highway legislation.

The Republican leader told reporters Tuesday that there's "bipartisan enthusiasm" for a multi-year bill.
