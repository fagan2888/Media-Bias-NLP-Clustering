Varone, who has lived in Walpole for 25 years, filed a petition in 8th Circuit Court Probate Division in Keene on Jan. 15, asking the court to amend the selectmen\u2019s proposal, and to change the way such transactions are handled.\n\nVarone said the selectmen\u2019s plan to put a conservation easement on the land will decrease its value.\n\nIn August, selectmen approved a plan recommended by the Hooper Study Committee, which formed in 2011 to research options for the land. Selectmen serve as trustees of the Hooper Trust, which supervises a variety of nature-based educational programs. The trust is also responsible for the land.\n\nThe N.H. Attorney General\u2019s Charitable Trust Unit, which oversees trusts in the state, has said for years the Hooper Trust wasn\u2019t maximizing the value of the approximately 150 acres of land by leasing it to the golf club. The trust\u2019s duties include getting the highest possible value out of the land, as set forth in the requirements of the trust formed in 1926.\n\nThe town\u2019s plan is to work with the Monadnock Conservancy of Keene to put a conservation easement on the land before selling it to a private buyer at its assessed value of $1,188,000.\n\nBut Varone says selectmen are going about the sale all wrong, and claims they\u2019re hurting the Hooper Trust by not selling the land for the top possible dollar.\n\n\u201cThe problem is their appraisal is based on existing use as a golf course, which is probably not highest and best use,\u201d he said Tuesday in a telephone interview.\n\nVarone said his children have benefited over the years from the educational programs offered at the Frederick H. Hooper Institute, which offers agricultural, forestry, botany, soils and environmental science programs, following the wishes expressed in the will of George L. Hooper. Hooper died in 1916 and willed his mansion and the farmland surrounding it on Prospect Hill to the town for those purposes.\n\nThe institute also awards grants and scholarships to Walpole students in those fields, and Varone said he worries that selectmen\u2019s actions may jeopardize the future of those programs.\n\n\u201cThe Hooper Institute provides educational vocational services to supplement public schools,\u201d he said. \u201cSelling the property for less than it could be sold for is only going to hinder that, (because) you have less cash, and you can\u2019t offer as many scholarships.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my interest, to make sure the educational programs continue.\u201d\n\nPutting a conservation easement on it before selling it will only encumber the property \u201cin a manner that is almost certain to diminish its value because either they themselves do not wish the property put to an alternate lawful use or they believe to be acting on behalf of their constituency ... perhaps both,\u201d Varone said in his petition.\n\nIn its petition seeking permission from the court to sell the land, selectmen said they believe that \u201cgiven the Hoopers\u2019 intentions in donating this real estate, that it was important to attempt to (ensure) that the real estate continued to be left open, with no further development.\u201d\n\nBut Varone said in his petition that he believes the statement is false, and that the Hooper will says that if the town \u201cwishes to relinquish the property, the real estate hereby conveyed shall be sold by the town of Walpole upon the best terms which can be obtained.\n\n\u201cThe only true way to meet their fiduciary obligation to the trust is to sell the property without restriction to the highest bidder using a marketing effort designed to produce such an outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cThe buyer of course is free to encumber the property after purchase if they so wish.\u201d\n\nVarone also claims that selectmen have mismanaged the property for years, including renting the property \u201cfor less than the value of the real estate taxes that should have been paid, had they adhered to (state law) ... no responsible fiduciary would ever do so.\u201d\n\nFor the town\u2019s part, there seems to be some confusion over the tax issue. In the town\u2019s petition to sell the property, selectmen say that they at one of the public hearings on the topic, \u201ca citizen questioned why the (Hooper Golf) Club was not paying real estate taxes to the town ... this added another layer of complexity to the situation.\u201d\n\nIn his petition, Varone criticized selectmen for \u201cgranting the lessee a $500,000 tax exemption to reduce the tax burden. They also paid the taxes that were assessed from the lease payments rather than assessing them to the lessee, thus lowering the income to the trust.\u201d\n\nVarone\u2019s petition also asks the court to remove the selectmen as trustees of the Hooper Trust, and to instead appoint \u201ca special trustee ... to be a disinterested party (non-resident) who will act solely in the best interest of the trust. The selectmen are simply under too much political pressure to act objectively and without bias.\u201d\n\nVarone said Tuesday selectmen are \u201cmore concerned with the outcome of the (sale of) the property than what\u2019s best for the trust, and that\u2019s why court should take it out of their hands. The property is zoned rural/agricultural, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to end up being a Walmart.\u201d\n\nSelectmen Chairwoman Jamie J. Teague declined to comment on the matter, except to say that the town\u2019s attorney, Jeremy Hockensmith, would be filing a response to Varone\u2019s petition in the near future. Hockensmith also declined to speak about the petition.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "SentinelSource.com", "description": "WALPOLE \u2014 A town resident has filed a petition challenging the selectmen\u2019s plan to sell the Hooper Golf Course land.", "title": "Plan to sell Hooper Golf Course land challenged by Walpole resident", "url": "http://www.sentinelsource.com/news/local/plan-to-sell-hooper-golf-course-land-challenged-by-walpole/article_014d818a-ec42-5b3d-b002-af2c6947cdf1.html", "image": {"width": 332, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/sentinelsource.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/d2/7d247a98-9be0-5e4e-8844-1b1bbc808b3f/52e9254c6cfc8.preview-300.jpg?resize=332%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@sentinelsource", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "WALPOLE \u2014 A town resident has filed a petition challenging the selectmen\u2019s plan to sell the Hooper Golf Course land.", "fb": {"app_id": 195134749461}, "keywords": "local,featured,top_story", "google-site-verification": "oOCA50_TAAjdvXwxVnDnOs5yS_kZUqHI6u4prlFHnH4", "news_keywords": "local,featured,top_story"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf38\"", "article_summary": "WALPOLE \u2014 A town resident has filed a petition challenging the selectmen\u2019s plan to sell the Hooper Golf Course land.\nSelectmen serve as trustees of the Hooper Trust, which supervises a variety of nature-based educational programs.\nIn August, selectmen approved a plan recommended by the Hooper Study Committee, which formed in 2011 to research options for the land.\nVarone said the selectmen\u2019s plan to put a conservation easement on the land will decrease its value.\nBut Varone says selectmen are going about the sale all wrong, and claims they\u2019re hurting the Hooper Trust by not selling the land for the top possible dollar."}
