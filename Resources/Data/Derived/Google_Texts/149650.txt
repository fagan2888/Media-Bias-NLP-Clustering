Sears has apologized and removed a men’s swastika ring that was briefly for sale on its Marketplace website.

The “.925 Thai silver Swastika ring” was listed under the “men’s punk rock style” jewelry category.

“Not for Neo Nazi or any Nazi implication. These jewelry items are going to make you look beautiful at your next dinner date,” description read, Haaretz reported.

Sears tweeted personalized responses to dozens of outraged customers, apologizing for the mistake and explaining that sometimes third-party vendors slip through the cracks.

“We certainly understand the upset and regret this occurred. The vendor is being reviewed and the item removed,” Sears tweeted.

“This item is a 3rd party Sears Marketplace product that does not abide with our guidelines and is being removed,” the company said.

The item was also briefly for sale on Amazon.com, though it is listed currently as unavailable, Haaretz reported.

The Jewish parenting website Kveller posted an image of the Sears page with the swastika ring before it was removed.
