But unlike other ads about Obamacare, it wasn\u2019t funded by tax dollars.\n\nGenOpp\u2019s blog, Free the Future, highlights some of the contractor failures.\n\nIn one such failure, a worker quit her job with a contractor that was awarded $1 billion in federal money because she had little work.\n\nThe employees reportedly played games and napped at the office to pass the time.\n\nOr the $474 million in federal money spent on exchange sites that failed in Massachusetts, Oregon, Nevada and Maryland.\n\n\u201cTheir totals are just a fraction of the $4.698 billion that the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation calculates the federal government has approved for states since 2011 to help them determine whether to create their own exchanges and to assist in doing so. Still, the amount of money that now appears wasted is prompting calls for far greater accountability.\u201d\n\nBut while this Uncle Sam is tossing hundred-dollar bills, the real one is making billions rain on contractors for failed exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Creepy Uncle Sam is making it rain for \"glitchy IT contractors\" in the latest Generation Opportunity video.
