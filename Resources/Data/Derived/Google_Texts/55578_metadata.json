In fact, the actor thinks the rumors are highly complimentary.\n\nIn an upcoming episode of Inside the Actors Studio, the 32-year-old also talked about his relationship with co-star Heath Ledger, whose death he said \u201cfelt like losing a family member, and it still does to this day.\u201d\n\nGyllenhaal and Ledger first met when they both auditioned for the 2001 film Moulin Rouge.\n\n\u201cI remember him just saying, like, \u2018F**k Baz [Luhrmann, the film\u2019s director],\u2019 and I remember thinking, \u2018I like this guy, he\u2019s just like super lovable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Brokeback came and they said, \u2018Ang wants this combination, you and Heath.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Heath Ledger?'\u201d\n\nGyllenhaal also said that the gay rumors that started circulating after the film came out were a \u201chuge compliment\u201d but that he prefers \u201ct**s and a**.\u201d\n\nSince Brokeback Mountain\u2018s release, Gyllenhaal has dated Rendition co-star Reese Witherspoon and Taylor Swift. He began dating model Alyssa Miller this summer.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal isn\u2019t the only actor to take pride in rumors about his sexuality. Following his Comedy Central roast, James Franco said he wished he was gay. Franco also went on to say that the stuff that happened off camera was even worse.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two sides to what happened in the roast. If that\u2019s what they were going to make fun of me for, I was like, \u2018Great! Bring on the gay jokes!\u2019 because these aren\u2019t insults at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even care if people think I\u2019m gay, so it was like, \u2018Awesome!\u2019 I mean, I wish I was\u2026 I wish I was gay.\u201d\n\nFranco went on to say that some of the jokes were more disturbing than funny.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not necessarily up on the comedy world, so it\u2019s interesting to see what\u2019s acceptable as far as gay jokes and Indian jokes. They had to cut about 40-60 minutes of it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Jeff Ross was saying some crazy s***. They weren\u2019t even funny, these jokes, they just gave me nightmares. He was referencing the Ohio kidnapper dude, abortion, it was just like\u2026 \u2018oh, God.'\u201d\n\nJake Gyllenhall\u2019s episode of Inside the Actors Studio premieres September 19 on Bravo. His new film, Prisoners, which co-stars Hugh Jackman, is set to be released September 20.\n\n[Photo credit: Helga Esteb / Shutterstock.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jake Gyllenhaal isn't offended by questions about his sexuality after playing a gay cowboy in the 2005 Oscar-winning film Brokeback Mountain.
