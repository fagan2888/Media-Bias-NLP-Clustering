So every month, I don't send a check directly to our offices in Peoria, Illinois. I send a check to Tom Smith in Iowa or Gary Johnson in New Mexico,\u201d said James Lansberry with Samaritan Ministries.\n\n\n\nWhile this is not considered insurance, it does satisfy the federal coverage mandate under Obamacare, but most members rave about the cost.\n\n\n\nOn average, these programs are roughly 30 percent cheaper than traditional insurance plans, according to a study from the Association of Health Insurance Providers.\n\n\n\nThe cost is $180 a month for a single person and it runs $405 a month for a family. There are no real deductibles.\n\n\n\nPreventative care is not included, but members don't really seem to mind.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou kind of look at this and say well, it's not going to cover my colonoscopy every 10 years, my physical once a year with blood work. You figure, if I'm saving three or $400 a month, I think I can budget for a physical,\u201d said Daniel Sneed, a religious exchange participant.\n\n\n\nPre-existing conditions are covered under these religious exchanges.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"ib-analytics": "data", "description": "Since the controversial roll out of Obamacare, many Americans have turned to faith-based groups for their insurance and health care needs.", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "og": {"site_name": "fox21online", "description": "Since the controversial roll out of Obamacare, many Americans have turned to faith-based groups for their insurance and health care needs.", "title": "Enrollment Increases in Faith-Based Alternatives to Health Insurance", "url": "http://www.fox21online.com/features/Enrollment-Increases-in-Faith-Based-Alternatives-to-Health-Insurance/36348184", "image": "http://www.fox21online.com/image/view/-/36355692/medRes/2/-/maxh/640/maxw/640/-/3rlkgfz/-/imgEnrollment-Increases-in-Faith-Based-Health-Insurance.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.fox21online.com/features/Enrollment-Increases-in-Faith-Based-Alternatives-to-Health-Insurance/36348184", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 778484812222310}, "keywords": "health insurance, faith-based alternatives, medi-share, samaritan ministries", "google-site-verification": "vcAmUSGL7qsu2lvYwi_nhJLc_WwUQkPjQyh_hcN5vAM", "news_keywords": "health insurance, faith-based alternatives, medi-share, samaritan ministries"}, "article_summary": "On average, these programs are roughly 30 percent cheaper than traditional insurance plans, according to a study from the Association of Health Insurance Providers.\nSince the controversial roll out of Obamacare, many Americans have turned to faith-based groups for their insurance and health care needs.\nThen you submit medical bills to the exchange and fellow members send you the cash to cover them in full.\nMore than 50,000 households are part of the Samaritan ministry program, moving $15 million among its members each month.\nWhile this is not considered insurance, it does satisfy the federal coverage mandate under Obamacare, but most members rave about the cost."}
