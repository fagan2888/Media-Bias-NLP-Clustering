The Walking Dead maintained enough momentum on Sunday night to again to the Winter Olympics.



In the second episode of its midseason run, the AMC drama was Sunday's top performer among adults 18-49, averaging 8.7 million viewers in the key demographic. That's down from the premiere's 10.4 million -- but enough to lock in a win against NBC's Sochi coverage.



That's an advantage of nearly 30 percent, with The Walking Dead's 6.9 rating in the key demo topping the Olympics' 4.8 rating for the night.



Among total viewers, The Walking Dead pulled 13.3 million at 9 p.m. The Winter Games, with an average 21.3 million, again easily surpassed the series in viewership.



The Walking Dead had bigger competition in its second outing, facing both Sochi and the NBA All-Star Game. Post-show The Talking Dead averaged 4.8 million viewers and 3.1 million adults 18-49.
