Though strange, the idea quickly went viral, with over eight million views since it was posted in early October.\n\nBut while a rainbow ice cream pooping unicorn is entertaining, is there any science behind the Squatty Potty\u2019s actual design? Apparently, yes. The human body was designed to defecate in a squatting position, something that gets lost during modern pooping habits, The Guardian reported. When we squat, we take pressure off from our bottoms. Too much pressure on the anus can cause individuals to develop uncomfortable and sometimes painful hemorrhoids, or swollen veins in the anal canal. These hemorrhoids occur both from strained bowel movements and come about when we spend too much time on the toilet \u2014 two behaviors the Squatty Potty claims to correct.\n\nThe Squatty Potty company was launched in 2011 and received funding from Shark Tank last November, Newser reported. Now, thanks to the viral video, created by The Harmon Brothers, the same company behind 2013\u2019s Poo Pourri, the affordable and discreet toilet stools are getting more exposure than ever before.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "squatty, potty, viral, video, enlists, constipated, unicorn, help, get, america, pooping, better", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Is there actually any science behind the viral campaign for the Squatty Potty toilet seat stool?", "title": "Constipated Unicorn Finds Relief With Squatty Potty And You Can, Too", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/squatty-potty-viral-video-enlists-constipated-unicorn-help-get-america-pooping-better-363452", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/01/squatty-potty-viral-video-enlists-constipated-unicorn-help-get-america-pooping-better.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Is there actually any science behind the viral campaign for the Squatty Potty toilet seat stool?", "title": "Constipated Unicorn Finds Relief With Squatty Potty And You Can, Too", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/squatty-potty-viral-video-enlists-constipated-unicorn-help-get-america-pooping-better-363452", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/01/squatty-potty-viral-video-enlists-constipated-unicorn-help-get-america-pooping-better.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/01/squatty-potty-viral-video-enlists-constipated-unicorn-help-get-america-pooping-better.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-12-01T15:33:07-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-01T15:33:04-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Is there actually any science behind the viral campaign for the Squatty Potty toilet seat stool?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf267\"", "article_summary": "But while a rainbow ice cream pooping unicorn is entertaining, is there any science behind the Squatty Potty\u2019s actual design?\nThe Squatty Potty company was launched in 2011 and received funding from Shark Tank last November, Newser reported.\nYou\u2019ve probably been pooping wrong your whole life, but fear not, because the makers of the Squatty Potty have enlisted the help of a mythical unicorn to set you back on the path for a healthy colon.\nThese hemorrhoids occur both from strained bowel movements and come about when we spend too much time on the toilet \u2014 two behaviors the Squatty Potty claims to correct.\nThough strange, the idea quickly went viral, with over eight million views since it was posted in early October."}
