The company took a hit when the crude oil plunge significantly dropped oil prices towards the end of 2014 due to weak demand and the strengthening dollar.\n\nEven though oil prices are beginning to recover, oil stocks are still lacking in sales growth making Exxon unattractive to investors.\n\n5 top-performing analysts have rated Exxon over the past 3 months with 3 bearish ratings and 2 neutral ratings, making the company\u2019s top analysts\u2019 consensus a Moderate Sell.\n\nExxon was recently rated on January 23rd by 4-Star analyst Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse, who downgraded his rating to Sell.

The company recently reported its fourth quarter earnings, revealing a big profit drop largely due to tax charges. Overall, VeriSign reported a profit of $65.5 million, down from $292.1 million, a year earlier.\n\nThe profit decrease is due to domain renewal rates dropped from 72.7% a year earlier to 72% and new registered domains missing the company\u2019s projection of 700,000, reaching only 590,000 for the quarter.\n\nIn the last 3 months, 1 top ranked analyst rated Verisign a bearish rating, making the company\u2019s top analyst consensus a Strong Sell.\n\nVerisign was recently rated a Sell on January 26th by 4-Star analyst Phillip Winslow of Credit Suisse, noting \u201cWe believe the risk/reward from VeriSign\u2019s current share price, which equates to a NTM EV/UFCF multiple of 13.1 (versus our forecasted 5-year CAGRs for operating profit and EPS of 5.0% and 8.9%, respectively), is biased to the downside given (1) near-term risk to domain name growth and (2) our expectation for slowing operating profit and EPS growth relative to valuation.\u201d\n\nVerisign is currently valued at $7.31 billion.\n\nTo see more recommendations for these strongly recommended stocks, visit TipRanks today!", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Smarter Analyst", "description": "2014 was an eventful year on Wall Street with many ups and downs.
