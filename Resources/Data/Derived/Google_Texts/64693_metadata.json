State itemized deductions are no longer identical to federal deductions for charitable contributions.\n\nThe $50,000 business deduction had ended for Schedule C proprietors and the self-employed.\n\n\u201cIndividuals should use the Jan. 20 opening date as the baseline when calculating tax refund expectations,\u201d the state Revenue Department said.\n\nSome tax-preparation experts said it may not be clear until well into the 2014 filing season whether state tax reform will result in the average taxpayer getting a larger or small state refund, or whether they will pay when they are accustomed to getting a refund.\n\n\u201cEach individual tax situation is different, so the changes will have varying effects for North Carolina taxpayers,\u201d said Genie Petrangeli, senior manager of Bernard Robinson & Co. LLP, which has two Triad offices.\n\n\u201cAlthough there is a drop in deductions in 2014, the good news is the tax rate is a flat 5.8 percent. This will suffice for many of the lost deductions. That is a tremendous decrease for taxpayers who paid 7.75 percent in prior years.\u201d\n\nMark Steber, chief tax officer for Jackson Hewitt, projects the majority of North Carolinians will be affected positively in terms of their state refund. He said it will take several weeks of returns to see if that projection holds true.\n\n\u201cThe changes are likely to confuse some people because they won\u2019t need the usual paperwork to verify the deductions they have claimed in the past,\u201d Steber said.\n\nSteber said he believes the bigger lesson taxpayers will learn from the 2014 tax filing season is making sure to reflect any life and family changes in their return.\n\n\u201cIf someone is now taking care of mom and dad, they likely have another dependent to claim,\u201d Steber said.\n\n\u201cIf someone is now taking educational classes, they likely qualify for one of the educational or lifelong learning tax credits.\u201d\n\nRegarding the federal tax return, taxpayers who met the minimum essential coverage requirement of the Affordable Care Act will just have to check off the box.\n\nWhat qualifies as minimum essential coverage includes: most job-based plans, including retiree plans and COBRA coverage; Medicare Part A or Part C; Medicaid; the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program; most individual health plans bought outside the federal marketplace; and coverage under a parent\u2019s plan for those under age 26.\n\n\u201cAll marketplace consumers will receive a new statement \u2013 called a Form 1095-A \u2013 in the mail by early February that includes all the information they need about their coverage to file their return,\u201d according to the federal DHHS. A downloadable version will be available in most states in late January.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to wait for your Form 1095-A to arrive before you file your taxes,\u201d the federal DHHS said.\n\n\u201cIf your marketplace coverage started partway through 2014 and you were uninsured earlier in the year, or if you were uninsured for only a short period of time during the year, you may be eligible for an exemption from the requirement to have health coverage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "35.779590;-78.638179", "description": "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Tax filing season begins in earnest Tuesday in North Carolina, with significant federal and state changes that could confuse and exasperate some taxpayers, according to the Winston-Salem Journal.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "myfox8.com", "description": "RALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 Tax filing season begins in earnest Tuesday in North Carolina, with significant federal and state changes that could confuse and exasperate some taxpayers, according to the Wi\u2026", "title": "North Carolina tax-filing changes could generate confusion", "url": "http://myfox8.com/2015/01/18/north-carolina-tax-filing-changes-could-generate-confusion/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwghp.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/taxes.jpg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwghp.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/taxes.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@myfox8", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@myfox8"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Weather, Sports and more from WGHP Fox 8 Television", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=576468704", "fb": {"pages": 66055982622}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://myfox8.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/d6825caa4f715bb372290d2344aae986?s=16", "application-name": "myfox8.com", "ICBM": "35.779590, -78.638179", "keywords": "news, taxes", "google-site-verification": "Yn8rglGvxxL_bChOFSZTPKslhj-7-DDnVf-rpVixhQs", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox8news", "published_time": "2015-01-19T02:34:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-19T02:41:55+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox8news"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd4a1\"", "article_summary": "\u00d7 North Carolina tax-filing changes could generate confusionRALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 Tax filing season begins in earnest Tuesday in North Carolina, with significant federal and state changes that could confuse and exasperate some taxpayers, according to the Winston-Salem Journal.\nState itemized deductions are no longer identical to federal deductions for charitable contributions.\n\u201cEach individual tax situation is different, so the changes will have varying effects for North Carolina taxpayers,\u201d said Genie Petrangeli, senior manager of Bernard Robinson & Co.
