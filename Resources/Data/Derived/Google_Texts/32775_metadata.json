The Milwaukee Journal/Sentinel just ran an article \"Obama visit celebrates ACA\" (3/4/16). The visit was a prize (yes, Obama coming to Milwaukee was the reward) bestowed upon Milwaukee for winning the White House's Healthy Communities Challenge - a nationwide competition among 20 cities in which Milwaukee won by signing up the largest percentage of new enrollees (38,000) to Obamacare. (As a side note, doesn't Obamacare make health care insurance mandatory for everyone now anyhow? After all, people are supposed to be fined and pay penalties for NOT having such. What gives?) A contest in order to get more people on yet another entitlement program is in itself rather pathetic. It's akin to having a ticker tape parade to \"celebrate\" the largest amount of Americans EVER having to rely on food stamps (almost 48 million and counting)due to Obama's policies.\n\nNow, all Obama could tout about Obamacare was, well, that a few more thousand people signed up. To Obama, getting more people reliant on yet another government program is supposedly a success. But, is that REALLY the definition of success? No. It is not.\n\nSuccess would be an actual health care system that works. A system that doesn't require huge increases in health care premiums, copays, and deductibles. A system that allows one to keep their own doctor. A system that allows one to keep their own health insurance. A system that upholds people's religious beliefs. A system that is not designed to take and redistribute the earnings of taxpayers and spend such as the government sees fit. A system that does not discourage people from wanting to go into the health care fields. A system that ensures quality health care in a timely manner. A system that does not put America on a path towards a single-payer system.\n\nObamacare does none of these things. Quite the contrary.\n\nThe fact is Obamacare is not a success - Obamacare is a failure. Those who are being forced to pay (propping up Obamacare for the time being) the increased costs of health care created by Obamacare - are carrying the burden of paying for subsidies for those who cannot afford health care. Obamacare, in order to work, has to keep getting those who are healthy, and preferably younger, to pay in. And don't forget - all of the other mandates of Obamacare haven't even kicked in yet - when costs will continue to skyrocket and even more burdens will be placed on businesses and individuals in the future to help fund this unsustainable government social program.\n\nAnd Milwaukee had to celebrate this garbage with a visit from the narcissist-in-chief. Par for the course, Obama can never resist taking un-presidential swipes at those who do not agree with him or his ideology. Obama made a few snide remarks about Governor Scott Walker, chiding him for refusing to expand Medicaid in the state. No mention that Badger Care is still available in the state for the needy. Also, no mention that if Wisconsin did expand Medicaid, once the federal monies dried up (in the near future), the state would be left hanging high and dry and be forced to fund Medicaid on its own for years to come. Walker made the right call, and Obama glossed over the facts - and pitfalls - as usual.\n\nIn closing, it would be wonderful if a real act of journalism occurred in regards to Obama's Milwaukee stop. Specifically, it was strange that an individual - Brent Brown - was chosen to introduce Obama as Obama graced Milwaukee with his presence. Brown is supposedly a Republican who never voted for Obama, but credited Obama and the ACA act with saving his life. Brown - according to the story - had a pre-existing condition and couldn't afford treatment. Obamacare \"saved his life.\" Could a more ideal candidate to introduce the President have ever been found? I doubt it. It's almost TOO perfect. A devout Republican who suddenly had an epiphany and realized that Obama and Obamacare are the second coming - even apologizing to Obama for his former anti-Obama beliefs. I would think that any real journalist would have taken some time to check out a few things. Such as: what is this person's (Brent Brown) background? Is his story really true? or false? Did Team Obama pay him? How did they find him? What was the extent of his illness that nothing could save him but Obamacare? Think the Milwaukee Journal/Sentinel would have seen fit to do a little checking rather than taking Mr. Brown's story at face value - the who, what, why, when, where, and how. If true, Mr. Brown's story would be a Lifetime movie in the making if there ever was one! If false, no surprise. It's Obama after all. Just sayin'.\n\nAll we can do now is wait for November 2016, and hope that Obama and Obamacare become bad, fading memories.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.lakecountrynow.com/opinion/blogs/communityblogs/371106941.html", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/lc-share-logo.jpg", "height": 700}, "type": "article", "description": "If Obamacare is so wonderful, why does the White House have to run a &quot;contest&quot; in order to get people to participate?
