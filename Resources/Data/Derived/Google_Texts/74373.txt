The Oconee County Coroner's Office said a teenager died Friday night due to complications of an apparent drowning at Lake Keowee.

Coroner Karl Addis said Oconee County 911 services received a call at 5:22 p.m. for assistance with a missing person in the water at Fall Creek, a popular swimming location on Lake Keowee.

Addis said 17-year-old Treven J. Tolliver from Greer was recovered from a water depth of 26 feet and resuscitated.

After being transferred to Greenville Memorial Hospital, Tolliver died from complications at 9:17 p.m.

Tolliver was a senior at Greer High School, according to Greenville County Schools' spokesman Oby Lyles.

Lyles said counselors with the school district's Grief Response Team will be available to speak with students and staff at Greer High School on Monday.

The death remains under investigation by the Oconee County Sheriff's Office and the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. Addis said the preliminary investigation indicates Tolliver's death was accidental.
