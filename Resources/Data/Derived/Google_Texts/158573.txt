Black Lives Matter protesters interrupted holiday shopping and travel in cities across the U.S. Thursday, using the holiday season as a way to draw attention to their cause. Protesters in Chicago staged a "die-in," laying down on the streets of a major shopping district on Michigan Avenue in order to protest the 2014 fatal shooting of black 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, who was shot 16 times by a police officer. The protests came one day after Minneapolis Black Lives Matter protesters flooded the Mall of America and the Minneapolis airport chanting for justice for Jamar Clark, a 24-year-old black man killed in a police shooting last month.
