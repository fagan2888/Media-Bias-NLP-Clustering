The U.S. economy is gorgeous, he insists.\n\n\u201cIn the United States, our economy is growing again,\u201d Obama crowed during his trip to Germany last month. And the American people would appreciate all of this \u201cif we had been able to more effectively communicate all the steps we had taken\u201d to improve it, he recently told one news outlet.\n\n\u201cIt is very hard to get good stories placed\u201d about the economy, Obama whined to college journalists last week. \u201cPeople will assign you stories about what\u2019s not working. It\u2019s very hard for you to write a story about, \u2018Wow, this thing really works good.'\u201d\n\nThat grammatical gaffe aside, a failure to communicate is not among Obama\u2019s myriad weaknesses.\n\nAs his self-confident and hilarious appearance at last Saturday\u2019s White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner confirmed, Obama is a gifted speaker. The national media have eaten out of his hand since he descended from the heavens, fully formed, at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. As president, he can summon two dozen TV cameras and just as many microphones just by crawling out of bed every morning. So, the notion that Obama cannot express his economic message \u201cgood\u201d deeply insults the intelligence of the American people.\n\nWhile Obama can talk the bark off a banyan tree, he cannot make Americans hallucinate prosperity. Here is the sad picture they actually see:\n\nThe unemployment rate has improved significantly, from 7.8 percent at Obama\u2019s January 20, 2009, inauguration to 5.0 percent in April.\n\nHowever, as more and more Americans stop looking for work, the Labor Force Participation Rate on Obama\u2019s watch has fallen from 65.7 percent to 62.8 percent, a level last measured before Obama in March 1978. Since Obama took office, this metric has slid 4.1 percent.\n\nLast month saw the creation of 160,000 jobs, a widely panned number, and much below the 200,000-plus jobs generated in five of the last six months. Nothing about the latest employment report spells \u201cboom.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, annualized GDP growth nearly stalled in the first quarter at a meager 0.5 percent. This is down from already tepid 1.4 percent growth in the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\nObama is the only U.S. chief executive in history not to preside over even a single year with 3 percent GDP growth, as the Institute for Policy Innovation\u2019s Tom Giovanetti observes:\n\n\u2018From 1790 to 2000, U.S. real GDP growth averaged 3.79 percent,\u2019 entrepreneur Louis Woodhill explained at RealClearMarkets. He expects final figures to show that \u20182015 will have been the tenth year in a row that real GDP growth came in at under 3.0 percent.\u2019\n\nDuring the Obama years, the number of Americans below the poverty line is up 3.5 percent.\n\nReal median household income: down 2.3 percent.\n\nAmericans on Food Stamps \u2013 33 million then, 46 million now: up 39.5 percent.\n\nAmericans who own homes: down 5.6 percent.\n\nNational debt \u2013 $10.63 trillion then vs. $19.19 trillion last Wednesday: up 80.5 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, millions of college-educated Millennials are languishing in their parents\u2019 basements and wallowing in student debt, with limited prospects. Many of those who have found work lag their predecessors.\n\nA recent report by New York City\u2019s Democratic comptroller Scott Stringer found that Gotham employees born between 1985 and 1996 earn roughly 20 percent less than their peers a generation earlier. Lack of work and lower wages are a recipe for student-debt hangovers. Robust economic growth is the cure.\n\n\u201cThis generation is at a crossroads. They worked hard, got an education and then faced roadblocks to getting a good-paying job,\u201d Stringer told U.S. News and World Report. \u201cWe need to foster an economy here that helps young people get ahead, not one that holds them back.\u201d\n\nInsurance companies are fleeing Obamacare\u2019s exchanges. Amid $650 million in expected losses this year, UnitedHealth announced that it would medevac itself out of all but \u201ca handful\u201d of its 34 state markets.\n\nThe percentage of families in which no one is employed has grown from 17.8 in 2008 to 19.7 in 2015, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports.\n\nFor details on these data, click here:\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal\u2018s Dan Henninger has noted, even the Clintons acknowledge Obama\u2019s economic wreckage.\n\nAmericans are suffering \u201cthe awful legacy of the last eight years,\u201d Bill Clinton said in March. He explained on April 26, \u201cThe problem is, 80 percent of the American people are still living on what they were living on the day before the crash [of 2008]. And about half the American people, after you adjust for inflation, are living on what they were living on the last day I was president, 15 years ago. So that\u2019s what\u2019s the matter.\u201d\n\nStumping in New Haven, Conn., Hillary Clinton spoke about a nurse who is facing breast cancer and foreclosure.\n\n\u201cShe is speaking for so many people across our country who feel beaten down, left out and left behind,\u201d Hillary said. \u201cPeople who have worked hard and done their part, but just can\u2019t seem to get ahead, and find it tough even to get by.\u201d\n\nIn Obama\u2019s eighth year, Americans remain in pain. The best thing he can do is apologize, stop talking, and leave us alone until January 20, 2017.\n\nA version of this piece also appeared on National Review Online.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Accuracy In Media", "description": "If this morning's employment report has you down, just listen to President Obama.
