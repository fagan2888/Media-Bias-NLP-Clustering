SAN TAN VALLEY, Ariz. -- This time of year there is no shortage of stories about high school seniors pulling pranks and being told their presence at graduation is not needed as a result.

This story is the polar opposite.

Seniors at Combs High School in Arizona graduate on Thursday, but perhaps more memorable than the Class of 2014's walk across the stage is what a group of students did to help a man in need. The group of seniors organized a plan called "prank it forward" according to FOX affiliate KSAZ.

The students raised money over the course of 10 days to help a waiter at a local Olive Garden who needed money for medical bills. The group stopped in for lunch and left the waiter a cash tip of $510, which was caught on camera and applauded by other customers.

"And as he opened it, all the money was right there, and he was like, 'um, here you go." And we were like, 'no, Combs High School is presenting this prank it forward to you because you deserve it," said Angelica Whinnery.

Students and other teachers hope this gesture catches on and is duplicated in the future.

"More people get a benefit out of this than we would out of pranking our school," said Karla Alfaro.
