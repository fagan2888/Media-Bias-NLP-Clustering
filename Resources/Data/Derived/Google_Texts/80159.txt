Eight people were without a home after a fire at a Fort Worth apartment complex early Friday, officials said.

The fire was reported about 2:30 a.m. in the 3100 block of Sappington Place.

Fire crews had to cut electricity to the 20-unit apartment building so they could extinguish the two-alarm fire, which was out within 20 minutes, Fort Worth Fire Department spokesman Kyle Falkner said.

Four units had fire, smoke and water damage.

Falkner said one man was taken to a hospital after he jumped from a second-floor balcony to avoid the blaze, but he wasnâ€™t seriously injured.

The cause of the fire was still under investigation as of 9:30 a.m. The American Red Cross was helping the displaced families.
