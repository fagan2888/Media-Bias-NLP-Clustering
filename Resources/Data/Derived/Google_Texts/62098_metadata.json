But what happens when a worker falls prey to perfectionism?\n\nHigh standards and the pursuit of excellence are always desirable traits. The need for due diligence and thoughtful analysis are critical, too (think infrastructure or medicine). But many highly skilled employees, in a quest for perfection, can gum up the works, hold their teams back and stand in the way of innovation because they\u2019re aiming for somewhere north of superb - making perfectionism toxic in the workplace.\n\nRelated: The One Trait All Leaders Should Have\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an inherent danger in being a \u2018perfection\u2019 chaser,\u201d says Travis Furlow of Alexander Mann Solutions, a global talent management firm in Detroit. \u201cIt sets an expectation that isn\u2019t normally achievable.\u201d\n\nPerfectionist employees are usually pretty easy to spot. They re-do projects over and over to get things \u201cjust right.\u201d They can be risk averse. They can lose sight of a firm\u2019s larger goals or of their own. (Real perfectionism, of course, can be severely destructive and can lead to anxiety, depression or even suicide, a paper in Review of General Psychology argued last fall.)\n\nMost perfectionists are focused on getting every little thing exactly right \u2013 which often backfires.\n\nRelated: The Physical Traits That Can Get You Promoted\n\nIf you recognize signs of perfectionism in yourself or in people you know, these expert insights can help you break free of this less-than-desirable quality.\n\n1: Aiming for perfection often eliminates creativity, spontaneity and disruption \u2013 all qualities that are integral to doing well at work.\n\n\u201cFinding a way to be OK with \u2018pretty good\u2019 and staying focused on productivity is instead the path to success,\u201d says Michele Woodward, an executive coach in the Washington, D.C. area. \u201cPeople need to get their work out there and revise as needed.\u201d She says that when she did that in her own career \u2013 her work took off.\n\n\u201cAs a proactive leader you always have the option of revising or tweaking something afterward,\u201d adds Chuck Wardell, CEO of executive search firm Witt/Kieffer in Oak Brook, Illinois.\n\n2: \u201cSolutions are only \u2018perfect\u2019 at the moment they\u2019re created because the marketplace is changing all the time,\u201d says Kim Janson, an executive coach at the Harvard Business School and author of the new book, Demystifying Talent Management: Unleash People\u2019s Potential to Deliver Superior Results.\n\nInstead of toiling away on an idea with a limited lifespan (thus missing an opportunity altogether), be willing to stick your neck out, to say \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d and to keep pushing forward. \u201cIn the long run you\u2019ll be more productive, gain more experience and help your business be more innovative,\u201d advises Travis Furlow of Alexander Mann Solutions.\n\nRelated: Why You Should Start Thinking Like an Entrepreneur\n\n3: Perfectionism is often rooted in a lack of confidence. \u201cWe are so afraid of the ramifications of being wrong that we overachieve,\u201d says Julianne Franke, a career coach in the Atlanta area.\n\nInstead, have enough faith in yourself and your ability to handle rejection or failure \u2013 there just isn\u2019t time to do otherwise. \u201cToday\u2019s workers and leaders are overburdened with more than they can handle, so perfectionism isn\u2019t really an option,\u201d says Franke. \u201cPushing ahead also builds confidence and resilience, which is crucial to succeeding.\u201d\n\n4: Ironically, many leaders are perfectionists by nature. \u201cIt\u2019s partly why they were able to achieve leadership status in the first place,\u201d says Matt Rizzetta, CEO of North 6th Agency, a communications firm based in New York City.\n\nIt\u2019s the rare leader who holds himself to an ultra-high level of performance but holds off on expecting perfectionism from others - which can breed second guessing in employees. Instead, replace perfectionism with accountability. \u201cAccept that nobody\u2019s perfect, that mistakes will be made,\u201d says Rizzetta. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s a system of full accountability and those who make mistakes commit to making improvements, organizations will generally come out in better shape than if mistakes were never made in the first place.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Men and Women Still Can't Get Along at Work\n\n5: \u201cOrganizations should define when \u2018slightly less than perfect\u2019 will be good enough, as well when more rigor and care are needed,\u201d advises Ray Carvey, executive vice president at Harvard Business Publishing. \u201cA process should be in place to capture learning from any failures that do occur.\u201d\n\nMany new employees are not going to excel right out of the gate but often make a very good move \u2013 which can be better than a \u201cperfect\u201d move that takes days or weeks to execute, says Carvey. A transparent work process that shares control and accountability across teams is smart to implement.\n\n\u201cMistakes do happen, but the pace at which people complete products is much faster \u2013 a reasonable tradeoff in today\u2019s business environment. Even with imperfect data, conflicting inputs and never enough time, today\u2019s leaders need to take action and move the business forward,\u201d says Carvey. \u201cThose who can adapt will be successful the fastest.\u201d As will employees of all levels.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There isn\u2019t a company in America that doesn\u2019t want great employees \u2013 people with knowl", "title": "The One Trait That Could Hurt a Great Career", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/04/One-Trait-Could-Hurt-Great-Career", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03042015_Vince_Vaughn_Unfinished_Business_Stock_Photos09.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/04/One-Trait-Could-Hurt-Great-Career", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03042015_Vince_Vaughn_Unfinished_Business_Stock_Photos09.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There isn\u2019t a company in America that doesn\u2019t want great employees \u2013 people with knowl", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd0ba\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMistakes do happen, but the pace at which people complete products is much faster \u2013 a reasonable tradeoff in today\u2019s business environment.\nEven with imperfect data, conflicting inputs and never enough time, today\u2019s leaders need to take action and move the business forward,\u201d says Carvey.\n\u201cToday\u2019s workers and leaders are overburdened with more than they can handle, so perfectionism isn\u2019t really an option,\u201d says Franke.\n\u201cWe are so afraid of the ramifications of being wrong that we overachieve,\u201d says Julianne Franke, a career coach in the Atlanta area.\n\u201cIt sets an expectation that isn\u2019t normally achievable.\u201dPerfectionist employees are usually pretty easy to spot."}
