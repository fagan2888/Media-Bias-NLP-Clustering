Higher rates of diabetes, obesity, or asthma in some communities may place them at greater risk of climate-related health impacts. Children who breathe more air relative to their size than adults are also at higher risk of worsened asthma and respiratory symptoms from air pollution.\u201d\n\nAs part of the initiative, the administration is expanding its Climate Data Initiative, which it launched a year ago, to include more than 150 health-relevant data sets.\n\nThe White House also announced a coalition of deans from 30 medical, public health, and nursing schools around the country, who are committing to ensure that the next generation of health professionals is trained to address the health impacts of climate change. Those universities include Johns Hopkins, the University of Maryland, Harvard University and the University of Nebraska.\n\n\u201cClimate change is posing a threat to more people, in more places, to their public health,\u201d White House senior adviser Brian Deese told reporters on a conference call today, according to The Washington Post.\n\nObama was scheduled to meet today at Howard University in Washington with public experts and senior administration officials, as well as the mother of a child suffering from asthma. Asthma is made much worse by warmer temperatures that contribute to the formation of smog. Deese cited a recent study by the American Thoracic Society that found that seven out of 10 doctors reported climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients.\n\nRelated: How Climate Change Costs Could Soar to the Billions\n\n\u201cOne thing that we know is the most salient arguments around climate change are the ones around health impacts and involve meeting people where they are,\u201d Deese told reporters.\n\nGerald Davis, a physical fitness trainer in Washington who suffers from asthma, applauded the president\u2019s new initiative -- although he wondered whether it is coming too late. He said the combination of air pollution, wide-spread pollen throughout the spring and dramatic changes in temperature have made it very difficult for him to breathe and sleep at night.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in global warming, wake up with me in the morning,\u201d Davis said in an interview today.\n\nAsthma is a chronic obstructive lung disease, caused by increased reaction of the airways to various stimuli such as pollen, mold, dust and animal dander, according to the American Lung Association. Asthma can be a life-threatening disease if not properly managed.\n\nRelated: Despite Evidence, Global Warming Ranks Low on Americans\u2019 Worry List\n\nExperts say asthma is one of the most common chronic disorders in childhood that currently affects an estimated 7.1 million children under the age of 18. Exposure to cold air or sudden temperate change can also cause dangerous reactions.\n\nThe annual direct health care cost of asthma is approximately $50.1 billion, according to the lung association. Indirect costs such as lost productivity add another $5.9 billion to the total.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In the latest twist to his campaign to combat global warming, President Obama on Tuesd", "title": "Obama Warns of Costly Public Health Crisis Spurred by Climate Change", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/07/Obama-Warns-Costly-Public-Health-Crisis-Spurred-Climate-Change", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06162014_Obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/07/Obama-Warns-Costly-Public-Health-Crisis-Spurred-Climate-Change", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06162014_Obama.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In the latest twist to his campaign to combat global warming, President Obama on Tuesd", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd965f\"", "article_summary": "Related: How Climate Change Costs Could Soar to the Billions\u201cOne thing that we know is the most salient arguments around climate change are the ones around health impacts and involve meeting people where they are,\u201d Deese told reporters.\nHigher rates of diabetes, obesity, or asthma in some communities may place them at greater risk of climate-related health impacts.\n\u201cClimate change is posing a threat to more people, in more places, to their public health,\u201d White House senior adviser Brian Deese told reporters on a conference call today, according to The Washington Post.\nThe White House also announced a coalition of deans from 30 medical, public health, and nursing schools around the country, who are committing to ensure that the next generation of health professionals is trained to address the health impacts of climate change.\nDeese cited a recent study by the American Thoracic Society that found that seven out of 10 doctors reported climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients."}
