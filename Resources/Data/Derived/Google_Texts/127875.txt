PA-9: NRLC Endorses Shuster in GOP Primary

Written by James Foster, Contributing Writer

Pro-life advocacy group The National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) announced Thursday they will be supporting Congressman Bill Shuster in his bid for re-election in April.

In their endorsement, the NRLC cited Shuster’s voting record on pro-life issues such as the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act and Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act as well as his membership in Precious Life of Blair County.

“All voters who are concerned with the right to life and with the protection of the most vulnerable members of the human family should vote to return you to Congress, so that you can continue to work to advance vital pro-life public policies,” NRLC leaders wrote in a letter to Congressman Shuster.

“Fighting for the right to life has always been a priority for me and I was pleased that pro-life leaders decided I am the best candidate in this race to fight for pro-life values,” said Shuster. “We need steadfast leadership on these issues in Congress, including a full repeal of Obamacare, which allows federal subsidies to cover abortions.”

Shuster will be facing stiff competition in April from primary challenger Art Halvorson who recently called for Shuster’s resignation as Chair of the House Transportation Committee following accusations of fraud.

The 9th Congressional District encompasses all of Indiana, Cambria, Blair, Huntingdon, Franklin, Fulton, Bedford, Somerset, Fayette, Green, and Washington Counties.
