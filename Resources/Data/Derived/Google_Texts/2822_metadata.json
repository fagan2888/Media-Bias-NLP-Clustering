During Boehner\u2019s reign as speaker, the House voted more than 60 times to repeal all or parts of the ACA.\n\nHouse Strategy on ACA\n\nDuring the interview, Ryan said that Republicans need to take \u201cpolicy risks,\u201d such as creating a health care reform plan to replace the ACA.\n\nHe said, \u201cPeople don\u2019t like Obamacare. Members of Congress don\u2019t like Obamacare. \u2026 But I think if you take a look at the premiums, if you take a look at the fact that decisions are being taken away from patients and their doctors, the people are starving for an alternative to this vision.\u201d\n\nWhile Boehner targeted the law through repeated, and inevitably fruitless, repeal efforts, Ryan appears focused on creating a viable alternative to the law. Both strategies take different paths, but the end game is the same: doing away with the ACA.\n\nEdwin Park, vice president for health policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said, \u201cThe same dynamic is still in place. Both before Speaker Ryan and with Speaker Ryan the GOP is still seeking to repeal the ACA.\u201d He noted that the House\u2019s budget reconciliation bill (HR 3762) \u2014 negotiated under Boehner \u2014 contains provisions to repeal major parts of the ACA, including the:\n\n\u201cCadillac\u201d and medical device taxes; and\n\nIndividual and employer mandates.\n\nHowever, most health policy experts say it is unlikely that any effort to change, replace or repeal the ACA in a significant way will be implemented while President Obama is in office. Park said, \u201cPresident Obama will veto any legislation\u201d that seeks to drastically change or repeal parts of the ACA.\n\nThe 2016 Presidential Election\n\nThe 2016 presidential election could be a game changer for the ACA, potentially giving Ryan the political backing needed not only to pass new health reforms, but to sign them into law.\n\nTim Garson, director of health policy at Texas Medical Center, believes that Democrats and Republicans agree on more ACA principles than most people think. He said, \u201cThere is tremendous ability to compromise [on health care reform] moving forward\u201d and there is plenty that Ryan, as House speaker, could do, but it all depends on who wins the 2016 presidential election.\n\nACA Replacement\n\nWhile the election has the potential to make enactment of an ACA replacement plan more realistic, Republicans must first agree on a proposal.\n\n\u201cThe House has been unable to coalesce around a single ACA replacement plan. There has not been consensus among the caucus,\u201d Park said.\n\nHowever, such a plan \u201ccould be possible,\u201d he said, noting that several Republicans \u2014 including Ryan \u2014 have talked about replacement proposals in the past.\n\nGarson said a key question is whether Ryan\u2019s views on health care reform have changed since the 2009 Patients\u2019 Choice Act, which he co-sponsored. Garson noted that the foundation of the 2009 plan is very similar to the ACA, but it differs in the execution. For example, he said the Patients\u2019 Choice Act would have created state health insurance exchanges, suggesting that a new Ryan plan could get rid of the federal insurance exchange and allow for more state innovation.\n\nGarson also noted that depending on who is in the White House, the ACA\u2019s individual and employer mandates \u201ccould go away.\u201d But, he said they would have to be replaced by something that really works and encourages people to purchase coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, Park expressed some concerns with the health care changes included in budget plans proposed by Ryan during his time as House Budget Committee chair. Park said, \u201cIt is important to remember that those plans repealed the ACA coverage expansions and made deep cuts to low-income programs, such as Medicaid.\u201d\n\nAccording to Garson, the missing piece in Ryan\u2019s health reform proposals is ensuring that coverage is both accessible and affordable. He said, \u201cThere needs to be a basic health plan that is affordable at all levels of income.\u201d He added, \u201cThe problem right now is the ACA is not affordable in some situations.\u201d For example, an individual may be able to afford the premium, but factor in other costs \u2014 deductibles, copayments, etc. \u2014 and the out-of-pocket costs grow.\n\nWhile much remains up in the air surrounding the future of the Affordable Care Act and Ryan\u2019s plans for a replacement, Ryan\u2019s comments on the ACA so soon after his election suggests he will continue to wage the GOP war against the ACA that Boehner is leaving behind.\n\nAround the Nation\n\nUnforeseen consequences. A new study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that reducing excess health care spending, a main goal of the Affordable Care Act, could prompt a rise in medical malpractice lawsuits, the Washington Post\u2018s \u201cWonkblog\u201d reports.\n\nBehind the scenes.
