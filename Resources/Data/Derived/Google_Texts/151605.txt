You know that old election cliche: “are you better off now than you were four years ago?” Well, a new Washington Post/ABC poll finds not that many people who consider themselves better off now than when President Obama was inaugurated.

(Unrelated note: midterms are less than a month away, and while Obama himself is not on the ballot, he very specifically said that his policies are.)

22 percent of those polled say they’re better off now than they were six years ago. This is in reaction to the question “Would you say you yourself are better off financially than you were when Obama first became president, not as well off, or in about the same shape as then financially?”

30 percent overall say they’re worse off, and 46 percent say they’re in the same shape.

Democrats are a little kinder to Obama, with 37 percent saying they’re better off, while only 9 percent of Republicans and and 19 percent of independents say the same.

Among African-Americans, 33 percent say they’re better off and only 8 percent say they’re worse off. Meanwhile, 18 percent of white voters say better off; 35 percent say worse off.
