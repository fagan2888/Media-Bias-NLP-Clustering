Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, at The Texas Tribune Festival on Sept. 29, 2013.\n\nThe Big Conversation\n\nThe fallout continues from the Sunday story in The Dallas Morning News on discrepancies in Wendy Davis' accounting of her early life. Here's a roundup of some of what was printed on Tuesday:\n\n\u2022 \"Until now, not one of her often bitter political opponents ever asked whether she was truly a 'single' teen mother in 1982 or only 'separated' from her husband. Nor did anyone criticize her parenting of two daughters or air allegations from a divorce,\" wrote the Fort Worth Star-Telegram's Bud Kennedy in a column. \"Now, she\u2019s important enough for reporters to double-check facts in her still-too-vague campaign biography and for national Republican bloggers to rise up in finger-shaking condemnation.\"\n\n\u2022 \"Truth is, it would happen if any of us aimed to define ourselves. Life is complicated. It's not a tidy little bio on a website, or a focus-grouped message or a sappy sunlit candidate-approved TV ad. The stories we get in politics are never pure,\" the Houston Chronicle's Lisa Falkenberg wrote in a column. \"They're told either in the best light, or the worst, depending on which side is doing the telling. No, outright lies aren't acceptable. They're not a sign of good character. But there doesn't appear to be any evidence, yet, that lying was Davis' intention here.\"\n\n\u2022 \"The fuller picture is far more complicated and less useful as a political narrative. Still, it was good to see Davis, a state senator from Fort Worth, take responsibility for the need to 'be more focused on the detail' of her story,\" The Dallas Morning News wrote in its editorial. \"No one is disputing that Davis worked hard for years and overcame obstacles that few people manage to overcome \u2014 single mothers especially. Davis deserves credit for that. And she\u2019s right that a single mother\u2019s story of struggle is one that millions of women can identify with. Regardless of their demographic, Texans want candidates for major office to be ready to step away from the window dressing and present their unvarnished selves to voters.\"\n\nToday in the Trib\n\nHispanic Republicans Look Past Primary Elections: \"With most candidates' campaigns for the March primaries in full swing, Hispanic Republicans trying to increase their numbers in the state House are mostly looking past the primaries. Their main fight is in November.\"\n\nSan Antonio Seeks Ownership of its Wastewater: \"A bid by San Antonio's water utility to declare ownership of the sewage it treats and releases has sparked a regional tug of war \u2014 one that could become more common as Texas' thirsty water users struggle to protect their supplies.\"\n\nBorder Reps Split on Using Drones for Security: \"Texas' recent designation as one of six test states for a federal project that seeks to expand the use of drones is spotlighting how far apart border lawmakers are on using more unmanned aircraft for border security.\"\n\nTexas Finalizes Rules for Health Care Navigators: \"The Texas Department of Insurance on Tuesday issued state regulations for health care 'navigators,' the workers who assist people seeking health insurance in the federal marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nMust-Read\n\nBresnen vs. MQS: the Texas ethics throwdown, San Antonio Express-News\n\nTexas school finance trial resumes, Austin American-Statesman\n\nStockman's campaign files amended, Houston Chronicle\n\nGarcia: Abbott's 'new' BRAC plan looks familiar to Van de Putte, San Antonio Express-News\n\nNorth Texans to Texas Railroad Commission: Stop the \u2018Frackquakes\u2019, Texas Observer\n\nTea Party Tests Its Might in Texas by Opposing Conservative Rep.
