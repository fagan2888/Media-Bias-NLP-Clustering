So when those same psychologists admit that they nevertheless continue to use the DSM for financial reasons, asked the researchers, is that not a violation of their most basic ethics?\n\nTwo State University of New York psychologists surveyed 104 psychologists about their use of and attitudes about the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. They found that the psychologists' perspectives were \"significantly more negative than neutral.\"\n\nThe psychologists identified some of the DSM's problems: \u201cobscures individual differences\u201d (60.58%), \u201cplaces more emphasis on diagnosis than treatment\u201d (51.92%), \u201cplaces too much emphasis on pathology\u201d (50.96%), \u201clabels distort one\u2019s perception of a client\u201d (43.27%), \u201capplies medical labels to psychosocial problems\u201d (43.27%), \u201chas little bearing on treatment\u201d (31.73%), \u201cnot reliable\u201d (29.81%), \u201cother\u201d (22.12%), \u201cnot valid\u201d (19.23%), and \u201cdiagnostic classification often leads to inappropriate treatment\u201d (18.27%).\n\nYet 90% admitted that they still use the DSM regularly, primarily because it is accepted as a framework for billing.\n\n\"Finally, ethical concerns remain, with the question being whether it is appropriate for psychologists who have concerns about the scientific status of the DSM to continue using it,\" wrote the researchers. \"Professional ethics forbids the use of instruments one does not believe to be valid, yet the results of the current survey suggest that most psychologists are using the DSM as a means to collect insurance payments.\"\n\nRaskin, Jonathan D., and Michael C.
