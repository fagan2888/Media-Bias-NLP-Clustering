As Deadspin highlighted Monday morning, Pop Chart Lab put together an incredible poster of 165 NBA jerseys over the years that features a handful of old-school Nuggets jerseys.

So, naturally, we here at the Denver Post conducted an in-house poll (we do important stuff here!) and the decision is unanimous: The Nuggets need to bring back the 1982 jerseys. Enough of the light blue and yellow: We want rainbows.

Agree? Disagree?
