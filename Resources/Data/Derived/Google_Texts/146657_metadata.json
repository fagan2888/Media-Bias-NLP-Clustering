It's time for Gov. Chris Christie to quit his doomed presidential campaign and take a second shot at being governor.\n\n\n\nIf he won't do that, he should at least stop accepting his $175,000 salary. Because let's face it: The man is not doing the job we hired him to do.\n\n\n\nThe state is in crisis, and he is responding with neglect. Senior business leaders and political players say they can't get answers to basic questions, that his office has become dysfunctional. His mind is on the presidency.\n\n\n\nAnd now he will be even more distracted by the Bridgegate scandal. That should tip the scale in two ways.\n\n\n\nOne is the 24-hour problem. There are only so many hours in a day. And the Bridgegate scandal is not over. It's gaining steam.\n\n\n\nDavid Wildstein's testimony confirms the core elements of the scandal. And the indictments against Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly create enormous pressure on them to cooperate, given that they each face a theoretical maximum prison term of 86 years.\n\n\n\n\"It is not uncommon for people after they are indicted to plead guilty,\" U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said Friday.\n\n\n\nAnd prosecutors haven't made their move yet on the investigation of David Samson's horrific conflicts of interests as chairman of the Port Authority.\n\n\n\nAsked if more charges might be coming, Fishman said, \"It's like the end of Downton Abbey. You've got to wait for a whole other season.\"\n\n\n\nEven before Friday, Christie was disengaged. His main Democratic partner, Senate President Steve Sweeney, says the change in the last few years has been \"night and day\" and that it makes tough problems impossible to solve.\n\n\n\n\"You can't fix it if you're not here,\" Sweeney says of the governor.\n\n\n\nPut aside the 24-hour problem, though: This scandal also makes it clear that Christie is not remotely fit to be president. Who wants a reincarnation of Richard Nixon in the Oval Office?\n\n\n\nChristie argues that this was a rogue operation, that he knew nothing of it, and that he quickly severed ties with all the guilty parties.\n\n\n\nThink about that: His best defense is that he was clueless about what his own people were doing, right under his nose. We are not talking about mid-level bureaucrats. The people implicated in this scandal were senior figures in his administration.\n\n\n\nThe lane closures grew from a culture of bullying without restraint that is Christie hallmark. It's no surprise his team embraced the same hubris.\n\n\n\nImagine the mindset of those who would create deadlock for four days, deliberately starting it on the first day of school, and joking about kids stranded in their buses. When local leaders told them the gridlock was blocking ambulances trying to get to patients in distress, this crew ignored them.\n\n\n\nAnd all this was an act of revenge because a local Democratic mayor wouldn't endorse Christie in race that was not remotely close.\n\n\n\nIn Jersey City, Mayor Steve Fulop wouldn't endorse Christie either, and the administration responded by canceling several appointments with cabinet officers. Call it the Bridgegate culture.\n\n\n\nDuring his first two years, Christie was an effective governor. He worked with Democrats to enact smart reforms that reduced public spending. He was engaged, even restless, and he got stuff done.\n\n\n\nBut he seems to have lost interest, and turned his talents towards advancing his own career. That's exactly what happened when he was elected as a young freeholder in Morris County, and decided almost immediately to run for state legislature.\n\n\n\nEnough. It's time for Christie to regroup, and to focus on New Jersey. The state's economy is a mess, and he needs to at least try to fix it. The bridges are falling down, and he's proposed no solution. And if he wants to reform the pension system, he's going to have to stick around Trenton and meet with people like Sweeney.\n\n\n\nNo doubt, this would be a big letdown to Christie, who seems intoxicated by the glitz and attention of a presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nTough luck, though. He's our only governor. He needs to recapture his mojo and do his job. His work is in Trenton, not New Hampshire.\n\nFollow The Star-Ledger on Twitter @StarLedger and find us on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "bridgegate, bridgegate-indictments, chris-christie, editorials, fort-lee, george-washington-bridge, star-ledger, star-ledger-editorials, opinion", "title": "Gov.
