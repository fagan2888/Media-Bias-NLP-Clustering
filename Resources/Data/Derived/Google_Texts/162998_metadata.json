Mark Ferrandino, the history-making, term-limited lawmaker who became Colorado\u2019s first gay House speaker.\n\nFerrandino likely will leave the heavily Democratic District 2 in the primary victor\u2019s hands.\n\nAlec Garnett and Owen Perkins both say they would continue Ferrandino\u2019s popular blend of progressive priorities, including support for same-sex marriage.\n\nBut the two campaigns have struck out in decidedly different directions as they\u2019ve knocked on doors across the district, which stretches from Capitol Hill to neighborhoods south of I-25 and east to Holly Hills.\n\nPerkins, 50, proudly focuses on traditional liberal issues, including environmentalism, attaining universal health care and reducing the influence of money in politics. He hits campaign finance reform hard on the trail, repeating often that he would refuse any donation from a political-action committee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to take money and feel like you\u2019re only going to take from groups you support \u2026 but political action committees give you money expecting something in return,\u201d Perkins said.\n\nGarnett, 31, puts his focus elsewhere.\n\nThe district\u2019s constituents are among the youngest, on average, in the state, and Garnett sees himself as emblematic of those he\u2019d represent: young, college-educated, newly married and with plenty of student loans to pay off. He has focused on issues that he says resonate with his peers, including education quality, jobs and the economy. He\u2019s particularly focused on ideas for expanding preschool offerings statewide.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I threw my hat into the ring was because I matched the demographics,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Garnett also did so at the urging of Ferrandino, who has endorsed him.\n\nHe\u2019s risen fast in Colorado politics. Garnett worked as a legislative aide to U.S. Rep. Ed Perlmutter, then later returned to Colorado to run the 2010 campaign of his father, Boulder District Attorney Stan Garnett, for Colorado attorney general. Garnett lost.\n\nBut Alec Garnett parlayed that experience into an appointment as executive director of the Colorado Democratic Party. He stepped down to run for the House seat.\n\nPerkins also can point to a big-name backer: the late former state Sen. Ken Gordon, who died in December. Last year, Gordon gave a full-throated endorsement of Perkins and his focus on rooting money out of politics.\n\nThe Baltimore native spent part of his career as a teacher and college instructor in Colorado, and then worked as a journalist, most recently writing about baseball for MLB.com.\n\nHe also has worked in the trenches for the Denver Democrats, including as party secretary. He sees District 2, with its strong liberal base, as capable of carrying political weight for more vulnerable Democrats on issues such as gun control.\n\nSo far, the big money has focused on Garnett, who raised more than $98,000 through May 28. Perkins has raised nearly $43,000.\n\nIn March, though, Perkins surprised some Garnett supporters by capturing 39 percent of the vote at the Denver County Democratic assembly, well above the 30 percent needed to make the ballot.\n\nGarnett had spent months recruiting young supporters to participate in the assembly. Perkins, saying his emphasis was elsewhere before the assembly, suggested his support has grown.\n\nThe primary winner will face Republican Jon Roberts in November. Ferrandino, while backing Garnett, also lauds Perkins.\n\n\u201cOwen\u2019s a good guy,\u201d Ferrandino said. \u201cHe\u2019s been very active in the district for a long time. The nice thing is that the district is choosing between two good choices.\u201d\n\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurray", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Two Democrats seek to succeed Colorado House Speaker Mark Ferrandino", "title": "Two Democrats seek to succeed Colorado House Speaker Mark Ferrandino", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/20/two-democrats-seek-to-succeed-colorado-house-speaker-mark-ferrandino/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140618__mark-ferrandinop1.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140618__mark-ferrandinop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-20T16:08:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:46:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Two loyal Denver Democrats are vying in Tuesday\u2019s primary to succeed state Rep.
