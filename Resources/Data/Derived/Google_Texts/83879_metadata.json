Our moment has arrived.\u201d The nation\u2019s 40th president added:\n\nWe stand together shoulder to shoulder in the thickest of the fight. If we carry the day and turn the tide, we can hope that as long as men speak of freedom and those who have protected it, they will remember us, and they will say, \u201cHere were the brave and here their place of honor.\u201d\n\nThe American Conservative Union, in a statement to Breitbart News, said the use of Reagan\u2019s words builds on last year\u2019s CPAC theme, \u201cConservative Action Starts Here.\u201d The point is \u201curging the people we trained and activated at CPAC to help restore the ideas and ideals of our nation\u2019s founding.\u201d\n\nHeritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, a former Republican senator from South Carolina, struck a similar note in his 2014 address at CPAC:\n\nThe only way for us to change our government is for we the people to remember that the solutions to America\u2019s problems will not come from Washington, but from the little platoons all around us that must be freed from the one-size-fits-all federal government straightjacket. Americans will unite around core ideas of our founding and our success. You know them: the ideas of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional values, a strong national defense. These are the conservative ideas that built a strong America and can once again unite us.\n\nCPAC again seeks to unite conservatives through a one-day \u201cActivism Boot Camp\u201d followed by three days of programming designed to bring together elected and other leaders with grassroots activists, including college students.\n\nAmong scheduled speakers are Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio; author Gordon Chang; actress Stacey Dash; and television and radio personalities Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck.\n\nThe conference again will take place at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center at Maryland\u2019s National Harbor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Our Time Is Now,\" the theme of this year's Conservative Political Action Conference, comes from President Ronald Reagan\u2019s address to CPAC in 1981.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"Our Time Is Now,\" the theme of this year's Conservative Political Action Conference, comes from President Ronald Reagan\u2019s address to CPAC in 1981.", "title": "CPAC Strikes Reaganesque Note of Hope", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160219_CPACTheme_Mork.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-02T11:34:47+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1RcsVLb"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"Our Time Is Now,\" the theme of this year's Conservative Political Action Conference, comes from President Ronald Reagan\u2019s address to CPAC in 1981.", "title": "CPAC Strikes Reaganesque Note of Hope", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160219_CPACTheme_Mork.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2016-02-23T12:25:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-02T11:34:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Conservative Political Action Conference, Our Time is Now, CPAC, Matt Schlapp, American Conservative Union, ACU, 2016, theme, Ronald Reagan"}, "article_summary": "These are the conservative ideas that built a strong America and can once again unite us.\nCPAC again seeks to unite conservatives through a one-day \u201cActivism Boot Camp\u201d followed by three days of programming designed to bring together elected and other leaders with grassroots activists, including college students.\nThe conference again will take place at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center at Maryland\u2019s National Harbor.\nOur moment has arrived.\u201d The nation\u2019s 40th president added:We stand together shoulder to shoulder in the thickest of the fight.\nYou know them: the ideas of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional values, a strong national defense."}
