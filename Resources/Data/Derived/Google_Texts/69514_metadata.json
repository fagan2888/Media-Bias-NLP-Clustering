But second chances have their limits: \"This program specifically excludes those who are convicted of making methamphetamine drugs, sex offenses or domestic violence,\" the news release said.\n\nPresident Obama said on Monday he was directing federal agencies to \u201cban the box,\u201d or rather, not ask prospective government employees about their criminal past on job applications.\n\n\"It is relevant to find out whether somebody has a criminal record. We're not suggesting ignore it,\" Obama said. \"What we are suggesting is that when it comes to the application, give folks a chance to get through the door. Give them a chance to get in there so they can make their case.\"\n\n\"We can't dismiss people out of hand simply because of a mistake that they made in the past,\" he added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Much like the term illegal immigrants became politically incorrect, so too has juvenile delinquent, apparently..05/27/2016 8:21:18AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Much like the term illegal immigrants became politically incorrect, so too has juvenile delinquent, apparently.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Obama Admin Now Refers to Juvenile Delinquents as 'Justice-Involved Youth'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/11/05/obama-admin-now-refers-to-juvenile-delinquents-as-justiceinvolved-youth-n2076526", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2006/174/2006-06-23T174210Z_01_BSB04D_RTRIDSP_0_BRAZIL.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Much like the term illegal immigrants became politically incorrect, so too has juvenile delinquent, apparently.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Obama Admin Now Refers to Juvenile Delinquents as 'Justice-Involved Youth'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/11/05/obama-admin-now-refers-to-juvenile-delinquents-as-justiceinvolved-youth-n2076526", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2006/174/2006-06-23T174210Z_01_BSB04D_RTRIDSP_0_BRAZIL.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama Admin Now Refers to Juvenile Delinquents as 'Justice-Involved Youth', Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "That means young offenders leaving juvenile detention will not necessarily be excluded from public housing, jobs, or higher education.\nMuch like the term \u2018illegal immigrants\u2019 became politically incorrect, so too has \u2018juvenile delinquent,\u2019 apparently.\n\"We can't dismiss people out of hand simply because of a mistake that they made in the past,\" he added.\n\"What we are suggesting is that when it comes to the application, give folks a chance to get through the door.\nThrough the new Juvenile Re-Entry Assistance Program, DOJ and HUD will work collaboratively \"to help individuals that have paid their debt to society rehabilitate and reintegrate back into their communities.\""}
