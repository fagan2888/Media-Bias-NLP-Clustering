Ann Kirkpatrick, has won in the last two elections.\n\nHowever, Sullivan will have to find other attributes to sell himself on in order to emerge from a crowded primary race that includes three other Democrats, eight Republicans and one independent candidate.\n\nHe said the broad range of skills he\u2019s accumulated over the years make him stand out over his opponents, especially since he doesn\u2019t consider himself a \u201ccareer politician.\u201d\n\nSullivan, who announced his candidacy in January, is a member of the Navajo Nation and lives in the small community of Kayenta, located in northern Arizona. He\u2019s had many professions over the years that have included working as a park manager for the National Park Service, a church minister and owner of multiple small businesses.\n\nHe said one hardship he\u2019s noticed to be most prevalent in the Navajo Nation is unemployment. He attributed part of the problem to the bureaucratic difficulties Native Americans must go through to start small businesses.\n\nMaking it easier for Native Americans to be business entrepreneurs would be one of Sullivan\u2019s priorities as a member of Congress. He has a list of other priorities that include improving roads and infrastructure, providing more services to senior citizens and protecting natural resources.\n\nSullivan has previously worked in the mining industry so he understands how important that industry is to the CD1 economy. But he contends protecting the environment is very important.\n\nHis political viewpoints don\u2019t always follow the general Democratic platform. He\u2019s in favor of repealing the Affordable Care Act and supports the rights guaranteed under the Second Amendment, though he thinks background checks are a necessary safeguard.\n\nHe also admires the rhetoric expressed by Bernie Sanders on the presidential campaign trail. The Vermont senator\u2019s desire to eliminate corporate interests from politics, Sullivan said, is something he completely advocates.\n\nSullivan said he did temporarily change his party affiliation at one point from Democrat to independent but quickly moved back over to his party. He said Democrats occupy a large majority of the Navajo Nation, and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s an ideology that can be easily swayed.\n\nThere are two other members of the Navajo Nation running in the CD1 race. State Sen. Carlyle Begay, a former Democrat, and businessman Shawn Redd are competing for the Republican nomination against six other candidates: Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, Arizona Speaker of the House David Gowan, former Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett, businessman Gary Kiehne, engineer Thomas Whipple and retired Air Force Col. Wendy Rogers.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Sullivan is running against former state legislator Tom O\u2019Halleran, businessman James Maloney and Coolidge resident Miguel Olivas. Independent Michael Mitchell is a write-in candidate. Kirkpatrick announced last year she would not seek re-election because she will run for a seat in the U.S. Senate.\n\nAccording to the Federal Election Commission\u2019s most recent campaign finance reports, O\u2019Halleran is leading among Democrats by reporting to have $329,000 cash on hand at the end of the March. Both Sullivan and Olivas reported not having any financial activity so far.\n\nGathering political capital to run a campaign has been a big hurdle, Sullivan said. He hasn\u2019t been successful raising funds on his home base so he plans to venture off the Navajo Nation to solicit donations.\n\nAs the campaign moves into the summer months, Sullivan said he plans to travel to the southern edges of CD1 in Pinal County to increase his name recognition among voters.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "trivalleycentral.com", "description": "Kayto Sullivan said he has two advantages as a candidate in Arizona\u2019s 1st Congressional District race: He\u2019s Native American and a Democrat.", "title": "Navajo man of many hats running for CD1", "url": "http://www.trivalleycentral.com/coolidge_examiner/news/navajo-man-of-many-hats-running-for-cd/article_74ada5e2-220f-11e6-b491-0f89326f2378.html", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/trivalleycentral.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/81/a815e66e-20fd-11e6-b225-1fbe067a5729/57432628736ce.image.jpg?resize=300%2C300", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Kayto Sullivan said he has two advantages as a candidate in Arizona\u2019s 1st Congressional District race: He\u2019s Native American and a Democrat.", "fb": {"admins": "<266179467961>", "app_id": 266179467961}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "pnob7A_ZlKDY1isdeDLyU6W1kqaqdp1JUZJ3eDCa61w", "news_keywords": "news"}, "article_summary": "There are two other members of the Navajo Nation running in the CD1 race.\nHe hasn\u2019t been successful raising funds on his home base so he plans to venture off the Navajo Nation to solicit donations.\nHe said Democrats occupy a large majority of the Navajo Nation, and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s an ideology that can be easily swayed.\nHe said one hardship he\u2019s noticed to be most prevalent in the Navajo Nation is unemployment.\nKayto Sullivan said he has two advantages as a candidate in Arizona\u2019s 1st Congressional District race: He\u2019s Native American and a Democrat."}
