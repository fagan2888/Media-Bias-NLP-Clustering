The desk from which President Franklin Roosevelt delivered his famous fireside chats, chocolate molds used to emboss candies with the presidential seal, and a preserved section of a tree planted by President John Quincy Adams are a few of the artifacts on display at the new White House Visitor Center.

The center, which sits right across the street from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, just underwent a massive, nearly $13 million remodel thanks to a public-private partnership between the National Park Service and the White House Historical Association.

The revamped center — which is free for visitors — doesn’t open to the public until Saturday, but ITK got a sneak preview of the space.

John Stanwich, the Park Service’s liaison to the White House, tells us, “There’s over 94 objects in here to help to tell that story and make a personal connection with the White House and the people that lived and worked there.”

Among the hands-on exhibits: a lesson on presidential food favorites, complete with realistic wax and plastic meals set on a table. While President Truman was apparently a fan of fried chicken, President Garfield couldn’t get enough of squirrel soup.

According to the exhibit, after Garfield was shot in 1881, doctors suggested his beloved, rodent-filled soup might revive his appetite.

Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), former chief of staff to Laura Bush Anita McBride, and Ann Stock, the former assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs, were among the VIPs eyed at a preview reception on Monday night.
