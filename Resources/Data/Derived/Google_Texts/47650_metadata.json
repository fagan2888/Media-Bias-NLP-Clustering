That has led to patients receiving unexpected bills for treatment.\n\nLawmakers have spent weeks looking at ways to address the issue, but insurers have been at odds with doctors and hospitals about changes.\n\nThe Senate Banking and Insurance Committee on Tuesday, however, approved a revised bill (SB 1442) that received support from representatives of groups such as the Florida Association of Health Plans and the Florida Medical Association.\n\nBill sponsor Rene Garcia, R-Hialeah, said he is trying to prevent consumers from getting \"dinged\" with unexpected bills. The revised proposal, in part, includes a dispute-resolution process, and Garcia said the bill is aimed at removing patients from negotiations between providers and insurers.\n\nThe bill still needs to go through the Senate Appropriations Committee before it could reach the full Senate. A House version (HB 221), filed by Rep. Carlos Trujillo, R-Miami, is slated to be heard Wednesday by the House Health & Human Services Committee.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "After a lobbying battle that has included insurers, doctors and hospitals, a Senate committee Tuesday approved a potential compromise on a controversial", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/senators-approve-possible-balance-billing-compromise", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201504/renegarcia_0.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "After a lobbying battle that has included insurers, doctors and hospitals, a Senate committee Tuesday approved a potential compromise on a controversial", "title": "Senators Approve Possible Balance Billing Compromise"}, "wordCount": 222, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "News Service of Florida", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Senators Approve Possible Balance Billing Compromise"}, "nid": 13647, "datePublished": "2016-02-17", "story_id": 467053420, "keywords": "\"balance billing\", emergency medical treatment, out-of-network charges, unexpected bills for emergency care, Florida Legislature", "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "After a lobbying battle that has included insurers, doctors and hospitals, a Senate committee Tuesday approved a potential compromise on a controversial issue known as \"balance billing.\"\nThat has led to patients receiving unexpected bills for treatment.\nThe bill still needs to go through the Senate Appropriations Committee before it could reach the full Senate.\nThe issue primarily stems from some patients receiving emergency treatment from doctors and other health providers who are not part of the networks in the patients' insurance plans.\nA House version (HB 221), filed by Rep.
