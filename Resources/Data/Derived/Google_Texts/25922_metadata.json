Carlile was hit by a bat when a player was warming up.\n\nIn York, a safety committee meets monthly to ensure players, employees and fans are not in harm's way when watching the York Revolution play.\n\nEric Menzer is the York Revolution team president and said the accident in Kansas happened under a non-professional league. Menzer says at the professional level, like the Revolutions, paid employees are aware of the strict safety protocols that are put in place.\n\n\"The very first thing you think of is, man I would hope we would never have a situation like that,\" Menzer said. \"We need to ensure that anybody on the field is of a respectable age, that can be trained... enforcing rules about equipment, helmets at all times and keeping your eyes open all the time to make sure employees are doing their job in a safe way.\"\n\nChristian Lowery has been a bat boy for the York Revolution for two years. The 17-year-old said he was scared when he learned the news of Kaiser Carlile's death.\n\n\"My mind was going a little bit all over the place because it was crazy to hear about it, because I never thought anyone that young could get hurt doing the job I do,\" Lowery said.\n\nThe safety guidelines implemented also apply to the fans. Menzer said that for the same ticket price, fans have the choice to sit behind a safety net located just steps away from the home plate.\n\n\"As a family friendly affordable product, we're in a position to do that, we don't have to jack up the prices of our tickets behind the plate,\" Menzer said.\n\nWhen it comes to sitting in a foul ball zone, fans aren't fearful, rather they're prepared. \"We try to prepare the girls, our teams to pay attention to the game, and we learn how to catch,\" spectator Rick Stottlemyer said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "YORK, Pa. -- After the tragic death of Kaiser Carlile, the 9-year-oldbat boy in Kansas, safety concerns are being raised about ball park safety here in Central Pennsylvania.\u00a0 Carlile was hit by a bat when a player was warming up.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "WPMT FOX43", "description": "YORK, Pa. \u2014 After the tragic death of Kaiser Carlile, the 9-year-oldbat boy in Kansas, safety concerns are being raised about ball park safety here in Central Pennsylvania.\u00a0 Carlile was hit b\u2026", "title": "Fatal baseball accident hits home inside Santander Stadium", "url": "http://fox43.com/2015/08/05/fatal-baseball-accident-hits-home-inside-santander-stadium/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://tribwpmt.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/promo263098044.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://tribwpmt.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/promo263098044.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox43", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox43"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News in Harrisburg, York, Lancaster, Lebanon News, Weather, Sports", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=593652814", "fb": {"pages": 121742908330}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox43.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/c21a62ded72703161d0a8a5845d07db8?s=16", "application-name": "WPMT FOX43", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox43news", "published_time": "2015-08-06T00:31:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-06T00:31:42+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox43news"}, "keywords": "news, city of york, york revolution", "google-site-verification": "ilkJ6nB6LBJwfhBgyPxbKMW1j6YSMqGS-P6sRpLIxD4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb1cf\"", "article_summary": "Eric Menzer is the York Revolution team president and said the accident in Kansas happened under a non-professional league.\nIn York, a safety committee meets monthly to ensure players, employees and fans are not in harm's way when watching the York Revolution play.\nChristian Lowery has been a bat boy for the York Revolution for two years.\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this videoYORK, Pa. -- After the tragic death of Kaiser Carlile, the 9-year-oldbat boy in Kansas, safety concerns are being raised about ball park safety here in Central Pennsylvania.\nMenzer says at the professional level, like the Revolutions, paid employees are aware of the strict safety protocols that are put in place."}
