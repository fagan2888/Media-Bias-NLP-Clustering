Anthony List targets Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, for her 2009 vote for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe billboard is expected to read \u201cKaptur Voted For Taxpayer-Funded Abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like former Reps. Bart Stupak and Steve Driehaus, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur betrayed the unborn and her pro-life constituents by voting for Obamacare, which allows taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion on demand,\u201d said SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser. \u201cThis billboard campaign is part of our renewed effort to educate all Americans about the reality of abortion funding in Obamacare. Four years later, Rep. Kaptur\u2019s constituents still deserve to know the truth.\u201d\n\nThe campaign was allowed to move forward after Judge Timothy Black ruled unconstitutional an Ohio law that allowed a politically appointed panel of government bureaucrats to monitor campaign statements and determine whether or not they are true.\n\nThe SBA List noted the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office released a report in September identifying more than 1,000 Obamacare plans that cover abortion on demand and receive taxpayer subsidies.\n\nIn addition to providing federal tax subsidies that finance elective abortion coverage for millions of women, the ACA also expands state Medicaid program coverage of elective abortion for millions of women in dozens of states and uses federal funds to finance elective abortion coverage for members of Congress and their staff, the SBA List said.\n\nEarlier this summer, the organization launched a similar billboard campaign in Louisiana to expose Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu\u2019s support for taxpayer-funded abortion.\n\nGet \u201cTaking America Back,\u201d Joseph Farah\u2019s manifesto for sovereignty, self-reliance and moral renewal\n\nMeanwhile, the organization said, it had been notified that the state has decided to appeal the judge\u2019s ruling to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in an effort to maintain its censorship authority.\n\nWND reported when Black issued his ruling Dannenfelser said her organization now was allowed \u201cto freely communicate the truth with voters \u2013 that elected representatives who voted for the Affordable Care Act voted for taxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is beyond dispute that, because Congress and the White House failed to include the Stupak amendment, Obamacare contains multiple abortion-funding provisions,\u201d she said at that time. \u201cThis reality will continue to be a key part of our message to voters in the 2014 midterm elections and beyond.\u201d\n\nThe organization went to court when it wanted to put up billboards in Ohio in 2010 exposing that former Rep. Steve Driehaus, D-Ohio, supported taxpayer-funded abortion by voting for Obamacare.\n\nThe billboards, however, were banned under the state\u2019s \u201cfalse claims\u201d law that set up the government as judge and jury over whether any political statement was true or false.\n\nThe case already has been to the U.S. Supreme Court once, after an appellate court said the SBA List didn\u2019t have standing to sue over the law, but the Supreme Court overturned the ruling.\n\n\u201cThis summer, more than 20 groups from across the political spectrum submitted amicus briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of SBA List. The ACLU, the Cato Institute, and even President Obama\u2019s own solicitor general supported our fight for the right to criticize elected officials,\u201d Dannenfelser noted.\n\nBlack had quoted from the SBA\u2019s arguments: \u201c[We are not] arguing for a right to lie. We\u2019re arguing that we have a right not to have the truth of our political statements be judged by the government.\u201d\n\nWND reported the case originated in 2010 over the Driehaus campaign. He was one of the key votes for the controversial health insurance law. He had been holding out because he didn\u2019t want to support abortion funding but eventually was convinced to support the bill.\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t believe Obamacare allowed funding for abortion.\n\nSBA List wanted to publicize his support for abortion funding but was stopped by the Ohio law. SBA List was also threatened with prosecution if it engaged in similar speech about Driehaus or other candidates in Ohio.\n\nDannenfelser noted Driehaus initially opposed Obamacare because he said it did not contain specific language preventing the funding of abortion.\n\n\u201cThat never changed and to this very day, Americans are still fighting the expansion of taxpayer funding of abortion brought about by the overhaul,\u201d Dannenfelser said.\n\nHowever, Ohio bureaucrats, citing a law that \u201ccriminalizes \u2018false\u2019 political speech\u201d and leaves it to bureaucrats to judge, ordered that the billboards could not go up.\n\nEarlier, SBA List won its other battle with Driehaus. He had filed a defamation lawsuit alleging SBA List cost him his job and a \u201closs of livelihood,\u201d but a district court held that SBA List\u2019s statements about Driehaus\u2019 vote on Obamacare were not defamatory.\n\nWND later reported that SBA List had taken its billboards to several other states, targeting Landrieu, Kay Hagen of North Carolina and Mark Pryor of Arkansas.\n\nSBA List said it is highlighting through the billboards the Democrats\u2019 support of \u201ctaxpayer funded abortion by voting for the Affordable Care Act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "A billboard campaign charging lawmakers supported taxpayer-funded abortion when they voted for Obamacare is returning for the 2014 election just as Ohio renews its claim that it can censor the signs.
