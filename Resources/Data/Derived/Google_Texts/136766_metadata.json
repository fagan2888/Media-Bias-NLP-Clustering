Many say dismantling the Affordable Care Act is also high on the agenda.\n\nA recent Pew survey found that the incoming Congress carried a 92 percent Christian majority, while less than two percent reported \"Unaffiliated\" or refused to answer about their faith.\n\nSome of the issues the Congress faces may be more impacted by faith values than others, but Jones argued that all of us \"have moral convictions that inform the work we do.\"\n\n\"It is impossible not to be formed by our values,\" Jones said in the statement. \"Moreover, for people of faith, it is impossible not to be formed by our faith.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Inauguration Invocations Inauguration Invocations\n\n1 of 17 ZeBarney Thorne Phillips At the inaugurations of Franklin D.
