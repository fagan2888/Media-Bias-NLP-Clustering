Skype\n\nAn Oklahoma doctor was penalized on Thursday for allegedly prescribing medicine via the Internet video-messaging platform Skype. These prescriptions were given by Dr. Thomas Trow, of the eastern Oklahoma town Park Hill, without an initial in-person evaluation.\n\nAccording to a News OK investigative report, the medications included \u201ccontrolled dangerous drugs,\" such as Xanax and other potent narcotic pharmaceuticals. One of Trow\u2019s patient\u2019s \u2014 known as \u201cR.C.\u201d in official documents \u2014 was subsequently treated for three incidents of drug overdosing within a six-month period, according to the medical board review.\n\nAlthough doctor-patient chats via Skype are growing in popularity across the country, this video chat platform is not approved for telemedicine communication in Oklahoma. The popular messaging system does not meet Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) standards for web-based security, meaning privileged health conversations on Skype between physicians and patients are vulnerable to hackers.\n\nMany hospitals and healthcare providers are working with private telemedicine companies to create innovative systems that provide HIPAA compliance.\n\nTrow cited his own failing health as his reason for using Skype.\n\n\u201cHe said his (registered nurse) traveled to the various satellite clinics and presented the patients to him via Skype,\u201d a board investigator wrote in the complaint against Trow, according to News OK. \u201cHe stated that he did not think he had to see patients in person since they were psychiatric patients.\u201d\n\nThree of Dr. Trow\u2019s patients \u2014 including R.C. \u2014 died while under his care, although those deaths were not ultimately attributed to Trow during his disciplinary hearing. Trow was given two years of medical probation and must complete a course on prescribing rules before seeing patients again.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "oklahoma, doctor, thomas trow, drugs, prescriptions, telemedicine", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Thomas Trow, an Oklahoma doctor, prescribed narcotics via Skype sessions, without ever seeing patients in person for an initial exam.", "title": "Oklahoma Doctor Reprimanded For Prescribing Narcotics Via Skype", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/oklahoma-doctor-thomas-trow-reprimanded-prescribing-narcotics-skype-did-he-take-telemedicine-too-far", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/13/untitled-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thomas Trow, an Oklahoma doctor, prescribed narcotics via Skype sessions, without ever seeing patients in person for an initial exam.", "title": "Oklahoma Doctor Reprimanded For Prescribing Narcotics Via Skype", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/oklahoma-doctor-thomas-trow-reprimanded-prescribing-narcotics-skype-did-he-take-telemedicine-too-far", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/13/untitled-1.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/13/untitled-1.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-13T17:02:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-13T17:02:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Thomas Trow, an Oklahoma doctor, prescribed narcotics via Skype sessions, without ever seeing patients in person for an initial exam."}, "article_summary": "Thomas Trow, an Oklahoma doctor, prescribed narcotics via Skype sessions, without ever seeing patients in person for an initial exam.\nSkypeAn Oklahoma doctor was penalized on Thursday for allegedly prescribing medicine via the Internet video-messaging platform Skype.\nTrow was given two years of medical probation and must complete a course on prescribing rules before seeing patients again.\nThese prescriptions were given by Dr. Thomas Trow, of the eastern Oklahoma town Park Hill, without an initial in-person evaluation.\nOne of Trow\u2019s patient\u2019s \u2014 known as \u201cR.C.\u201d in official documents \u2014 was subsequently treated for three incidents of drug overdosing within a six-month period, according to the medical board review."}
