But the Republican presidential front-runner\u2019s success in business and politics raises this uncomfortable question: What if he also exemplifies the upsides of narcissism? And what if it would behoove many of us to be a bit more like him?\n\nYour knee-jerk response may be, \u201cI don\u2019t want to emulate Donald Trump in any way!\u201d But can we take just the useful pages from his playbook and leave out the ugly parts?\n\nI put that query to Dr. Craig Malkin, author of the new book, \u201cRethinking Narcissism: The Bad \u2014 And Surprising Good \u2014 About Feeling Special.\u201d A clinical psychologist and instructor at Harvard Medical School, he begins with a massive disclaimer: \u201cI would not advise anyone to emulate Donald Trump in a lot of the ways that he behaves.\u201d\n\nBut broadly speaking, he says, it\u2019s a myth that narcissism is all bad. In fact, narcissism is a trait, not a diagnosis, Malkin says; it\u2019s a drive to feel special. And it exists on a spectrum, unhealthy mainly at the extremes.\n\n\u201cWe are surrounded by this idea of empty, soulless, dangerous narcissists, and there are people like that out there,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the reality is, what we see in the research is that there are healthy aspects, and they coexist, often, with the unhealthy in people who are extremely narcissistic. So you get the good with the bad.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the good? \u201cThe good is what comes from seeing yourself through slightly rose-colored glasses. There are many gifts that come with that, including better relationships. People who see themselves through slightly rose-colored glasses also tend to see their partners through slightly rose-colored glasses, and that\u2019s not a small thing. People who do that actually have longer relationships. They\u2019re more likely to have longer relationships if they\u2019re capable of doing that with their partner than if they have winning personalities or great self-esteem.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a study of 40,000 people, that ability to put your partners a little bit on a pedestal, not see them entirely realistically \u2014 I call it \u2018feeling special by association\u2019 \u2014 was the strongest predictor of how long the relationship lasted.\u201d\n\nSo maybe we should try on those rose-colored glasses and look at Donald Trump. Malkin offers these eight Trumpian qualities worth absorbing, in moderation:\n\n1. Pride\n\n\u201cPride is a gift of healthy narcissism. Trump clearly sees himself through extremely rose-colored glasses. He\u2019s proud of his hair. But the vast majority of people around the world, across cultures, see themselves as a little bit special, and when we don\u2019t, we suffer. It\u2019s called the \u2018sadder but wiser\u2019 effect. We might even see ourselves realistically, or even negatively, but it leaves us feeling anxious and depressed. Without that healthy pride, worse, we\u2019re more likely to attract really narcissistic friends and partners.\u201d\n\n2. Optimism\n\n\u201cFew people achieve anything great without first feeling like they\u2019re capable of greatness, whether or not they are at the start. Trump clearly thinks he\u2019s capable of anything, including giving speeches unprepared. And while he can\u2019t, we can all do with a little of that conviction \u2014 just not so much that we skip doing our homework, and we come out with word salad. That\u2019s not optimism, that\u2019s hubris.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of my net worth. I\u2019ve done an amazing job.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump\n\n3. Conviction\n\n\u201cTrump clearly stays the course, and that\u2019s what people find appealing. It\u2019s helpful to feel like you\u2019ve got things figured out enough to follow through on your plans and see where they take you. That\u2019s part of healthy narcissism, too. That\u2019s part of feeling special enough to keep going, as long as you don\u2019t feel so special, so infallible that you can\u2019t correct course without feeling weak or ashamed. That\u2019s where people fall into unhealthy narcissism, and black-and-white thinking. When they can\u2019t correct course, they usually adopt the attitude of, \u2018there\u2019s a right way and there\u2019s a wrong way and that\u2019s all there is to it.\u2019 There\u2019s no nuance.\u201d\n\n4. Charisma\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t easy to come by, but Trump obviously has it. We can acknowledge that. It does come from seeing yourself through rose-colored glasses. I should mention even quiet, introverted people can have it \u2014 there\u2019s something compelling about them, whether you love them or hate them, you can\u2019t stop watching. When the person is extremely narcissistic it can be like watching a train wreck \u2014 but none of us can approach this kind of appeal at all if we don\u2019t feel a little exceptional or unique.\u201d\n\n5. Decisiveness\n\n\u201cWe all have doubts. But some of us are overly influenced by other people\u2019s questions about what we have in mind, and healthy narcissism really protects us from that. We can hold on to our vision of the world long enough to make choices \u2014 as if they\u2019re absolutely the right ones regardless of what other people say. At least until they turn out to be wrong \u2014 and extreme narcissists don\u2019t pay attention when they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cRebuild the country\u2019s infrastructure? Nobody can do that like me.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump\n\n6. Self-Sufficiency\n\n\u201cThis one actually comes directly out of research on the narcissistic personality. Self-sufficiency is only healthy. It helps to feel like when no one can be counted on, you at least have yourself, especially during tough times. Self-sufficiency emerges again and again on narcissism measures as a gift that comes from seeing ourselves as a little special. [Extreme] narcissists cling to it so much they often push other people away. Trump goes it alone too much \u2014 that\u2019s the hubris again, that\u2019s where it goes too far. But for the rest of us, nurturing a little self-sufficiency, no matter what our cultural background, helps us feel stronger when life is challenging.\u201d\n\n7. Persuasiveness\n\n\u201cThis one goes along with decisiveness and conviction. We find it compelling when people are sure of themselves, right? And healthy narcissism gives us a talent for persuasiveness when we believe strongly in ourselves \u2014 so much that we light up the room, or at least can\u2019t be ignored. People listen. Just make sure you have something substantive to say. Extreme narcissists use their persuasiveness to exploit others instead of inspire them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump\n\n8. Big Dreams\n\n\u201cPeople who see themselves as special enough to believe they\u2019re capable of extraordinary things hold on to their dreams \u2014 even dreams of becoming president, for example. We all need to dream. It keeps us going when reality seems to fall short. Dreams sow the seeds of ambition. One of the questions on the Narcissism Spectrum Scale, our scale in \u201cRethinking Narcissism,\u201d that related strongly to healthy narcissism is: \u2018I like to dream big, but not at the expense of my relationships.'\u201d\n\nAll in all, sounds like a tricky balancing act, doesn\u2019t it? Some narcissism is good, but too much can be bad. Dr. Malkin reassured me:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually not as hard as you worry, because what\u2019s amazing is that what relates to healthy narcissism is a capacity for authentic connection and caring \u2014 something called secure attachment in the research. When we have the ability, in times of need, to acknowledge when we\u2019re feeling vulnerable, turn to others when we feel sad or scared or lonely or worried, and trust that they will be there for us, and depend on them \u2014 that actually is related to seeing ourselves through slightly rose-colored glasses. And even more fascinatingly, it keeps people from becoming arrogant and self-involved. So that is the tether that keeps us in the center.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m actually a very nice person.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump\n\n\u201cRethinking Narcissism\u201d includes accounts of researchers\u2019 attempts to increase empathy in narcissists. So is there hope for Donald Trump?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only hope for Donald Trump if he can acknowledge where he has difficulty,\u201d Malkin said. \u201cAnd please note: this is not a diagnosis, but I can certainly talk about narcissistic traits. If you openly take delight in buying and selling people, you\u2019re crossing the line and you need to recognize that. If you go viciously after someone because you don\u2019t like their line of questions, that is crossing the line \u2014 it\u2019s bullying, really, and it\u2019s actually emotionally abusive, that\u2019s what we call it as therapists.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to recognize that those are behaviors that if you want to be a caring, passionate person \u2014 with conviction, with decisiveness \u2014 that you want to stay away from those things. And you can only do that if you have the capacity to acknowledge vulnerable feelings, like \u2018Ugh, maybe I shouldn\u2019t have done that, I\u2019m sorry!\u2019 If you have to cling so much to this image of yourself as unwaveringly perfect in every decision you make no matter how bad it is, then you\u2019re never going to be able to apologize, and more concerningly, you\u2019re never going to correct course.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s hope for people like Donald Trump or anyone who\u2019s extremely narcissistic if they\u2019re not physically and emotionally abusive\u2013 and not all narcissists are \u2014 if they\u2019re not in denial of their problems, and they have to have a capacity for vulnerability.\u201d\n\nHow best to affect a narcissist like Donald Trump? In a piece for The Huffington Post, Malkin lays out his argument that \u201cwe influence politicians with our vote, and our applause. If you applaud open manipulation or ad hominem attacks, you\u2019re applauding unhealthy narcissism. That is the hallmark of unhealthy narcissism: Extreme narcissists put people down and attack them to feel superior instead of making points.\u201d\n\nI found myself feeling more and more guilty about even writing a Trump-related headline.\n\n\u201cThis is the problem: we are compelled by this,\u201d Malkin said. \u201cBut the reason we\u2019re compelled is exactly the list we just went through \u2014 there are those good aspects, the healthy aspects we should all nurture and are often there in great supply. The problem is that they coexist with all the nastiness.\u201d\n\nReaders, reactions?
