He urged China to pursue a lower-carbon future, according to media reports. It was a rare admission from a prominent official in a country that ranks as the world\u2019s top emitter of carbon emissions \u2013 a leading contributor to climate change \u2013 with the United States ranking second.\n\nSo why are Americans more concerned about the quality of their drinking water or the fate of some wildlife species than the potential for more cataclysmic storms, floods and coastal destruction and havoc?\n\nRelated: GOP Leaders Fume over Obama\u2019s Climate Deal with China\n\nThe most likely explanation, according to Gallup, has to do with the immediacy of the threat. That is, Americans voice less concern about long-term threats that may have far graver implications for the environment and their lives. Low-quality drinking water and polluted rivers and lakes, as well as every-day air pollution, impact the lives and health of average Americans than more distant and long-term threats, such as global warming.\n\nOnly when a region is struck by a natural catastrophe -- such as a hurricane or super storm along the eastern or southern coasts or an epic drought in California \u2013 do Americans begin connecting the dots between global warming and direct threats to their lives and businesses, although these climate events have occurred naturally long before carbon polluted the planet.\n\nThe difference today is that carbon pollution has accelerated and intensified these climate events to an unsustainable level, threatening lives and economies.\n\nThis has been the case for decades. Despite some variation in the percentage worried about various issues, the rank order of the environmental problems has remained fairly consistent over the decades, according to Gallup.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Budget Boosts EPA to Fight Climate Change\n\nYet the state of the economy also is an important factor in Americans\u2019 concern about the environment.\n\n\u201cThe amount Americans worry about the various threats tends to rise and recede in unison, with concern higher in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the revival of environmentalism, and in the late 1990s and early 2000s amid the economic boom,\u201d Gallup said in an analysis. \u201cSince then, Americans' worry has fallen, with concern dipping to record lows on most issues in 2010 or 2011. The current level of worry on each issue remains at or near those record lows.\u201d\n\nIn effect, Americans tend to attach a higher priority to environmental concerns when the economy is healthy than when it is struggling. In recent decades, the U.S. economy has arguably been its strongest in late 1999 and early 2000 \u2013 the very times when environmentalism was on the rise.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Despite mounting scientific and anecdotal evidence that global warming is contributing", "title": "Despite Reams of Evidence, Global Warming Ranks Low on Americans\u2019 Worry List", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/25/Despite-Reams-Evidence-Global-Warming-Ranks-Low-Americans-Worry-List", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09182013_Ice_Floes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/25/Despite-Reams-Evidence-Global-Warming-Ranks-Low-Americans-Worry-List", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09182013_Ice_Floes.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Despite mounting scientific and anecdotal evidence that global warming is contributing", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Global Warming Skeptics Give Obama the Cold ShoulderAnd just this week, China\u2019s top meteorologist, Zheng Guogang, told Xinhua news service that global warming is a serious threat to the country that could have a number of adverse consequences.\n\u201cSince then, Americans' worry has fallen, with concern dipping to record lows on most issues in 2010 or 2011.\nRelated: How Climate Change Costs Could Soar to the BillionsDuring his State of the Union address in January, President Obama declared global warming the most profound danger to the future of the country.\nLow-quality drinking water and polluted rivers and lakes, as well as every-day air pollution, impact the lives and health of average Americans than more distant and long-term threats, such as global warming.\nThat is, Americans voice less concern about long-term threats that may have far graver implications for the environment and their lives."}
