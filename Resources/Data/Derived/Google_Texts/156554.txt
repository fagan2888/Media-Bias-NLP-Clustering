T.J. Ward doesn’t want to just be a part of a good Broncos secondary. He’s seeking greatness.

“We’re light years ahead of where we were last year,” Ward said Friday, the team’s second day of training camp. “I want (us) to lead the league in interceptions. I want (us) to lead the league in sacks from the secondary and lead the league in turnovers.”

Led by three Pro Bowlers — cornerbacks Chris Harris Jr. and Aqib Talib, and Ward — the Broncos have the talent. Now it’s a matter of execution. Even with all their accolades, their perceived slight from being left off the NFL Top 100 list should prevent them from being complacent.

Last season, the Broncos were tied for seventh in the league in interceptions with 18. Although they were second in the league in rushing yards allowed (79.8 per game), the Broncos were tied for 22nd in forced fumbles, with seven.

“We dropped some interceptions last year. I would like to see us have more forced fumbles,” Ward said. “I want to see us score on defense. Big plays and turnovers, that’s what we want and that’s what we can improve on from last year.”

Ward said the key to forcing more turnovers is simple: pressure the quarterback and play good coverage. Opportunities are great, but they mean nothing if you can’t capitalize.

The fourth member of that secondary, Darian Stewart, is in his first year with the Broncos after starting 14 of 16 games with the Baltimore Ravens last season. He recorded 53 tackles (37 solo), three pass deflections, one interception and one fumble.

“You never really see him flustered or out of position too much,” Ward said. “He can play both free (safety) and strong (safety), so that’s great for us. We’ll get to interchange.”

High aspirations, but not completely far-fetched for what may be one of the Broncos’ most talented Broncos secondaries.
