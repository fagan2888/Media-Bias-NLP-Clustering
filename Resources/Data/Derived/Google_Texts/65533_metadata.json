Remember how they were aghast \u2014 Aghast! \u2014 Tennessee turned down \u201cfree\u201d federal funding to provide \u201cfree\u201d health insurance to the uninsured?\n\nRemember the Democratic derision when Tennessee\u2019s \u201cstupid\u201d Republicans decided not to establish an Obamacare exchange? Remember Obamacare was going to \u201cbend the cost curve,\u201d causing insurance premiums to fall? Well.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week BlueCross and BlueShield of Tennessee, the largest provider of Obamacare insurance plans in the state, has requested a 36 percent premium increase for 2016. Which means, I guess, the cost curve is bending. Up. Straight up. Sickeningly so.\n\n\u201cOur filing is planned to allow us to operate on at least a break-even basis for these plans, meaning that the rate would cover only medical services and expenses \u2014 with no profit margin for 2016,\u201d BCBS spokeswoman Mary Danielson told the Journal. BCBS said it lost $141 million last year on Obamacare exchange-sold plans, primarily because of a few really sick people.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee BCBS will get all its request. Tennessee Insurance Commissioner Julie Mix McPeak told the Journal she would be \u201csurprised if we settled\u201d for such a sharp rise. However, McPeak said her staff had seen data that confirmed BCBS paid some huge claims for a relatively few policyholders. The older, sicker Tennesseans who bought their insurance on the federal exchange cost insurers much, much more than the \u201ccompassionate\u201d crowd could comprehend.\n\nAnd about those exchanges. Oregon and Nevada have already closed their state-run exchanges. Hawaii could be next. Other states are learning the low, too-good-to-be-true cost estimates of running exchanges were, in fact, too good to be true. Colorado recently learned the cost of its call center would be more than 60 percent higher than estimated \u2014 $21 million vs. $13 million.\n\nThe feds have pumped more than $5 billion into state-run exchanges to get them up and running. State exchanges are up, but many are barely crawling. Vermont, with 626,000 residents \u2014 one-tenth the population of Tennessee \u2014 could see its exchange cost more than $200 million to run this year. Those bribes \u2014 er, federal subsidies \u2014to state exchanges are set to expire this year, so more exchanges could fall into failing fiscal health soon.\n\nAnd finally, remember how Obamacare would cap administrative costs, meaning more money for actual care? The Hill reported this week, citing an analysis of data from the Congressional Budget Office and the government\u2019s National Health Expenditure Projections, administrative costs will increase more than $270 billion over the next decade above what would have happened without Obamacare. In other words, Tennessee dodged a budget buster by \u201ccold-heartedly\u201d opting out.\n\nThe \u201ccompassionate\u201d crowd felt morally superior to \u201cstupid\u201d Republicans when Obamacare was but a fraudulently sold concept. But now that reality bites and the actual bills for it are coming due, we learn again stupid is as stupid does.\n\nGreg Johnson\u2019s columns appear on Wednesdays, Fridays and the second Sunday of each month.
