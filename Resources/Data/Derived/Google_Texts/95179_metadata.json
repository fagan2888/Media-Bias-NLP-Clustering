If the truce held, he hoped talks to find a lasting solution to the dispute could be resumed.\n\nNagorno-Karabakh is a mountainous enclave within Azerbaijan's borders, populated mainly by ethnic Armenians who reject Azerbaijan's rule. With support from Armenia they fought a war in the early 1990s to establish de facto control over the territory.\n\nThe fighting this week was the most intense since a 1994 ceasefire that stopped the conflict but did not resolve the underlying dispute.\n\nOn Thursday, each side alleged the other had violated the Moscow-brokered truce in skirmishes overnight. Each said one of their servicemen was killed.\n\nThose incidents aside, the ceasefire was broadly holding. A Reuters reporter in Nagorno-Karabakh's Martuni district, near the front line with Azerbaijan's forces, said there was no sign of fighting on Thursday.\n\nRESTORING INFLUENCE\n\nSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and Europe have been cultivating ties in the South Caucasus region, which includes Azerbaijan, Armenia and their common neighbor Georgia.\n\nWestern powers see the region as a strategically-important corridor through which Caspian Sea oil and gas can be exported to world markets. The route bypasses Russia, so reducing Moscow's stranglehold on energy exports from the former Soviet Union.\n\nRussia, the former imperial master, has seen its influence decline. In the Minsk Group, the body set up in 1994 to mediate in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Russia had equal status alongside the United States and France.\n\nAccording to Matthew Bryza, a former U.S. ambassador to Azerbaijan and co-chair of the Minsk Group, Putin saw this week's outbreak of violence in Nagorno-Karabakh as an opportunity to re-assert Moscow's sway.\n\nPutin has already established a pattern of trying to restore Russia's clout beyond its borders, notably in Ukraine with his support for pro-Russian separatists and in Syria with a military campaign to help President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nSince the latest flare-up over Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia has acted separately from the rest of the Minsk Group, Bryza told Reuters.\n\n\"Russia\u2019s goal in its lone mediation mission appears to be twofold: firstly, to repair its international reputation in relation to its debacle in Ukraine, and secondly to strengthen the impression in Armenia and Azerbaijan that Russia calls the shots in the South Caucasus,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the U.S. administration is so absent and timid in its response has the impact of ceding the strategic field in the South Caucasus to Russia. This can have profound and dangerous consequences in Syria, Ukraine, and far beyond.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Nailia Bagirova in AZERBAIJAN, Hasmik Mkrtchyan in YEREVAN, and Dmitry Solovyov in MOSCOW; Editing by Andrew Osborn and Andrew Roche)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "YEREVAN/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia staked out its claim on Thursday to be the lead play", "title": "Russia styles itself lead mediator in Nagorno-Karabakh conflict", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/07/Russia-styles-itself-lead-mediator-Nagorno-Karabakh-conflict", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/nagorno-karabakh-fighting_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/07/Russia-styles-itself-lead-mediator-Nagorno-Karabakh-conflict", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/nagorno-karabakh-fighting_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "YEREVAN/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia staked out its claim on Thursday to be the lead play", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In the Minsk Group, the body set up in 1994 to mediate in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Russia had equal status alongside the United States and France.\nSince the latest flare-up over Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia has acted separately from the rest of the Minsk Group, Bryza told Reuters.\nOn a visit to Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, on Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov emphasized Moscow's special role as mediator.\nDozens of people were killed this week in four days of shelling and rocket strikes between Azerbaijan's military and Armenian-backed separatists over the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region, prompting fears of an all-out war.\nNagorno-Karabakh is a mountainous enclave within Azerbaijan's borders, populated mainly by ethnic Armenians who reject Azerbaijan's rule."}
