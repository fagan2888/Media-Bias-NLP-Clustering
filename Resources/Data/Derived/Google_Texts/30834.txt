MSNBC’s Chris Matthews on Tuesday ripped Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) over his hours-long anti-Obamacare speech on the Senate floor, part of a gutsy attempt to prevent Democrats from restoring the funds to the health care law that the House voted to remove.

Matthews said Cruz is not a “legislator” or trying to “change government the way its formulated and carried out.”

“He is a problem for our Republic,” the host later declared.

Matthews also went after Cruz for questioning Chuck Hagel’s foreign ties in a “Joe McCarthy fashion” during his confirmation hearing.

“He has contempt for the American political system. He is not a member of any political party that I can tell,” he said. “His behavior has been totally and utterly destructive.”

Americans have not learned a “single thing about Obamacare” because of Ted Cruz, he added. “He doesn’t teach, he is a demagogue.”

After listening to Matthews and his panel fume about Cruz and his “antics,” it’s pretty clear the Texas Republican has struck a nerve.
