Again and again, in more than two dozen recorded public statements, the president emphatically denied that he had the power to pronounce law unilaterally. \u201cMy job,\u201d he huffed, \u201cis to execute the laws that are passed.\u201d His mere say-so could not suspend deportations or grant illegal aliens lawful status, he explained, because that would transgress \u201claws on the books that Congress has passed.\u201d\n\nIn fact, nearly two years ago, Obama said he and his subordinates had already \u201cstretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can\u201d for the benefit of unlawful immigrants. Yet this week, he abruptly discovered enough elasticity to dictate a new legal regime \u2014 actually, an illegal regime \u2014 for conferring lawful status on illegal aliens, a power our quaint Constitution vests in Congress.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s speech, Obama was not just brazen but remorseless, not deigning to offer a word of explanation for his sudden 180. Another day, another story line in the soap opera, as if the prior episodes had never happened.\n\nThe pundits were aghast and, for once, seemed embarrassed at having covered the solipsist-in-chief\u2019s original expressions of humility as if they were, you know, sincere. This, fittingly, stirred the Obama courtiers to an embarrassing defense of their man. We were told that the president \u2014 heretofore the brightest, most learned ever to grace the office \u2014 had previously been uninformed about the extent of his power, but thankfully his lawyers set him straight.\n\nLaughable. Obama is not an expert in much, but he has a Ph.D. in power. By his own account, moreover, he is a constitutional scholar. Even if he weren\u2019t, the doctrine of prosecutorial discretion \u2014 at the root of both Obama\u2019s prior disavowals of sweeping power and his current usurpation of it \u2014 is for government lawyers what two-plus-two is for scientists. Everyone in the executive branch knows, as surely as they know their own names, that neither Congress nor the courts can compel the president to enforce the law. And in the not implausible event that Obama was on the golf course the day they covered that in president school, he would no doubt have learned it from the stacks of memos generated by his Department of Homeland Security since 2009. As I detail in Faithless Execution, those memos heavily rely on prosecutorial discretion as the administration\u2019s rationale for refraining from enforcement of the immigration laws and for awarding favorable treatment to sundry categories of illegal aliens.\n\nIt is not that the president has been confused or misinformed about the extent of his authority as it regards the law. It is that the law has never mattered to him \u2013 any more than it matters now on immigration, the \u201cAffordable\u201d Care Act, the federal narcotics statutes, and the remaining array of congressional enactments that Obama has twice sworn to execute faithfully.\n\nAgain, President Obama is an Alinskyite.\n\nAlinskyites gauge the extent of their authority not by the limits of law but by the potential of raw power constrained only by political expediency. Once you grasp that, you have everything you need to know.\n\nAlinsky\u2019s theory of power involves co-opting the language and mores of the bourgeois society that community organizers seek to transform. The idea is that the radical in sheep\u2019s clothing becomes politically viable. Upon acquiring power, he quietly but steadily ratchets the system in the direction of his goals. The key is never to get too far ahead of where the public is ready to go \u2014 at least while public opinion matters.\n\nFor the first six years between Obama\u2019s assumption of office and the 2014 midterms, he was saddled with an immigration dilemma. His restive open-borders base wanted immediate, blanket amnesty, but the president knew that amnesty by executive fiat \u2014 particularly without assurances about border security \u2014 was (and remains) intensely unpopular. For all the Beltway chatter about the virtues of amnesty (under the guise of \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d), the president knows that the House conservatives he derides for thwarting Washington\u2019s schemes get elected because their opposition is popular with the voters back home.\n\nFor those six years, Obama played the Alinsky game of trying to appease his radical supporters while maintaining his mainstream credibility. He had three elections to worry about \u2014 his own reelection sandwiched between midterms. If, prior to 2012, he had taken the monarchical action he took Thursday night, he\u2019d have been a one-term president. If he\u2019d taken it before the election two weeks ago, a GOP landslide would have been assured, and even steeper than it turned out to be.\n\nSo Obama repeatedly told his base he could not simply declare an amnesty, not because he really believed he was hemmed in by law \u2014 after all, during that time he was rewriting Obamacare once a week. He did it because he needed to frame his politically expedient inaction in some story that his base might grudgingly accept, the public might find noble, and his opposition might be disarmed by.\n\nThe \u201crule of law\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s the ticket!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a king,\u201d said our notoriously modest king. But by Thursday night, Obama not only had no more elections to fret over; Mary Landrieu\u2019s long-shot reelection bid \u2014 the chance to hold on to a Democratic seat in the Senate \u2014 had unofficially tanked. With no more reasons to delay or pretend, the president threw caution and the Constitution to the wind, proclaiming the amnesty he\u2019d been insisting he was powerless to proclaim.\n\nYou may have been surprised if all you read are news reports. But not if you\u2019ve read Saul Alinsky.\n\n\u2014 Andrew C. McCarthy is a policy fellow at the National Review Institute.

And in the not implausible event that Obama was on the golf course the day they covered that in president school, he would no doubt have learned it from the stacks of memos generated by his Department of Homeland Security since 2009. As I detail in Faithless Execution, those memos heavily rely on prosecutorial discretion as the administration\u2019s rationale for refraining from enforcement of the immigration laws and for awarding favorable treatment to sundry categories of illegal aliens.#page#\n\nIt is not that the president has been confused or misinformed about the extent of his authority as it regards the law. It is that the law has never mattered to him \u00a0\u2013 any more than it matters now on immigration, the \u201cAffordable\u201d Care Act, the federal narcotics statutes, and the remaining array of congressional enactments that Obama has twice sworn to execute faithfully.\n\nAgain, President Obama is an Alinskyite.\n\nAlinskyites gauge the extent of their authority not by the limits of law but by the potential of raw power constrained only by political expediency. Once you grasp that, you have everything you need to know.#ad#\n\nAlinsky\u2019s theory of power involves co-opting the language and mores of the bourgeois society that community organizers seek to transform. The idea is that the radical in sheep\u2019s clothing becomes politically viable. Upon acquiring power, he quietly but steadily ratchets the system in the direction of his goals. The key is never to get too far ahead of where the public is ready to go \u2014 at least while public opinion matters.\n\nFor the first six years between Obama\u2019s assumption of office and the 2014 midterms, he was saddled with an immigration dilemma. His restive open-borders base wanted immediate, blanket amnesty, but the president knew that amnesty by executive fiat \u2014 particularly without assurances about border security \u2014 was (and remains) intensely unpopular. For all the Beltway chatter about the virtues of amnesty (under the guise of \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d), the president knows that the House conservatives he derides for thwarting Washington\u2019s schemes get elected because their opposition is popular with the voters back home.\n\nFor those six years, Obama played the Alinsky game of trying to appease his radical supporters while maintaining his mainstream credibility. He had three elections to worry about \u2014 his own reelection sandwiched between midterms. If, prior to 2012, he had taken the monarchical action he took Thursday night, he\u2019d have been a one-term president. If he\u2019d taken it before the election two weeks ago, a GOP landslide would have been assured, and even steeper than it turned out to be.\n\nSo Obama repeatedly told his base he could not simply declare an amnesty, not because he really believed he was hemmed in by law \u2014 after all, during that time he was rewriting Obamacare once a week. He did it because he needed to frame his politically expedient inaction in some story that his base might grudgingly accept, the public might find noble, and his opposition might be disarmed by.\n\nThe \u201crule of law\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s the ticket!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a king,\u201d said our notoriously modest king. But by Thursday night, Obama not only had no more elections to fret over; Mary Landrieu\u2019s long-shot reelection bid \u2014 the chance to hold on to a Democratic seat in the Senate \u2014 had unofficially tanked. With no more reasons to delay or pretend, the president threw caution and the Constitution to the wind, proclaiming the amnesty he\u2019d been insisting he was powerless to proclaim.\n\nYou may have been surprised if all you read are news reports. But not if you\u2019ve read Saul Alinsky.\n\n\u2014 Andrew C. McCarthy is a policy fellow at the National Review Institute.
