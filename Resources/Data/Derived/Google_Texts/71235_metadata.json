Rather than rely on the virtue of its citizenry, the city council of Washington DC has chosen to pay for it instead.\n\nRelated: U.S. Police Chiefs Vulnerable as Crime Rates, Media Pressures Rise\n\nThe council voted unanimously to implement a program piloted in California to reduce criminal recidivism by paying former convicts not to commit crimes. Normally, the incentive structures run in the other direction \u2013 for instance, fines and loss of freedom when convicted of crimes, and civil penalties for violation of regulations on myriad potential offenses from watering lawns on the wrong day to painting houses in an unapproved color. Richmond, California chose to pay ex-cons to comply with the law, and not surprisingly, the program succeeded \u2013 at least in the short term.\n\n\u201cIn Richmond, 79 percent of \"fellows\" participating in the program have not been suspected of involvement in any gun crimes since joining the program,\u201d reports the Associated Press, \u201cand 84 percent have not been injured by gunfire, the program's executive director, DeVone Boggan, said in a report to the Council.\u201d During the first eight years of the program, Boggan claimed that homicides in Richmond dropped by 77 percent, but the correlation so far lacks any reproducible connection to causation. Still, the city feels confident enough in these results to recommend it to Washington DC.\n\nRelated: FBI Chief Debunks Obama\u2019s Crusade for Criminal Justice Reform\n\nHow much did it cost the citizens of Richmond to keep violent felons from attacking them? The \u201cstipend\u201d for each \u201cfellow\u201d in compliance can reach $9,000 a year. Bear in mind that this money comes from people who don\u2019t commit crimes \u2013 the taxpayers of Richmond. Washington would open the program for up to 200 people a year and set aside $460,000 in annual stipend payments, or roughly $2,300 per person a year if all qualified for the cash prize for good citizenship \u2026 or at least for not getting caught.\n\nCrime may not pay, but after-crime certainly will, and not just for the criminals. The city projects the overall cost of the program in its first four years at $4.9 million, even though the total amount of the stipends comes to only $1.84 million in the same period. Sixty-two percent of the funding will go to the bureaucracy necessary for paying ex-cons to obey the law.\n\nThe money would be well spent, some argued, because the cost of preventing more victimization pales in comparison to the damage these \u201cfellows\u201d would otherwise cause. Perhaps it might be cost effective in that narrow sense, but the taxpayers who fund a program that sounds curiously similar to a protection racket might wonder if they\u2019re being victimized anyway. Nice community ya got there, folks. Shame if anything happened to it \u2026.\n\nRelated: After California Shootings, Muslim-American Families Struggle With Identity\n\nThe cash payments point to a fundamental fairness issue, too. If ex-cons get cash for not breaking the law, why shouldn\u2019t everyone get a piece of that action? If people promise not to conduct breaking and entering, why should it take a conviction to get $2300 a year from Uncle Sugar? I\u2019d gladly promise not to commit a violent felony in 2016 if it means I can get my hands on a few thousand dollars. What\u2019s more, my clean record makes me a more reliable risk, too.\n\nAnd why stick to major crimes? Maybe the government can pay people not to have loud parties. Here in Minnesota, we could pay drivers not to tailgate even when six inches of snow has come down in the last hour. (I\u2019d actually donate to a fund for that one.)\n\nThe money is beside the point, however. As Franklin pointed out, liberty is suited for a virtuous people \u2013 those who voluntarily operate in good faith within the framework of self-governance. Virtue by its nature cannot be bought. Those who respond to the social contract only on the basis of wealth incentives will only abide by it to the extent that the cash balances out competing incentives.\n\nFurthermore, the moral impact of such programs reward the threat of implied violence by paying cash to hold them temporarily in abeyance. Rather than incentivizing felons to demonstrate rehabilitation, we\u2019re essentially paying them to be dangerous.\n\nRelated: 21 Unbelievable Facts About Guns in America\n\nRudyard Kipling put it best in his poem Dane-Geld, the practice of Vikings to extort cities and states to prevent invasions and sackings:\n\nIt is always a temptation for a rich and lazy nation,\n\nTo puff and look important and to say:\n\n\"Though we know we should defeat you, we have not the time to meet you.\n\nWe will therefore pay you cash to go away.\"\n\nAnd that is called paying the Dane-geld;\n\nBut we've proved it again and again,\n\nThat if once you have paid him the Dane-geld\n\nYou never get rid of the Dane.\n\nEither we hold all citizens equally responsible for conducting themselves according to the rule of law, or we pay the Dane-geld. But don\u2019t be surprised when we not only can\u2019t get rid of the Dane, but that we find ourselves hip-deep in them. Such are the consequences for discarding virtue and equal application of the law for shortcuts around the difficult but necessary responsibilities to enforce it \u2013 the exact impulse Kipling lamented.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "\"Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom,\u201d Benjamin Franklin wrote to Abb\u00e9s Chal", "title": "The New Protection Racket: Paying Criminals Not to Commit Crimes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/02/04/New-Protection-Racket-Paying-Criminals-Not-Commit-Crimes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09252012_money_handcuffs_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/02/04/New-Protection-Racket-Paying-Criminals-Not-Commit-Crimes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09252012_money_handcuffs_article.jpg", "creator": "@EdMorrissey", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "\"Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom,\u201d Benjamin Franklin wrote to Abb\u00e9s Chal", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Furthermore, the moral impact of such programs reward the threat of implied violence by paying cash to hold them temporarily in abeyance.\nBear in mind that this money comes from people who don\u2019t commit crimes \u2013 the taxpayers of Richmond.\nRelated: U.S. Police Chiefs Vulnerable as Crime Rates, Media Pressures RiseThe council voted unanimously to implement a program piloted in California to reduce criminal recidivism by paying former convicts not to commit crimes.\nSixty-two percent of the funding will go to the bureaucracy necessary for paying ex-cons to obey the law.\nRichmond, California chose to pay ex-cons to comply with the law, and not surprisingly, the program succeeded \u2013 at least in the short term."}
