Much like spring\u2019s mounting of Tarell Alvin McCraney\u2019s \u201cThe Brothers Size,\u201d this production introduces audiences to the work of a young American playwright on the ascent.\n\nHerzog\u2019s \u201c4000 Miles\u201d was a 2013 Pulitzer Prize finalist.\n\nThe Lincoln Center production c0-starred local fella made good Gabriel Ebert as the grandson of Vera Joseph, a character in \u201cAfter the Revolution.\u201d Herzog\u2019s \u201cBelleville\u201d and \u201cThe Great God Pan\u201d each had New York productions earlier this year.\n\n\u201cAfter the Revolution\u201d also represents the writer\u2019s creative tussle \u2014 at once personal, political and generational.\n\nIn 1999, Herzog\u2019s family learned that paternal grandfather Joe Joseph, who had been blacklisted during the 1950s, had passed secrets to the Soviet Union during World War II.\n\nIn \u201cAfter the Revolution,\u201d recent law school grad and headstrong activist Emma Joseph learns that the grandfather she named her social-justice foundation after was not the person she believed him to be. It\u2019s a revelation that rattles Emma\u2019s foundation. Yes, her organization, but also her sense of familial identity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always ben interested in not just the politics, but the trappings of being a deeper political person,\u201d Herzog says on the phone from New York, where she lives with husband and theater director, Sam Gold, and their baby.\n\n\u201cThe word I\u2019ve used before is \u2018scaffolding.\u2019 The kind of scaffolding people build for themselves in terms of their own belief systems is a subject of enduring interest to me,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve always been troubled with questions of how the things we hold dear become the things we hold dear, whether that process is just arbitrary.\u201d\n\nEvery family has its stories. Most don\u2019t have a storyteller of Herzog\u2019s observational clarity, sturdy will or subtle wit to tease them, turn them this way and that, take their peculiarities and make resonant sense of them.\n\nEven if we did, we still might not have kin willing to accept a version of itself made public.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say it wasn\u2019t hard on anyone, but I think \u2014 amazingly \u2014 people withstood it with a lot of grace.\n\n\u201cLuckily for me, I have a really generous and accepting family,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe more important than that, they have a sense of humor.\u201d\n\nLisa Kennedy: 303-954-1567, lkennedy@denverpost.com, twitter.com/bylisakennedy\n\n\u201cAFTER THE REVOLUTION.\u201d A Curious Theatre Company production.
