In the 2010 Federal Census, 29,036 people were counted, according to Finance Director Jim Smith.\n\nThe city has budgeted $110,000 to hire Dempsey, Dilling and Associates, the city engineer\u2019s company, to conduct the census from beginning to end. During the 2013-14 budget year, the city budgeted $100,000 and the actual cost was $110,000.\n\nDempsey, Dilling and Associates conducted the special census of 2007, and \u201cthey have the process already set up to conduct a special census,\u201d Smith said, adding the survey will probably start in September. The city leaders plan to have an initial meeting by the end of July or early August, he noted.\n\nThere will be one to three outgoing mailings, as well as inserts in water bills and forms at city hall. The city will set up a special email account for citizens to acquire more information.\n\n\u201cToward the end of December to January, (we will be going) door-to-door for those who have not filled out their form. There will also be outgoing calls from city hall towards the end.\u201d\n\nAs in 2013, there will be yard signs around the city to encourage residents to turn in a census, Smith said.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the special census is to get as accurate a count as possible of the citizens living here because it has a very direct impact on distribution of state monies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state returns part of its portion of the sales tax it receives at the point of sale to each municipality based on population. Since Spring Hill is a rapidly growing city, it behooves us to receive as much as we can from \u2018state-shared sales taxes.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor fiscal year 2015-16, the state is paying cities $75.50 per resident. Because the total official population is 32,053, the city will receive $2,420,001 from the state this fiscal year.\n\nSmith said the city issued 507 new residential building permits in 2013 and 587 in 2014.\n\n\u201cIf one assumes an average of 2.5 people per household, we could then conclude that we have added 2,735 new residents since the last census,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would give a grand total of 34,788 people living here. Personally, I think we will go over the 35,000 mark. At $75.50 per person, that amounts to an additional $206,492.50 just by having more folks living here. If the census costs $110,000, we would still be ahead for this fiscal year in the amount of $96,492.50.\u201d\n\nSmith said it\u2019s important for people to respond and fill out the forms properly.\n\n\u201cThe requirement for state verification is to have the first and last name of each person living in the house. This includes children\u2019s names. In the last census, we asked for ages of each person for our own demographic purposes. This is not a requirement for state verification. The first and last names is a requirement. Without that, the state will not verify that household and that address.\u201d\n\nFor more information, call Spring Hill City Hall at (931) 486-2252 or visit www.springhilltn.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Spring Hill is planning to conduct another special census later this year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "ANGIE MAYES amayes@c-dh.net", "og": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/spring-hill-conduct-special-census-2015", "site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "type": "article", "description": "Spring Hill is planning to conduct another special census later this year.", "title": "Spring Hill to conduct special census in 2015"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/spring-hill-conduct-special-census-2015", "title": "Spring Hill to conduct special census in 2015", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1253004", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1253004", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local News,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-26T19:36:39-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17c3\"", "article_summary": "Dempsey, Dilling and Associates conducted the special census of 2007, and \u201cthey have the process already set up to conduct a special census,\u201d Smith said, adding the survey will probably start in September.\nSpring Hill is planning to conduct another special census later this year.\nWithout that, the state will not verify that household and that address.\u201dFor more information, call Spring Hill City Hall at (931) 486-2252 or visit www.springhilltn.org.\nThe census showed that 32,053 people were counted in Spring Hill.\nThere will be one to three outgoing mailings, as well as inserts in water bills and forms at city hall."}
