As part of the agreement, the six original charges filed against her, including four counts of felony child abuse, were dropped.\n\nBailey pleaded guilty to an added charge of reckless child abuse \u2014 a Class 5 felony \u2014 which names all four boys as victims.\n\nUnder that charge, the 36-year-old could face up to eight years in prison. Prosecutors agreed to cap her sentence at seven years in prison, but the judge has discretion to sentence her to probation.\n\nA sentencing hearing has been set for Sept. 18. She remains free on bond.\n\nWayne Sperling, the father of the four boys, faces six counts of felony child abuse in the case. The 66-year-old pleaded not guilty in January and has since been sent to the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo for a competency exam.\n\nHis next court hearing has been scheduled for Oct. 17. Sperling remains free on bond.\n\nBailey and Sperling were arrested last October, after Denver police officers removed the four malnourished boys from the squalid apartment. None of the boys \u2014 who were ages 2, 4, 5 and 6 at the time \u2014 were potty trained, and they could speak only in grunts, according to an arrest affidavit.\n\nDuring the hearing on Friday, Bailey spoke in quick, one-word answers as Denver District Court Judge Eric Elliff asked if she understood the plea agreement.\n\nSperling was not in the courtroom. During past hearings, Sperling and Bailey have sat in different rows and did not speak to each other.\n\nThe case is one of the worst child abuse cases the Denver District Attorney\u2019s Office has ever prosecuted, said spokeswoman Lynn Kimbrough.\n\n\u201cWith the way the child abuse statute reads, this was a disposition we felt held her accountable as best we could under the law,\u201d Kimbrough said.\n\nBailey and Sperling were eligible for felony counts in the case only because this was the second time they faced child abuse charges, Kimbrough said.\n\nThe two were known to Denver County child protective services before the boys were removed. In 2006 and 2009, both Sperling and Bailey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child abuse charges in the 2006 case.\n\nEach received a sentence of two years\u2019 probation in that case.\n\nBailey\u2019s parental rights for her three other children were terminated in 2009. Two of the children removed from the home in 2006 are now thriving with their family in Lamar.\n\nIn November, a judge denied a request from Bailey and Sperling to visit the four boys. A protection order issued after the two were arrested prohibits them from having contact with the children.\n\nAll four boys have been placed in the same foster home, Kimbrough said. Prosecutors have also said the boys are making significant progress.\n\nJordan Steffen: 303-954-1794, jsteffen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jsteffendp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver mother pleads guilty to keeping four sons in squalid apartment", "title": "Denver mother pleads guilty to keeping four sons in squalid apartment", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/08/denver-mother-pleads-guilty-to-keeping-four-sons-in-squalid-apartment/", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131121_095343_Lorinda-Bailey.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131121_095343_Lorinda-Bailey.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-08T08:33:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:31:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9d7\"", "article_summary": "The Denver mother accused of keeping her four young sons in a tiny, feces-littered apartment pleaded guilty to one count of felony child abuse Friday.\nAs part of the agreement, the six original charges filed against her, including four counts of felony child abuse, were dropped.\nIn 2006 and 2009, both Sperling and Bailey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child abuse charges in the 2006 case.\nBailey pleaded guilty to an added charge of reckless child abuse \u2014 a Class 5 felony \u2014 which names all four boys as victims.\nWayne Sperling, the father of the four boys, faces six counts of felony child abuse in the case."}
