But the news is less good for those who put off necessary capital investment during more than half a decade of the easiest money policy in the Fed\u2019s history.\n\nChief among those likely to be regretting the failure to take advantage of unprecedentedly cheap borrowing is the U.S. government and, by extension, the U.S. taxpayer. Infrastructure in the U.S. is widely viewed as being in desperate need of repair. From highways, bridges and airports to harbors, railroads and the power grid, are all in need of modernization.\n\nRelated: What the Bond Market Knows that the Stock Market Doesn\u2019t\n\nThese are investments that can be \u2013 and have been \u2013 delayed, but that can\u2019t be avoided forever. Members of Congress missed the chance to fully fund needed infrastructure investment at the time when it would both have done the most good and been cheapest.\n\nInterest rates are rising now and are likely to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. Even so, the argument for major infrastructure spending is still strong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like capital was cheap and now capital is expensive,\u201d said economist Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. \u201cAny impulse to do infrastructure investment should not be thwarted by a small rate hike.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said, every interest rate increase, however small, will cascade through future federal budgets in the form of higher debt service. That means that not only will every dollar borrowed to support infrastructure spending cost more, but also that there will be fewer dollars to spend in the first place, because the debt service on existing government obligations will be rising as well.\n\nRelated: Six Years and $17 Billion Wasted in Afghanistan with Nothing to Show for It\n\n\u201cAs interest rates rise, if we borrow to do the things we need to do, it\u2019s more costly to service that debt,\u201d Bernstein said.\n\nHow much more costly?\n\nIn terms of the total outstanding debt held by the public -- about $13 trillion \u2013 Bernstein said, \u201cA quarter of a basis point is in the tens of billions of dollars per year. That is the part of the budget that is growing most quickly.\u201d\n\nBernstein is among the many economists who bemoan the failure of lawmakers to seize the opportunity to invest in infrastructure years ago, when the economy was still stagnant in the wake of the Great Recession. With unemployment high and infrastructure projects guaranteed to create jobs, it seemed obvious what the government should have been doing, he said.\n\nRelated: Congress to Pentagon \u2013 Don\u2019t Even Think About Closing Military Bases\n\n\u201cIn an environment where borrowing is incredibly cheap? Add to that the fact that infrastructure needs a lot of work? It was a slam-dunk.\u201d\n\nIf it was a slam-dunk then, it\u2019s at least an uncontested layup now, and Congress should take advantage of it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to finally start raising interest rates last week was bad for those who put off necessary capital investment during more than half a decade of the easiest money policy in the Fed\u2019s history.
