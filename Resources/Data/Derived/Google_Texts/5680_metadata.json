This is called the \u201c pack size effect .\u201d New research published in Public Health Nutrition found that in addition to pack size, images on food packaging may have an even stronger influence on people to than serving size, causing them to consume more than recommended amount, especially when there are additional food items depicted on these packages, such as frosting on cake-mix boxes.\n\n\u201cIf what is seen can be more powerful than what is said, these effects should be even stronger for what is seen and not said. This is the case with many of the extras that are depicted on packaging such as sauces on main dishes, syrup on pancakes, dips with chips, sprinkles on ice creams and frosting on cake,\u201d researchers wrote.\n\nAfter conducting a series of four studies involving a total of 51 different cake mixes, researchers at Cornell University\u2019s Food and Brand Lab found that people overestimated the appropriate serving size when shown cake mix boxes with depictions of frosted cake \u2014 for those of you who don\u2019t know, frosting usually isn\u2019t included in boxed cake mix. It\u2019s purchased separately.\n\n\"If we see a slice of cake smothered in frosting on the cake box, we think that is what is normal to serve and eat, but that's not what is reflected in the serving size recommendation on the nutrition label,\" Dr. John Brand, lead study author and researcher, said in a statement .\n\nThe first study compared the calories on the nutrition labels of boxed cake mix with the calories displayed on the box, they found that the frosted cake on food packaging amounted to nearly 135 percent more calories than the recommended serving size. In studies 2, 3 and 4, researchers undergraduates and food-service professionals were given one of these typical cake mix boxes, with some being told the frosting was not included on the nutrition label, whereas others were given no additional information, and they were asked to indicate what they believe would be a reasonable serving size. Researchers found that the depictions of overly caloric frosted cakes caused both undergraduates, and, surprisingly, food-service professionals to overestimate the serving size.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, companies don't intend to deceive us when they include frosting in cake box depictions, but these seemingly small elements of packaging can have a huge impact,\" said co-author Brian Wansink. Also, the fact that food service professionals were influenced to overstate the serving size, even when told the supplementary extras are not included on the nutrition label, shows that these images are strong enough to impact even the most nutritionally savvy consumers.\n\nAlthough nutrition labels were designed to help people make healthier food choices and maintain their diets, research has shown that nearly 70 percent of consumers routinely ignore these labels. However, a prior study conducted by this group of researchers found that the framing of portion size greatly influences the amount of food people eat. For example, if people were given an overly large portion of a pasta meal, and they were told it was \u201cregular\u201d sized portion, they would still eat it because they believe it\u2019s \u201cregular\u201d sized. Reinforcing the impact \u201cpack size effect\u201d and how food image can be more influential than nutrition labels.\n\nThe misleading practice of posting extra calories on packages is prevalent. To be less misleading, researchers suggest manufacturers state the calorie count for goods when supplemental extras such as suaces on foods and toppings, are included.\n\nSource: Brand J, Wansink B, Cohen A.
