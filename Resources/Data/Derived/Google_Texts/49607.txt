Planned Parenthood Votes announced Tuesday that it will spend $450,000 on its first Iowa TV buy highlighting Ernst's positions on birth control and abortion.

In the 30-second spot, set to air in the Des Moines market, women around a kitchen table criticize Ernst on a slew of women's health issues.

"I had no idea her record was this bad. Joni Ernst thinks my boss should have control over whether I get birth control? â€¦ Bottom line, Joni Ernst just does not trust women," individual women say in turn.

Ernst, a member of the Iowa state Senate, is running neck-and-neck against Rep.

Planned Parenthood hopes that highlighting Ernst's opposition to abortion rights and support for the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision will boost Braley in November.
