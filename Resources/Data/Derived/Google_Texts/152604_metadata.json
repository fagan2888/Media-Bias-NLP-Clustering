(Some people refer to this as \u201cprojection\u201d in which someone applies their own faults and flaws onto another.) One example of this is how they routinely threaten to shut down the government unless the Democrats acquiesce to their outrageous demands by insisting that it\u2019s the Democrats who are shutting down the government by failing to acquiesce to their outrageous demands. It\u2019s a very common right-wing tactic designed to twist liberals into pretzels trying to explain why that makes no sense.\n\nBut perhaps the single greatest achievement of this sort of projection is their insistence that the media is liberal. (This goes hand in hand with another very successful right-wing tactic called \u201cplaying the refs\u201d in which they mau-mau the press by accusing them of being tools of the left.) This tactic has its roots in the 1960s and \u201970s when the far right exploited cracks in the so-called liberal consensus, aided and abetted by establishment opinion writers who found themselves discomfited by the cultural changes of the era.\n\nNobody has been more successful at this game than L. Brent Bozell, the head of the Media Research Center, which has spent decades chronicling the alleged biases of the liberal media. Each year the MRC gives out a series of awards to the liberal media in which they clutch their pearls over all the liberal hate they are forced to endure. You see, they are deeply concerned about the incivility and rudeness of liberal America so they get together each year to give what they call the \u201cDishonor awards\u201d to reporters, commentators and citizens whom they believe are polluting the discourse.\n\nJudged to be 2014s most horrifying leftist quote, which had the likes of delicate flowers such as Erick Erickson and Neal Boortz calling for the fainting couch, was this one from CNN\u2019s Carol Costello:\n\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019m just going to come right out and say it: This is quite possibly the best minute and a half of audio we\u2019ve ever come across \u2014 well, come across in a long time anyway. A massive brawl in Anchorage, Alaska, reportedly involving Sarah Palin\u2019s kids and her husband. It was sparked after someone pushed one of her daughters at a party\u2026.And now police have released audio of that interview. It does include some rather colorful language from Bristol. Here now is Bristol\u2019s recollection of how that night unfolded. So sit back and enjoy.\u201d \u2014 CNN Newsroom anchor Carol Costello on Oct. 22, introducing audio of Bristol Palin describing how a man shoved her, dragged her on the ground and repeatedly cursed at her.\n\nAt long last, madame, have you no decency?\n\nBozell constantly berates liberals for being \u201chaters.\u201d Seeing as he has a bit of a history of saying what a reasonable person would likely see as being less than civil, perhaps it just proves the point that it takes one to know one. For instance:\n\nOn Fox News\u2019 Hannity, Bozell said, \u201cHow long do you think Sean Hannity\u2019s show would last if four times in one sentence, he made a comment about, say, the President of the United States, and said that he looked like a skinny, ghetto crackhead? Which, by the way, you might want to say that Barack Obama does.\u201d [Fox News, Hannity, 12/22/11, via Media Matters]\n\nNeedless to say, one of the MRCs most vociferous complaints is that conservatives are unfairly accused of racism.\n\nBut despite the fact that Bozell has been doing yeoman\u2019s work for the Republican Party for decades, he\u2019s not universally popular among leaders of the GOP:\n\nIn a morning interview with a conservative radio talk show, Jonathan Collegio, a spokesman for Republican super-PAC American Crossroads, dubbed conservative author L. Brent Bozell III a \u201chater\u201d for his frequent criticism of GOP leaders in Washington. Hours later a group of influential Bozell supporters shot a letter to Crossroads President Steven Law calling for Mr. Collegio\u2019s head.
