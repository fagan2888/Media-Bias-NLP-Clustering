She calls them \"untrue.\"\n\nNeighbors learning of his arrest like Rick Perlaza said, \"things like that I'm sorry they're not forgivable in my book. If there are 21 counts, those are some serious, serious charges.\"\n\nPerlaza added he's relieved Hook is behind bars for now since there are several children and a school in the neighborhood.\n\nHook is in the Charlotte County Jail on a $2,050,00 bond.\n\nThis is not his first run-in with the law in Charlotte County.\n\nTwo years ago, Hook was arrested at his home for attempted 2nd-Degree murder after he fired a gun at a man in a car.\n\nIn 2010, he was arrested for fleeing deputies at high rates of speed.\n\nThey used ground and aviation units to track him down. He was arrested and charged with fleeing to elude and reckless driving.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Charlotte County Sheriff's Deputies arrested 29-year-old Christopher Hook at his Port Charlotte home Thursday on 21 counts of child molestation.", "og": {"url": "http://www.abc-7.com/story/29475704/port-charlotte-man-charged-with-21-counts-of-child-molestation", "image": "http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wncustom/custom/wzvn/wzvn_og_image.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Charlotte County Sheriff's Deputies arrested 29-year-old Christopher Hook at his Port Charlotte home Thursday on 21 counts of child molestation.", "title": "Port Charlotte man charged with 21 counts of child molestation"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://WZVN.images.worldnow.com/images/8234495_G.jpg", "description": "Charlotte County Sheriff's Deputies arrested 29-year-old Christopher Hook at his Port Charlotte home Thursday on 21 counts of child molestation.", "card": "summary", "title": "Port Charlotte man charged with 21 counts of child molestation"}, "wnreadableurl": "port-charlotte-man-charged-with-21-counts-of-child-molestation", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "WZVN", "fb": {"admins": 1851799707, "app_id": 1678378052403648}, "date": "2015/07/04", "google-site-verification": "gcWGJ_5HBMygrFxFQLREn-pvEzLmkYG-FQepn2WoVSk", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS04"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f8e\"", "article_summary": "Charlotte County Sheriff's Deputies arrested 29-year-old Christopher Hook at his Port Charlotte home Thursday on 21 counts of child molestation.\nIf there are 21 counts, those are some serious, serious charges.\"\nThis is not his first run-in with the law in Charlotte County.\nIn 2010, he was arrested for fleeing deputies at high rates of speed.\nHook is in the Charlotte County Jail on a $2,050,00 bond."}
