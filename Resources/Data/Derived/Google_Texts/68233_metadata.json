He had an opportunity to elaborate during this exchange with correspondent Scott Pelley:\n\nScott Pelley: What's your plan for Obamacare?\n\nDonald Trump: Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced. Obamacare is a disaster if you look at what's going on with premiums where they're up 45, 50, 55 percent.\n\nScott Pelley: How do you fix it?\n\nDonald Trump: There's many different ways, by the way. Everybody's got to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say because a lot of times they say, \"No, no, the lower 25 percent that can't afford private.\" But--\n\nScott Pelley: Universal health care.\n\nDonald Trump: I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.\n\nScott Pelley: The uninsured person is going to be taken care of. How? How?\n\nDonald Trump: They're going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And, you know what, if this is probably--\n\nScott Pelley: Make a deal? Who pays for it?\n\nDonald Trump: --the government's gonna pay for it. But we're going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most part it's going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP presidential candidate says Obamacare is terrible and needs to be replaced.
