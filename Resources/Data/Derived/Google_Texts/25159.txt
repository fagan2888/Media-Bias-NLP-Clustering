A newly released affidavit is shedding some light on the mental state of a man accused of killing his mother and grandmother.



Michael Dieckmann, 30, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of his mother Jacqueline Dieckmann, and his grandmother Illa Pfeiffer.



The two women were found dead in their home Wednesday morning.



According to an affidavit released by the Council Bluffs Police Department, a witness told investigating officers that one of the victims confided Michael Dieckmann had been violent toward her within the past week.



The witness said Michael Dieckmann had a history of mental illness and had been committed to a facility for treatment in 2015.



“She said she has been very concerned by his actions of late and bazaar [sic] conversation which included a fetish with guns, ammunition and knives. She said they have removed several machete knives from the home to keep away from Michael,” the affidavit says.



The witness told detectives she had seen Michael the night before , and he told her that “cats are talking to him, telling him what to do.”



The witness arrived at the house the next morning and went inside when no one answered the door. She saw one of the victims dead, rushed out and called 911.



According to the affidavit, officers found Michael Dieckmann walking a short distance away from the home, and took him into custody.



He is being held on $1 million bond.
