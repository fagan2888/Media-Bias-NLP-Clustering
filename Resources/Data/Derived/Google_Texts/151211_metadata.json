(RELATED: Washington\u2019s Obamacare Exchange Is Already Shut Down)\n\n\u201cWould really like to know WHY I was charged TRIPLE this month and when you are fixing the problem,\u201d wrote Gabrielle Whitman. \u201cThis is NOT acceptable. No help online or by calling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got triple billed as well,\u201d Azhar Basit wrote. \u201cI also called and waited on [the] phone and no one picked up after a long wait. This is terrible.\u201d\n\nOnizuka, the CEO of the state-run Washington Healthplanfinder, says the problem had affected 13,000 customers total and that the exchange is working on fixing it within 48 hours.\n\n\u201cYesterday evening, the exchange was made aware that a portion of Washington Healthplanfinder Qualified Health Plan customers had an incorrect amount withdrawn from their bank accounts during our standard monthly payment process,\u201d Onizuka told KIRO-TV. \u201cThe issue affected 13,000 customer accounts that had previously set up automatic payments through their online account.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are working closely with our system integrator, Deloitte, to reverse the incorrect withdrawals as quickly as possible, but no later than the next 48 hours,\u201d Onizuka said. \u201cWe apologize to our impacted customers and are working to correct the problem to minimize any further inconvenience they may have already experienced.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Washington\u2019s exchange has dealt with this problem. During the state\u2019s first year running the Obamacare exchange, customers reported that Washington Healthplanfinder had debited their accounts for double the amount of their premium. The payment glitches persisted for months for between 10,000 and 15,000 people, King 5 News reported last fall.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Still glitchy", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Washington state's Obamacare exchange overcharged 13,000 customers by taking too much straight out of their bank accounts this month, according to the marketplace's CEO, Richard Onizuka.
