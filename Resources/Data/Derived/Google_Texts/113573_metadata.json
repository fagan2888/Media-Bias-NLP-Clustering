Many agents reached for this article said the number is low because the program is simply not widely known yet.\n\nAccording to figures released Wednesday, more than 125 businesses have started the enrollment process through the website MyARInsurance.com.\n\nArkansas SHOP, offered under the My Arkansas Insurance brand, opened for business on Nov. 1, and coverage for enrolled small businesses became effective on Jan. 1.\n\nThere is no deadline to sign up for future coverage on SHOP, Donaldson added.\n\nDonaldson said the roll out on SHOP has been a \u201cgood start\u201d for a new program and has at least seen a better start than the federal SHOP program, which signed up 28 businesses over the past two years.\n\nByron Ware of Ware Insurance & Financial Services in Fort Smith is one of 104 agents in the state qualified by the Arkansas Insurance Department to sign up businesses onto SHOP. He says that while the rates are not different through SHOP, a big advantage to the program is a sliding scale to offer tax credits to small businesses.\n\n\u201cWe just signed up a small business this week and their accountant said the business owner was going to save $6,000 in tax credits on his taxes for 2016,\u201d Ware said. \u201cThis guy was paying 100 percent of his seven employees\u2019 premiums though.\u201d\n\nThree variables are taken into consideration on those tax credits, Ware explained: How much the employee is paying, how many employees there are and what their income is. There is a sliding for what kind of tax credits employers can expect.\n\nThe one drawback so far to SHOP is that there is only one carrier on the system, Blue Cross Blue Shield. Ware said when the program gets more developed other carriers might jump on board to provide more competition and options.\n\nStephanie Freeman, an independent insurance agent who is also approved to sign up small businesses on SHOP, said her agency has dealt with companies that qualify for SHOP but are not willing to give up their \u201cgrandfathered plans.\u201d However, it\u2019s worth looking into, she says.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, the primary reason a business would seek coverage through the SHOP is for the tax benefits if applicable,\u201d Freeman wrote in an email. \u201cThe tax credit is worth up to 50 percent of the employer contribution toward the employees\u2019 premiums for low to moderate wage workers (up to 35 percent for tax-exempt employers). The tax credit is highest for companies with fewer than 10 employees whose average annual salary is $25,000 or less.\u201d\n\nWhile insurance carriers outside the SHOP marketplace require businesses to pay 50 percent of the \u201cemployee only\u201d rate, SHOP employers can pay as little as nothing. However, in order to receive tax credits, business owner must pay at least 50 percent of the \u201cEmployee Only\u201d premium, Donaldson explained.\n\nTo qualify for the tax credit, all of the following must apply: Employer has fewer than 25 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees; average employee salary is about $50,000 per year or less; employer pays at least 50 percent of the full-time employees\u2019 premium costs; and employer offers coverage to the full-time employees through the SHOP Marketplace.\n\nAnother issue Freeman says they have discovered is that employers don\u2019t like the added complication of having to consider whether it will raise their insurance costs if they are able to give their employees a raise during the year, or if employees work more overtime than expected increasing their annual pay.\n\nSmall businesses can find a list of the 104 qualified SHOP agents and brokers at www.MyARInsurance.com and clicking on the \u201cFind An Agent/Broker\u201d icon at the top of the page.
