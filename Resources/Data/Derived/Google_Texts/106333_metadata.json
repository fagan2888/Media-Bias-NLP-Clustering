The poll was begun on Jan. 2.\n\nThe last time the percentage of uninsured reached that level was in early 2009. Previous polls found the number of uninsured was close to that mark in early 2011, at 16.1%, and late 2012, at 16.3%. The slice of uninsured peaked at 18% in mid-2013, the pollsters said.\n\nBut it may be too early to tell whether Obamacare is having a significant effect on the uninsured. The fluctuation in the percentages may be a sign of inherent variability in the rate or random changes. If the uninsured rate continues to fall over the next several months, it could be due to the ACA, Gallup officials said.\n\nThe poll also found that the number of uninsured \u201cinvincibles,\u201d or those aged 18-34, is declining. Uninsured consumers aged 18-25 is down to 23.3%, showing a steady decline since the ACA\u2019s passage allowed them to remain on their parents\u2019 plans. The percentage of those without coverage ages 26-34 was down to 25.7%, a level not seen since late 2010. Consumers in those age groups are needed to help pay for older, less healthy patients.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw.\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog.\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nPressure builds on Walgreen to drop tobacco\n\nLeukemia treatment approval boosts shares of Pharmacyclics\n\nDaVita hits a new high after upping its forecast", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-02-12T15:07:00-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "A new poll shows that the number of uninsured individuals in the U.S. has dropped to levels not seen since 2009.", "title": "Poll says uninsured numbers down but Obamacare effects unclear", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/12/poll-says-uninsured-numbers-down-but-obamacare-effects-unclear/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU503_uninsu_MG_20140212145515.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Gallup,health care,Number of uninsured,Obamacare", "article.headline": "Poll says uninsured numbers down but Obamacare effects unclear", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Gallup,health care,Number of uninsured,Obamacare", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "A new poll shows that the number of uninsured individuals in the U.S. has dropped to levels not seen since 2009.", "article.published": "2014-02-12T15:07:00-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/12/poll-says-uninsured-numbers-down-but-obamacare-effects-unclear/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "A new poll shows that the number of uninsured individuals in the U.S. has dropped to levels not seen since 2009.", "title": "Poll says uninsured numbers down but Obamacare effects unclear", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/12/poll-says-uninsured-numbers-down-but-obamacare-effects-unclear/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU503_uninsu_MG_20140212145515.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2072", "article.updated": "2014-02-12T15:07:00-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0bb6\"", "article_summary": "If the uninsured rate continues to fall over the next several months, it could be due to the ACA, Gallup officials said.\nThe poll also found that the number of uninsured \u201cinvincibles,\u201d or those aged 18-34, is declining.\nBut it may be too early to tell whether Obamacare is having a significant effect on the uninsured.\nThe last time the percentage of uninsured reached that level was in early 2009.\nPrevious polls found the number of uninsured was close to that mark in early 2011, at 16.1%, and late 2012, at 16.3%."}
