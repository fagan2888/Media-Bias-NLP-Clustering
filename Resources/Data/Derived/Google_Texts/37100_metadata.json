Rand Paul put Hollywood in the spotlight Monday revealing a $25,000 federal grant billing taxpayers for the building of an Oscars museum.\n\nThe National Endowment for the Arts is sending the federal dollars to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science to help build what the academy claims as the \u201cworld\u2019s premier museum\u201d exploring the history and future of movies.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican revealed the spending in his latest \u201cWaste Report,\u201d which he uses to publicly uncover \u201cegregious\u201d instances of excessive government spending.\n\n\u201c$25,000 might be small in the scope of the federal budget or in Hollywood, it is over half what the average worker makes in a year, and equals the full federal tax liability of almost four average Americans,\u201d Paul said in the report.\n\nHe questioned why the government would send the chunk of money to the academy given the group\u2019s \u201cabundance of wealth.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition to scores of Hollywood brass ponying up donations to the museum, the academy is flush with cash; it makes profits of roughly $50 million on the Oscars alone,\u201d Paul said.\n\nThe museum, set to open in 2017, will receive the grant to subsidize planning for its exhibits. Paul highlights the museum will include a space shuttle from \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d which he said the academy bought for a \u201ccool\u201d $344,000.\n\n\u201cOne must wonder, when cries ring out about what constitutes a fair share of taxes for someone to pay, why are any of those tax dollars going to support a museum that does not need it?\u201d Paul said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The museum spent $344K on a movie prop.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The museum spent $344K on a movie prop.", "title": "Rand Paul Highlights $25K Federal Grant For Oscars Museum", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150706_Oscars_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-06T19:46:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1gk2jdE"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The museum spent $344K on a movie prop.", "title": "Rand Paul Highlights $25K Federal Grant For Oscars Museum", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150706_Oscars_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "government waste", "published_time": "2015-07-06T17:57:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T19:46:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Rand Paul, The Waste Report, The National Endowment for the Arts, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Science"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc25d\"", "article_summary": "Sen.
