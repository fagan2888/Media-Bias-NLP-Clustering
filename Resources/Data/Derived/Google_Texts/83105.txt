Desperate times call for desperate...Al Gore?

Democrats are reportedly getting close to hitting the panic button on Hillary Clinton's presidential candidacy as the scandal surrounding her possession of top secret, classified information continues to get worse. Bernie Sanders is currently beating Clinton in New Hampshire and Joe Biden looks like he'll be jumping into the race sometime in September.

With Clinton's flailing poll numbers and inevitability failing to pass public scrutiny, apparently Al Gore's people are now looking at the potential for another White House run. Yes, that Al Gore.

Gore, 67, won the popular vote in the 2000 election and has been mentioned as a possible candidate in every contested Democratic primary since then. He instead spent much of the 2000s focused on environmental campaigning and business ventures. He has largely slipped out of public view in more recent years.



But in recent days, “they’re getting the old gang together,” a senior Democrat told BuzzFeed News.



“They’re figuring out if there’s a path financially and politically,” the Democrat said. “It feels more real than it has in the past months.”



The senior Democrat and other sources cautioned not to overstate Gore’s interest. He has not made any formal or informal moves toward running, or even met with his political advisers about a potential run.

Sure, Gore hasn't made any "formal or informal" moves toward running, but technically neither has Biden.

If Gore decides to get into the race, the big question is who Bill Clinton will side with. Will it be his wife? Or his former vice president who he supported back during the 2000 run for the White House?
