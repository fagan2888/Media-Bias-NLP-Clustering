Well apparently \u201cthey\u201d are wrong. In a video for the YouTube channel \u201cMental Floss,\u201d Dr. Aaron Carroll explains that the correlation between foot size and penis length is unsubstantiated by science.\n\n\u201cThere have been many studies on this, amazingly enough, and they fail to find any link between the size of a man\u2019s shoes and the size of a man\u2019s stretched or erect penis,\u201d said Dr. Carroll, who is a Professor of Pediatrics and Assistant Dean for Research Mentoring at Indiana University School of Medicine. \u201cThere\u2019s also no relationship between the size of his penis and the size of his hands, or ears, or anything else for that matter. Looking at his shoes will only tell you about his taste in footwear.\u201d\n\nIn the rest of the clip, entitled \u201c20 Misconceptions About Sex,\u201d Dr. Carroll debunks myths and misconceptions that most of us have heard (and believed) since middle school: Is sex really great exercise? Can women have wet dreams? Can things like sexual position at conception influence the gender of your child? Do men really think about sex every seven seconds? Does the birth control pill cause women to gain weight?\n\nThe answers to all of those questions, and more, are in the video below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sex, facts, 20, misconceptions, you, probably, thought, were, true, about, sex", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Do men really think about sex every 7 seconds?
