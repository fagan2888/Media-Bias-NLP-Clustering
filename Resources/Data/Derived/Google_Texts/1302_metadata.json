Rather, they\u2019re a reflection of the relative political power of physician lobbies like the Pennsylvania Medical Society vs. nurse practitioner groups.\n\nThis isn\u2019t anybody\u2019s favorite election year issue, but it matters a great deal, and if you read this far then you should ask your local state House and Senate candidates to commit to the anti-shortage position when you next see them out campaigning.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Keystone Politics", "description": "This bill allowing state certified (think about that) nurse practitioners to practice without a doctor's oversight has been introduced by a few Republican legislators, but every single Democrat should be on bill 1063, especially those claiming to be...", "title": "To Address Doctor Shortage, Nurse Practitioners Bill is a Must-Pass", "url": "http://keystonepolitics.com/2014/03/address-doctor-shortage-nurse-practitioners-bill-must-pass/", "image": "http://keystonepolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kp.gif", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KeystonePolitics?fref=ts"}, "fb": {"page_id": 205607432796469, "app_id": 136182523122686}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9436\"", "article_summary": "This bill allowing state certified (think about that) nurse practitioners to practice without a doctor\u2019s oversight has been introduced by a few Republican legislators, but every single Democrat should be on bill 1063, especially those claiming to be progressives.\nSo every time they provide primary care service to a patient, regardless of whether a doctor even saw that patient, they have to kick a cut of the money they earned upstairs to the MD.\nRather, they\u2019re a reflection of the relative political power of physician lobbies like the Pennsylvania Medical Society vs. nurse practitioner groups.\nAcross the United States, \u201cscope of practice\u201d laws vary wildly from state to state, so they don\u2019t really have a basis in any kind of legitimate policy considerations.\nThis needlessly increases health care prices, and it\u2019s purely a rent-seeking scheme cooked up by the physician lobby."}
