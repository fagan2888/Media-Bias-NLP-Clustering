The first was $29.5 million for a 112,600-square-foot building in Skokie, according to Cook County property records. The second purchase was $131 million for a nine-building portfolio, said Peter Westmeyer, president and managing principal of MB Real Estate Healthcare Group.\n\nIllinois Bone & Joint Institute, a network of orthopedic specialists including more than 90 doctors in 20 Chicago-area locations, occupies more than half the space in the nine-building portfolio. That was the deal's main draw, Westmeyer said.\n\n\u201cWe try to partner with premier health care providers like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThen there is hospital tenants in a number of the buildings.\u201d\n\nThe nine buildings are 95 percent occupied, he said. Other tenants include Advocate Health Care, Resurrection Health Care, Metro Infectious Disease Consultants, NorthShore University HealthSystem and Pain Specialists of Greater Chicago.\n\nThat same desire for high retention rates and creditworthy tenants drew MB Real Estate to the Skokie deal, Westmeyer said. The building, 9933, 9955, 9977 Woods Drive, is 70 percent occupied by NorthShore University HealthSystem.\n\nRELIABLE INVESTMENTS\n\nMedical office buildings have become very reliable among real estate investments, said Kevin Tyler, a health care analyst at Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach, Calif.-based real estate research firm. And they tend to be less vulnerable to swings in the economy than other property types.\n\n\u201cDoctors in general tend to be a little stickier than other real estate tenants because they have a patient population that knows where their business is and is used to coming to their location on a regular basis,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cYou get a very stable operation . . . and as a landlord, you can drive constant revenue increases.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act also has boosted demand for office space, Tyler said. The law has increased the insured population, and a push toward more outpatient procedures has put an emphasis on satellite locations and outpatient facilities.\n\nCouple that with the aging baby boomers, and you have \u201ca very hot market,\u201d Tyler said.\n\n\"For medical and health care providers, the spaces they typically occupy they typically don't leave, they're in there for a long time,\u201d said Gino Lollio, associate vice-president in Marcus & Millichap's Healthcare Real Estate Group, which brokered the larger sale. \u201cYou couple that with operational performance and one can understand why investing in the real estate that they occupy is a strong investment for landlord because there's a good chance that they're going to perform well and occupy that space for a long time.\u201d\n\nA partnership comprising multiple Illinois Bone & Joint Institute physicians and a local developer owned the nine-building portfolio. Lollio represented the sellers in the sale with John Smelter, senior director of Marcus & Millichap's Healthcare Real Estate Group, and Associate Vice President Scott Niedergang.\n\nMichael Bennett, managing director at Chicago-based real estate firm HFF, represented the seller of the Skokie building, Chicago-based Development Resources. An executive from Development Resources did not return calls.\n\nThe nine-building portfolio in the $131 million sale is made up of:\n\n\u2022 7055 High Grove Ave., Burr Ridge\n\n\u2022 2923 N.
