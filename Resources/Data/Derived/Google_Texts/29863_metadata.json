In October of 2014, Dash said Louisiana minority voters under the Affordable Heath Care Act adopted a \u201cplantation mentality.\u201d In February of 2015, Dash apologized for what she called a \u201cfailed attempt at humor\u201d when she referred to rape victims as \u201cthe ones who like to be naughty might go out and play and and get hurt.\u201d\n\nIn what comes as a uncharacteristic move for the conservative pundit, Dash disagreed with Geraldo Rivera\u2019s statement that \u201cHip Hop has done more damage to black and brown people than racism in the last 10 years.\u201d While appearing on Fox\u2019s The Five, Dash offered the following:\n\n\u201cI love Geraldo, but I disagree. Coming from a Hip Hop family\u2014my cousin is Damon Dash, and he started Roc-A-Fella Records with Jay Z\u2014I know that this is a way for men to legitimize their lives. It sells, and it makes money, and it\u2019s capitalist.\u201d\n\nAfter her \u201cplantation\u201d comments, Dash told Net-A-Porter some of her family members disowned her for her political views.
