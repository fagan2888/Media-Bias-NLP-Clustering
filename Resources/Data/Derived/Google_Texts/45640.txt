Opera Solutions to provide operational analytics under $28M CMS contract

Opera Solutions has won a $28 million contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to provide operational analytics for the Health Insurance Marketplaces under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

In addition to the operational analytics, Opera Solutions will evaluate issuers’ claims, revenue, and profit to help CMS make appropriate decisions in regard to the three risk-sharing programs of health insurance, which the company said are risk adjustment, reinsurance and risk corridors.

“Big Data and advanced analytics are improving healthcare beyond clinical decision support. They are improving operational efficiency and ensuring claim accuracy,” said Pieter Schouten, executive vice president of Healthcare at Opera Solutions.

This contract continues a three year relationship between Opera Solutions and CMS.
