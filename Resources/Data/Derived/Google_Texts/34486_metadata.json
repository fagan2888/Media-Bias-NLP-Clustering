The public is learning more every day about its nature as a virus and as a public health contagion. Doctors and researchers are working with extreme urgency to get out ahead of it.\n\nBut perhaps because the disease is so overwhelming \u2013 the symptoms, the mortality rate, the social horror it precipitates, the prospect of vast human devastation \u2013 we have a strange collective blind-spot about the term itself: Where exactly does the name come from? What does it mean?\n\nEnglish professor to the rescue!\n\nThe connotations of Ebola are graphic, grisly, disheartening. The images we associate with the word are grotesquely incontinent, nearly alien bodies in the throes of a violent death; or the hazmat suits, worn by the few available healthcare providers, looking as though they\u2019re designed for Chernobyl, or outer space.\n\nThe visuals convey fear: Stay far away, and pray that this horror doesn\u2019t come anywhere near us. Maps depict no-go zones, quarantine sectors, proximate areas at risk. There has been some degree of sympathy for those who suffer the disease, and this has translated into somewhat significant levels of material support to treat victims, ease their suffering and halt the spread \u2014 but only recently. Dr. Kent Brantly, the American doctor who contracted (and was subsequently cured of) Ebola, himself noted that the world\u2019s attention for the plight of Africans was relatively minimal, and slow in developing, until two white people came down with it. In the minds of non-Africans \u2014 and to our great discredit \u2014 the disease seems to be construed largely as exotic, as foreign, as defined primarily by its \u201cother\u201d-ness.\n\nLooking at Ebola as something explicitly distant may provide people a sense of protective safety from this deadly disease. President Obama, after visiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this week, said that while it was crucial for the United States to help contain Ebola, the chances of it spreading here are \u201cextremely low.\u201d A White House fact sheet announces: \u201cU.S. health professionals agree it is highly unlikely that we would experience an Ebola outbreak here in the United States, given our robust health care infrastructure and rapid response capabilities.\u201d The subtext is that this is not our problem.\n\n\u201cEbola.\u201d\n\nWhat are we saying, and hearing, when we invoke this term? It\u2019s interesting to think about where names and words come from, and their meanings \u201cmutate\u201d (as the virus itself, in a worst-case scenario, might also mutate into something that is transmittable even more robustly than it is now). I don\u2019t mean to distract attention from the human tragedy taking place, but it\u2019s interesting to think about how the language we use frames our experience of this contagion.\n\nIn 1976, two outbreaks of this ravaging viral disease that had never been seen before were recorded in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Sudan. The Zaire outbreak took place at Yambuku, an isolated village deep in the rain forest, in the north of the country near the Ebola River, a small and winding tributary of the Congo River. About 600 people were infected altogether, with a mortality rate reaching as high as 90 percent.\n\nThere have been about a dozen subsequent eruptions of Ebola. Half of them led to a few hundred deaths each, while the others were smaller in scope. Now, the largest outbreak ever seen is growing exponentially, catastrophically. Some forecast that hundreds of thousands of people might catch the virus before it is brought under control, which could take over a year. The area of vulnerability has expanded greatly across West Africa: Liberia will likely suffer an enormous toll as the virus rages through densely populated urban areas. Guinea and Sierra Leone continue to be battered, and Nigeria and Senegal are starting to see cases as well.\n\nI think most people are unaware that the name given to the virus specifically refers to the Ebola River, which seems to be a fairly obscure landmark, at least as far as the Internet is concerned: Besides its location and the fact that it lent its name to this illness, Google has virtually nothing to say about the river.\n\nBut whether or not we are aware of the Ebola River, the name nevertheless sounds recognizably African, with its long vowels and crisp, hard rhythmic consonants. In meter, Ebola is an \u201camphibrach.\u201d Less common to students of English poetry than dactyls, iambs, trochees and anapests, an amphibrach is a word with a stressed syllable sandwiched between two unstressed syllables. English words like \u201cpersistent\u201d and \u201ctogether\u201d have this pattern. African (and African-origin) words and names are more commonly amphibrachic: \u201cUganda,\u201d \u201cinjera,\u201d \u201cbanana,\u201d \u201cimpala,\u201d \u201ckalimba,\u201d \u201cmacaque,\u201d \u201cmerengue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Americans talk about Ebola, they're reinforcing dangerous cultural attitudes that do much more harm than good", "title": "The problem with \u201cEbola\u201d: The troubling, xenophobic language of disease", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "When Americans talk about Ebola, they're reinforcing dangerous cultural attitudes that do much more harm than good", "title": "The problem with \u201cEbola\u201d: The troubling, xenophobic language of disease", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/28/the_problem_with_ebola_the_troubling_xenophobic_language_of_disease/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/ebola_virus.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When Americans talk about Ebola, they're reinforcing dangerous cultural attitudes that do much more harm than good", "title": "The problem with \u201cEbola\u201d: The troubling, xenophobic language of disease", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/ebola_virus.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Randy Malamud", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Culture, ebola, Editor's Picks, Language, Racism, West Africa, Xenophobia", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe91\"", "article_summary": "But whether or not we are aware of the Ebola River, the name nevertheless sounds recognizably African, with its long vowels and crisp, hard rhythmic consonants.\nLooking at Ebola as something explicitly distant may provide people a sense of protective safety from this deadly disease.\nThe Zaire outbreak took place at Yambuku, an isolated village deep in the rain forest, in the north of the country near the Ebola River, a small and winding tributary of the Congo River.\nTopics: Culture, ebola, Editor's Picks, Language, Racism, West Africa, Xenophobia, Sustainability News, News\u201cEbola.\u201dIt\u2019s on everyone\u2019s lips in the media, in the medical establishment, in communities around the world.\nhealth professionals agree it is highly unlikely that we would experience an Ebola outbreak here in the United States, given our robust health care infrastructure and rapid response capabilities.\u201d The subtext is that this is not our problem."}
