That\u2019s in sharp contrast to the closest Senate races, most of which are in states Obama lost and where he remains highly unpopular.\n\nDemocratic governor candidates also are better shielded from Obama\u2019s policies than Democratic candidates for Senate, whose votes can directly advance the president\u2019s agenda. With Obama\u2019s approval ratings at the lowest of his presidency, Democrats in tight Senate contests have distanced themselves. One called him irrelevant; another refused to say whether she even voted for him.\n\nHis team privately bristles at some of the snubs, but Obama has abided by the candidates\u2019 wishes, staying away while still raising millions for the party\u2019s Senate fundraising arm.\n\n\u201cIn Senate races, voters are looking through the lens of federal politics, and voters are getting a president with the lowest approval of his presidency right now,\u201d said Nathan Daschle, a former executive director of the Democratic Governors\u2019 Association.\n\nGovernors aren\u2019t necessarily viewed through that same lens, Daschle said, and can use the president more tactically to turn out key blocs of voters, particularly African-Americans and young people.\n\n\u201cThe reality is the president still has a great relationship with very important blocs of voters and for a lot of them he is really the only person who can turn them out,\u201d Daschle said. \u201cSo for governors it makes a lot of sense because you can bring all the positive values of this president without the negatives.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials argue that ensuring that states are run by Democratic governors can be as important to Obama\u2019s agenda as retaining Democratic control of the Senate.\n\n\u201cA lot of the important policy making is happening at the state level,\u201d White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said. \u201cYou see this with minimum wage, access to health care, early childhood education.\u201d\n\nState action has been a crucial element of Obama\u2019s health care law. Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have so far agreed to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But 21 states, most of them governed by Republicans, have not. Two are considering it.\n\nObama also has been pushing for a federal increase in the minimum wage, without success. But since the beginning of the year, 10 states and the District of Columbia have enacted minimum wage raises.\n\nStill, Obama\u2019s emphasis on governor races is relatively recent. His fundraising over the year has been focused on the Democratic Party and the party\u2019s House and Senate money committees. He has held only one fundraiser for the Democratic Governors\u2019 Association.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama\u2019s fundraising for the national party benefits Democrats up and down the ballot, including governors. \u201cWe also anticipate that the events that the president will be hosting over the course of next week will also significantly benefit those campaigns as well,\u201d he said.\n\nObama has already made campaign appearances for Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn and for Maryland gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown \u2014 as with the others, Obama won in those states as well.\n\nNotably, Obama will not campaign on behalf of Democrat Martha Coakley who is running behind in her race for governor in Massachusetts, even though Obama won the state in 2012 by 23 percentage points. Obama did stump for Coakley in 2010 when she ran for Senate against Republican Scott Brown, a race she lost and one many Democrats believe she botched after being in the lead.\n\nObama is not headed for Florida either, where Republican Gov. Rick Scott is locked in a bitter and tight race with former Gov. Charlie Crist, who served as a Republican but is now running as a Democrat. Obama barely carried the state in 2012 and remains a polarizing figure in Florida.\n\nStill, Republicans worry that Crist is gaining a lead on Scott and that Scott can\u2019t benefit from anti-Obama sentiment.\n\n\u201cIn focus group after focus group, they can\u2019t stand the president, but they don\u2019t think it matters in the governor\u2019s race,\u201d said Republican pollster Wes Anderson whose firm is advising Scott. \u201cWe would benefit from a hot Senate race on top of us in Florida.\u201d\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.
