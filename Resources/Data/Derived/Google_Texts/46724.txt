The Imagin8 show is at the Zarrow Center and free to everyone.

The Tulsa Girls Art School is a non-profit after-school art program that trains some Tulsa Public School students to be visual artists.

The young artists got to display their work at the Zarrow Center in the Brady District.

Melissa Garcia is nine years old and brand new to the Tulsa Girls Art School, and very proud of the work she's already done.

"I wanted to be creative on this one," Garcia said.

This is the Girls Art School winter show. It's called Imagin8, and includes art work from 45 girls ages 8 to 17.

Lauryn McConnell is ten and this is her second year; she's already sold one of her paintings.

Each girl has a micro savings account, so she'll get to keep 30 percent from the sale. She can use that money for educational materials or field trips.

She sold her abstract, different shapes and bright colors. The buyer asked how she thought he ought to display it.

"I would like it sideways," McConnell said.

This is the seventh year of the Tulsa Girls Art School, so some of the older students have been involved since the beginning, and you can see what they've accomplished.

Tulsa artist Matt Moffett is the executive director of the school and said the idea is to allow the kids to develop as young artists.

"How far can a kid go if they have all the tools they need," Moffett said.

That's the concept, give these young people professional instruction and the supplies they need, and see where it leads.

"I think these girls are dreamers. I want them to be better and bigger dreamers," said Moffett.

The showing at the Zarrow Center is free and open through most of February.
