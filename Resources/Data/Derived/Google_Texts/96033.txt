A 58-year-old northeast Kansas man is dead after the dump truck he was driving ran off the road and into a cornfield.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports Edward Howard Hollingdale of Holton was pulling a corn hauler trailer on Saturday when the truck left K-9 highway near Netawaka.

Jackson County Sheriff Tim Morse says the truck was found "deep inside the cornfield" and the driver was unresponsive.

Hollingdale was declared dead at the scene.

The sheriff says the driver and his truck had been missing for a short period of time after he failed to arrive at his destination in Whiting.
