In their latest attempt to help usher in Hillary Clinton, they sent forth their unqualified, two-time loser Mitt Romney to hypocritically attack Donald Trump. That was proceeded by anti-American Obama minion Paul Ryan giving Barack Obama everything that he wanted and more when he helped push through an omnibus bill that places $2 trillion deficit on the backs of The American people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, don\u2019t forget that\n\nMitch McConnell\u2019s father-in-law being busted for cocaine onboard one of his ships\n\nonly helps things further things along.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those that did not know, it was Mitt Romney and his top advisor\n\nJonathan Gruber\n\nwho were the ones responsible for the unconstitutional RomneyCare, which you know now to be the blueprint for ObamaCare (Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMIT professor Jonathan Gruber, who advised both Romney and President Obama on their health care reform plans, told the Washington Post\u2019s Jennifer Rubin that without Romney\u2019s plan, and more specifically, that plan\u2019s individual mandate, President Obama never could have gotten his plan through Congress:\n\nHe says that as the federal health care plan emerged, the Massachusetts plan was \u201cwidely discussed.\u201d [\u2026]\n\n\n\nIn his opinion, without the Massachusetts plan, the federal individual mandate plan wouldn\u2019t have garnered acceptance and gotten through. \u201cIt was huge,\u201d Gruber says, to have the Massachusetts plan to point to. And without it, he thinks \u201cit\u2019s likely\u201d ObamaCare wouldn\u2019t have become law.\n\n\n\nMitt Romney is also a pro-sodomite supporter (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:24) and an advocate for the murder of the innocent in the womb (Proverbs 6:17). I know that is not what he said, but friends it is what he did (Matthew 7:16).\n\n\n\nWhile the attempt to further divide and conquer continues by adding more confusion (Daniel 9:8), Harry Reid from has now demanded that Paul Ryan denounce his support for Trump, who is said to be in support of the KKK because David Duke supports Trump. How does that work?\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nConfused yet? You should be! It is all by design.\n\nAmerica, it is the Democratic Party that is responsible for the creation of the KKK!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, America, we have one Constitution, not two! We are ruled by Law, not party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension, is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution.\u201d \u2013President John Adams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, remember that every single one of these players is an outlaw when it comes to the enumerated laws of our Constitutional Republic. Every single one of them!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are the American people confused?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident James Garfield quickly brought this to resolve when he said,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNow more than ever before, the people are responsible for the character of their Congress. If that body be ignorant, reckless, and corrupt, it is because the people tolerate ignorance, recklessness and corruption.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy aren\u2019t these (effeminate thugs) representatives calling for the indictment of Bill and Hillary Clinton? It is not like they have to speculate when it comes to the list of crimes committed against the American people when it comes to the Clintons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that just recently it was found that the\n\nClintons are selling Uranium Ore\n\nto the\n\nRussians from underneath the ranchers in Oregon\n\n.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nWhy are they not bringing this to light (Ephesians 5:11)?\n\nWhat of the Travelgate scandal? Whitewater scandal? Filegate scandal? Lootergate scandal? Drug Dealer Donor scandal? Ponzi scheme and political favor scandal? Benghazi? The email scandal? Mena, Arkansas drug trafficking scandal? What of the dead bodies strewn across the path of the Clintons (147) and the list goes on and on concerning who Hillary is and what she is truly about.\n\n\n\nWhy are they not calling her out America? To call out Hilary for these would be the same as exposing themselves in so many different ways. Just look at their records. They are just as guilty as she is, and that is exactly why they are attempting to protect her.\n\n\n\nAmerica, it stands true, these are protecting themselves against those who are raising some serious threats to the ground (the establishment) that they mean to hold. It is vital that these usher Hilary in so that things remain the same.\n\n\n\nWe were warned by George Mason in Article 3 of Virginia\u2019s Declaration of Rights:\n\n\n\nThat government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit, protection, and security of the people, nation or community; of all the various modes and forms of government that is best, which is capable of producing the greatest degree of happiness and safety and is most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration; and that, whenever any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these purposes, a majority of the community hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish it, in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal.\n\n\n\nWake-up!
