You must repay your loans even if you drop out of college or can't find a job\u2014or just think in hindsight the education was nowhere near worth the average $33,000 in loans that 2014's graduating class take home with their diplomas, according to an analysis of government data by Mark Kantrowitz of Edvisors.\n\n\n\nRelated: Free Online College Tuition for Starbucks Baristas\n\nThere are income-based repayment plans\u2014which President Obama has been pushing in an effort to lessen the debt load as wages continue to stagnate and job opportunities remain scarce\u2014and deferment is an option if you lose your job or experience another kind of financial hardship. Refinancing student loans may also lower your payments.\n\nBut most student-loan holders have to pay the piper eventually\u2014except for those who may qualify for true student loan forgiveness. Could that be you?\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau revealed last year that many of the estimated 25 percent of the U.S. workforce employed by a public service employer \"may be eligible for existing student loan repayment benefits.\"It pays to understand the circumstances that might lead to your loans being classified by the federal government as eligible for being forgiven, canceled or discharged.\n\nThe most important thing to know is this: Student loan forgiveness programs cover many types of federal student loans\u2014including Direct Loans, Perkins Loans and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans, such as the Stafford loans\u2014but there is no dedicated student loan forgiveness program for private student loans. In addition, the forgiveness programs vary depending on the type of federal loan\u2014some apply only to Direct loans and others only to Perkins loans, for example.\n\nRelated: North Dakota Oil Boom Now Pays for College\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education provides a reference chart covering all of the conditions that may lead to cancellation of a loan and covering all the types of federal loans, as well as links to the applications that must be completed. Here are the basics:For the Direct Loan, FFEL program and Perkins loans, the following conditions can result in 100 percent student loan forgiveness:\n\nTotal or permanent disability or death (also referred to as discharge rather than forgiveness).\n\nBankruptcy (though only in rare cases).\n\nSchool of attendance closing before graduation.\n\nFalse certification of loan by school.\n\n\n\n\n\nTeacher Forgiveness\n\nThe most certain way to qualify for student loan forgiveness is to work as a teacher, in the public service sector or for a nonprofit organization.If you are a full-time teacher for five consecutive years in a designated elementary or secondary school or educational service agency serving students from low-income families, you can qualify for up to $5,000 (up to $17,500 for elementary/secondary special education teachers and secondary math and science teachers) of the total loan amount outstanding after completion of the fifth year of teaching.\n\nRelated: One Man's Uncommon Fix for Outrageous Student Debt\n\nThough note that graduate students and parents of students who hold PLUS Loans do not qualify. Loans with balances taken out prior to October 1998 are not eligible, and your five years of consecutive teaching must have commenced after October 1998. The teacher loan-forgiveness application is available here.\n\nFor Perkins loans holders, cancellation of up to 100 percent of a loan may be granted if you have served full-time in a public or nonprofit elementary or secondary school system as a teacher in a school serving students from low-income families; or are a special education teacher, including teachers of infants, toddlers, children, or youth with disabilities; or a teacher in the fields of mathematics, science, foreign languages or bilingual education, or in any other field of expertise determined by a state education agency to have a shortage of qualified teachers in that state.\n\nThe following formula applies to the cancellation scheduled:\n\n15 percent canceled per year for the first and second years of service.\n\n20 percent canceled for the third and fourth years.\n\n30 percent canceled for the fifth year.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic Service Employees\n\nFor public-service employees generally, the main loan program considered for forgiveness is the Direct Loans\u2014Perkins or FFEL loan holders who work in the public sector and want to qualify would need to consolidate their loans in the Direct Loans program first. PLUS loans for parents and graduate students and/or professional students are part of the Direct Loans program.\n\nRelated: It's Time to Tame the College Admissions Monster\n\nFull-time employment with a federal, state or local government agency, entity or organization, or a not-for-profit organization that has been designated as tax-exempt by the Internal Revenue Service, may qualify you for this program. A private not-for-profit employer that is not a tax-exempt organization can also qualify if they serve the public interest and have no affiliate with labor unions or partisan politics.\n\nThe basic factors to qualify are:\n\nMaking 120 on-time, full, scheduled, monthly payments on your Direct Loans. Only payments made after October 1, 2007, qualify. (Perkins or FFEL loan holders who consolidate into the Direct loan program must start the 120-payment cycle once the loans are consolidated.)\n\nMaking those payments under a qualifying repayment plan.\n\nWhen you make each of those payments, you must be working full-time at a qualifying public-service organization.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must complete the employer certification form and send it to the federal loan servicing agency. The first forgiveness-of-loan balances as of October 1, 2007, will not be granted until October 2017.\n\nRelated: The College Lawsuit That Will Make Your Jaw Drop\n\nFor Perkins loan holders, a chart of the specific public service sector positions that qualify for cancellation\u2014and to what percentage of total loan balance\u2014is available from the Department of Education.\n\nThe authoritative source for all information related to federal student loan forgiveness programs and the criteria considered in applications is the U.S. Department of Education's website section devoted to the details.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Everyone knows the alarming news about student loans: It's grown to become the second-", "title": "The Best Way to Get Your Student Loan Forgiven", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/13/Best-Way-Get-Your-Student-Loan-Forgiven", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04182011_student_loan_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/13/Best-Way-Get-Your-Student-Loan-Forgiven", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04182011_student_loan_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Everyone knows the alarming news about student loans: It's grown to become the second-", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5cd3\"", "article_summary": "The most important thing to know is this: Student loan forgiveness programs cover many types of federal student loans\u2014including Direct Loans, Perkins Loans and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans, such as the Stafford loans\u2014but there is no dedicated student loan forgiveness program for private student loans.\nBut most student-loan holders have to pay the piper eventually\u2014except for those who may qualify for true student loan forgiveness.\n(Perkins or FFEL loan holders who consolidate into the Direct loan program must start the 120-payment cycle once the loans are consolidated.)\nThe authoritative source for all information related to federal student loan forgiveness programs and the criteria considered in applications is the U.S. Department of Education's website section devoted to the details.\nYou must complete the employer certification form and send it to the federal loan servicing agency."}
