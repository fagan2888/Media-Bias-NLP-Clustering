TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (WTHI) – It’s time for that dreaded but inescapable annual job, filing your tax return and one group says you shouldn’t put off the task.

“You’ll get your money back, and a lot of people have bills and they want to get the bills paid,” said Pat Tovey, an Agent with Wabash Tax Service.

Before filing you should be aware of a few changes as a result of the Affordable Care Act.

“The IRS will probably send out an excess of a million letters saying if you have health insurance you will be required to prove it,” said Tovey.

Those who are covered will be required to fill out a new form.

“It’s an 89-65 and an 89-62, those are the forms you have to fill out and they’re not easy,” explained Tovey.

There are some who are exempt.

“If you’re head of household and your income is below $13050 you’re exempt. If you’re a single person and you make less than $10,150 you do not have to carry health insurance.”

If you’re not exempt and don’t have health insurance be prepared to pay the price.

“Its $95 per adult and $47 per child in a home,” said Tovey.

It’s called an individual shared responsibility payment, and the penalty could continue to rise in the future.

“Yes it doubles next year,” said Tovey.

So this year he suggests using a professional to avoid complications.
