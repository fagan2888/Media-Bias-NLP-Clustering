DOVER, DE – Commissioner Karen Weldin Stewart announced today that the Department of Insurance has posted the recent rate request filings from Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware, Aetna Health Inc., and Aetna Life Insurance Co. on the DOI website at http://www.delawareinsurance.gov/departments/rates/ratefilings.shtml.

The rate postings also provide access to the insurers’ justifications for the requests and other supporting data offered by Highmark and Aetna. The Affordable Care Act requires insurers seeking rate increases over 10% to supply such information, which can also be accessed at the Rate Review page at www.Healthcare.gov.

DOI announced last week that Highmark is asking for a 25.4% increase in the individual market, and Aetna requests a 16% increase. In the small group market, Highmark seeks a 12.7% increase, while Aetna asks for a 6.1% decrease.

Commissioner Stewart also announced last week that DOI will conduct public information sessions to receive comment on the proposed rate increases. Detailed information on time and location of the sessions follows:
