He\u2019s hot, he\u2019s fresh, he\u2019s burning up the polls, he\u2019s \u2026 John Kasich. Yeah. That guy. The guy you forget is running for president until each new debate rolls around and you\u2019re like \u201coh yeah, John Kasich.\u201d Up to this point, the Ohio governor\u2019s most lasting achievement on the campaign trail was bumping Rick Perry from the prime-time debate stage and dooming his campaign to an early, ignominious termination. Kasich has been spending his campaign huddled in New Hampshire, preaching a positive, results-oriented campaign message that is designed to draw independents. And, according to a slew of recent polls, it\u2019s starting to pay off at just the right moment.\n\nThe RealClearPolitics polling average shows that Kasich now holds a narrow lead in the jumbled race for second place in New Hampshire, having overtaken Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and Marco Rubio in the last month. He\u2019s a bit of a weirdo \u2013 he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt this week that \u201cI consider myself the Prince of Light and Hope\u201d \u2013 but New Hampshire is a weird state, and Kasich can at least claim to offer something different than what the other candidates are selling. He\u2019s the closest thing the GOP race has to a moderate, what with his Medicaid expanding and refusals to rip up the Iran nuclear deal on day one (though he\u2019s still an antiabortion rights nut and a fan of wildly regressive tax policies, so \u201cmoderate\u201d is kind of a misnomer). And he\u2019s actually running the relentlessly positive campaign Jeb Bush pretends to be running when he\u2019s not spending millions on attack ads. And right now Kasich-mentum looks like it might be on the rise.\n\nIf that is the case and Kasich really is gaining traction less than three weeks from the primary, that\u2019s bad news for the segment of the Republican Party that wants to keep Donald Trump or Ted Cruz from becoming the nominee. New Hampshire is supposed to be the redoubt of establishment Republicans, and while Trump has been dominating the polls, the fight for second place is seen as critical to the establishment\u2019s hopes of preventing the race from turning into a two-man fight between Trump and Cruz. If the right establishment candidate finishes a strong second in New Hampshire, the thinking goes, then he\u2019ll have momentum, and that momentum will help him win South Carolina, and then the party unites behind him and he eventually triumphs over the Trump/Cruz insurgency. That\u2019s the incredibly risky plan establishment darling Marco Rubio has sketched out, at any rate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "To stop Trump and Cruz, the GOP establishment needs a New Hampshire breakthrough, and John Kasich could spoil it", "author": "Simon Maloy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "To stop Trump and Cruz, the GOP establishment needs a New Hampshire breakthrough, and John Kasich could spoil it", "title": "Kasich\u2019s rise is bad news for the GOP: How the Ohio governor\u2019s surge could actually derail any hope of thwarting Trump and Cruz", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/22/kasichs_rise_is_bad_news_for_the_gop_how_the_ohio_governors_surge_could_actually_derail_any_hope_of_thwarting_trump_and_cruz/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/cruz_kasich_trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "To stop Trump and Cruz, the GOP establishment needs a New Hampshire breakthrough, and John Kasich could spoil it", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/cruz_kasich_trump.jpg", "title": "Kasich\u2019s rise is bad news for the GOP: How the Ohio governor\u2019s surge could actually derail any hope of thwarting Trump and Cruz", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Kasich\u2019s rise is bad news for the GOP: How the Ohio governor\u2019s surge could actually derail any hope of thwarting Trump and Cruz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, 2016 GOP primary, 2016 Republican primary, Donald Trump, John Kasich, New Hampshire primary, new hampshire republicans, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s hot, he\u2019s fresh, he\u2019s burning up the polls, he\u2019s \u2026 John Kasich.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, 2016 GOP primary, 2016 Republican primary, Donald Trump, John Kasich, New Hampshire primary, new hampshire republicans, Ted Cruz, Elections News, News, Politics NewsDon\u2019t look now, but there\u2019s a new candidate on the rise in New Hampshire.\nAnd he\u2019s actually running the relentlessly positive campaign Jeb Bush pretends to be running when he\u2019s not spending millions on attack ads.\nKasich has been spending his campaign huddled in New Hampshire, preaching a positive, results-oriented campaign message that is designed to draw independents.\nAnd, according to a slew of recent polls, it\u2019s starting to pay off at just the right moment."}
