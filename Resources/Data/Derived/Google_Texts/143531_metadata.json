The mountain region, which consists of 15 counties bisecting the middle of the state, had the second highest cost at $69,000.\n\nBy contrast, the cost averaged $39,000 in a nine-county Denver region and $41,000 in a three-county area that includes Colorado Springs. Still, the results were not crystal clear. Costs in southeast Colorado, also rural, were not nearly as high as the northeast.\n\nGenerally, the study\u2019s findings are reflective of disparities in health care costs across Colorado that have not changed under the Affordable Care Act. Private health insurance premiums in the Colorado mountains have been among the nation\u2019s highest for several years, and efforts by the state to lower those costs in rural areas have had little impact.\n\nThe CIVHC study found the commercial price for a hip and a knee replacement in northeast Colorado is more than three times the Medicare reimbursement, which averaged $23,000. That reimbursement \u2014 the amount Medicare pays for the procedures for seniors covered by the federal insurance program \u2014 varied slightly from region to region but also averaged about $23,000. CIVHC and hospital officials agree that more study is needed to understand why charges vary so much from place to place within the state.\n\nA shortage of medical providers in rural areas may account for some of the regional variations, but the complete answer is undoubtedly complicated, said Jonathan Mathieu, CIVHC\u2019s vice president for research and compliance.\n\nHe said such comparisons help because \u201cthe increasing cost of health care is unaffordable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t understand what we don\u2019t measure, and we can\u2019t fix what we don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nAt the Colorado Hospital Association, \u201cit is widely accepted that there are significant cost variations in health care and that more progress in understanding the drivers of that variation is needed,\u201d spokeswoman Cara Welch said. \u201c(The association) believes that the release of the summary data by CIVHC should be the start of the conversation, not the end of it.\u201d\n\nSoutheast Colorado, while largely rural and agricultural like the northeast, averaged $44,000 for a hip and knee \u2014 $34,000 less than in northeast Colorado. The commercial cost averaged $48,000 on the Western Slope.\n\nThe CIVHC study suggested Colorado could learn from Medicare\u2019s comprehensive joint replacement program, which encourages hospitals, doctors and post-surgery therapists to work together from hospitalization through recovery.\n\nIn 2014, more than 24,300 Colorado residents received a new hip or knee, and the state\u2019s over-65 population is projected to more than double in the next 15 years.\n\n\u201cReducing Medicare and commercial price variation could result in significant savings now and in the future and provides a prime opportunity for Colorado to improve care and lower costs,\u201d the study says.\n\nWhile commercial costs can drive up insurance premiums, many patients have little idea of the actual charges for their surgeries.\n\nBob Howard, whose wife underwent knee surgery recently, took her to the Sky Ridge Medical Center south of Denver on her doctor\u2019s recommendation. She is eligible for Medicare, and the couple pays Kaiser Permanente for supplemental insurance.\n\n\u201cThe only cost to us so far under our plan has been $450 we paid to the hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, he would like to see more information about variations in medical prices. \u201cIf you were going to buy a car, you\u2019d look at several places,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CIVHC study also reported that the median commercial price varied from $18,000 to $40,000 for a hip replacement and from $19,000 to $48,000 for a knee replacement at different Colorado hospitals, without post-surgery costs. It did not name the hospitals but expects to release that information this year.\n\nCIVHC undertook its study after a recent national report that places such as Grand Junction had low Medicare costs but high-priced commercial claims. Generally, higher commercial prices drive higher insurance rates. The center previously reported that surgery costs vary significantly from hospital to hospital, but not by regions of the state.\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or @dolingerdp\n\nHigh surgery costs\n\nA recent study by the Center for Improving Value in Health Care found large disparities across Colorado in the combined cost of a knee and hip replacement.\n\nNortheast \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. $78,000\n\nMountain \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. $69,000\n\nWestern Slope \u2026\u2026.. $48,000\n\nSoutheast \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. $44,000\n\nColorado Springs \u2026.. $41,000\n\nDenver \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. $39,000", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Surgery study finds costs vary greatly by region in Colorado", "title": "Surgery study finds costs vary greatly by region in Colorado", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/14/surgery-study-finds-costs-vary-greatly-by-region-in-colorado/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160214_101928_20151222__CD02OPERATIONWALK_KO22045-p1.jpg", "height": 446}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160214_101928_20151222__CD02OPERATIONWALK_KO22045-p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-14T20:52:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T03:25:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Generally, the study\u2019s findings are reflective of disparities in health care costs across Colorado that have not changed under the Affordable Care Act.\nWhile commercial costs can drive up insurance premiums, many patients have little idea of the actual charges for their surgeries.\nBy contrast, the cost averaged $39,000 in a nine-county Denver region and $41,000 in a three-county area that includes Colorado Springs.\nHe said such comparisons help because \u201cthe increasing cost of health care is unaffordable,\u201d he said.\nThe center previously reported that surgery costs vary significantly from hospital to hospital, but not by regions of the state."}
