The U.S. claims such a sale would violate the United Nations Security Council Resolution governing last year\u2019s nuclear agreement between Iran and various Western powers.\n\nRelated: Move Over, F-35: Russia Has Raised the Stakes for Next-Generation Fighters\n\n\u201cIn terms of the specific reports about the proposed sale of the Sukhoi Su-30SM multi-role fighter jets, for example, we would almost certainly veto such a sale, as provision of such equipment to Iran would further exacerbate existing tensions in the region,\u201d Toner told the Free Beacon.\n\nU.N. Security Council Resolution 2231 \u201cprohibits the sale to Iran of specified categories of conventional arms as defined for the purposes of the U.N. Register of Conventional Arms, without approval in advance on a case-by-case basis by the U.N. Security Council,\u201d he added.\n\nThat \u201cincludes the Su-30SM fighter,\u201d according to Toner.\n\nThe warplane, which was part of Moscow\u2019s arsenal in its aggressive air campaign in Syria, is comparable to the American F-15E Strike Eagle fighter-bomber.\n\nRussia\u2019s uptick in arms sales to Iran in the wake of the nuclear deal, and to other countries including China, has caused serious consternation in Washington. The Obama administration views the moves as part of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s scheme to make Russia a superpower again, as well as a way to fill the Kremlin\u2019s coffers after years of international economic sanctions and recent low oil prices.\n\nRelated: Is the US Facing a \u2018Fighter Gap\u2019 With China and Russia?\n\nFor now, it seems, the State Department is not taking issue with Russia\u2019s separate deal with Iran for the S-300 air defense missile system. The countries signed an $800 million contract in 2007 for the supply of five air-to-ground missile systems, but the transaction was frozen in 2010 due to U.N. sanctions.\n\nPutin approved delivery of the air defense missile system in April 2015. The sale is permitted under existing U.N. resolutions because it is considered defensive, according to the State Department.\n\nAs for the fighter jets, since the U.N. resolution pertaining to the deal does include prohibitions on arms sales to and from Iran, the U.S. would likely have to call for a vote in the Security Council to specifically block the transaction.\n\nSuch diplomatic maneuvering would do nothing to improve the frosty relationship that has existed between Washington and Moscow ever since the Kremlin annexed the Crimean peninsula in early 2014.\n\nRelated: Russia\u2019s Military Buildup Continues with Big New Fighter Jet Order\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear if a Security Council vote would go Washington\u2019s way. Other countries that were part of the nuclear agreement negotiations -- like China, already a buyer of Russian military hardware -- are eager to do more business with Iran, which wants to boost its military capability after decades of sanctions. Beijing might side with Russia in order to facilitate arms deals of its own in the future.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S. is ready to step in to prevent Russia from selling advanced fighter jets to Iran.", "title": "Russia Wants to Sell Advanced Fighter Jets to Iran \u2013 and the US Wants to Stop It", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/06/Russia-Wants-Sell-Advanced-Fighter-Jets-Iran-and-US-Wants-Stop-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02192016_Su-30SME_jet_fighter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/06/Russia-Wants-Sell-Advanced-Fighter-Jets-Iran-and-US-Wants-Stop-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02192016_Su-30SME_jet_fighter.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The U.S. is ready to step in to prevent Russia from selling advanced fighter jets to Iran.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The U.S. is ready to step in to prevent Russia from selling advanced fighter jets to Iran.\nRelated: Russia\u2019s Military Buildup Continues with Big New Fighter Jet OrderIt\u2019s also unclear if a Security Council vote would go Washington\u2019s way.\nThat \u201cincludes the Su-30SM fighter,\u201d according to Toner.\nThe U.S. claims such a sale would violate the United Nations Security Council Resolution governing last year\u2019s nuclear agreement between Iran and various Western powers.\nBeijing might side with Russia in order to facilitate arms deals of its own in the future."}
