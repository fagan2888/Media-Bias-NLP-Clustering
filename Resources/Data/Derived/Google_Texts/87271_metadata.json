Her worry is about some 300,000 people around the country in programs like hers who now must quickly find health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThis is what keeps me up at night,\u201d Tanya Case told me earlier this week.\n\nMany of the programs are set to close by law on Dec. 31.\n\nBy then consumers are supposed to be able to enroll in new plans that can\u2019t discriminate against them based on their health status.\n\nBut as problems continue to bog down the federal health insurance marketplace, Healthcare.gov, it\u2019s an open question whether people in the risk pools can get a policy in time.\n\n\u201cThey are very frightened because many of them are undergoing chemotherapy or they\u2019re on high-dollar drugs, and they need to make certain that they have coverage effective Jan. 1,\u201d said Case, who is also chairwoman of the National Association of State Comprehensive Health Insurance Plans, which represents plans in 35 states.\n\n\u201cOne lady expressed to me, \u2018I\u2019m in the middle of chemotherapy, and then I have to deal with this on top of everything else and quite frankly, I\u2019m scared to death.\u2019 That\u2019s what she told me, and you hear that or a version of that quite frequently,\u201d Case said.\n\nPeople like this were supposed to among the biggest winners under the Affordable Care Act because insurers can no longer discriminate based on pre-existing conditions. As a result, the cost for many is expected to go down substantially.\n\nAdvocates say they still hope that will happen despite the current glitches.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in this tough spot right now of guessing whether people will reasonably be able to get through\u201d to purchase insurance on Healthcare.gov, said Stacey Pogue, senior policy analyst for the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe concern is particularly acute in the 36 states that are relying on Healthcare.gov to process insurance enrollments. The other states and the District of Columbia are running their own marketplaces.\n\nA spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the agency believes that there is enough time for individuals in the high-risk pools to sign up by Dec. 15 for coverage that begins Jan. 1.\n\nFederal officials have pledged that Healthcare.gov will be fixed by the end of November. But even if they are true to their word, Pogue said, that would only give consumers two weeks to choose a plan and enroll.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know yet whether it\u2019s reasonable,\u201d Pogue said.\n\nTexas is one of 14 states that plan to close its high-risk pool by Jan. 1, according to Case\u2019s group. Texas gives its insurance commissioner a bit of discretion to certify that insurance options are \u201creasonably available\u201d before the state plan shuts down, Pogue said.\n\nA federal program set up under the Affordable Care Act that serves much the same purpose (and funds Oklahoma\u2019s program) will similarly close then. Last week, Indiana became the first state to delay its program\u2019s closure, giving its 6,800 participants another month to find new plans. \u201cThe state of Indiana will ensure that these Hoosiers, who are facing significant health care challenges, maintain their health coverage until the problems with the federal marketplace are resolved,\u201d Republican Gov. Mike Pence said in a statement.\n\nOther states are considering similar moves, Case said.\n\nAlthough some consumers have been successful signing up for new coverage, she said, \u201cI would say that the majority have not been.\u201d\n\nIn California, officials are feeling good about the transition. \u201cThere are no barriers I am aware of with people from California\u2019s high-risk pool or anyone with pre-existing conditions getting covered for January,\u201d said Ken Wood, a senior adviser for Covered California, the state\u2019s insurance marketplace. \u201cBased on the types of calls our service center has received, these individuals were reaching out the first week of October to understand their options and beginning to move through the enrollment process.\u201d\n\nCase said she and her colleagues in other states are encouraging consumers to shop around by calling different insurance companies \u2014 even if they cannot yet enroll on the marketplace website. They can use an online calculator to determine their eligibility for premium subsidies.\n\nThe program Case runs will shut Dec. 31 because it is funded by the federal government. But Oklahoma runs a second program that isn\u2019t set to close right away, she said.\n\nA map of states with high-risk pools for those with pre-existing conditions that deem them medically uninsurable.
