It was a bold move, with a decidedly partisan twist \u2013 the announcement was made on the heels of sweeping Democratic victories in the commonwealth, and the shift was quickly denounced by Virginia Republicans.\n\nBut in Nevada yesterday, we saw a similar announcement under very different political circumstances.\n\nNevada state officials will no longer defend the state\u2019s amendment banning same-sex couples from marrying against legal challenge, both the governor and attorney general\u2019s offices announced Monday. The decision comes in the context of an ongoing challenge to that marriage amendment that is currently before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto is seeking to withdraw a previously filed defense of the marriage amendment in that case. \u201cWhen the Federal District Court decided this case in November 2012, the law regarding treatment of same-sex couples under traditional marriage laws was uncertain,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cBut the legal landscape has since changed.\u201d\n\nIt has, indeed. Since November 2012, for example, the U.S. Supreme Court has struck down the Defense of Marriage Act as unconstitutional.\n\nBut the political landscape has changed, too. Note that the move was initiated by Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, who is a Democrat, but it was also endorsed by Gov. Brian Sandoval, who happens to be a Republican. What\u2019s more, while in Virginia the news came after an election, in Nevada, the shift came in advance of an election \u2013 Sandoval is currently seeking a second term and will be on the 2014 ballot.\n\nT he governor\u2019s spokesperson told BuzzFeed last night, \u201cBased upon the advice of the [state] Attorney General\u2019s office and their interpretation of relevant case law, it has become clear that this case is no longer defensible in court.\u201d\n\nFor context, it\u2019s worth emphasizing that Sandoval is himself a former federal judge, appointed to the federal bench during the Bush/Cheney administration.\n\nNote, this does not mean marriage equality is imminent in Nevada; the legal proceedings will continue despite yesterday\u2019s announcement. It does mean, however, that Nevada\u2019s Republican governor and Democratic attorney general no longer believe the state\u2019s ban on same-sex marriages is defensible in court.\n\nAs for Sandoval, it stands to reason a move like this will undermine his support with the Republican Party\u2019s far-right base, but he\u2019s probably used to that \u2013 the Nevada governor has already embraced Medicaid expansion and created a state-based exchange marketplace to implement the Affordable Care Act in his state.\n\nPolitico recently suggested that Sandoval is \u201carguably doing more to put the Democrats\u2019 signature law into place than any other Republican.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Nevada's Democratic state A.G. is no longer willing to defend the state's ban on marriage equality.
