This is especially so in regard to some of America\u2019s most affluent residents.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a recent study from Nielsen, the media and market research firm. Nielsen\u2019s study focused on the population it calls \u201cmass affluent.\u201d This group lives in households with an estimated $250,000 to $1 million in liquid assets.\n\nThe mass affluent are estimated to control about 26% of the country\u2019s total wealth. Nielsen\u2019s research into the acceptance of mobile banking included members of the Millennial and Baby Boomer generations.\n\nResearchers discovered that resistance to mobile banking extends not only to the less tech-savvy older generation, but also to those in the Millennial group, arguably the most tech-friendly of all generations at present time.\n\nNielsen researchers found that some 27% of mass affluent Millennials check their financial account balances via mobile applications, but only about 18% are willing to transfer funds using this method.\n\nAbout 21% of this Millennials said they\u2019ve experienced problems using mobile banking applications in the past.\n\nWhen researchers delved into the Baby Boomer generation they found that about 20% of this group didn\u2019t know how to use mobile banking apps. This, researchers concluded, might explain why only an estimated 5% of mass affluent Boomers use mobile devices to check their balances.\n\nWhen they do use mobile, Boomers are more likely to use tablets rather than smartphones.\n\nInterestingly, members of both generations were less hesitant to use traditional online banking than mobile applications.\n\nBoomers, Nielsen found, are rather active in online banking with some 92% saying it is their preferred choice for bill paying. More than 65% of mass affluent Millennials say they pay their bills online.\n\nResearchers also delved into the reasons for hesitancy in regard to mobile banking. They found that 67% of Boomers felt they couldn\u2019t trust the method while 71% of Millennials said the same.\n\nThe digital age has also given rise to the creation of alternative payment methods, including Amazon Flexible Payments, Bill Me Later, PayPal and Checkout by Amazon.\n\nNielsen researchers found the most accepted of these options among mass affluent Millennials included Amazon Flexible Payments, Checkout by Amazon and Google Checkout.\n\nMass affluent Boomers are more likely to use Bill Me Later.\n\nWhile mobile banking hasn\u2019t caught on as strongly as the more traditional online option, Nielsen concludes the situation leaves the door open for companies that are able to address the desires and hesitancies of consumers.\n\nGet Free Updates!
