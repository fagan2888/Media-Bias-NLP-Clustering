Those two seemingly opposing forces mask a pent-up, unsatisfied demand for housing that is steadily pushing the average home sale price upward.\n\nDecreasing home sales isn\u2019t a demand problem in Sioux Falls. It\u2019s a supply problem.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re selling what we have at a faster rate, but we can\u2019t sell as many because we don\u2019t have as many,\u201d said Beth Jamison, an agent for Jamison Company Real Estate.\n\nJamison is also president-elect of the REALTOR Association of the Sioux Empire, which tracks housing trends in the metro area.\n\nThe association's February market report shows a drop in new listings from last year. Supply dropped across all categories except homes price over $300,000. The biggest drop was among homes listed between $100,000 to $150,000. The median sales price for a home in Sioux Falls increased to $170,363.\n\nThe association's report describes the level of competition for available homes as \u201cprofound.\u201d\n\nHamilton bought a \u201cfixer-upper\u201d because he wanted something he could personalize. Besides, he said, new homes in his price range lacked character.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t start becoming nicely built and constructed until you are at about $400,000 to $500,000,\u201d Hamilton said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 100-yard-dash to secure good homes [under $150,000].\u201d Marshall Selberg, Lloyd Cos.\n\nFinding new homes at a more affordable price is a struggle, said Harlan TenNaple, a real estate agent with the Solus Real Estate Group. That means that homebuyers such as Hamilton need to look at older homes closer to the core of the city.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have to say builders have built less houses in those lower price ranges for the last two years,\u201d TenNaple said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re also having a hard time finding land to build on, which complicates it even further.\u201d\n\nBuilding homes is more expensive than it used to be, said Steve Van Buskirk, a developer for Van Buskirk Cos. Lots from the company usually go to homes starting at $275,000 or higher.\n\nBuyer expectations have gone up when it comes to what they want in a house\u2019s space and design. Making a new, energy efficient home with quality materials \u2013 all of that stuff adds up, Van Buskirk said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty hard to get to a $100,000 house, no matter how Spartan the amenity package would be,\u201d Van Buskirk said.\n\nHomebuilders in Sioux Falls are less inclined to build for the lower price ranges because the profit margin is shrinking, City Planning Director Mike Cooper said. Materials, labor and even land costs are higher because of the increased demand for homes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just with the growth of the city and the economy that the land costs and development costs have gone up,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nDevelopers are doing what they can in a market that makes it almost impossible to build affordable homes, said Wayne Wagner, housing development director for Affordable Housing Solutions.\n\nBuy Photo The construction site of one of Affordable Housing Solutions affordable, energy efficient houses Friday, March 11, 2016, in Sioux Falls. (Photo: Joe Ahlquist / Argus Leader)\n\nThe Sioux Falls nonprofit builds new homes in the $120,000 to $130,000 range and sells them to families who make 80 percent or less than the median income.\n\nHis organization relies on federal and local funding to make homes affordable as local demand forces development costs \u201cthrough the roof,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the cost of materials or land creating the barrier. Builders of lower-cost homes can struggle sometimes to find workers. Plumbers and electricians will migrate to bigger, more expensive projects for a more stable source of income, Wagner said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because things are good here, but it\u2019s causing housing shortages,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nWagner\u2019s nonprofit can build about 10 homes each construction season, but it\u2019s not even close to meeting the need.\n\nHomes sell before they\u2019re finished.\n\n\u201cWe need to figure out how to expand our programs to do a better job,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nLimited supply has created a rush among first-time homebuyers or anyone else looking for a house in the lower price ranges. The result is quicker decision-making and increased competition.\n\nA good listing that goes up on a Friday afternoon could get multiple offers by dinner time and sell by 9 p.m.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened recently to a $170,000 house in the popular Kingswood neighborhood in western Sioux Falls, TenNaple said.\n\n\u201cIf people waited until getting off work, they were too late.\u201d Harlan TenNaple, Solus Real Estate Group\n\n\u201cIf people waited until getting off work, they were too late,\u201d TenNapel said.\n\nFor potential buyers, it means submitting offers at or above the asking price, keeping daily tabs on the market and being ready to jump at an opportunity.\n\nHamilton felt that pressure when he bought in December, and that\u2019s why he jumped when he saw a house that was asking for less than others in the same neighborhood.\n\n\u201cI think people are getting a little excited with the demand and asking way too much,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cThe houses that are on the market are, in my opinion, way overpriced.\u201d\n\nCompetition can be frustrating for buyers. But it\u2019s the result of a strong market that has continued to buoy home sales, Selberg said.\n\nFor sellers, demand means the standard off-season winter months are fair game.\n\nShanna Knutson, 35, put her home on the market in January, preparing to move her family to the Twin Cities. The house at 2401 Dartmoor Circle sold in three weeks to another family looking for a good neighborhood for kids.\n\n\u201cEspecially considering it was January, things were moving pretty quick,\u201d Knutson said. \u201cWe had a lot of traffic through here.\u201d\n\nReal estate agents hope the market will balance out itself out, but when?\n\nSelberg is confident home builders will respond to market demands, despite the cost of land and materials. Last year, though, the city issued more than triple the building permits for homes worth more than $250,000 than for homes under that threshold.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the weather variable. The recent supply might be obscured by a \u201cphantom market\u201d of sellers who don\u2019t yet have a sign on their front lawn.\n\n\u201cTruly, what do we have for inventory?\u201d Jamison said. \u201cWell, a lot of those houses aren\u2019t all back on the market yet.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, with affordable homes still in short supply, potential buyers should be prepared to sprint.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nFebruary 2016 home sales\n\ncompared to February 2015\n\n9 percent drop in sales\n\n$9,363 increase in median sale price\n\n23 percent drop in available homes for sale\n\n107 fewer homes available between $100,001 and $150,000\n\nRead or Share this story: http://argusne.ws/1pmXMw7", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Housing demand is driving sale prices up and creating a drain on supply", "og": {"site_name": "Argus Leader", "description": "Housing demand is driving sale prices up and creating a drain on supply", "title": "Seller's market: Affordable homes harder to find in Sioux Falls", "url": "http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2016/03/12/buying-home-ready-100-yard-dash/81583284/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/argusleader.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Housing demand is driving sale prices up and creating a drain on supply", "creator": "@argusleader", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b7f708985f77c50e3f101b4202cee963e7af0b3a/c=712-0-3544-2832&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/11/SiouxFalls/SiouxFalls/635933076913765219-0311-Housing-Story-2727.jpg", "title": "Seller's market: Affordable homes harder to find in Sioux Falls", "site": "@argusleader", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=823665884", "fb": {"app_id": 174484999248444}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/ArgusPatrick"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo The construction site of one of Affordable Housing Solutions affordable, energy efficient houses Friday, March 11, 2016, in Sioux Falls.\nDevelopers are doing what they can in a market that makes it almost impossible to build affordable homes, said Wayne Wagner, housing development director for Affordable Housing Solutions.\nHis organization relies on federal and local funding to make homes affordable as local demand forces development costs \u201cthrough the roof,\u201d Wagner said.\nDecreasing home sales isn\u2019t a demand problem in Sioux Falls.\nA three-bedroom ranch home in central Sioux Falls had been on the market only hours, and cars were already lined up out front."}
