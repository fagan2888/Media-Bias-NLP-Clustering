He was 76.\n\nHilliard was a legendary journalist, was a member of the Denver Press Club Hall of Fame and has been listed as one of the state\u2019s most influential media members. When he retired in 1999, three governors and more than a dozen legislators attended the party, said his wife, Lana.\n\nShe said he had heart problems for some time. He loved politics, cars, Civil War history, horses and dogs, she said.\n\n\u201cHe told me about a week ago, \u2018I had the strangest dream,\u2019 \u201d she said Sunday night. \u201cI said, \u2018Was it a good dream?\u2019 because he had been having bad dreams. He said, \u2018I was standing out in front of the house, and I had a heart attack. And all the dogs came and gathered around me, and they could talk.\u2019 They were all the dogs he had had. He asked where they had been, and they said, \u2018We\u2019re in the happy place, and we\u2019ve come to get you.\u2019 \u201c\n\nHilliard was known for his intelligence and his sense of humor.\n\n\u201cHe would say, \u2018We saved two other people from us,\u2019 \u201d Lana Hilliard said with a laugh. The couple would have celebrated their 50th anniversary in March.\n\nThey met when she was a senior at the University of New Mexico in 1963. He was working at the Albuquerque Journal soon after finishing a stint in the Army. He had worked as a medic and a writer at Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Aurora.\n\nHilliard joined The Associated Press in November 1964 and was assigned to its bureau in Cheyenne. He was assigned to cover politics and state government in Denver in 1967.\n\nHis son, Bronson Hilliard, spokesman for the University of Colorado, said people across the state remember his father, from his news stories and his weekly column \u201cCapitol Closeup.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the window to the Capitol and state government all over Colorado,\u201d his son said. \u201cEvery small-town paper carried his stories and his column.\u201d\n\nHilliard also helped cover the Denver Broncos.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, and two sons, Bronson and Brendan, as well as three grandchildren. A memorial is being planned for this month, his wife said.\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Former Colorado Associated Press writer Carl Hilliard dies", "title": "Former Colorado Associated Press writer Carl Hilliard dies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/10/former-colorado-associated-press-writer-carl-hilliard-dies/", "image": {"width": 570, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131110__Carl-Hilliardp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131110__Carl-Hilliardp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-10T21:18:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:20:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Carl Hilliard, a Colorado statehouse reporter and political columnist for The Associated Press for 32 years, died Sunday after a heart attack at his home.\nHilliard was a legendary journalist, was a member of the Denver Press Club Hall of Fame and has been listed as one of the state\u2019s most influential media members.\nHilliard joined The Associated Press in November 1964 and was assigned to its bureau in Cheyenne.\nWhen he retired in 1999, three governors and more than a dozen legislators attended the party, said his wife, Lana.\nHe was assigned to cover politics and state government in Denver in 1967."}
