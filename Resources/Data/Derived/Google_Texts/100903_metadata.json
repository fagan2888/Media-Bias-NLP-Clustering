Planned Parenthood Association of Hidalgo County, now named Access Esperanza Clinics, has ended its partnership with Planned Parenthood. Patricio C. Gonzales, CEO of Access Esperanza, explained the significant move:\n\n\"Changing our name and affiliation allows our agency to apply for state health programs and make low-cost services more available for thousands of our low-income women, men and teens,\" said Patricio C. Gonzales, CEO of Access Esperanza, in a letter posted on the group's website, where she added that it was \"a difficult but practical solution.\"\n\nIn summary, renouncing its association with Planned Parenthood now gives Access Esperanza the opportunity to receive government funds.\n\nGovernor Rick Perry signed Senate Bill 7 in 2011. This law barred Planned Parenthood from receiving government assistance. In light of this legislation, Access Esperanza had to close four of its eight clinics. Statewide, the bill led to the closings of 76 clinics.\n\nAccess Esperanza's break with Planned Parenthood is evidence that Senate Bill 7 is working. While supporters claim the majority of Planned Parenthood's services are related to women's health and not reproductive services, the fact remains that the organization performs over 300,000 abortions annually and a near 12 percent of Planned Parenthood's clients get abortions. These statistics leave little to the imagination as to why pro-life legislators are trying to revoke taxpayer funding to the infamous organization. As for Access Esperanza, it has not stated whether or not it performs abortions.\n\nPerhaps Access Esperanza's decision to be independent of Planned Parenthood is proof that the organization is being brought down a peg. Similar changes can and should be copied in other states.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is Planned Parenthood being brought down a peg?.05/25/2016 21:36:37PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Is Planned Parenthood being brought down a peg?", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Texas Clinics Say Goodbye to Planned Parenthood", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2014/09/21/texas-clinics-say-goodbye-to-planned-parenthood-n1894682", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/9/21/0.jpeg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Is Planned Parenthood being brought down a peg?", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Texas Clinics Say Goodbye to Planned Parenthood", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2014/09/21/texas-clinics-say-goodbye-to-planned-parenthood-n1894682", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/9/21/0.jpeg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Texas Clinics Say Goodbye to Planned Parenthood, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd184e\"", "article_summary": "Planned Parenthood Association of Hidalgo County, now named Access Esperanza Clinics, has ended its partnership with Planned Parenthood.\nIn summary, renouncing its association with Planned Parenthood now gives Access Esperanza the opportunity to receive government funds.\nPlanned Parenthood continues to lose momentum in the state of Texas.\nPerhaps Access Esperanza's decision to be independent of Planned Parenthood is proof that the organization is being brought down a peg.\nAccess Esperanza's break with Planned Parenthood is evidence that Senate Bill 7 is working."}
