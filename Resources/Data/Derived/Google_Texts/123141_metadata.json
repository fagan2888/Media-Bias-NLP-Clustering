The cause of SIDS is still relatively unknown, though some doctors believe it may have to do with undetected brain abnormalities. A new study shines some light on the issue: it turns out that in higher altitudes, where oxygen molecules are distributed more sparsely in every breath you take, infants may be at a higher risk of hypoxia \u2014 or low oxygen in their blood \u2014 which ultimately may be tied to SIDS.\n\nIn the study, researchers examined Colorado birth certificates and death registries from 2007 to 2012, as well as the residential addresses for some 395,000 infants. They controlled for maternal age and education, as well as whether the mother smoked cigarettes, and found that infants who lived in altitudes higher than 8,000 feet had double the risk of SIDS than those who lived below 6,000 feet.\n\nThis recent study confirms past findings: a 1998 study completed in Austria found that babies sleeping on their stomachs in higher altitudes had a higher risk of SIDS than babies at lower altitudes. In general, parents are advised to have their infants sleep on their backs instead of their stomachs to lower the risk of SIDS. As a result, even though higher elevation poses higher risk, the authors of the study explain that there\u2019s ways to mitigate that risk without having to move to lower altitudes.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to point out that parents can still focus on modifiable risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome, including putting infants on their back to sleep, avoiding excessive blankets or stuffed animals, and maintaining a no-smoking environment,\u201d Dr. David Katz, a cardiologist at the University of Colorado and an author of the study, told LiveScience.\n\nDr. Susan Niermeyer, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and another of the authors on the study, adds that parents do still have some control in preventing SIDS. \u201cI would like parents to feel that they\u2019re empowered to take some very concrete steps to minimize risk of SIDS wherever they live,\u201d she told LiveScience. \u201cIf [the babies] are able to turn over, they\u2019re probably going to have the motor development to get themselves out of a situation where they have an obstructed airway.\u201d\n\nThe researchers state that the study isn't meant to worry parents who live in higher altitudes; it is, however, a step in the right direction for further research on SIDS.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid people will interpret this study as saying high altitudes are dangerous, but this association really begs for further research into why it exists,\u201d Katz told the New York Times.\n\nSource: Katz D, Shore S, Bandle B, Niermeyer S, Bol K, Khanna A.
