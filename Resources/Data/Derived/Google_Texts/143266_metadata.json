There is a new victim of identity theft every two seconds in the United States,\u201d said Nancy LeaMond, Chief Advocacy & Engagement Officer, AARP. \u201cFrank Abagnale\u2019s guidance as AARP Fraud Watch Network Ambassador will be highly effective in educating our members and the public about ways to protect themselves and their families from fraud.\u201d\n\nAs part of the AARP education campaign, Abagnale hosts a fun online \u201cCatch the Con\u201d video quiz. He also will participate in AARP-sponsored identity theft forums which are scheduled in communities nationwide. In the coming weeks, events are scheduled for: Omaha, Chicago, Sioux Falls, Seattle, St. Paul, and Hanover, N.H.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the news of the major security breaches which have occurred over the past two years,\u201d said Abagnale. \u201cPersonal information from some of those incidents is just starting to show up, as it is common for criminals to warehouse personal data for two to three years before they make it available in the marketplace. Too many of us are vulnerable, and I look forward to working with AARP to advise people about the safest ways to conduct their financial transactions and manage social media.\u201d\n\nFor news about the latest reported scams, and advice from Abagnale on how to avoid identity theft, visit the AARP Fraud Watch Network.\n\n# # #", "article_metadata": {"DivisionMain": "Division:Press Center", "Division1": "Division:Press Center", "page_title": "Identity Theft Expert Frank Abagnale Named AARP Ambassador", "estimated_publish_date": "2015-08-26", "Last-Modified": "2015-08-26T10:41:04.610-04:00", "keywords": "Frank Abagnale, AARP, Identity Theft, Cybercrime, Con Artist", "paywallStatus": "off", "livefyreId": "350119:http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-08-2015/identity-theft-expert-frank-abagnale-named-aarp-ambassador.html", "lfdataConfig": "{\"globalConfig\":{\"network\":\"aarp.fyre.co\"},\"livefyreConfig\":[{\"collectionMeta\":\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.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.CnIAj4TYvfhpS19z4EQyfyasBTnmM7LbdfeTXLUdmYw\",\"checksum\":\"65d9fdca28e311006cfc944a112c028d\",\"siteId\":\"350139\",\"articleId\":\"http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-08-2015/identity-theft-expert-frank-abagnale-named-aarp-ambassador.html\",\"el\":\"livefyreConversation\",\"disableAvatars\":true,\"postToButtons\":[\"tw\",\"fb\"]}]}", "source": "aarp_press_center", "type": "info", "description": "\u201cCatch Me if You Can\u201d Author Joins with AARP Fraud Watch Network to Raise Awareness of Cybercrime", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "DCSubjects:Entertainment", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "\u201cCatch Me if You Can\u201d Author Joins with AARP Fraud Watch Network to Raise Awareness of Cybercrime", "title": "Identity Theft Expert Frank Abagnale Named AARP Ambassador - AARP", "url": "http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-08-2015/identity-theft-expert-frank-abagnale-named-aarp-ambassador.html", "image": "http://cdn.aarp.net/etc/aarp/statics/global/img/logos/aarp_50x50.imgcache.rev1463067051643.png", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarp/en/home/about-aarp/press-center/info-08-2015/identity-theft-expert-frank-abagnale-named-aarp-ambassador", "mcafeesecure-site-verification": "fa79d1a3c2770869e1286a81816d01a4", "IALevel1": "about-aarp", "IALevel2": "press-center", "s43": "PressCenter|Membership", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016-05-26"}, "article_summary": "There is a new victim of identity theft every two seconds in the United States,\u201d said Nancy LeaMond, Chief Advocacy & Engagement Officer, AARP.\nHe also will participate in AARP-sponsored identity theft forums which are scheduled in communities nationwide.\n\u201cFrank Abagnale\u2019s guidance as AARP Fraud Watch Network Ambassador will be highly effective in educating our members and the public about ways to protect themselves and their families from fraud.\u201dAs part of the AARP education campaign, Abagnale hosts a fun online \u201cCatch the Con\u201d video quiz.\nToo many of us are vulnerable, and I look forward to working with AARP to advise people about the safest ways to conduct their financial transactions and manage social media.\u201dFor news about the latest reported scams, and advice from Abagnale on how to avoid identity theft, visit the AARP Fraud Watch Network.\n\u201cOur technology today seemingly has made it easier for the scam artists."}
