It\u2019s not just about those basic needs. People don\u2019t think about all those other needs.\"\n\n\n\nWith her bad knee, Jeanne McLaughlin rarely travels far, having chosen her doctor, grocery store and hairdresser for their proximity to her Ocean County retirement village.\n\nIn the depths of winter, that small circle shrinks even more.\n\n\"I don\u2019t go out, period, when the weather is bad,\" said McLaughlin, an 86-year-old widow who lives by herself. She still recalls the time she fell when putting out the trash after a rainstorm. Luckily, she was able to crawl to her car in the dark, then pull herself up using its door handle.\n\nWhile the recent string of storms may give nearly everyone cabin fever, it can be particularly burdensome for the elderly \u2014 turning even the relatively independent into temporary shut-ins.\n\nDoctor and hair appointments are canceled. Visitors call to reschedule. Those who still drive face icy porch steps as daunting as a Sochi luge run.\n\n\"They\u2019re stuck inside and can\u2019t get visitors. Oftentimes it can be very lonely,\" said Liz Fandel, of Fellowship Village\u2019s Helping Hands, a Basking Ridge agency that provides home health care. \"And we know that social isolation \u2014 particularly with the elderly \u2014 can lead to other issues.\"\n\nPiercing that isolation is the whole point of \"telephone reassurance\" programs set up for seniors by county agencies, as well as groups such as Catholic Charities.\n\n\"This lady has been a savior,\" McLaughlin said of Pat Shick, a volunteer for the Ocean County program who calls her almost every day. \"If I didn\u2019t have Pat, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do.\"\n\nShick is one of 17 volunteers with the county\u2019s Meals on Wheels program who call to check in with seniors. Another 17 volunteers visit in person, said Jim Sigerdson of Meals on Wheels. The program was designed in hopes it would forestall depression in the elderly.\n\n\"It gives them something to look forward to,\" said Judy Cascella, of Manchester, another \"telephone reassurance\" volunteer.\n\nIn her nine years as a volunteer, Shick has gone well beyond a daily \"wellness\" call to McLaughlin.\n\nShe invites McLaughlin to her own family\u2019s get-together on Christmas Eve, and, as the most recent storm was approaching, called from a supermarket to ask McLaughlin if she needed anything.\n\n\"I call her my guardian angel,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nWhen the weather forecast is alarming, friends or relatives of older residents will often make sure their basic needs \u2014 food, heat, shelter \u2014 are met. If a storm is coming, Meals on Wheels programs will deliver tomorrow\u2019s meal today, in a so-called \"Blizzard box.\"\n\nBut human companionship often isn\u2019t in the forefront of those preparations, nor very easy to provide in bad weather.\n\n\"Families need to talk about this with their loved ones,\" Fandel said. \"It\u2019s not just about those basic needs. People don\u2019t think about all those other needs.\"\n\nWhen a storm is coming, some of her elderly clients will have their visiting aide come the day before, or even stay overnight to safeguard them. That carries a price tag, or course, but it can help during extended bad weather.\n\n\"Oftentimes when someone\u2019s alone for a longer period of time than they\u2019re used to, they feel uneasy,\" Fandel said. Her service charges $21 an hour for home health aides.\n\nAfter the storm, out-of-state adult children may contact her agency to do something as simple as take their relative to get her hair done \u2014 a \"non-essential\" need that can wear on one\u2019s mind.\n\nThe reluctance of some older residents to brave the elements is prudent, experts say, given how devastating any fall can be.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Health reports:\n\n\u2022 At least one in three N.J. adults 65 and older will fall over the next 12 months.\n\n\u2022 On average, 194 older adults are admitted to the hospital or treated in an emergency room every day because of a fall.\n\n\u2022 Falls are the leading cause of unintentional injury, hospitalizations and death among older New Jerseyans.\n\nTechnology may be able to make a dent in this isolation down the road. Fandel said continuing care communities nationwide are now talking about making their social activities \u2014 such as in-house talks or seminars \u2014 available to older people who live nearby, but outside the actual complex.\n\nEven older people who claim they \"don\u2019t use the computer\" can navigate an iPad, she\u2019s found. \"So buy them an iPad. Set them up with Skype!,\" she advises adult children who live far away from their aging parents.\n\nCatherine L\u2019Insalata, division director for volunteer services of Catholic Charities, said she\u2019s noticed something odd: A bad winter often triggers the impulse in some people to become volunteers themselves.\n\n\"Maybe it\u2019s feeling boxed in ... or not being able to get the car out ... or just the need to communicate,\" she theorized. \"But we get a lot of calls to volunteer. I think winter becomes a time of reflection,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Kathleen O'Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@river','health-news','nj-storm'", "title": "In depths of winter, volunteers bring the elderly needed companionship", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"In depths of winter, volunteers bring the elderly needed companionship\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/02/winter_and_the_elderly.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2014/02/14236664-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12155705\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-08T11:55:42Z\", \"author\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@river\",\"health-news\",\"nj-storm\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2014/02/14236664-small.jpg", "description": "Piercing winter's isolation is the whole point of \"telephone reassurance\" programs set up for seniors by county agencies, as well as groups such as Catholic Charities.", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "creator": "@OBrienLedger"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, February 08, 2014,  7:52 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2014/02/14236664-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"kobrien\", \"author_nickname\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"2434\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Piercing winter's isolation is the whole point of \"telephone reassurance\" programs set up for seniors by county agencies, as well as groups such as Catholic Charities.", "title": "In depths of winter, volunteers bring the elderly needed companionship", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/02/winter_and_the_elderly.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, February 08, 2014,  6:52 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Piercing winter's isolation is the whole point of \"telephone reassurance\" programs set up for seniors by county agencies, as well as groups such as Catholic Charities."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0b5\"", "article_summary": "Catherine L\u2019Insalata, division director for volunteer services of Catholic Charities, said she\u2019s noticed something odd: A bad winter often triggers the impulse in some people to become volunteers themselves.\n\"I don\u2019t go out, period, when the weather is bad,\" said McLaughlin, an 86-year-old widow who lives by herself.\nShick is one of 17 volunteers with the county\u2019s Meals on Wheels program who call to check in with seniors.\nBut human companionship often isn\u2019t in the forefront of those preparations, nor very easy to provide in bad weather.\nIn the depths of winter, that small circle shrinks even more."}
