Just before the blow, Bisping (18-7) had signaled to referee Herb Dean after losing his mouthpiece, and Dean ruled the fight would continue to the fourth round. To add to the tension, Bisping was struck with a low-blow, while Silva (16-3) was inadvertently poked in the eye.\n\nBisping was bleeding from several cuts on his face by the end, but the final scorecard had him winning unanimously 48-47.\n\n\u201cI wanted this fight my entire life,\u201d Bisping said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019m crying.\n\n\u201cI worship this guy. This guy is the greatest martial artist of all-time. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so emotional right now.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Gegard Mousasi landed the majority of significant strikes in his war of attrition with Thales Leites, coming out on top via unanimous decision after three rounds of lackluster action.\n\n\u201cMy standup was better,\u201d Mousasi said. \u201cI played it smart because (in) the last fight, I took chances, and I paid for it.\u201d\n\nTom Breese\u2019s victory over Keita Nakamura showed neither man in a positive light, with the outsized Nakamura mostly holding on to the Englishman, and Breese hardly looking like a fighter with a previous 9-0 record in MMA competition.\n\n\u201cIt was very frustrating,\u201d Breese said. \u201cI told everyone, this guy\u2019s a tough guy. \u2026 I\u2019ve got to get more cage time.\u201d\n\nIn the opening contest of the main card, Londoner Brad Pickett took a split decision victory over Francisco Rivera. The American was picking off \u201cOne Punch\u201d in the first round, landing accurate blows, but Pickett rebounded in the second and controlled the fight on the ground in the third.\n\n\u201cI want to be someone within the sport, and if I felt I couldn\u2019t compete \u2014 not just compete at the level but win at this level \u2014 then I would\u2019ve hung my gloves up tonight,\u201d an emotional Pickett said. \u201cI had a lot of inner demons that I was fighting, and I am so happy to come away with the win.\u201d\n\nOn the preliminary card, Davey Grant beat Marlon Vera by unanimous decision despite suffering a nasty forehead cut in the first round, while Makwan Amirkhani made it three wins out of three in the UFC with a unanimous decision win over Mike Wilkinson.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Michael Bisping beats Anderson Silva in wild ending at UFC Fight Night", "title": "Michael Bisping beats Anderson Silva in wild ending at UFC Fight Night", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/28/michael-bisping-beats-anderson-silva-in-wild-ending-at-ufc-fight-night/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160228_095610_michael-bisping.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160228_095610_michael-bisping.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-28T09:54:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T03:00:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LONDON \u2014 Michael Bisping survived a wild ending to the third round and beat Anderson Silva with a unanimous decision in the main event of UFC Fight Night 84 on Saturday night.\nSilva and numerous ringside officials thought Silva had won the fight near the end of the third round after Silva knocked down Bisping with a Muay Thai knee just before the bell.\nTo add to the tension, Bisping was struck with a low-blow, while Silva (16-3) was inadvertently poked in the eye.\n\u2026 I\u2019ve got to get more cage time.\u201dIn the opening contest of the main card, Londoner Brad Pickett took a split decision victory over Francisco Rivera.\nBisping was bleeding from several cuts on his face by the end, but the final scorecard had him winning unanimously 48-47."}
