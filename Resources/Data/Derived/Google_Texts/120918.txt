The funny thing about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is that many people who support it will admit — if pressed — that it is a very poorly drafted piece of legislation.

The overall purpose of the ACA, of course, is to provide a general structure for universal health coverage, but Congress left most of the details to three federal agencies (the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Health and Human Services) to sort out on their own. The results have been mixed, to say the least, though in fairness, the agencies have done the best they could with what they were given.
