The two face each other in the June 7 Democratic primary, with the winner challenging Republican U.S. Rep. Rod Blum of Dubuque in the November general election.\n\n\u201cMy opponent needs to own his record that, when it mattered the most for women in Iowa, he was not there for them,\u201d Vernon said in her opening statement.\n\nMurphy, however, defended his record, noting that while he was House speaker, he did not allow any legislation to move forward that would have rolled back women\u2019s access to abortion.\n\nWhile both Murphy and Vernon said they were opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, Murphy questioned Vernon\u2019s actual stance.\n\nHe pointed to a questionnaire from the New Democratic Coalition Political Action Committee, which endorsed her, that asked about the TPP. Vernon said she is a \u201cstraight-shooter\u201d and explained her opposition to the trade agreement.\n\n\u201cThen, release the questionnaire so we can see it in writing,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nVernon stressed that the PAC, which bills itself as a \u201cmoderate, pro-growth\u201d group of legislators, endorsed her over Murphy because of her willingness to \u201cwork with people to solve problems.\u201d\n\nShe highlighted her list of endorsements by saying, \u201cWhy is it, Pat, that the people who know you the best trust you the least?\u201d\n\nDespite the early clashes, the two candidates found plenty to agree on. They both support the Affordable Care Act and would like to see it expanded to include more people. They both want to see veterans get the care they deserve and have a foreign policy that includes Congress in military decisions.\n\nWhile they both want to see a lower incarceration rate for people of color, Vernon criticized Murphy for focusing solely on drug conviction disparities. She focused on community policing and understanding the underlying issues driving racial clashes.\n\nMurphy pushed back, saying during his tenure as House speaker, Iowa saw a dramatic increase in African-American lawmakers and grew in diversity in other ways.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking to the guy that elected more African-Americans to the Iowa Legislature than any other time in the state\u2019s history,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nMurphy and Vernon will meet for a fourth debate at 7 p.m. May 13 at the Tama Ballroom.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | VINTON - For all the issues where 1st District Democratic candidates Monica Vernon and Pat Murphy found agreement, they continued to clash Friday night over the", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "VINTON - For all the issues where 1st District Democratic candidates Monica Vernon and Pat Murphy found agreement, they continued to clash Friday night over the definition of what makes a progressive.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/government/murphy-vernon-question-progressive-credentials-20160429", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20160429/ARTICLE/160429573/AR/0/AR-160429573.jpg", "article": {"section": "Default"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/government/murphy-vernon-question-progressive-credentials-20160429", "description": "VINTON - For all the issues where 1st District Democratic candidates Monica Vernon and Pat Murphy found agreement, they continued to clash Friday night over the definition of what makes a progressive.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "Murphy, Vernon question progressive credentials"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2016-04-29T22:10:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_default", "pubDate": "2016-04-29T22:10:51-05:00", "title": "Murphy, Vernon question progressive credentials"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "While both Murphy and Vernon said they were opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, Murphy questioned Vernon\u2019s actual stance.\n\u201cThen, release the questionnaire so we can see it in writing,\u201d Murphy said.\nMurphy and Vernon will meet for a fourth debate at 7 p.m. May 13 at the Tama Ballroom.\nMurphy pushed back, saying during his tenure as House speaker, Iowa saw a dramatic increase in African-American lawmakers and grew in diversity in other ways.\nWhile they both want to see a lower incarceration rate for people of color, Vernon criticized Murphy for focusing solely on drug conviction disparities."}
