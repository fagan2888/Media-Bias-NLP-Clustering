Multiple ALS Research Leads Heat Up\n\nI sighed this week when I heard, \u201cHey, Mom, do we have a clean bucket and some ice?\u201d\n\nYes, the viral ALS ice-bucket challenge that has swept the country had reached our household as well. And though my daughter averred that she would never have heard about ALS otherwise, it pushed some of my cynic buttons. (My favorite response so far had come from an acidly hilarious Facebook friend who advised celebrities: \u201cJust write a check to support ALS research. If you still need a gimmick and social media attention, set your hair on fire instead.\u201d)\n\nFor me, the trouble was that I had looked into ALS research a few years ago and it had struck me then as extraordinarily frustrating. It was the field that first taught me that it\u2019s all too common for a potential treatment to look good in initial testing and then fail to pan out when tried in a bigger clinical trial. That happened with ALS over and over again. And meanwhile, patients faced inexorable neurological degeneration and far too early deaths. (One of my most admired colleagues, Dudley Clendinen, died of ALS in 2012 after eloquently chronicling his time with it.)\n\nBut then I thought: Let\u2019s be positive. Whatever the narcissistic elements of the ice-bucket dousings, the challenge is raising millions of dollars \u2014 more than $50 million as of Friday, from more than a million new donors, according to the ALS Association. And maybe ALS research has changed?\n\nIndeed it has, say scientists working in the field. Not that it looks like there\u2019s a cure around the corner, but there has been major progress of late, they say, and we can expect more to come.\n\n\u201cIn about the last seven years, the genetics of ALS has just exploded the field, and just come up with so many new ideas for how we can tackle the disease,\u201d said Avi Rodal, an ALS researcher at Brandeis University whose work is funded by the Blazeman Foundation for ALS.\n\nDr. Lucie Bruijn, chief scientist of the ALS Association that is reaping the ice-bucket windfall, also describes a field that is forging ahead in multiple directions. \u201cThe understanding of the disease, the research that has gone into it, has grown exponentially,\u201d she says. \u201cSo we\u2019re much closer to understanding the complexity of the disease and how to approach it in a very different way from before, when many of the trials were challenging partly because we didn\u2019t understand the disease as closely.\u201d\n\nThe Association, she says, is focusing on six main areas, and the ice-bucket money will likely be divided among them: \u201cWe want to invest in many areas,\u201d she says, \u201cto be sure not to dilute it too much but to be very strategic that we don\u2019t put all our eggs in one basket.\u201d\n\nThose areas, in brief and lightly edited, as she described them:\n\n1. Genetics:\n\nAbout five to 10 percent of ALS runs through families, but 90 percent is sporadic. However, we\u2019ve found that many of the genes we identify in familial disease are potential risk factors, and certainly also seem to be involved in the sporadic form. So there\u2019s an underlying genetics in all ALS, but sometimes it\u2019s more dominant than others.\n\nThrough our funding, we\u2019ve been able to build large consortia. In fact, a couple of years ago there was a very exciting finding \u2014 a quite tricky gene, one that we couldn\u2019t find so easily, so we invested heavily into it \u2014 it affects about 40 percent of familial ALS. Also, in some cases of ALS, there\u2019s a kind of dementia called frontotemporal dementia, and this gene finding affects both ALS and frontotemporal dementia. So there\u2019s an interesting link we\u2019re trying to understand, with different biologies with the same gene, and that really made the field explode.\n\nThe gene has a complicated name \u2014 C9orf72 \u2014 because it produces a protein that we don\u2019t know anything about, and the name is just a location number \u2014 it\u2019s located on chromosome 9, Open Reading Frame 72 \u2014 until we understand more about what the gene does.\n\nSo it\u2019s a mystery gene?\n\nIt is, and even more fascinating is that it\u2019s the first for ALS we\u2019ve found where it\u2019s not a point mutation \u2014 it\u2019s not one change on the reading code that causes an abnormal protein \u2014 it\u2019s actually an expansion that is inserted into this region of the gene. And it\u2019s a repeat, it\u2019s called a hexanucleotide repeat \u2014 six things repeating over and over again a thousand times when it should be only 20. So it\u2019s similar to Huntington\u2019s disease and others like it. And experts in those fields are now using their knowledge and bringing it to the ALS field.\n\n2. Biomarkers:\n\nBiomarkers are very important because they are signatures of the disease, they tell us if the disease is changing or give us clues for diagnosis.\n\nWhat had been really challenging in the clinical trials that you mentioned that had failed is that often we don\u2019t know why they have failed. Partly, we think maybe ALS is a spectrum of diseases \u2014 that some might react to the treatment approach differently than others. And we\u2019ve started to see if we can group and discern patients in different categories, some that might have a particular profile in their blood or the fluid around their brain that tells us, for example, that they might have more of an inflammatory profile and they might respond better to drugs if we treat along that pathway.\n\nSo it\u2019s a fascinating area, and it really requires significant investment because all these efforts require large studies, large collaborations. It\u2019s been done very successfully in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, so we are borrowing expertise to see how we could do something like that.\n\n3.Stem cells (not the embryonic kind) :\n\nEarly studies trying to understand whether stem cell technologies would be of value in ALS were done using embryonic stem cells, but we have really been so lucky with technological advances. Now you can get skin cells from someone with the disease, or someone who doesn\u2019t have ALS, and you can reprogram them to make them be immature cells that can develop into motor neurons and the surrounding astrocytes.\n\nWe are starting to try to develop these model systems in a dish, using these cells from people who live with the disease, and then testing drugs that might change what that looks like. So if the cells are looking different from those that comes from someone who doesn\u2019t have the disease, what are those differences and how can you correct them using drugs? That\u2019s really going to spearhead a new direction.\n\nStem cells can also play a role as potential therapy, but it\u2019s very complicated in ALS. We are very excited that there are FDA-approved trials testing the idea, but ALS is unlike Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 it does\u2019t happen just in one region, it\u2019s a complex architecture where the nerve cells connect to the muscles, and it\u2019s really quite widespread. So where you have to put the cells is often the big challenge. In the approved stem cell trial, they are injecting them straight into the spinal cord. But it\u2019s extremely difficult. Still, stem cells are also invaluable for their use as model systems.\n\n4. In the clinic:\n\nWe\u2019re trying to move things forward in clinical management, in day-to-day care of people living with the disease. One example is a trial we\u2019re funding of a compound that has been approved for people who have changing emotions in ALS \u2014 laughing and crying that\u2019s exaggerated. This compound, which we are now testing in a trial, has already been approved for that, but one of our clinicians and some anecdotal information seem to indicate that it improves swallowing. It\u2019s not proven yet, but this is the kind of thing that we can provide funding for, to test that idea. So we seed small clinical trials \u2014 though trials can be anywhere up from $25 million plus, just for perspective. So these are not small investments.\n\n5. Understanding disease mechanism:\n\nA yeast model has helped us understand more risk factors for ALS; flies, worms, zebrafish, yeast, mice \u2014 all are models that can be used, and we invest in that.\n\nWhat have you come to understand in recent years about the disease?\n\nWe were very fixated on the motor neuron being the main thing that goes wrong \u2014 but actually, we\u2019ve learned so much more now: the surrounding cells, the astrocytes, which are important in regulating glutamate, are very important, as are the cells that are the inflammatory cells of the brain, the microglia.\n\nNow we know that these support cells are critical to the process, we\u2019ve actually started to look for ways to intervene, and one idea is to replace the dying astrocytes \u2014 that\u2019s a stem-cell transplant idea that\u2019s moving forward. The other is looking at inflammation and seeing if we can find drug targets.\n\n\n\n6. Drug development:\n\nWe can bring together all the right players \u2014 academia and industry. So we give out contracts \u2014 academia-industry contracts \u2014 where we mostly fund the academic partner, but the industry partner gives resources in kind and the expertise to really help bring the idea from the laboratory through the process of drug discovery into a treatment.\n\nOne great example of that, which is thrilling, is the use of antisense technology \u2014 which has now been used for all kinds of other diseases \u2014 for ALS. Simplistically, what happens with this technology is that it lets you down-regulate or suppress the production of something you don\u2019t want to have. It was first tried on SOD1 [the first ALS gene found] but an attempt is moving forward very, very fast to try the same thing with the new gene, C9orf72. We don\u2019t know yet whether it\u2019s going to be effective in humans but it\u2019s certainly safe.\n\nReaders, thoughts?
