For Sean Luckuy, fishing is a kind of escape.

"I come out here everyday after work," said Luckuy. "It's just a good time to get away from everything and come out here and have some fun."

Luckuy is what you call an avid angler and likes to fish at Lock 30 on the Rock River in Milan.

"I've been fishing since I was about 10. I fish this area a lot so I know what kind of fish are in here and I know what to use," said Luckuy.

"Some days you don't catch any fish, but it's a blast when you do. Actually, I got a fish now," said Luckuy, as he reeled in a freshwater drum fish.

In Illinois, the free fishing days were from June 6-9, and in Iowa from June 6-8.

"We want families to get out and enjoy fishing, maybe get hooked on fishing, get some kids involved in it," said Steve Francisko, Illinois DNR officer.

After free fishing weekend, people will have to buy a license to fish in either state. Fishing licenses cost $15 for Illinois residents and $19 for Iowa residents.

People can get fishing licenses through their local bait shops, or they can buy them online from Illinois' fishing website or through Iowa's DNR website.
