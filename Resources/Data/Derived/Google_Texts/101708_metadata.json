I don't know about any plans, but in principle Russia can do it.\u201d It\u2019s a position that other Russian officials have articulated in the past. Ulyanov\u2019s boss, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, made similar comments in December.\n\nMore surprising was Ulyanov\u2019s warning about the status of the Intermediate Range Nuclear Force Treaty, signed by the U.S. and the Soviet Union in 1987. The deal was designed to eliminate the two countries\u2019 stocks of nuclear and ballistic missiles with ranges of between 300 and 3,400 miles.\n\nRelated: Putin Pulls Out of Post-Cold War Arms Treaty\n\nThe escalating rhetoric over nuclear weapons comes as tensions continue to rise in Europe. On Tuesday, Russia formally withdrew from a different treaty limiting conventional armed forces in Europe. Over the weekend, the president of the European Commission called for a Pan-European Army specifically to serve as a counterweight against Russia\u2019s aggression.\n\nThe U.S. has repeatedly called on Russia to admit to violations of the nuclear treaty. The Kremlin, not surprisingly, has declined to do so.\n\nThe government-owned news agency ITAR-TASS reported on comments made by Ulyanov Wednesday morning. \u201cSome actions by our U.S. colleagues cause great surprise,\u201d he reportedly said. \u201cIn their scheme of things we are expected to say voluntarily what we have violated and to confess violations. This kind of approach does not look serious to us.\u201d\n\nRelated: Spooked by Putin, EU Brass Consider a European Army\n\nUlyanov charged that the U.S. is undermining global stability and making progress toward nuclear disarmament more difficult, TASS reported. Ulyanov reportedly said the presence of U.S. anti-ballistic missiles in Europe and \u201cdevelopment of high-precision strategic non-nuclear weapons\u201d are damaging the prospects for continued cooperation on nuclear arms issues.\n\n\"In such circumstances, the continuation of the nuclear disarmament process seems problematic,\u201d he said.\n\n\"The discussion with the United States on this subject will go on. Its outcome is anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d he added before concluding with the backhanded assurance that \u201cat this point it would be wrong to say that the treaty is falling apart.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials have already accused Russia of repeatedly violating the nuclear treaty by developing new weapons of the kind it specifically banned. Last month, U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said, that in the face of continued violations, \u201cU.S. responses must make clear to Russia that if it does not return to compliance, our responses will make them less secure than they are today.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A high-level Russian official on Wednesday asserted again that the Kremlin has the rig", "title": "Nuclear Treaty with Russia May Be Breaking Down", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/11/Nuclear-Treaty-Russia-May-Be-Breaking-Down", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03112015_Putin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/11/Nuclear-Treaty-Russia-May-Be-Breaking-Down", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03112015_Putin.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A high-level Russian official on Wednesday asserted again that the Kremlin has the rig", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd19c3\"", "article_summary": "On the question of sending nuclear weapons into Crimea, Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency quoted Mikhail Ulyanov as saying, \u201cI don't know if there are nuclear weapons there now.\nThe U.S. has repeatedly called on Russia to admit to violations of the nuclear treaty.\nRelated: Putin Pulls Out of Post-Cold War Arms TreatyThe escalating rhetoric over nuclear weapons comes as tensions continue to rise in Europe.\nMore surprising was Ulyanov\u2019s warning about the status of the Intermediate Range Nuclear Force Treaty, signed by the U.S. and the Soviet Union in 1987.\nA high-level Russian official on Wednesday asserted again that the Kremlin has the right to move nuclear weapons into the disputed Crimean peninsula, which Russian troops invaded last year \u2014 and suggested that a key nuclear arms control agreement between the U.S. and Russia is in danger of breaking down."}
