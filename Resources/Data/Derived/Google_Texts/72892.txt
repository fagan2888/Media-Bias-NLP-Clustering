Executives at H&R Block Inc. (NYSE:HRB) are hoping the Obama administration will get tough on individual health insurance mandate enforcement for the 2015 tax year.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) required exchanges to send Form 1095-A to consumers who used premium tax credits, to help with the administration of the PPACA premium tax credit program. But the IRS put off requiring insurers to send 1095-B coverage notices and employers to send 1095-C coverage notices.

Consumers had no easy way to document whether they had individual coverage or employer coverage. To get out of paying the penalty on the uninsured, a taxpayer could simply check a box on the tax return stating that the taxpayer had had adequate coverage throughout 2014.
