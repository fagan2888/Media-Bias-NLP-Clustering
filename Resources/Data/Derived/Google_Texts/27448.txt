Kneady Bakery will mark the opening of its first retail location with a ribbon cutting at 1 p.m. Friday at the Community Marketplace in Moorpark.

Free cookies and other items will be available for marketplace visitors while supplies last.

The bakery was founded in 2013 by friends and Los Angeles residents Kati Angelini and Ashley Guerrero.

They previously specialized in online sales, catering and providing treats to Hollywood gifting suites during the awards season. The business will continue to offer those services in addition to retail sales at the marketplace, where it occupies Booth 436.

Vegan and gluten-free items are among the bakeryâ€™s items named for pop-culture references. They include Game of Scones, Rice Krispin Glovers and sea salt chocolate chip Wookies. The items are made with organic ingredients when possible, Angelini said. Baking is done at a commercial kitchen in Ventura.

Kneady Bakery hours will echo those of the marketplace: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Fridays through Sundays, excluding some holidays.

The location is 709 Science Drive. For information about the Community Marketplace, click on shopcommunitymarketplace.com. For information about Kneady Bakery, click on kneadybakery.com.
