But in its modern incarnation \u2014 the kind that gets written up by critics and praised by other architects \u2014 architecture can seem forbidding and impenetrable. You don\u2019t have to be Prince Charles (a notorious modern-architecture skeptic) to stand before Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron\u2019s de Young Museum in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park and feel you\u2019re in the presence of something oppressive and monstrous. Then again, if you simply turn around in the same spot, you can refresh your spirit with Renzo Piano\u2019s ravishing California Academy of Sciences, built only three years later.\n\nThe layperson couldn\u2019t find a better guide to this enigmatic terrain than Witold Rybczynski\u2019s \u201cHow Architecture Works: A Humanist\u2019s Toolkit.\u201d Despite the title (apparently inspired by literary critic James Wood\u2019s \u201cHow Fiction Works\u201d), this isn\u2019t a book about how buildings stand up or the steps by which they\u2019re erected. Rather, Rybczynski, emeritus professor of architecture at the University of Pennsylvania and a celebrated writer on the subject, provides a tour of the factors every architect must consider when designing a building: site and setting (not the same thing, Rybczynski takes pains to explain), the plan, the skin, the style and above all the idea. For it is \u201can enduring truth\u201d Rybczynski writes, that \u201cgreat buildings are often the result of a single \u2014 and sometimes very simple \u2014 idea.\u201d \u201cHow Architecture Works,\u201d he explains, is \u201ca conceptual toolkit for thinking about the experience of architecture.\u201d\n\nNot all of the examples Rybczynski picks are modern; among others, he discusses the Pantheon, Christopher Wren\u2019s St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral and the villas of Andrea Palladio, iconic structures that influence architects to this day. But modern buildings are his primary focus, and that\u2019s just as well. They do seem to need more explaining.\n\nNot that Rybczynski has much regard for what he sees as \u201cattempts to impose intellectual theories on buildings\u201d or academically driven schools of architecture \u201cwhose work is accompanied by long \u2014 and often labored \u2014 explanations.\u201d He describes himself as someone who \u201chas lived through both the decline and resurgence \u2014 in altered form \u2014 of modern architecture,\u201d and he\u2019s not afraid to cast a jaundiced eye upon, say, Louis I. Kahn\u2019s paradoxical commitment to revealing the structure of the buildings he designed, even at the expense of their function. He thinks Frank Gehry\u2019s famous Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, doesn\u2019t really work in its setting, but that Gehry\u2019s Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles does. Rybczynski has a lot of opinions without being doctrinaire, and his tastes are wide-ranging and omnivorous.\n\nThere are photos and illustrations in \u201cHow Architecture Works,\u201d but its intended audience will get a lot more out of it with the assistance of Google Image Search. I kept my iPad at my elbow whenever I opened the book, and that made it a much richer and more exciting (if also considerably more time-consuming) experience, whether I found myself agreeing with Rybczynski or not. The chapter on details, for example, looks at how several different contemporary architects handle balustrades (the railings on the edges of terraces or balconies) and banisters. Even though the chapter is well-illustrated, being able to see color photos of Bing Thom\u2019s facility for Simon Fraser University in British Columbia online helped me to see how his use of wooden handrails warms up the glass plates that form the guardrails.
