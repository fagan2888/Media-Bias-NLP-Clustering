Steve Geddes of the Valley Center Recreation Commission said the state turned down a request to drill a well and pump water into the field.\n\n\"It's unfortunate, it was kind of a shock,\" said Geddes. \"I didn't realize all the 'red tape' so to speak.\"\n\nThe state told the recreation commission the area's water rights were 'over appropriated', so the commission applied for a permit and will have to get by with five million gallons a year.\n\n\"It's going to require us to be creative from an irrigation standpoint,\" said Geddes. \"We're just going to have to be really smart on how we water, and not waste water.\"\n\nBut the problem doesn't stop there. Geddes said they may run into a bigger irrigation issue across the field from the soccer complex where the 9 hole golf course is going.\n\n\"There could be an opportunity for us to have to pump less water for the golf course than we do for the soccer facility,\" said Geddes.\n\nThe golf course is nearly three times the size of the soccer complex. The commission is looking into only watering tee boxes and greens, but since it's a bigger plot of land, they're hoping a permit will allow more water.\n\n\"There could be an opportunity to get a little bit more water, but I think we can make anything from 5 to 8 million gallons work, I really do,\" added Geddes.\n\nRecreation commissioners said they haven't applied for a water permit for the golf course yet. Geddes told KAKE it will take around a year to go through the state's application process. The golf course is expected to be completed in 18 months. If everything goes as planned, the soccer complex will be ready this time next year.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Valley Center has two huge recreation projects that are running into water problems.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "Valley Center has two huge recreation projects that are running into water problems.", "title": "Valley Center soccer and golf projects running into water issue", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Water-irrigation-creating-issue-for-Valley-Center-soccer-and-golf-projects--272521551.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/9A3/11A/9A311AB28CBA4840888879157DB24734", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/02F/D0C/02FD0CDAABDA44268BB42FBDC8C33E3E.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Valley Center has two huge recreation projects that are running into water problems.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Water-irrigation-creating-issue-for-Valley-Center-soccer-and-golf-projects--272521551.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/sprinkler14.jpg", "title": "Valley Center soccer and golf projects running into water issue", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Valley Center soccer and golf projects running into water issue", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Valley Center soccer and golf, projects running into water issue"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d22\"", "article_summary": "Valley Center is getting a new soccer complex and a nine hole golf that combine for 1.7 million dollars.\nThe eight field soccer complex will be used by hundreds of kids, but a major irrigation issue is standing in the way.\nThe golf course is nearly three times the size of the soccer complex.\nIf everything goes as planned, the soccer complex will be ready this time next year.\nGeddes said they may run into a bigger irrigation issue across the field from the soccer complex where the 9 hole golf course is going."}
