Surveillance cameras got a clear shot of the man accused of threatening a liquor store clerk with a screwdriver in the middle of a robbery.

Pueblo police are hoping someone will recognize the suspect from the surveillance photos--released Monday--and help lead officers to an arrest.

On the afternoon of Dec. 17, police say a Hispanic man between 45 and 55 years old shoplifted a few items from Bonny Hy-Land Liquors. A clerk noticed the suspect hiding the stolen items under his clothes and followed him outside. The clerk asked the suspect to return the items; in response, police say the suspect whipped out a screwdriver and thrust it towards the clerk while yelling, "Come get it."

The clerk backed off and called police.

The suspect is described as 5-foot-10 to 6 feet tall, weighing between 180-200 pounds. Surveillance shows him sporting facial hair and wearing a denim jacket with a blue or tan cap.

Bonny Hy-Land Liquors is located on 1114 Bonforte Blvd., on Pueblo's east side.
