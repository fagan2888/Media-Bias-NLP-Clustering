But studies have found that average Americans generally don\u2019t vote with their feet in making life-altering choices of where to live and whether to move.\n\n\u201cFor most Americans, the major factors determining where they live are where they get a job, how well the job pays and what the schools and communities where they have job offers are like,\u201d said Linda McKissack Beale, professor of law at Wayne State University. \u201cAdditional factors include what others say about quality of life in that city and state, and whether they have family and friends in that area.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeale added, \u201cMost people don\u2019t decide where to live based on taxes, in part because they usually don\u2019t have full information about complex state and local tax regimes or about the kinds of services paid for by those living in that state and local taxes.\u201d\n\nFactors that must be taken into account include not only state income tax rates, but also real estate taxes, vehicle ownership taxes, sales taxes and excise taxes.\n\nRelated: States Are Spending More as Economy Improves\n\nAccording to the latest findings, tax rates in the most expensive states are three times more than those in the least expensive states. New York\u2019s state cigarette excise tax rate is 26 times higher than Missouri\u2019s. And tax rates are nearly 11 percent higher in Blue States than in Red States.\n\nFor the purposes of the study, WalletHub calculated relative income tax obligations by applying the average American\u2019s income to the effective income tax rate in each state and locality.\n\nClick here to see new data on the 10 Worst States for Paying Taxes.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As Americans take stock of their personal finances with Tax Day looming, a new study p", "title": "Is Your State One of the Worst for Paying Taxes?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/08/Your-State-One-Worst-Paying-Taxes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142011_taxes_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/08/Your-State-One-Worst-Paying-Taxes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142011_taxes_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "As Americans take stock of their personal finances with Tax Day looming, a new study p", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "SLIDESHOW: The 10 Worst States for Paying Taxes in 2015It\u2019s not uncommon for the wealthiest Americans and professionals to choose their residency based on where they can count on the least onerous state and local taxes, such as in states like Florida, Delaware or Texas.\nClick here to see new data on the 10 Worst States for Paying Taxes.\nFor the purposes of the study, WalletHub calculated relative income tax obligations by applying the average American\u2019s income to the effective income tax rate in each state and locality.\n\u201cAdditional factors include what others say about quality of life in that city and state, and whether they have family and friends in that area.\u201dBeale added, \u201cMost people don\u2019t decide where to live based on taxes, in part because they usually don\u2019t have full information about complex state and local tax regimes or about the kinds of services paid for by those living in that state and local taxes.\u201dFactors that must be taken into account include not only state income tax rates, but also real estate taxes, vehicle ownership taxes, sales taxes and excise taxes.\nThe consumer research organization WalletHub notes in its study that while the average American household pays roughly $17,000 in federal income taxes each year, \u201cthere is significant disparity when it comes to state and local taxes.\u201d Indeed, taxpayers in the most expensive tax states pay out three-times more in taxes than those in low-tax states."}
