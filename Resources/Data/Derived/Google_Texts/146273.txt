Gulf World Marine Park employees and community members are mourning the loss of one of the park's co-owners.

Brad Miller died Friday afternoon on his farm in Tennessee.

Employees at Gulf World say Miller was supposed to be back in Panama City Beach to work this weekend, when they received a call saying he had passed away.

Ron hardy, another Gulf World co-owner, says his death came as a complete shock to everyone.

Hardy and Miller bought Gulf World back in 1984 and ran the park for 30 years. Then in 2010, Hardy and Miller added two more partners to the park.

Miller was also an active member in the Bay County community.

"He and I always said we would be partners one day, and this was the perfect opportunity, we took it and Brad was just a dynamo," Hardy said. "Very hard worker. Working 12 to 14 hours a day didn't bother him at all. We built Gulf World from when we got it, into a a lot larger place with more animals. I hope the community sees what we have done, and a major attraction in PCB, and Brad was a major influence in that."

At this time, Hardy says he does not know the cause of Miller's death.
