A nice 7% move thus far in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) comes on top of five solid years for stocks, and many strategists are concerned valuation is the big issue with buying stocks now. If today\u2019s selloff is any indication, a bumpy road may be a sign of things for a tired bull market. Despite these issues, Chicago's very own Jack Ablin of BMO Private Bank has three sectors that you can buy right now.\n\nFinancials\n\nOne of the laggards of 2014, financials are a sector Ablin\u2019s eying right now. \u201cThe financials are pretty cheap,\u201d from a relative point of view he says in the attached video. \u201cNet interest margins are virtually nothing, but as the taper concludes, and potentially the 10-year treasury rate (^TNX) rises, then net interest margins increase, lending potentially increases (certainly that\u2019s what the Fed would like to see), and banks move to profitability.\u201d\n\nWith yields potentially rising, Ablin feels this creates a favorable environment for banks.\n\nHealth Care\n\nIn spite of what Janet Yellen had to say about biotech, Ablin\u2019s not shying away from the health care sector. \u201cI think that health care in general, particularly pharma, is still pretty cheap. A lot of it is the Affordable Care Act overhang, I think that as investors learn more about that business and how these companies are making money, they will continue to [make money] as they will have a whole new army of customers.\u201d\n\nEurope\n\nAblin\u2019s looking across the pond for his third selection, as he believes Europe could be a high-growth trade for investors. \u201cWe think that as Europe continues to stimulate, they expand their balance sheet and actually do some QE in Europe, it pushes Europe to slightly more growth,\u201d he says.\n\nFor Ablin, buying Europe could be considered as something of a pairs trade, as he expects money to flow from one particular area in the U.S. into Europe. \u201cWe expect that [investors] will take money out of U.S. small caps where everyone\u2019s hanging out because they\u2019re worried about the rest of the world and want to be insulated here\u2026 I think that baton switches to Europe and money moves from U.S. small caps into Europe.\u201d\n\nAblin does caveat this trade stating he is hedging the Euro back to the U.S. dollar because he sees growth across the pond coming from a weaker Euro.\n\nMore from Investing:\n\nMicrosoft, Facebook, Amazon, Apple highlight biggest week in earnings\n\n\n\nYellen was right, market is overvalued says Johnson\n\n\n\nMain Street prosperity may spell trouble for Wall Street", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "From Yahoo Finance: Jack Ablin of BMO Private Bank gives us his top 3 picks to own right now", "original-source": "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-sectors-to-buy-as-stocks-sell-off-150114069.html", "og": {"site_name": "Yahoo Finance", "description": "Jack Ablin of BMO Private Bank gives us his top 3 picks to own right now", "title": "3 sectors to buy as stocks sell off", "url": "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-sectors-to-buy-as-stocks-sell-off-150114069.html", "image": "http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/p.WhNsoNwAGz7zFzfDqNxQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztpbD1wbGFuZTtxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.pd2upload.com/video.yahoofinance.com@63fc97e8-d456-33c7-9f7e-2371511a73b8_FULL.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jack Ablin of BMO Private Bank gives us his top 3 picks to own right now", "title": "3 sectors to buy as stocks sell off", "image": {"src": "http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/p.WhNsoNwAGz7zFzfDqNxQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztpbD1wbGFuZTtxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.pd2upload.com/video.yahoofinance.com@63fc97e8-d456-33c7-9f7e-2371511a73b8_FULL.jpg", "identifier": "http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/p.WhNsoNwAGz7zFzfDqNxQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztpbD1wbGFuZTtxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.pd2upload.com/video.yahoofinance.com@63fc97e8-d456-33c7-9f7e-2371511a73b8_FULL.jpg"}, "site": "@YahooFinance", "dnt": "on", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 90376669494}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://l.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/presentation/images/icons/win8-tile-1484740.png", "application-name": "3 sectors to buy as stocks sell off", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/yahoofinance"}, "theme-color": "#400090"}, "article_summary": "Despite these issues, Chicago's very own Jack Ablin of BMO Private Bank has three sectors that you can buy right now.\nA nice 7% move thus far in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) comes on top of five solid years for stocks, and many strategists are concerned valuation is the big issue with buying stocks now.\nIf today\u2019s selloff is any indication, a bumpy road may be a sign of things for a tired bull market.\nHealth CareIn spite of what Janet Yellen had to say about biotech, Ablin\u2019s not shying away from the health care sector.\nThe first half is in the books, but where should you be positioned as 2014 rolls on?"}
