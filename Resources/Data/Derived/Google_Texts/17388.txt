Vice President Biden was criticized on Tuesday for putting his hands on Secretary of Defense Ash Carter's wife and whispering in her ear at Carter's swearing-in, but it wasn't the first time Biden has gotten up close and personal with someone.

Biden faced similar criticism in January for whispering to the daughter of Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and then trying to give her a kiss on the head.

Biden has also been photographed close-talking with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan.

But while Biden has raised a few eyebrows, he's proven that he has no problem with hands-on attention, and he doesn't appear to be changing his style any time soon.
