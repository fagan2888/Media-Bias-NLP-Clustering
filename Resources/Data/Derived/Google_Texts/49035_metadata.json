We will then begin to hear State of the State messages from governors that detail the challenges, opportunities and priorities they have defined for the year ahead.\n\nAt AARP, we\u2019ve also set our priorities for 2015 with a state advocacy agenda that highlights how we will continue to fight for you in every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands. We\u2019ll be watching closely as governors and legislators lay out their agendas to make sure our priorities \u2014 your priorities \u2014 are addressed.\n\nHere are our top 2015 legislative priorities, across the states:\n\nSupporting Family Caregivers\n\nToday more than 42 million family caregivers care for parents, husbands, wives and other loved ones to help them stay at home \u2014 and out of costly institutions. That\u2019s why in 2015 we\u2019re working for commonsense solutions to give caregivers more support, help at home, training and more by fighting:\n\nHelping People Live Independently in Their Own Homes and Communities\n\nThe vast majority of older Americans want to stay in their homes and communities as they age. It\u2019s also less costly. In fact, home care is one-third the cost of institutions, like nursing homes. That\u2019s why AARP is calling on state lawmakers to take action and make changes so that individuals receive the services they need to continue living independently in their homes.\n\nEnhancing Retirement Security\n\nToday, millions are facing a retirement deficit, outliving their retirement savings by an average of $57,000 per household. To help you live the life you want in retirement, AARP is fighting for your financial future. Here are two ways how:\n\n55 million Americans don\u2019t have access to a retirement plan at work, a tool that increases savings rates by 1,300 percent. \u201cWork and Save\u201d plans are a commonsense solution that allows employees to save for their future at their job and benefits small businesses, employees and states.\n\nWe\u2019re also working to protect retirees from cuts to their pensions \u2014 because pensions are promises and states need to keep up their end of the deal. Underfunded pension plans need to be shored up, and any changes must be fiscally responsible and protect the financial future of workers and retirees.\n\nStanding Up for Consumers\n\nFair utilities: You should pay only what\u2019s fair and reasonable for reliable utility service \u2014 that\u2019s why we\u2019re fighting against unfair utility rates. We\u2019re working to defeat unreasonable rate increases and charges, to make sure you have a voice at the table when utility companies want to raise your rates and ensure consumer protections.\n\nFinancial exploitation: We\u2019re also helping to safeguard older Americans from financial abuse, by enacting laws that help prevent, detect, report and assign penalties against elder financial exploitation, preserve funding for adult protective services and more.\n\nAccessing Affordable Health Coverage\n\nMany hard-working Americans who have lost their jobs or are struggling in jobs without health coverage have no access to affordable care. AARP is fighting in states across the country to expand access to affordable care and give these hard-working families the security of knowing they can get the health care they need.\n\nDesigning Livable Communities for All Ages\n\nWe need to make communities more livable for all ages. This could be barrier-free buildings and streets as well as more convenient access to services, businesses and green spaces. This includes legislation like Safe Streets to promote effective transportation planning, coordination and funding to address the needs of all residents.\n\nFor more advocacy news from across the country, sign up for the AARP Advocates e-newsletter or visit your state Web page.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nElaine Ryan is the vice president of state advocacy and strategy integration (SASI) for AARP.
