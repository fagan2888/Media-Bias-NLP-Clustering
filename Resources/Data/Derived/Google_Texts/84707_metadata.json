David Ake\n\nOn Friday, Talking Points Memo reported that a company named USHealth Group is actively encouraging consumers to buy individual health plans outside of Obamacare\u2019s marketplaces that provide shoddy benefits, don\u2019t qualify for federal subsidies, and won\u2019t even meet the Affordable Care Act\u2019s minimum coverage requirement. Since that doesn\u2019t fulfill the individual mandate, consumers with those plans would still have to pay a tax penalty under Obamacare.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s part of a larger trend of insurers using general confusion over the health law to hawk substandard plans that do little to protect consumers if they get sick or need extensive medical treatment.\n\nThe company at the heart of TMP\u2019s investigation has been insisting that Americans don\u2019t need the benefits levels required of policies sold through the Obamacare marketplaces, and that USHealth Group\u2019s plans are more affordable than marketplace plans even when taking the tax penalty for lacking sufficient coverage into account.\n\nBut these plans aren\u2019t really health \u201cinsurance\u201d in any real sense of the word. Many of them come with low annual and lifetime caps on the amount of care they\u2019ll pay for, meaning consumers with such plans may as well be uninsured if they suffer a catastrophic illness or accident. More than 60 percent of U.S. bankruptcies are over high medical bills, and a full three-quarters of these Americans who go bankrupt over health care costs actually had private insurance when they got sick.\n\nOther insurance companies are also trying out creative ways to bypass Obamacare\u2019s consumer protections and benefit requirements while consumers remain confused about reform. For instance, Arkansas Blue Cross Blue Shield has been offering a policy called the Essential Blue Freedom Plan. BCBS has been promoting this policy as \u201cfull coverage\u201d plan that has \u201cbenefits that are not dictated by the new health care law,\u201d according to Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms blog. That makes the plan cheaper from a premium perspective, but it also comes with a $1 million lifetime cap, severely limit mental health benefits, and doesn\u2019t even cover maternity care.\n\nBCBS only gets away with selling this policy because the company offers it as a so-called \u201climited duration plans.\u201d These plans are meant to, as the name implies, offer temporary and transitional coverage. But BCBS is selling Essential Blue Freedom as a 364-day plan. That technically meets the definition of \u201climited duration\u201d but is an obvious distortion of such policies\u2019 original intent. Customers who buy this plan would also have to pay Obamacare\u2019s tax penalty for having insufficient coverage.\n\nStudies have repeatedly found that Americans remain confused about what Obamacare actually does, which makes them susceptible to these type of misleading campaigns from insurance companies.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Unscrupulous insurance companies are resorting to creative methods to convince Americans to buy insurance that provides little financial protection if they get sick and need medical care.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Unscrupulous insurance companies are resorting to creative methods to convince Americans to buy insurance that provides little financial protection if they get sick and need medical care.", "title": "Insurers Capitalize On Mass Obamacare Confusion To Dupe Consumers Into Buying Junk Health Plans", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/11/15/2948841/shady-insurance-companies-obamacare-confusion/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ACA_application-e1384530142743.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Unscrupulous insurance companies are resorting to creative methods to convince Americans to buy insurance that provides little financial protection if they get sick and need medical care.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ACA_application-e1384268027311-321x214.jpg", "title": "Insurers Capitalize On Mass Obamacare Confusion To Dupe Consumers Into Buying Junk Health Plans", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ACA_application-e1384530142743.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ACA_application-e1384530142743.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-15T12:03:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd5d8\"", "article_summary": "Health Insurers Capitalize On Mass Obamacare Confusion To Dupe Consumers Into Buying Junk Health Plans CREDIT: AP Photo/J.\nBut these plans aren\u2019t really health \u201cinsurance\u201d in any real sense of the word.\nSince that doesn\u2019t fulfill the individual mandate, consumers with those plans would still have to pay a tax penalty under Obamacare.\nFor instance, Arkansas Blue Cross Blue Shield has been offering a policy called the Essential Blue Freedom Plan.\nBCBS has been promoting this policy as \u201cfull coverage\u201d plan that has \u201cbenefits that are not dictated by the new health care law,\u201d according to Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms blog."}
