Times.\n\nThis is in line with a 2013 Justice Department policy that promised to stop most federal marijuana prosecutions in states that have legalized the possession or sale of pot. Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia have all moved to legalize the drug, though the D.C. law may be scaled back by the so-called \u201cCRomnibus\u201d spending bill.\n\nSome tribes believes marijuana sales could prove to be a good source of revenue, much like the cigarette sales and Native American casinos, but many other tribes are strongly opposed.\n\nPurdon told the L.A. Times that the majority of Native American tribes appear to be against allowing marijuana use on their territory.\n\nTribes that don\u2019t want to legalize marijuana on their reservations can ask federal officials to enforce the law, he said, otherwise they will remain hands off.\n\n\u201cThe tribes have the sovereign right to set the code on their reservations,\u201d Purdon said.\n\nTribes that choose to allow it will have to meet eight federal guidelines,such as not selling to minors and not transporting it to areas that prohibit it.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "In this Nov. 5, 2014, file photo, a sample of cannabis appears on display at Shango Premium Cannabis dispensary in Portland, Ore.
