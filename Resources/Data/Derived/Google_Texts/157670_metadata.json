Like the two women, many of those at the vigil came to Hong Kong as domestic workers.\n\nBritish banker Rurik George Caton Jutting, 29, has been charged with murdering the two women but has not yet entered a plea. On Nov. 1, he led police to his 31st-floor upscale apartment near the city\u2019s Wan Chai red-light district, where they found the two women\u2019s bodies.\n\nNingsih\u2019s cousin, Jumiati, said at the vigil that she had last seen Ningsih in August in their home village in Indonesia. Like many Indonesians, Jumiati goes by only one name.\n\nShe said she called police about a week ago to report that Ningsih was missing and later was asked to identify her body. She said her cousin lived in Wan Chai.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indonesians pray for Hong Kong stabbing victims", "title": "Indonesians pray for Hong Kong stabbing victims", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Indonesians pray for Hong Kong stabbing victims", "title": "Indonesians pray for Hong Kong stabbing victims", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/09/indonesians_pray_for_hong_kong_stabbing_victims/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/hong-kong-women-killed.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Indonesians pray for Hong Kong stabbing victims", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/hong-kong-women-killed.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Indonesians pray for Hong Kong stabbing victims", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde636\"", "article_summary": "Like the two women, many of those at the vigil came to Hong Kong as domestic workers.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsHONG KONG (AP) \u2014 More than 100 Indonesians in Hong Kong held a prayer vigil and demanded justice Sunday for two Indonesian women found stabbed to death in a case that has shocked this city.\nLike many Indonesians, Jumiati goes by only one name.\nOn Nov. 1, he led police to his 31st-floor upscale apartment near the city\u2019s Wan Chai red-light district, where they found the two women\u2019s bodies.\nNingsih\u2019s cousin, Jumiati, said at the vigil that she had last seen Ningsih in August in their home village in Indonesia."}
