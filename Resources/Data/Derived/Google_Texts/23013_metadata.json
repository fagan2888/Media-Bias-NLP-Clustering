It has been below zero 42 times since 1946.\n\nHe said \u201cthere are no jobs\u201d to be had. In fact, there were 5.4 million job openings recorded at the end of April, the most in 15 years.\n\nHe said the \u201creal\u201d unemployment rate is \u201canywhere from 18 to 20 percent\u201d and \u201cmaybe even 21 percent.\u201d We see no factual basis for this opinion.\n\nHe boasted he would have blocked new Ford plants in Mexico by threatening to impose a 35 percent tax on vehicles and parts made in Mexico and shipped to the U.S. But only Congress can impose taxes and such a tax would violate the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nTrump claimed the five Taliban leaders exchanged for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl \u201care now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.\u201d But all five remain in Qatar, where they continue to be monitored and are subject to a travel ban, according to the State Department.\n\nHe also made the misleading claim that health care premium costs are going \u201cup 29, 39, 49 and even 55 percent.\u201d He\u2019s talking about some proposed rate increases on the individual market that still need regulatory approval. There are also proposed rate decreases or single-digit increases that did not have to be submitted for review.\n\nOn the Economy\n\nTrump, who gave his speech in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City, becomes the 12th Republican to officially join the race. The billionaire developer promised strong leadership and savvy economic stewardship. But he went too far in talking down the present state of the economy.\n\nGDP: Trump said, \u201cLast quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product \u2013 a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It\u2019s never below zero.\u201d That\u2019s pure nonsense.\n\nActually, the quarterly change in real GDP has been below zero 42 times since 1946, including a drop exactly one year before the most recent one.\n\nTrump was referring to the 0.7 percent drop in the annualized rate of real (inflation-adjusted) GDP growth that Commerce Department statisticians reported on May 29. The drop came as no surprise, given the record snowfall that paralyzed Boston and much of the Northeast in February, and the near-record snow that covered the Chicago area and much of the Midwest. There had been an even bigger, 2.1 percent drop in the January-March quarter of 2014, also attributed partly to bad weather.\n\nCurrently, all indications are that growth has resumed at a modest pace. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimated on June 16 that real GDP is increasing this quarter at an annual rate of 1.9 percent, while the \u201cBlue Chip\u201d consensus of private economists falls in the 2 percent to 4 percent range.\n\nOpinions can differ on whether the current growth rate represents \u201cstrength\u201d or not. And we\u2019re not sure how seriously Trump meant his \u201cnever\u201d comment to be taken, even though he repeated it for emphasis. In any case, it\u2019s not true.\n\n\u201cNo jobs\u201d: Trump said, \u201cA lot of people up there can\u2019t get jobs. They can\u2019t get jobs. Because there are no jobs.\u201d\n\nActually, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on June 9 that the number of job openings at the end of April had increased to 5.4 million, the most job openings since the bureau began tracking them in December 2000.\n\nThe previous record came in January 2001. The new record is 1.1 million higher than the number of job openings recorded in November 2007, the month before the Great Recession of 2007-2009 began. And the number of openings has more than doubled \u2014 increasing by 3.2 million \u2014 since hitting the low point in July 2009.\n\n\u201cReal\u201d Unemployment: Trump said, \u201c[O]ur real unemployment [rate] is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don\u2019t believe the 5.6. Don\u2019t believe it. \u2026 The real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent.\u201d\n\nWe see no factual basis for this claim. Trump is going well beyond the exaggeration that Mitt Romney made during the 2012 campaign that the \u201creal\u201d unemployment rate was 15 percent. And back then, the official rate was 8.3 percent, compared with the current rate \u2014 which is actually 5.5 percent, not the 5.6 percent Trump cited.\n\nRomney was referring to an alternative measure that is meant as the broadest measure of under-employment. That measure \u2014 called \u201cU-6\u2033 \u2014 adds in people who have part-time jobs but are looking for full-time work, \u201cdiscouraged workers\u201d who aren\u2019t looking for work because they don\u2019t believe jobs are available, and all others \u201cmarginally attached\u201d to the workforce, meaning those who say they want to work and would work if offered a job, and who have looked for work sometime within the past year but not within the last four weeks. (Only those who say they have looked for work in the last four weeks are officially counted as unemployed.)\n\nCurrently, that U-6 rate stands at 10.8 percent, well below where it was in 2012, though still not down to the 8.4 percent rate of November 2007, the month before the Great Recession of 2007-2009 began.\n\nSo where does Trump get his 18 percent to 21 percent range? The highest number we found from any economist comes from Peter Morici, an economist at the University of Maryland, who has argued that the \u201creal\u201d rate is \u201cat least 18 percent.\u201d In addition to categories included in the U-6 measure, Morici counts what he calls \u201cthe effects of immigration.\u201d And he also adds in the \u201cmany\u201d students who are being \u201cduped\u201d into applying for \u201cuseless programs\u201d at universities and for-profit schools.\n\n\u201cThey would likely be in the labor force now but for easy access to federally sponsored loans,\u201d Morici wrote. \u201cAdding in these students, the real unemployment rate among U.S. citizens and permanent residents is at least 18 percent.\u201d\n\nBut even that 18 percent estimate is a bit out of date. The U-6 rate has dropped another 1.4 percentage points since his article was published on July 31, 2014. Morici, in a telephone interview, said that if he were to run his calculations again, the \u201creal\u201d rate would likely be \u201cin the range of 15 percent now.\u201d\n\nOn Manufacturing Jobs\n\nIn April, American automaker Ford announced that it was putting $2.5 billion into building new engine and transmission plants in Mexico. The company said that it expects the deal will bring 3,800 new direct jobs to that country.\n\nBut Trump believes this is bad for the U.S., and said that as president, he would impose a huge tax on Ford vehicles and parts manufactured in Mexico and shipped to the U.S.\n\n\u201cEvery car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we\u2019re going to charge you a 35 percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that\u2019s it,\u201d he said.\n\nBut only Congress, not the president, can impose taxes. And Trump\u2019s tax proposal would likely run afoul of current international trade agreements.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s tax would violate the current North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, for most cars and car parts sourced from Mexico,\u201d wrote Sean McAlinden, chief economist and executive vice president of research for the Center for Automotive Research, in an email to us.\n\nMcAlinden said that under NAFTA, new vehicles and parts containing 60 percent North American manufacturing content are allowed tariff free access to all three countries.\n\nHe added that Trump\u2019s proposal \u201cmay also violate WTO (World Trade Organization) agreements signed by the U.S. that do not allow an increase in a tariff once it has been lowered except as an anti-dumping fine (which must be proven).\u201d\n\nBut McAlinden noted that Congress could possibly vote to revoke NAFTA and vote to withdraw from the WTO. And as president, Trump could sign that legislation into law.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t alone in wanting to make it tougher for U.S. companies to move operations outside the country. The AFL-CIO union has also argued that NAFTA, instead of boosting American jobs, has \u201cmade outsourcing to Mexico much more attractive for U.S. companies.\u201d\n\nEven so, Trump\u2019s proposal to tax Ford wouldn\u2019t be as simple as picking up the phone and threatening the CEO with a huge import tax.\n\nOn the Taliban Five\n\nTrump claimed the five Taliban leaders exchanged for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl \u201care now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.\u201d But all five remain in Qatar, where they continue to be monitored and are subject to a travel ban, according to the State Department. A department spokeswoman says none of them has returned to the battlefield.\n\nTrump argued that President Obama is a \u201cbad negotiator\u201d based on the deal the president approved to swap Bergdahl for five Taliban figures detained at Guantanamo Bay. Bergdahl, who was held captive by the Taliban for five years after wandering away from his base in Afghanistan, was charged on March 25 with desertion and misbehaving before the enemy.\n\nTrump, June 16: He [Obama] is the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there. We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That\u2019s the negotiator we have.\n\nAs part of the exchange, the five Taliban leaders were taken to Qatar, with the understanding that they would be monitored for a year and would be subject to a travel ban. That yearlong travel ban/monitoring was extended at the end of May, and no date was provided for when those restrictions might be lifted.\n\nIn January, CNN reported that according to multiple U.S. military and intelligence officials, one of the so-called Taliban Five \u201chas attempted to return to militant activity from his current location in Qatar by making contact with suspected Taliban associates in Afghanistan.\u201d And on March 25, Fox News, citing an unnamed \u201cgovernment official familiar with the intelligence,\u201d reported that \u201c[a]t least three of the five Taliban leaders traded last year for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl have tried to plug back into their old terror networks.\u201d\n\nState Department officials, however, have vehemently contested the claim that any of the men have rejoined the battlefield.\n\n\u201cWell, what I can say since their release is that none of the five individuals has returned to the battlefield,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said at a June 5 press briefing. \u201cAll five men are subject to a travel ban and none have left Qatar. None of the individuals has engaged in physical violence. Many actions have been taken to restrict their activities, of course. And so I know there was a lot of discussion about this earlier about their possible re-engagement, and none of the five have returned to the battlefield.\u201d\n\nHarf told us via email that nothing has changed in the two weeks since she made that statement.\n\nOn Health Care\n\nTrump made the misleading claim that health care premium \u201ccosts are going for people up 29, 39, 49 and even 55 percent.\u201d He\u2019s talking about proposed rate increases for 2016 for some plans on the individual market, but it\u2019s unclear whether such increases will be approved by state insurance regulators. And other plans have proposed decreases in rates, or single-digit increases that didn\u2019t have to be submitted for review.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires insurers to submit any proposed rate increase above 10 percent for individual and small-group market plans to state and federal regulators for review. Insurers must publicly disclose the proposed increases and explain why they are necessary.\n\nThese plans would be sold on the state and federal exchanges, as well as through insurance brokers for individuals buying their own plans. Most Americans get their insurance coverage through work, and their premiums have been rising at low rates for the past few years.\n\nThe average annual family-plan premium for employer-sponsored policies went up 3 percent from 2013 to 2014, according to the latest annual employer survey from the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research & Educational Trust. The press release on the survey noted: \u201cPremiums increased more slowly over the past five years than the preceding five years (26 percent vs. 34 percent) and well below the annual double-digit increases recorded in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\u201d\n\nBut the individual market is different, and how premiums can be priced has changed under the ACA. Insurers must now accept anyone who wants insurance, and they can\u2019t charge policyholders more based on health status. Plans also must cover certain minimum benefit standards.\n\nIn early June, as the Associated Press explained, the federal government released the rate increase proposals for the individual market, and indeed, some of them are quite high. \u201cDozens of health insurers say higher-than-expected care costs and other expenses blindsided them this year, and they\u2019re going to have to hike premiums for individual policies well-beyond 10 percent for 2016,\u201d the AP reported, citing a 26 percent increase sought by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, and about 20 percent increases proposed by plans in Illinois, Florida and other states.\n\nTrump cites a 55 percent increase, and, in fact, there are plans that have requested increases that high, and even above. In New Mexico, one Blue Cross Blue Shield plan is proposing a 65 percent increase; the same plan decreased its premium rate by nearly 2 percent for 2015. Another New Mexico BCBS plan that dropped rates by 2.37 percent for 2015 is seeking a 58.75 percent increase for next year. This information is available on HealthCare.gov, where people can search for their specific health plan to see if their insurer has proposed an increase above 10 percent.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico said that \u201cthe main driver\u201d of the proposed increase is that the claims were \u201csignificantly higher than expected.\u201d\n\nMinnesota is another state in which some plans are requesting very high increases, above 50 percent. Other plans in the state have proposed increases around 20 percent or 10 percent.\n\nThe actual rate increases could be lower. As the AP story said, \u201cRegulators in many states have the power to reject price increases, and many who don\u2019t are expected to at least pressure insurers to soften their plans.\u201d\n\nSome states, like New Mexico and Minnesota, also are experiencing more extreme proposals than others. In Ohio, for instance, only two of the 16 rate request increases exceed 20 percent.\n\nAnd, again, these proposals only include plans that are seeking increases above 10 percent. The Indianapolis Star published a story on June 15, showing that four of the nine insurance companies on the ACA exchange in Indiana are proposing to decrease premiums for 2016, some by double-digit percentages. Anthem of Indianapolis, which does the most business on the exchange for the state, has proposed a 3.8 percent rate increase.\n\nIndividuals also can switch to lower-cost plans. As we wrote last year, the New York Times analyzed premium data for the exchanges for 2015 and found that many who stuck with the same plan could see increases, as high as 20 percent. But not if they shopped around. \u201cIn a typical county, the price will rise 5 percent for the cheapest silver plan and 4 percent for the second cheapest,\u201d the Times wrote.\n\n\u2014 Brooks Jackson, D\u2019Angelo Gore, Robert Farley and Lori Robertson\n\nCorrection, June 17: In our original article we identified Peter Morici as a Fox News contributor.
