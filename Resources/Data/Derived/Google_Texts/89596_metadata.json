Mark Nakagawa, his smooth voice betraying his Crenshaw District roots, \u201cthat I expect, if not hope, that everyone here tonight will conduct themselves with decorum, treat each other with respect, and have an honest dialogue without being vindictive or mean.\u201d\n\nOver 150 people, mostly over the age of 60, filled the church\u2019s common room. They were gathered to express their concerns about Keiro Senior HealthCare \u2014 not only the nonprofit organization\u2019s decision to sell its residential care facilities for $41 million but also the way it communicated that decision to the community.\n\nLast week, corporations Pacifica, Aspen, and Northstar (the buyer and future operators of the facilities, respectively) officially agreed to the conditions put forth by the state attorney general, which require new management to keep certain integral policies\u2014like Japanese-focused service and acceptance of Medicare and Medi-Cal\u2014in place for the next five years.\n\nThe committee, led by Co-Chairs Mo Nishida and Charles Igawa, comprised only 10 people, but the group brought together a panel of speakers, including local doctors and one family member of a resident. Doctors Takeshi Matsumoto, Ronald Shigematsu, and Kenji Irie, along with Dr. Sumi Kawaratani, who sat in the audience, all together care for at least two-thirds of Keiro\u2019s residents.\n\n\u201cI have difficulty being critical of the CEO and the board because these are good people,\u201d said Dr. Matsumoto, who came to the meeting wearing scrubs, \u201cand they\u2019ve probably done more for the community than all of us put together, each one of them. But I have to speak for my patients. Most of them feel very abandoned by all of this. They\u2019re anxious, they\u2019re depressed, they don\u2019t know what to do, and they\u2019ve just totally lost trust in this institution they thought they trusted.\u201d\n\nThe physicians and fellow panelist, psychologist Keiko Ikeda, raised specific questions about the sale from a healthcare industry perspective, questions like: Why was the retirement home sold when it functions like an apartment and therefore isn\u2019t affected by the Affordable Care Act? Why not hire a consultation firm to help manage the nursing home? And will Pacifica continue to honor Medicare and Medi-Cal after the five-year conditional period ends?\n\nAccording to Dr. Ikeda, the full price for one month in one of the two nursing homes is between $6,450 and $11,700. If Pacifica chooses not to honor Medicare and Medi-Cal, the facilities will become prohibitively expensive for residents.\n\nDoctors Matsumoto and Shigematsu both said that the entire healthcare industry has been impacted by the Affordable Care Act and must adapt to its new conditions. The new policy alone is not reason enough to sell, they argued.\n\nCommunity members spoke mostly about their concern for current and future residents and their frustration at not being able to get through to administrators at Keiro, whom they wished would hold an open forum of their own.\n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Helen Funai Erickson told The Rafu Shimpo after the meeting. Erickson volunteers at Keiro, where her mother was once a resident. \u201cThe board are wealthy people, they\u2019ve donated millions of dollars to our community over the years, they\u2019re good-hearted people, and yet they won\u2019t meet with us. Does that make sense?\u201d\n\nBecause Keiro is a nonprofit dependent on donations, many in the room felt that it should be more receptive to community wishes. Dr. Irie received applause from the crowd when he said about the sale, \u201cThat choice should have been made by the community, not the board.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Ad Hoc Committee is coming together late in the game \u2014 when the sale has already been approved by the attorney general, and the buyer and operators have agreed to conditions \u2014 its members hold out hope that the sale can still be stopped before escrow closes early next year. The group has begun circulating a petition, which it will collect on Oct. 15.\n\nChair of the Keiro Board of Directors Gary Kawaguchi attended the meeting, choosing a seat close to the back of the room without announcing his presence. Even as discussion of the board grew heated, he listened quietly and took notes.\n\nToward the end of the audience question-and-answer session, former Assemblymember Warren Furutani approached the microphone to give his perspective. The Japanese American community is changing all across the country, he said, and those changes have affected other senior homes, like Seattle Keiro (no relation to Keiro in Los Angeles) and Kimochi in San Francisco. Both of those homes have reacted by becoming more pan-Asian American.\n\nWith tension in the room somewhat defused after Furutani\u2019s comment, Kawaguchi came forward to introduce himself and give a statement of his own. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be here to answer your questions because if I start, I think we\u2019ll be here all night,\u201d he said. \u201cI listened to the questions that you\u2019ve had, and we\u2019ll try to answer that in one way or another.\u201d When he suggested looking for facts on the Keiro website, one audience member booed.\n\n\u201cGary,\u201d said Furutani, \u201cI think it would really help tonight \u2014 and I know you can\u2019t make promises for the whole board \u2014 but I think one clear message is people want to have a meeting with the board. I just think the conversation would de-escalate all these problems, and if you don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the night, the Ad Hoc Committee to Save Keiro had more than doubled in size, reaching 25 members. Although Keiro said in an interview with The Rafu Shimpo that Pacifica, Aspen, and Northstar\u2019s approval of the attorney general\u2019s conditions meant the sale was final, the committee has its eye on the close of escrow, still at least three months away.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t lose hope,\u201d said audience member Tom Okabe, a real estate broker. \u201cI don\u2019t want to overstep my bounds, but any escrow can be stopped until the money is transferred, the contracts are signed, and the deed is given over. We\u2019ve still got time.\u201d\n\nThis is an ongoing story.
