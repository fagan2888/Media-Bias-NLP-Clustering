Pennsylvania Ave. Four victims were involved including two children.\n\nMiranda Dustin, 23, told police three armed men kicked in the door and assaulted him in the head with a gun. He said the men then tied them all up and robbed them.\n\nOnce they were out of sight, Dustin chased the men in his vehicle until he spotted an officer and pointed out their truck. The officer attempted to initiate a traffic stop, but the truck turned onto I-44 N. and then traveled I-40 W. The truck turned around and began traveling on I-40 E where police attempted to end the pursuit by using stop sticks, but the suspects just drove around them. The pursuit ended at S.E. 89th and I-35, and Boomer, Miller and Lee were taken into custody for robbery with a dangerous weapon.\n\nAccording to police, the home appeared to have been ransacked and a white zip tie was found on the bedroom floor. Boomer, Miller and Lee left the residence with cash, TVs, jewelry and two cell phones.\n\nAs stated in the police report, Dustin \"believed they were getting their orders from someone else, because one of them was on the phone and kept asking where the drugs were at.\"\n\nHe also mentioned he had told the suspects he didn't have drugs in the home. Police asked Dustin if he would sign for a search warrant of the home, and Dustin agreed.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "Oklahoma City police arrested three men after a home invasion early Tuesday morning in central Oklahoma City.", "author": "News9.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/24635251/three-arrested-after-overnight-home-invasion-in-central-okc", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24635251_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Oklahoma City police arrested three men after a home invasion early Tuesday morning in central Oklahoma City.", "title": "Three Arrested After Overnight Home Invasion In Central OKC"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24635251_SA.jpg", "description": "Oklahoma City police arrested three men after a home invasion early Tuesday morning in central Oklahoma City.", "card": "summary", "title": "Three Arrested After Overnight Home Invasion In Central OKC"}, "wnreadableurl": "three-arrested-after-overnight-home-invasion-in-central-okc", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/02/04", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,crime, police, arrest, three, men, home, invasion, robbery, tuesday, morning, central, news 9, news9.com, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS30", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,crime, police, arrest, three, men, home, invasion, robbery, tuesday, morning, central, news 9, news9.com, kwtv"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2947\"", "article_summary": "Oklahoma City police arrested three men after a home invasion early Tuesday morning in central Oklahoma City.\n89th and I-35, and Boomer, Miller and Lee were taken into custody for robbery with a dangerous weapon.\nBoomer, Miller and Lee were taken into custody for robbery with a dangerous weapon.\nBoomer, Miller and Lee left the residence with cash, TVs, jewelry and two cell phones.\nMiranda Dustin, 23, told police three armed men kicked in the door and assaulted him in the head with a gun."}
