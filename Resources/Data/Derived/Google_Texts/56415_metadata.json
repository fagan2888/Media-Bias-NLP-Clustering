The announcement comes after allegations of duplicated images of DNA fragments, as well as plagiarism, in the articles.\n\nThe RIKEN research institute released a report saying it had appointed an investigative committee to review any \u201cmisconduct\u201d that may have taken place in the course of the research, though the veracity of the research itself is not being contested.\n\nThe investigators are looking for \u201csignificant discrepancies\u201d in the articles. \u201cIt may become necessary to demand the withdrawal of the articles,\u201d RIKEN President Ryoji Noyori, a Nobel laureate in chemistry, said at a news conference in Tokyo, according to CBS News.\n\nThe investigative committee, however, stated that thus far it had found a few inappropriate instances of data handling but \u201cthe circumstances were not judged to constitute research misconduct,\u201d RIKEN explained in a statement.\n\nThe results of the study had originally been called \u201cgame-changing,\u201d as they had defined a new method to grow tissue that would ultimately treat diseases like diabetes and Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nThe experiment involved reprogramming animal cells back into an embryonic state, which would give them the ability to generate plenty of different kinds of tissue. Researchers were able to transform the blood cells of newborn mice by soaking them in mildly acidic solution for half an hour, which caused a shock that left them pluripontent, or able to regenerate into different kinds of tissues.\n\n\u201c[T]his could be the game changer that ultimately makes a wide range of cell therapies available using the patient\u2019s own cells as starting material \u2014 the age of personalized medicine would have finally arrived,\u201d Chris Mason, chair of regenerative medicine bioprocessing at University College London, told Reuters. Mason, who had not been involved in the study, also added that it would be \u201cthe most simple, lowest-cost and quickest method\u201d to create stem cells.\n\nThree of the paper\u2019s authors agreed to retracting the study, but in order for it to be fully removed, all authors and the journal in which it was published, Nature, must come to a consensus.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "japanese lab, riken, stem cell research retraction, pluripotent cells, stem cell study", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A recent article on stem cells may be retracted after allegations of plagiarism and other discrepancies, a Japanese lab announced.", "title": "Japanese Lab To Retract \u2018Ground-Breaking\u2019 Stem Cell Study Over \u2018Misconduct\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/japanese-lab-retract-ground-breaking-stem-cell-study-over-misconduct-and-discrepancies-271363", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/16/lab-work.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A recent article on stem cells may be retracted after allegations of plagiarism and other discrepancies, a Japanese lab announced.", "title": "Japanese Lab To Retract \u2018Ground-Breaking\u2019 Stem Cell Study Over \u2018Misconduct\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/japanese-lab-retract-ground-breaking-stem-cell-study-over-misconduct-and-discrepancies-271363", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/16/lab-work.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/16/lab-work.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-03-16T19:22:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-16T19:22:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A recent article on stem cells may be retracted after allegations of plagiarism and other discrepancies, a Japanese lab announced."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd311\"", "article_summary": "The 'ground-breaking' stem cell research published recently is under investigation by a Japanese lab, after allegations of plagiarism and discrepancies in the reports.\nA lab funded by the Japanese government has begun the process of possibly retracting a so-called ground-breaking study on stem cells due to \u201cinappropriate handling\u201d of data, they announced Friday.\nMason, who had not been involved in the study, also added that it would be \u201cthe most simple, lowest-cost and quickest method\u201d to create stem cells.\nThe RIKEN research institute released a report saying it had appointed an investigative committee to review any \u201cmisconduct\u201d that may have taken place in the course of the research, though the veracity of the research itself is not being contested.\nThe announcement comes after allegations of duplicated images of DNA fragments, as well as plagiarism, in the articles."}
