That includes the charges for the surgeon, operating room, image scans done during the procedure, anesthesia and an office visit after the surgery.\n\nNationally, medical care prices have been rising faster than most other prices during the past 12 months, and hospitals have had incentive to share price information for the past two years since the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began revealing what it pays.\n\nLehigh Valley Health Network, which includes Lehigh Valley Hospital-Hazleton, is studying a way to provide prices to patients.\n\n\u201cWe are still evaluating what that will look like and what is really best for our patients,\u201d Lehigh Valley said in a statement.\n\nSt. Luke\u2019s when creating PriceChecker kept in mind patients who pay high deductibles through their medical insurance, rather than patients insured by Medicare and Medicaid. Low-cost insurance plans with high deductibles have become more common since the Affordable Care Act required Americans to purchase healthcare insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nAt St. Luke\u2019s, PriceChecker is available for several types of surgeries and imaging scans.\n\nThe bundled price, however, doesn\u2019t always cover everything.\n\nHuman bodies differ, St. Luke\u2019s points out, and patients get a separate bill for any extra services required, such as lab tests of specimens and scans done before or after the procedure.\n\nA colonoscopy, for example, costs $1,050, but if the procedure finds cancer, the cost for treating the cancer is extra for the patients or their insurers.\n\n\u201cWe have a number of payment plans and options for patients in need,\u201d Kenneth Szydlow, a spokesman for St. Luke\u2019s, said by email.\n\nAt Geisinger Health Systems, based in Danville, patients have been offered a guaranteed price for heart surgeries since 2006. The price covers any additional work required up to 90 days after the surgery, and Geisinger expanded the plan called ProvenCare to a few other procedures.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began posting average charges for 100 procedures at 3,300 American hospitals on its website two years ago.\n\nSome websites collate the CMS data for consumers.\n\nNerdWallet.com has an online tool to compare hospital prices. Typing in Hazleton, PA, for example, yields a list of charges for hip replacements at nine area hospitals.\n\nThe website OpsCost.com provides the list of average prices that Medicare paid for dozens of procedures, such as MRI scans. Again by typing in Hazleton, PA, users can find the average cost paid at 10 area hospitals.\n\nThe cost of medical care commodities, which climbed 0.7 percent in February, the biggest spike in eight years, is up 3.4 percent for the 12 months ending in August, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Medical care services are up 2.2 percent during that span, while the bureau\u2019s Consumer Price Index for all items is up 0.2 percent.\n\nkjackson@standardspeaker.com", "article_metadata": {"author": "By KENT JACKSON", "title": "St. Luke\u2019s introduces PriceChecker system", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "By KENT JACKSON", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1958069"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "DC.title": "St. Luke\u2019s introduces PriceChecker system"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e00\"", "article_summary": "The system quotes a bundled price for the same operation at any of St. Luke\u2019s hospitals in Pennsylvania, including St. Luke\u2019s Miners Campus in Coaldale.\nAt St. Luke\u2019s, PriceChecker is available for several types of surgeries and imaging scans.\nSt. Luke\u2019s when creating PriceChecker kept in mind patients who pay high deductibles through their medical insurance, rather than patients insured by Medicare and Medicaid.\nPatients can find out how much their surgery will cost by dialing a phone or clicking a computer now that St. Luke\u2019s University Health Network rolled out PriceChecker.\n\u201cWe have a number of payment plans and options for patients in need,\u201d Kenneth Szydlow, a spokesman for St. Luke\u2019s, said by email."}
