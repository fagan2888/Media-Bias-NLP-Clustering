In doing so, administration officials say that the department will provide customized technical assistance by developing the schools\u2019 educational leadership skills and delivering resources informed by best practices in student support, instruction, financial management, organizational management, teacher training, recruitment, and retention.\n\n\u201cWe are very encouraged by the President\u2019s remarks and his commitment to improving education for Native American youth,\u201d said Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II, whose tribe hosted the President and First Lady at Friday\u2019s Flag Day Wacipi Celebration. \u201cWe are pleased that the President has demonstrated his dedication to strengthening the Bureau of Indian Education, through additional funding and policy improvements, which we remain hopeful will include the opportunity for tribes to pursue charter schools while utilizing BIE assistance. The tribe looks forward to working with the Administration on this important issue.\u201d\n\nThe plan was developed by a \u201cstudy group\u201d of more than 400 stakeholders in Indian education after a series of tribal consultations around the country earlier this year, which included Lone Man Day School in Oglala, South Dakota; Riverside Indian School in Anadarko, Oklahoma; Muckleshoot School in Auburn, Washington; and Gila River Head Start Building in Sacaton, Arizona.\n\nAdditionally, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held an oversight hearing on May 21 in which Melvin Monette, President of the National Indian Education Association and a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, testified that the current crisis in Indian education was due in part to the federal government\u2019s \u201cinability\u201d to uphold its trust responsibilities and obligations in regards to Native education.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Following President Barack Obama\u2019s visit Friday, the White House announced n plan to strengthen education and economic development in Indian country.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/16/president-obama-follows-visit-strong-action-plan-indian-country-155315", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/president_barack_obama_and_first_lady_in_cannon_ball_2014_-_courtesy_pete_souza_white_house.jpeg", "type": "article", "title": "President Obama Follows Visit With Strong Action Plan for Indian Country"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "President Obama Follows Visit With Strong Action Plan for Indian Country"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/16/president-obama-follows-visit-strong-action-plan-indian-country-155315", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-16T11:00-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, Native American Education, Native Education, Tribal Education, Native American Economic Development, Native Economic Development, Dave Archambault II", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.title": "President Obama Follows Visit With Strong Action Plan for Indian Country"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02dd\"", "article_summary": "In the wake of Friday\u2019s visit by President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota, the White House released an action plan to help strengthen and sustain at least two of Obama\u2019s biggest initiatives in Indian country: Education and Economic Development.\nAdditionally, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held an oversight hearing on May 21 in which Melvin Monette, President of the National Indian Education Association and a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, testified that the current crisis in Indian education was due in part to the federal government\u2019s \u201cinability\u201d to uphold its trust responsibilities and obligations in regards to Native education.\n\u201cWe are pleased that the President has demonstrated his dedication to strengthening the Bureau of Indian Education, through additional funding and policy improvements, which we remain hopeful will include the opportunity for tribes to pursue charter schools while utilizing BIE assistance.\nOn Friday, Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell signed a secretarial order to start the transformation of the Bureau of Indian Education into a \u201cSchool Improvement Organization,\u201d authorizing the shift of the BIE into a \u201cresource provider\u201d to tribally controlled schools.\n\u201cWe are very encouraged by the President\u2019s remarks and his commitment to improving education for Native American youth,\u201d said Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II, whose tribe hosted the President and First Lady at Friday\u2019s Flag Day Wacipi Celebration."}
