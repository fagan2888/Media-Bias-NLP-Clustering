The appearance before Univision, however, was the product of a long relationship between the Clintons and the Spanish language network. Haim Saban, who with a group of investors acquired Univision in 2007, is a Hillary Clinton megadonor, and threw her a fundraiser last week. Univision and the Clinton Foundation are also partners on an education program, \u201cToo Small To Fail,\u201d and the network praised Hillary Clinton\u2019s stance last week on immigration.\n\nBill Clinton, fresh off a Foundation trip to Africa, spoke for about 15 minutes about how cooperation must triumph conflict as the country\u2019s population becomes more diverse.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that makes sense is to have a policy of radical inclusion,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the world today, everywhere people are practicing inclusive governance \u2026 good things are happening. Everywhere people are practicing divisive politics, unequal economic opportunities, and unequal exclusive governance arrangements good things are not happening. This is not rocket science.\u201d\n\nSpeaking briefly about the criminal justice system, he evoked the death of Eric Garner last July, but appeared not to remember his name.\n\n\u201cRemember when the fellow was dying in New York, who was selling the illegal cigarettes in the street and he had a bunch of kids and he was very much overweight and was put in a chokehold and his cardio-vascular system failed,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nHe contrasted the tragedy of his death and the protests it sparked with the death of Ezell Ford, a civilian, by police hands in Los Angeles days later, where there were no protests because a system of \u201ccommunity decision makers\u201d was instituted to review every police incident.\n\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t riots,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cPeople felt like they were part of a process that treated them like they mattered. That their children\u2019s lives were not insignificant\u2026that\u2019s the big test of the entire world.\u201d\n\nHis message to the growing population of millennial Hispanics: \u201cbe upbeat and relentlessly forward looking,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery country, every company, every person needs to be in the future business. You may think that\u2019s funny for a guy that\u2019s older than everybody in this audience, but you have to live in the future.\u201d\n\nClinton was the first former President to participate in the media company\u2019s upfront presentation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m well aware I\u2019m just a warm up act for Ricky Martin,\u201d said Clinton. \u201cAt my age, you just take these chances when you get them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He says there should also be &quot;adequate support for children.&quot;", "title": "Bill Clinton: Path to citizenship is just common sense", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/bill-clinton-immigration-citizenship-path-117856.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/15/141215_bill_clinton_ap_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Immigration Reform,Hillary Clinton 2016,Elections,Hillary Clinton,2016 Elections,Immigration,Bill Clinton", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He says there should also be &quot;adequate support for children.&quot;", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4233\"", "article_summary": "Bill Clinton: Path to citizenship is just common senseFormer President Bill Clinton on Tuesday promoted his wife\u2019s robust call for immigration reform during a paid appearance at the Univision upfront presentation.\nHillary Clinton also challenged the entire Republican field for failing to support a path to citizenship.\nHaim Saban, who with a group of investors acquired Univision in 2007, is a Hillary Clinton megadonor, and threw her a fundraiser last week.\nBill Clinton, fresh off a Foundation trip to Africa, spoke for about 15 minutes about how cooperation must triumph conflict as the country\u2019s population becomes more diverse.\nUnivision and the Clinton Foundation are also partners on an education program, \u201cToo Small To Fail,\u201d and the network praised Hillary Clinton\u2019s stance last week on immigration."}
