Madison â€” Bo Ryan's players didn't panic after their loss at Maryland.

They refused to see the defeat, which snapped a 10-game winning streak, as anything more than a 40-minute misstep.

More important, the fifth-ranked Badgers didn't allow that loss to prevent them from moving on toward their No. 1 goal:

A Big Ten Conference title.

UW pounded the ball inside to Frank Kaminsky and Nigel Hayes from the start and that duo combined for 45 points as the Badgers systematically took down Michigan State, 68-61, Sunday at the Kohl Center in a game that wasn't as close as the final score.

"When the schedule came out, the first time I looked at it, I had this date circled," said guard Josh Gasser, one of four seniors honored Sunday. "I envisioned this scenario happening on senior night, last home game, against a really good team....

"We all had the same goal: winning a Big Ten championship. We were hungry and worked really hard at it.

"It's definitely fulfilling, but we've got a few more goals left to achieve."

In short, Ryan's players want more.

The Badgers (26-3, 14-2) clinched a share of the regular-season title, their first since 2008, with two league games remaining. Maryland (24-5, 12-4) is two games back. Purdue (19-10, 11-5) suffered a 65-61 loss Sunday at Ohio State (21-8, 10-6) to drop three games back.

UW plays Thursday at Minnesota (17-12, 6-10) and closes the regular season Sunday at Ohio State.

"We'll enjoy this today and then tomorrow rest up and then get back to work," Gasser said.

Maryland plays Tuesday at Rutgers (10-19, 2-14) and closes the regular season Sunday at Nebraska (13-15, 5-11).

Kaminsky and Hayes breathed life into UW's offense in the first half by combining for the Badgers' first 19 points en route to a 36-25 halftime lead.

Kaminsky hit 2 of 2 three-pointers but did most of his damage near the basket. He hit 7 of 9 shots overall and finished the half with 18 points, five rebounds, two blocks and a steal.

He finished with a Big Ten-high 31 points, eight rebounds, three assists, three blocks and two steals. Kaminsky hit 3 of 4 three-pointers and 11 of 17 shots overall to help UW build a 22-point lead that remained in double digits until the final minute.

More than two hours before tip-off, Kaminsky was on the court working on his moves. Then he reclined on a chair for several minutes, alone with his thoughts.

"It's my last game here," Kaminsky said. "And I wanted to do something special."

Hayes beat Michigan State's Branden Dawson with a variety of moves and finished the first half with 10 points, on 5-of-6 shooting. He finished with 14 points, four rebounds, two assists and a steal and hit 6 of 9 shots.

"The two of them (Hayes and Kaminsky) in the first half," Ryan said, "that was quite a show they put on."

UW finished the half 16 of 27 overall, 59.3% against a Michigan State team that entered the day limiting teams to 62.3 points per game on 30.3% three-point shooting and 38.9% shooting overall. Both shooting marks were No. 1 in the Big Ten.

That performance marked a dramatic improvement from UW's six-point loss at Maryland on Tuesday. UW made 1 of 11 three-pointers and 8 of 22 shots overall and trailed by 11 points at halftime in the loss.

"We knew they were a physical team so we had to get something going inside," Kaminsky said. "Against Maryland we settled for a lot of shots. We didn't want that to happen again.

"The second half of the Maryland game we pounded the ball inside and some good things happened for us. So we just tried to get that going from the start of the game. It helped us push a lead out and we never looked back."

Gasser added nine points and Sam Dekker eight points and a game-high nine rebounds for the Badgers, who finished at 26 of 50 (52%). The Badgers hit only 4 of 14 three-pointers but hit 22 of 36 shots (61.1%) inside the arc. UW also hit 12 of 15 free throws compared with 4 of 9 for the Spartans, who trailed by as many as 22 points after UW opened the second half with an 11-0 run.

Michigan State coach Tom Izzo called Kaminsky the best player in America and lauded Ryan's 14th UW team.

"They earned it," he said. "They deserve it. Bo's done a hell of a job. He has a good team, a team I think is a Final Four team.

"I'd like to give my early vote that Kaminsky is, no question, the best player in this country this year."
