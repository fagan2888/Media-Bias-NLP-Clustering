In particular, Maddow drew attention to claims O\u2019Reilly made about his reporting on the JFK assassination for CBS News.\n\nThe host said her show reached out to Fox for answers about his apparent fabrications and instead got information about how great his ratings are. \u201cI\u2019ve seen your ratings shoot my ratings right in the head,\u201d Maddow admitted. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve seen pictures of that, I should say,\u201d she added, referencing O\u2019Reilly\u2019s explanation for his false claims about seeing nuns get shot in the head in El Salvador.\n\n\u201cThe Fox News Channel now has a problem, right?\u201d Maddow said. \u201cEven on a business level, a media level with the face of their network, their flagship anchor having all this stuff trailing him around with no plausible explanation for what exactly he said and did and why they haven\u2019t tried to at least fix it.\u201d\n\nBut in the end, Maddow\u2019s O\u2019Reilly commentary was all just a preamble to a larger conversation about the Supreme Court challenge to Obamacare and how, hopefully, cable news won\u2019t screw up its coverage of the ruling as badly as it did the last time this happened.\n\nUPDATE \u2014 12:00 p.m. ET: We reached out to Fox News for comment, and a spokesperson told us that Maddow \u201ccompletely misrepresented\u201d Fox\u2019s communication with the program. Upon MSNBC\u2019s request for comment late yesterday, FNC said they sent them the network statement, information from previous stories they asked about, as well as publishing contacts and other notable stories. The spokesman said the ratings were simply just one of the many things sent along and was to show that the controversy has only increased the numbers.\n\nWatch video below, via MSNBC:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[Photo via MSNBC/screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rachel Maddow opened her MSNBC show Wednesday with an in-depth, scathing look at the revelations about various exaggerations and lies Fox News host Bill", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-04-at-6.25.33-PM.png", "title": "Maddow Uses O\u2019Reilly to Demonstrate Everything That\u2019s Wrong with Cable News"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rachel Maddow opened her MSNBC show Wednesday with an in-depth, scathing look at the revelations about various exaggerations and lies Fox News host Bill O'Reilly has been accused of making over the years.", "title": "Maddow Uses O'Reilly to Demonstrate Everything That's Wrong with Cable News", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-04-at-6.25.33-PM.png", "creator": "@themattwilstein", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2015-03-04T21:27:29+00:00", "keywords": "tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e0e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ve seen your ratings shoot my ratings right in the head,\u201d Maddow admitted.\nIn particular, Maddow drew attention to claims O\u2019Reilly made about his reporting on the JFK assassination for CBS News.\n\u201cThe Fox News Channel now has a problem, right?\u201d Maddow said.\nET: We reached out to Fox News for comment, and a spokesperson told us that Maddow \u201ccompletely misrepresented\u201d Fox\u2019s communication with the program.\nRachel Maddow opened her MSNBC show Wednesday with an in-depth, scathing look at the revelations about various exaggerations and lies Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly has been accused of making over the years."}
