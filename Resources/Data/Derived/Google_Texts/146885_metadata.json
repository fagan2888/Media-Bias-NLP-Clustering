(AP) - All that\u2019s missing are Ike and Corabeth Godsey. The homey feeling of a bygone era that was embodied by the Godseys\u2019 country store on the venerable TV show \u201cThe Waltons\u201d has been resurrected in Alderson\u2019s newly expanded Green Grocer store.\n\nThe cash register is of a decidedly more recent vintage, and familiar staples like sugar and flour vie for shelf space with 21st century products that are sweetened with agave nectar and boast that they are gluten-free, but the old-fashioned country store appeal shines through.\n\nA project of the Alderson Community Food Hub (ACFH), today\u2019s Green Grocer is an ambitious expansion of a modest co-op that came to fruition thanks to community support and volunteer sweat-equity.\n\n\u201cThe Food Hub\u2019s board members had this store as a long-range plan for a good while, but when (Gadd\u2019s IGA grocery store) closed, they decided the time was right to go ahead,\u201d explained Green Grocer manager Ann Knott, one of only three paid employees at the compact store at the corner of W.Va. 63 and 12.\n\nThe turn-around for the project was quick. Gadd\u2019s closed in November, and volunteers began remodeling the Green Grocer space the first of February. The full-service fresh grocery store opened a few weeks ago.\n\nThe expansion of the usable space included co-opting a former storage area to provide room for a small cafe, as well as painting all of the walls, installing equipment and constructing a rustic wooden produce stand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep a good mix of conventional foods and ingredients, along with organic and gourmet foods for those who want them,\u201d Knott said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge so far has been finding grocery providers to deliver to us. We\u2019re off the beaten path.\u201d\n\nKnott said she called providers in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia, to no avail. \u201cThey said we were too far away (from a major highway) for them to deliver,\u201d Knott said, noting she finally located a company in Princeton that was willing to ship goods to the store every week. In addition to those goods, the Green Grocer also found providers of organic and gourmet items in the Midwest who have agreed to ship products to the Alderson store on a monthly basis.\n\nCloser to home, word of mouth has been the most effective way of getting local farmers involved, Knott pointed out. ACFH\u2019s AmeriCorps VISTA worker Rick Allen has been instrumental in organizing that effort via social media and community outreach, she said.\n\nAmong the local products on the shelves and in the commercial coolers along one wall are beef from Swift Level Farm in Greenbrier County, stone-ground cornmeal from Reed\u2019s Mill in Monroe County and fragrant loaves of artisan bread from The Bakery in Lewisburg.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are interested in healthy, locally grown, pesticide-free foods,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThey cost a little more, but people have decided it\u2019s worth the price.\u201d\n\nHe said he expects to have even more local products when \u201cpeople get their gardens going\u201d later this spring.\n\nRecently the Green Grocer already had a few locally grown vegetables available, including bags of certified Greenbrier Valley Grown baby spinach produced in a high-tunnel operation in Caldwell and firm Kennebec potatoes (at 50 cents a pound) grown by local farmer Roy Loudermilk.\n\nAnd then there were the ramps, a sizable basket of which nestled just under the produce bin nearest to the front door. An Appalachian delicacy since time immemorial, ramps in recent years have also found their way into dishes served in high-end restaurants, amplifying the popularity of the wild onion.\n\n\u201cRamps are one of our best sellers,\u201d Allen said, smiling. \u201cPeople bring them in, and we sell them out every day.\u201d\n\nThe Green Grocer was envisioned by its founders as a way to \u201chelp people get what they need without going to Lewisburg,\u201d Allen explained. It\u2019s a vision that is already being fulfilled.\n\n\u201cThe first day, people just poured through the door,\u201d Allen said. \u201cOne lady said she wanted to make a pot of stew, but she needed an onion and didn\u2019t want to drive all the way to Lewisburg just to get an onion. So she bought that onion here.\u201d\n\nShopper Marybeth Hopkins echoed Allen\u2019s words when asked for her opinion of the new store.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome!\u201d Hopkins exclaimed. \u201cI brought my mother in the store today just to look, but they have more here than you might think. They have fresh vegetables, and now if you need an onion or a tomato - who wants to go to Lewisburg for an onion? - you can just come here instead of driving all that way.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the food, Hopkins said she is glad to see familiar faces behind the store\u2019s counters.\n\n\u201cI grew up around here with these folks; it\u2019s like family,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just this store; they help in the community, at ball games and all. They\u2019re good people.\u201d\n\nHopkins\u2019 mother, Bernice Hopkins, was less effusive than her daughter but nonetheless seemed pleased to have a local grocery option once more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad they opened this place,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother visitor to the Green Grocer was Anna Osborne, a Food Hub board member who also teaches at Alderson Elementary School.\n\n\u201cI see a lot of people becoming curious and inspired by what\u2019s happened here,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cThey know it\u2019s a place to get groceries, but when they come in they\u2019re seeing it\u2019s a community effort, it\u2019s a chance to connect.\u201d\n\nProviding a place for people to gather informally is another of the Green Grocer\u2019s goals, Allen agreed, pointing to the tables and chairs that invite visitors to take in the river view through the store\u2019s expansive front windows.\n\n\u201cWe want to encourage people to come and gather, to give this space a community atmosphere,\u201d Allen said.\n\nThe tables and chairs also provide a place for patrons of the cafe in the back of the store to enjoy a quick lunch. Billy and Dawn Painter operate the cafe as a commercial venture separate from - yet complementary to - the nonprofit grocery store.\n\nFormerly a manager at the Federal Correctional Institution in Beckley, Billy Painter now revels in his reputation as a master of the art of barbecue - a pitmaster whose workday revolves around a custom smoker that was built in Houston, Texas.\n\n\u201cI retired from my real job, and now I work seven days a week,\u201d Painter said, laughing.\n\n\u201cI love cooking real barbecue,\u201d Painter confided. \u201cIt is hard, dirty, greasy, sweaty work - not glamorous at all. I\u2019m not (famed TV chef and restaurateur) Gordon Ramsay.\n\n\u201cWe do everything the old-fashioned way. Just about everything we use is fresh.\u201d\n\nAmong Painter\u2019s smoked specialties are brisket, pulled pork, ribs and chicken, although he said at times he branches out into other proteins, like turkeys, upon request. He and his wife also fix up appropriate side dishes for the barbecue, including mashed potatoes, green beans, Mexican corn, macaroni and cheese, assorted salads and cabbage with bacon and cheddar.\n\nAlthough some of Painter\u2019s barbecue sauces are store-bought, many are of his own creation - like the mayonnaise-based Alabama white sauce. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he boasted. \u201cMy wife didn\u2019t think she\u2019d like it, but when she tried it on some chicken, she had to agree it\u2019s really something special.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the barbecue, the cafe inside the Green Grocer offers daily lunch specials and deli sandwiches and sides.\n\nThe Green Grocer is open 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday.
