Dallas City Council member Rickey Callahan turned 60 on St. Patrick’s Day, so he got to celebrate his birthday and Irish heritage at the perfect event: Saturday’s parade.

Callahan and several friends staked out a spot near Caruth Haven Lane where they hung a green flag emblazoned with the phrase “Erin go Bragh,” or “Ireland forever.”

The real estate broker said he’s enjoyed attending the annual festival that runs along Greenville Avenue for about five years.

“It just brings people of all backgrounds to something that’s clearly an Irish phenomenon,” Callahan said. “It means everybody can be Irish for a day.”

Callahan’a friend Lance Cantor said he’s keeping the tradition alive by bringing his 8-year-old son to the parade.

“As a Dallas native, I’ve been able to watch it evolve over time, and we certainly appreciate Mark Cuban being able to help participate in helping fund it,” Cantor said. “It’s gotten even better since he’s gotten involved.”

After the procession, Cantor said the group, or at least those of drinking age, planned to go on a pub crawl to keep the celebration going for both St. Patrick’s Day and Callahan’s landmark birthday.

The councilman said his 60th has been a special birthday for a variety of reasons, one of them being that Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings made an appearance Thursday for his party at Trinity Hall Irish Pub & Restaurant.

“My City Council staff, my real estate staff they just totally spoiled me and it just topped it off when the mayor came out to visit,” he said.

Clad in a bright green vest with gold shamrocks, Callahan paid tribute to his ancestry from Ireland.

“It’s a very beautiful island, the Emerald Isle, so I’m very proud to be of Irish descent and it’s always been a big thing since my birthday’s on St. Patrick’s,” he said. “It was a very special day, and I’ve had just a great birthday.”
