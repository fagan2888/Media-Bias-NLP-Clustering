The ayatollahs have never been closer to their 30-year-plus objective of getting deliverable nuclear weapons. They are clearly intent on getting an agreement with the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany that will lock in that achievement.

This is despite the fact there’s simply no evidence that the people of Iran want the ayatollahs to have nuclear weapons. The idea that this is a matter of pride for the Iranian citizens is propaganda from the regime.

The NCRI platform has long made it clear that in a democratic Iran there would be no nuclear weapons, no weapons of mass destruction. The MEK over time has done more to make the world aware of the clandestine nuclear weapons program of the ayatollahs than anyone else.

There’s simply no evidence that the mullahs have made a strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons; indeed, all of the evidence is to the contrary. It’s how they plan to break free. The real solution to the ayatollahs’ nuclear weapons program is to get rid of the ayatollahs.
