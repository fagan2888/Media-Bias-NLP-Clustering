And, thanks to Emily Paton Davies\u2019 and Emma Messenger\u2019s stout and anguished performances, it seldom gets more upsetting and thrilling.\n\nDays after the Edge Theatre Company\u2019s production of Martin McDonagh\u2019s \u201cThe Beauty Queen of Leenane,\u201d mother and daugh-ter still possessed those who\u2019d come to the 80-seat Lakewood theater.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like necessarily mainstream stuff,\u201d said Edge\u2019s artistic director Rick Yaconis. \u201cI\u2019d love to find more comedies, but I\u2019m attracted to plays where people come out of the theater saying \u2018Omigod.\u2019 \u201c\n\nWhen the Colorado Theatre Guild holds its annual Henry Awards gathering at the Arvada Center on July 21, Edge will be among the five companies vying for Outstanding Season. Its fellow nominees: The Arvada Center, Aurora Fox, Curious Theatre Company and the Denver Center Theatre Company.\n\nThe Lakewood theater has seven other nominations, most for McDonagh\u2019s bitter pill of a dramedy and two for the company\u2019s reprise of John Guare\u2019s \u201cHouse of Blue Leaves.\u201d\n\nThe Denver area boasts big houses. No, not jails but places bent on liberating the imagination: the Buell, the Arvada Center, the theaters in the Helen Bonfils Theatre Complex.\n\nBut for intrepid theatergoers, there are more and more opportunities to witness some of the region\u2019s most rewarding theater in intimate venues of 100 seats or fewer.\n\nHere are five smaller theaters offering consistently expansive theater experiences.\n\nThe Betsy Stage\n\n1133 S. Huron St.\n\nVibe: This canny experimental theater company shows off its smarts and fondness for the Bard (and other Elizabethan fare) in a 50-seat house tucked away in a southwest neighborhood more industrial than residential.\n\nRecently: With \u201cBeth,\u201d the all-female cast pile-drove Shakespeare\u2019s tale of the Thane of Cawdor, recounting the story \u2014 end to beginning, no less \u2014 of a female painter in Paris during the Roaring Twenties.\n\nUp next: Desdemona is not quite dead yet in this company\u2019s comedic take on \u201cOthello,\u201d set in Greece amid gods and demigods. (Fall) betsystage.com or 720-328-5294\n\nBoulder Ensemble Theatre Company at Dairy Center for the Arts\u2019 Carsen Theatre\n\n2590 Walnut St, Boulder\n\nVibe: BETC takes advantage of the Dairy Center\u2019s smallest house \u2014 which feel larger than its 80 seats \u2014 offering steady opportunities to see some of the area\u2019s most compelling actors up close: John Ashton, Chris Kendall, Sam Gregory, Rachel Fowler for starters \u2014 typically taking on regional premieres of off-Broadway works.\n\nRecently: In March, the company held the successful world premiere of best-selling history of science author Dava Sobel\u2019s new play \u201cAnd the Sun Stood Still.\u201d\n\nUp next: BETC opens it 2014-15 season in the Dairy\u2019s 100-seat East Theater with the regional premiere of Anthony Clarvoe\u2019s \u201cAmbition Facing West.\u201d (Oct. 9-Nov. 2) betc.org or 303-444-7328\n\nCherry Creek Theatre\n\nin the Shaver-Ramsey Showroom, 2414 E. Third Ave.\n\nVibe: Shows unfurl amid the gorgeous wares of this rug emporium. Pretty sure the carpets make for the warm acoustics in the 70-seat theater.\n\nRecently: Its annual musical featured local luminary Megan Van De Hey and up-and-comer Casey Andree in this two-hander about familial grief and reckoning \u201cJohn & Jen.\u201d\n\nUp Next: In Joe DiPietro\u2019s comedy \u201cOver the River and Through the Woods,\u201d a grandson announces plans to move. His Jersey grandparents have other ideas. (Oct. 3-26) cherrycreektheatre.org or 303-800-6578\n\nEdge Theatre Company\n\n1560 Teller St., Lakewood.\n\nVibe: Artistic director Rick Yaconis brings in plays that make good on the company\u2019s razor-sharp name.\n\nRecently: A fit and coolly ferocious Mrs. Robinson put the moves on a rather undone Benjamin Braddock in \u201cThe Graduate.\u201d\n\nUp Next: Edge is in the midst of \u201cOn the Edge: A Festival of New Plays.\u201d The winner of the three-play competition will get a full production during the 2014-15 season. (Through Aug. 3) theedgetheater.com or 303-232-0363\n\nGerminal Stage\n\n7287 Lowell Blvd. at the 73rd in Westminster\n\nVibe: For those familiar with this institution\u2019s former North Denver home, the pervasive scent of pipe smoke hasn\u2019t yet taken hold in the new, smaller digs. What has is co-founder and artistic director Ed Baierlein\u2019s tenacious commitment to \u201cplays of substance.\u201d\n\nRecent: Substance in no way excludes comedy. Germinal\u2019s collection of three \u2014 \u201cVictorian Garden Romance\u201d \u2014 ends July 20.\n\nUp Next: Germinal enters the dystopian fray when it closes its summer season with George Orwell\u2019s \u201cAnimal Farm.\u201d (Aug. 22-Sept. 14) germinalstage.com or 303-455-7108\n\nLisa Kennedy: 303-954-1567, lkennedy@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy\n\nCOLORADO THEATRE GUILD\u2019S 9TH ANNUAL HENRY AWARDS.
