County commissioners say once the ACA took effect last year, the independent, non-profit Ingham Health Plan pushed its low-income users to expanded Medicaid or federal marketplace programs.\n\nIngham Health Plan Director Robin Reynolds says 30 percent of people were enrolled in another plan. Commissioner Todd Tennis says that move saved the IHP money -- for now.\n\n\"A reduced population created a temporary surplus,\" said Tennis. \"We don't expect it to be around for very long ... There's always going to be a need in our community for those who fall through the cracks.\"\n\nTennis says the millage is designed for the long-term. Voters will be asked to renew a 0.52 mill tax, which could potentially bring in more than $3 million.\n\n\"We expect there still to be several thousand residents of Ingham County, families in Ingham County who are not going to qualify for either expanded Medicaid or the Exchange,\" said Tennis. \"And that's who we can target with these resources.\"\n\nTennis says the IHP may use the extra money to expand its current benefits or even add a dental plan.\n\nCounty commissioners put the millage on the ballot on a party-line vote in July.\n\nRepublican Commissioner Don Vickers says he isn't necessarily in favor of the millage, but he does agree public health should be a priority.\n\nIf passed, the millage will take effect in the 2016 fiscal year.\n\nCounty commissioners will have the ability to lower the millage if they see fit.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The Ingham Health Plan ended up with a nearly $10 million surplus, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, but it is still asking voters to renew its more than $3 million millage.
