The next hearing, scheduled for Feb. 16, will focus on transition-related surgeries. The process could take more than a year.\n\nMedical guidelines regarding transgender care have changed in the last few years, with the American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association saying hormones and surgeries are the recommended course for patients with gender dysphoria.\n\nTransgender health care A survey of transgender people published in 2011 found that about 20 percent were uninsured. Below is a breakdown of their insurance type and where they got care.\n\nTimes have changed and the state Medicaid program \u201chas a responsibility\u201d to evolve, said Judy Zerzan, chief medical officer for the state agency that runs the Medicaid program in Colorado.\n\n\u201cThe world and the evidence and the practice of medicine evolve,\u201d Zerzan said. \u201cWe think we have a responsibility to cover it when it\u2019s medically necessary.\u201d\n\nThe federal government prohibited Medicare and Medicaid from covering transgender-related surgery until 2014. The ban was lifted for Medicare, which provides health insurance for older Americans, but there was no universal policy change for Medicaid, which is administered by states.\n\nEight states changed policy in recent months to cover transition-related surgeries, but Colorado was not among them. An ongoing federal review requested by the Obama administration this fall could trump Colorado\u2019s process if it requires all 50 states to cover transgender-related surgeries through Medicaid.\n\nIn September, the administration proposed a new anti-discrimination provision that could require doctors and hospitals to allow patients to use the bathroom of their gender identity as well as bar insurance companies from excluding transgender surgeries and therapy. The Affordable Care Act prohibits sex discrimination, but new rules would clarify that gender identity also is protected.\n\nColorado is among 13 states that prohibit insurance companies from blanket exclusions against transgender-related care, but the law does not mandate coverage of gender reassignment surgeries. The state Division of Insurance in 2013 said companies cannot charge transgender people higher premiums, consider transgender status a pre-existing condition to deny coverage or limit coverage for \u201cmedically necessary services\u201d if the same service or surgery is provided to someone who is not transgender.\n\nThat means if a company covers hormone replacement therapy for other reasons, it should cover it for transgender people. But the law gets opaque regarding surgeries. If an insurer covers mastectomies for breast cancer patients, does it have to cover them for transgender people who want their breasts removed or augmented? And if a company covers a hysterectomy or genital surgery for a car accident victim or someone born with a genital anomaly, must it cover that for a transgender person?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we are kind of stuck at this point,\u201d said Matt Mortier, the insurance division\u2019s director of compliance. \u201cWe would like some more concrete federal guidance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "colorado,transgender,gender,issues,dysmorphia,healthcare,insurance,cosmetic,transition,medical", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "title": "Health transition: Transgender people seek coverage of procedures insurers call cosmetic - The Denver Post", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "For decades, insurers have denied coverage for procedures to help transgender people transition.
