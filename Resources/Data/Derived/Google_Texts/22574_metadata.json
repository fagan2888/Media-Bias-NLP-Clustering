The 26-16 win over the New England Patriots for the AFC championship was witnessed by Broncos fans in shopping malls, sports bars, retirement homes and many locations in between. Expect to see Broncos fever rise as the team and fans ramp up for Super Bowl XLVIII against the Seattle Seahawks on Feb. 2 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nOn the second floor of the Cherry Creek Shopping Center, about 25 people \u2014 mostly men \u2014 had gathered around two large TVs.\n\nOzz Camara, 27, was there while his girlfriend was at a cosmetics store. \u201cMy girlfriend lost her makeup, and she came in here to have it done,\u201d Camara said.\n\nBan Truong, 40, decked out in a Peyton Manning jersey, was watching while his wife, a hairdresser who works Monday through Saturday, shopped.\u201dWe get one day off,\u201d Truong said. \u201cAfter church we stop at the mall.\u201d\n\nMonica Flowers, 36, had flown in from Idaho with her husband, who had a ticket to the game. Instead of a ticket, Flowers said she got the cash equivalent from her husband. \u201cI\u2019d rather take the money and go shopping,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nDavid Medina, 60, a lifelong Broncos fan, spent the morning greeting friends, neighbors and fellow fans from his perch in his brother\u2019s backyard at 18th Avenue and King Street with a throaty: \u201cYo Dude! \u2026 We gonna do it today!\u201d\n\nMedina was among a core group of residents along 18th and 17th avenues who loudly declared allegiance to the Broncos in good times and bad.\n\nMedina remembers the bad, including the team\u2019s ugly socks and the emaciated Bronco on the helmets.\n\n\u201cAll the way back to the \u201960s, man \u2014 I\u2019ve been there,\u201d said Medina, while chomping on his stogie and offering a salute to the Broncos flag. \u201cAll of us,\u201d said Medina, who swept his hand through the air, \u201cwe\u2019ve always, always loved the Broncos.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nBusiness was buzzing at Mile High Recreational Cannabis an hour before kickoff. Mile High is across the street from Sports Authority Field, and the store was getting plenty of attention from Broncos fans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty busy, and we\u2019ve had a few New England fans come in,\u201d said Mile High\u2019s manager, who declined to give his name.\n\n\u201cMostly they are here for the game, but this is a good side trip for them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe counter was heavy with customers weighing purchases of Qrazy Train and Mr. Pink. A New England native who now lives in Colorado identified himself as Mark B.\n\nHis hometown buddies would love to have legal marijuana shops back East, he said, and they are a little jealous of Denver\u2019s venture into the pot market.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019d like a place like this, but that\u2019s too bad for them,\u201d Mark B. said.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nIt was nearly breathing-room-only at the Sports Column in LoDo before halftime. It was so noisy that \u201cWhat?\u201d was the most common reply to any question.\n\nAt the edge of the room, Cara Davidson, wearing a John Elway jersey, summed up the mood: \u201cCrazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lid is going to blow off this place,\u201d she predicted.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Tilted Kilt pub on the 16th Street Mall, the crowd roared with every completion by Manning.\n\n\u201cWe got this one, baby,\u201d Jeff Harkin bellowed. \u201cSuper Bowl, it\u2019s on.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThe Denver Rescue Mission, a shelter that houses up to 316 men each night, normally closes during daytime hours. But the building was open Sunday, and about 100 men gathered to watch the game.\n\nMonte Fall, 55, who was among them, said he usually would be found at the Denver Library. \u201cI like studying and reading good books,\u201d he said.\n\nBut a chance to watch the game lured him back to the shelter, where he spends his nights.\n\nLast year, he said, when the Broncos played the Baltimore Ravens in the playoffs, the shelter was closed. So he went to the St. Francis Center, a day shelter for the homeless. \u201cWe were trying to listen to it on a cheap transistor radio, and that was not easy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nDozens of dusty boots and worn jeans saddled up to the big-screen TV in the \u201ccontestants only\u201d area of the stock show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see the Broncos win this and see Peyton go out in style,\u201d bull rider Jay Morrow said as he strapped on his spurs before the pro rodeo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d be there if my husband wasn\u2019t team roping today,\u201d said season-ticket holder Mandy Hagler, who was in front of the big screen.\n\nThe \u201ccontestants only\u201d area was packed until shortly before the 2 p.m. rodeo began.\n\n\u201cI love the rodeo so it doesn\u2019t bother me (to miss the game). But it\u2019s a good thing they will announce the score updates,\u201d said Stadium Medical on-hand medic Brian Riley.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nProving that old lungs are just as good as young ones, the folks inside the game room at Meridian Arvada retirement community could be heard from well down the hall during the third quarter.\n\n\u201cGood, good, good toss, Tom,\u201d Chuck Landenberger, 81, said sarcastically to Patriots quarterback Tom Brady during a Hail Mary attempt.\n\nThe dozen residents, along with their canes and walkers, have gathered in the game room every Sunday to root for the Broncos.\n\n\u201cWe have such a good team this year, man,\u201d said Joanne Fife, 75, who has been a Broncos fan since the 1970s.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Across town, Broncos whip fans into frenzy", "title": "Across town, Broncos whip fans into frenzy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/19/across-town-broncos-whip-fans-into-frenzy/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140119__20140120_A1_CD20FANSp1.jpg", "height": 443}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140119__20140120_A1_CD20FANSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-19T23:14:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T00:54:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd95c4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cGood, good, good toss, Tom,\u201d Chuck Landenberger, 81, said sarcastically to Patriots quarterback Tom Brady during a Hail Mary attempt.\nMile High is across the street from Sports Authority Field, and the store was getting plenty of attention from Broncos fans.\nThe dozen residents, along with their canes and walkers, have gathered in the game room every Sunday to root for the Broncos.\n\u201cWe have such a good team this year, man,\u201d said Joanne Fife, 75, who has been a Broncos fan since the 1970s.\nThe 26-16 win over the New England Patriots for the AFC championship was witnessed by Broncos fans in shopping malls, sports bars, retirement homes and many locations in between."}
