Some locals started their Memorial Day weekend on the links to support a friend.

More than 75 golfers participated in a golf tournament Saturday morning for Leslie Brown.

Brown is a local registered nurse that has been suffering from a hysterectomy.

She has had 25 surgeries in the last three years and was just taken to a hospital in Miami for an intestinal transplant

More than $9,000 was raised Saturday.

Brown's daughters said they are happy about the support their mom has received.

"I think it's really special for us to have all these people out here just for us and to help our family out a little bit more, explained Megan Brown."

"It's helped bring our mom home and to raise money for all the bills that we have, said Kelsey Brown."

The family has a go-fund-me page set up at http://www.gofundme.com/e0s2gg.

The Brown's have an account setup at any Innovations Federal Credit Union, the account number is 0057745403.
