She is charged with obtaining a controlled substance by fraud or deceit and theft, according to a news release from the Fifth Judicial District Attorney\u2019s Office. Burgans, who has been licensed since January 2014 by the Colorado Department of Regulatory Affairs, was fired Jan. 28 from the Breckenridge hospital, the district attorney reported. Sheriff\u2019s deputies were called to the hospital on Jan. 30 after receiving reports that Burgans had a physical test indicating the presence of fentanyl. She did not have a prescription for the drug, the DA\u2019s office said.\n\nShe is suspected of misappropriating doses of injectable hydromorphone fentanyl intended for Summit Medical Center patients she was attending to, the news release said. She was found between December and January to have fentanyl doses in her possession that exceeded the amounts usually needed by hospital nurses for their patients.\n\nDistrict Attorney Bruce Brown said in the news release the investigation is ongoing to determine the extent of the misappropriation of the drug. Filing of formal charges is pending.\n\n\u201cNationwide, drug misappropriation by hospital staff is rising at an alarming rate resulting in serious concerns about the extent of prescription drug abuse by professionals,\u201d Brown said.\n\nFentanyl abuse has made headlines in Denver this year after Rocky Allen, a former surgical technologist at Swedish Medical Center, was accused of stealing the powerful narcotic from an operating room at the Englewood hospital. Allen was charged in federal court with tampering with a consumer product and obtaining a controlled substance by deceit. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nHis case has prompted wide-scale HIV and hepatitis B testing of Swedish patients. Allen is carrying a blood-borne pathogen, although specifics have not been released. Allen was fired from at least five hospitals where he worked in California, Arizona, Washington and Colorado.\n\nOne hospital said it found him swapping a doctor\u2019s fentanyl syringe with a syringe of saline solution and informed the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nHe also was court-martialed by the Navy in 2011 after he was caught stealing the drug at a military combat hospital in Afghanistan.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nurse accused of stealing fentanyl from Summit County hospital", "title": "Nurse accused of stealing fentanyl from Summit County hospital", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/nurse-accused-of-stealing-fentanyl-from-summit-county-hospital/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160321_080221_Kimberly_Jeanne_Burgans.jpg.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160321_080221_Kimberly_Jeanne_Burgans.jpg.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T21:30:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:44:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A Summit County nurse has been arrested on suspicion of stealing the narcotic fentanyl from St. Anthony Summit Medical Center.\nShe is suspected of misappropriating doses of injectable hydromorphone fentanyl intended for Summit Medical Center patients she was attending to, the news release said.\nHe also was court-martialed by the Navy in 2011 after he was caught stealing the drug at a military combat hospital in Afghanistan.\nKimberly Jeanne Burgans, 47, surrendered at the Summit County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Saturday.\nOne hospital said it found him swapping a doctor\u2019s fentanyl syringe with a syringe of saline solution and informed the federal Drug Enforcement Administration."}
