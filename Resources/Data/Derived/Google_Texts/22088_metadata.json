He now needs regular appointments with a specialist.\n\n\u201cHave you had any vision changes?\u201d asks the doctor. Aldridge replies \u201cyes\u201d before responding to questions about headaches, dizziness and pain.\n\nIt sounds like a routine medical visit \u2014 but patient and doctor are not in the same room or even in the same city. The doctor is in a clinic in Galveston, and Aldridge, an inmate at the Estelle prison in Huntsville, is 135 miles away in the prison clinic, talking to the doctor on a TV screen.\n\nThe high-tech medical consultation, known as telemedicine, uses technology to connect prisoners, who are often housed in remote areas, with medical experts throughout the state.\n\nIt\u2019s just one way that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice is trying to control spending on prison health care. But while telemedicine has shown some success in curbing spending, it hasn\u2019t been enough to stem rising costs due to an aging prison population.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2008, the cost of providing health care per inmate increased nationally by an average of 28 percent, according to a 2013 report by the Pew Charitable Trusts that examined cost data from 44 states.\n\nDuring that period, Texas and Illinois were the only states to see a reduction in spending. Texas reduced the cost of health care per inmate by 12 percent while Illinois saw a 3 percent decrease.\n\nBut that trend has changed in recent years. From 2007 to 2011, Texas prisons have seen a 24 percent increase in health care spending per inmate, according to a more recent study by the Pew Charitable Trusts. The July 2014 report looked at cost data for 50 states and found spending increased by an average of 10 percent.\n\nAn aging prison population is driving up the cost of health care in Texas prisons, said Maria Schiff, director of Pew\u2019s state health care spending project.\n\n\u201cThe number of prisoners over the age of 55 increased in the majority of states, but in Texas it went up by 32 percent from 2007 to 2011,\u201d she said.\n\nPrison health care is expensive. It cost $7.7 billion to provide health care to U.S. prisoners out of an overall $38.6 billion spent on corrections in 2011, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nMore than $581 million was spent on health care for Texas\u2019 152,841 prisoners in 2011.\n\nTexas is trying to lower that cost by subcontracting prison health care to the University of Texas Medical Branch and Texas Tech University. The partnership reduces medication costs through a federal program and uses cost-saving technology such as telemedicine.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing collectively between UTMB, Texas Tech and the Texas Department of Correctional Justice, no one in the country is doing that,\u201d said Dr. Owen Murray, vice president of offender health services at the University of Texas Medical Branch.\n\nBut critics argue that telemedicine isn\u2019t the way to save money in a system plagued with long-standing concerns of poor medical care.\n\nThe Texas Civil Rights Project has filed dozens of lawsuits against the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and its medical contractors citing medical negligence.\n\nWayne Krause Yang, the project\u2019s legal director, is concerned that telemedicine could shortchange an already vulnerable population.\n\n\u201cI see the potential for danger where, for example, psychiatric care is not given in person and a doctor doesn\u2019t see the cuts on the person\u2019s arm and the next day they commit suicide,\u201d said Yang. \u201cTelehealth could save money, but it could hurt health care.\u201d\n\nTelemedicine saved the Texas Department of Criminal Justice $780 million from 1994 to 2008. Those savings are set to increase as the number of telemedicine consultations rises. About 100,000 telemedicine encounters take place in Texas state prisons each year.\n\nThe Pew report found that, by some measures, the health of inmates has improved since telemedicine was rolled out in Texas in 1994. Deaths from AIDS fell 84 percent, blood sugar levels for diabetic inmates dropped 18 percent and blood pressure control improved.\n\nMurray points to a combination of strategies used to lower costs in Texas prisons. He said telemedicine, along with electronic medical records, preferred drug lists and adherence to disease-management guidelines, have curbed spending while improving access to care.\n\nBut a steady increase in the number of older prisoners is stretching the prison health budget. Costs for their medical care are two to three times higher than for younger prisoners.\n\nRegardless of age, prisoners have disproportionately higher rates of infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C, which are expensive to treat.\n\nAlmost half of Texas\u2019 prison pharmacy budget is spent on medications for the less than 2 percent of inmates who are HIV-positive.\n\nThe University of Texas Medical Branch uses a federal program called 340B that allows it to buy medications at a discounted price, a benefit that\u2019s passed onto inmates.\n\nThe university is eligible for the special pricing program because its hospitals care for a large proportion of underserved communities. That cost-saving benefit is passed onto the Texas Department of Criminal Justice when University of Texas Medical Branch doctors write prescriptions for inmates.\n\n\u201cYou think about all of the high-profile, really expensive diseases that we see in prison. There\u2019s HIV, [hepatitis] C, cancer, that\u2019s where we really save money with 340B,\u201d said Murray.\n\nTexas will save more than $60 million on medication costs through 340B pricing this year.\n\nTransporting inmates is not only inconvenient and expensive, it\u2019s dangerous, said Murray. \u201cWe\u2019re a public safety agency first and foremost, and safety is a big issue when you\u2019re transporting prisoners to outside clinics.\u201d\n\nWhile some states begin to enroll inmates in health insurance under the new Medicaid expansion part of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 an option not available to prisoners in Texas \u2014 others look to Texas for cues on expanding telemedicine and accessing federal drug pricing programs.\n\n\u201cPrison usually flies below the radar,\u201d said Murray. \u201cBut now everyone needs to find ways to save money in health care and they\u2019re looking at us.\u201d\n\nAs Texas loses its place as a leader in cutting prison health care costs, Murray is concerned that the spending increase will continue. \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing is older, sicker inmates,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the state needs to mull that over.\u201d\n\nDr. Seema Yasmin, a former epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a physician and a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas.\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@DoctorYasmin", "article_metadata": {"description": "The high-tech medical consultation has shown some success, but aging inmates have led to rising costs.", "og": {"description": "The high-tech medical consultation has shown some success, but aging inmates have led to rising costs.", "title": "Texas prisons try telemedicine to curb spending", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20150119-texas-prisons-try-telemedicine-to-curb-spending.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150119-nm_27doctorsa.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NM_27doctorsA.jpg", "height": 980}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-01-21T19:27:29Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-01-20T05:15:39Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Texas prisons try telemedicine to curb spending\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20150119-texas-prisons-try-telemedicine-to-curb-spending.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150119-nm_27doctorsa.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NM_27doctorsA.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2143383\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-20T05:15:39Z\", \"section\": \"State Headlines\", \"author\": \"SEEMA YASMIN\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150119-nm_27doctorsa.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NM_27doctorsA.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-01-20T05:15:39Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2bd\"", "article_summary": "Texas is trying to lower that cost by subcontracting prison health care to the University of Texas Medical Branch and Texas Tech University.\nIt\u2019s just one way that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice is trying to control spending on prison health care.\nAn aging prison population is driving up the cost of health care in Texas prisons, said Maria Schiff, director of Pew\u2019s state health care spending project.\nFrom 2007 to 2011, Texas prisons have seen a 24 percent increase in health care spending per inmate, according to a more recent study by the Pew Charitable Trusts.\nThat cost-saving benefit is passed onto the Texas Department of Criminal Justice when University of Texas Medical Branch doctors write prescriptions for inmates."}
