And when one of that agenda\u2019s key features is an ever-expanding government, agencies that request more things get plenty of consideration.\n\nTake the IRS, which can\u2019t stop complaining about how short-staffed and underfunded it\u2019s been since the GOP side of Congress has sort of, kind of held on to its unwieldy purse strings. The IRS has asked for \u2014 and received (from Obama, anyway) \u2014 approval for a bump of more than 9,000 employees and an addition $2 billion in its annual operating budget.\n\nFrom The Daily Signal:\n\nThe billions of dollars will help the agency bolster its staff by adding more than 9,280 full-time employees. The proposed jump in employment at the IRS is an 11 percent increase from 2015. To enforce the 46 new tax provisions of the Affordable Care Act specifically, the IRS asked for $67 million. That will cover 483 new employees related to Obamacare\u2019s implementation. \u2026 In addition, the agency requested $301.5 million to hire close to 3,000 additional staff to assist taxpayers calling into the agency with questions. The IRS said it needs to staff to address the \u201cincreased demand\u201d for assistance resulting from Obamacare\u2019s implementation and managing taxpayer submissions relating to the health care law.\n\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen, you may recall, has promised even poorer \u201ccustomer service\u201d from the IRS this year. He told the media in December that Americans shouldn\u2019t expect to quickly connect with a live, helpful IRS representative if they call the agency this year with questions about the new tax code.\n\n\u201cEvery time I say you can call us, in the back of my mind I almost feel like I should say: \u2018You should be prepared to stay on the line for half an hour before you get through. And a lot of you won\u2019t get through to a live person,'\u201d Koskinen said.\n\nNot that the IRS does a better job when it has more resources. The case has been made more than once that, short of abolishing the IRS, the next best thing to ensure its (relative) efficiency is to keep it on a diet.", "article_metadata": {"projectnami": {"version": "1.3.3"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Personal Liberty\u00ae", "description": "President Obama's fiscal year 2016 budget proposal has no chance of passing; but, as always, it serves as a compass for his agenda.", "title": "IRS wants 9,000 new employees to help enforce Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2014/12/IRS121814.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-06T14:10:42+00:00", "url": "http://personalliberty.com/irs-wants-9000-new-employees-help-enforce-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2014/12/IRS121814.jpg", "description": "President Obama's fiscal year 2016 budget proposal has no chance of passing; but, as always, it serves as a compass for his agenda.", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS wants 9,000 new employees to help enforce Obamacare"}, "description": "President Obama's fiscal year 2016 budget proposal has no chance of passing; but, as always, it serves as a compass for his agenda.", "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 135282966636750}, "article": {"section": "Taxpayer Dimes", "published_time": "2015-02-05T14:44:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-06T14:10:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "bvYDjX4XBto8stfZA3uAxLxNaRlmJGvc5BQnIbK_wQo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Personal Liberty, Ben Bullard, Budget Proposal, John Koskinen, IRS, Obamacare, Budget"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5f7e\"", "article_summary": "From The Daily Signal:The billions of dollars will help the agency bolster its staff by adding more than 9,280 full-time employees.\nTo enforce the 46 new tax provisions of the Affordable Care Act specifically, the IRS asked for $67 million.\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen, you may recall, has promised even poorer \u201ccustomer service\u201d from the IRS this year.\nThe IRS has asked for \u2014 and received (from Obama, anyway) \u2014 approval for a bump of more than 9,000 employees and an addition $2 billion in its annual operating budget.\n\u2026 In addition, the agency requested $301.5 million to hire close to 3,000 additional staff to assist taxpayers calling into the agency with questions."}
