Your job and education can suffer, and experts believe hearing loss needs to become prioritized as an important health concern in order to improve the future hearing of others.\n\n\u201cI think hearing is an important part of our well-being and losing your hearing shouldn\u2019t be something people just accept as a natural result of aging,\u201d Dr. Stefanie Wolf, a clinical audiologist at Audiology of Nassau County, told Medical Daily. \u201cI\u2019m fulfilled by my job because it\u2019s like turning a light on for some people and changing their lives. I help people by re-arming them with the tools they need to communicate.\u201d\n\nMost of Wolf\u2019s patients are 65 years and older, which is no surprise considering by the time a person hits that age, one in three people have hearing loss. However, she also treats people with congenital hearing loss, which means the person is born without hearing, while gradual hearing loss seen in elderly patients happens over time. Wolf said they\u2019re seeing younger and younger people noticing a change in their hearing and coming in for an exam, and believes it\u2019s a combination of awareness and increased hearing damage from technology, such as earbud headphones.\n\nVolume is measured in decibels, and as it rises, the volume increases along with its threat to your hearing. The volume of a normal conversation at a distance 3 feet away from the speaker is 60 dB, while a garbage truck, motorcycle, snowmobile, power lawnmower, snowmobile, or jackhammer can range from 85 to 100 dB. The upper threshold for human hearing is 130 dB and will tip you off because it\u2019s when the noise becomes painful.\n\nDanger of causing permanent damage to your hearing is when you expose yourself to a rock concert, jet engine firecracker, gunfire, ambulance siren, chainsaw, or the maximum volume of home stereo speakers. These all range between 110 to 140 dB and just one minute of exposure to any of these noises can result in permanent hearing loss, according to the National Institutes of Health. Gunfire and explosions are the number one cause of disability for those in combat at war.\n\nMany parents question how ear buds are affecting their children\u2019s hearing, especially when they can hear the music through the earphones themselves, indicating the high volume could be at damaging levels. Wolf suggests avoiding the background noise battle. If you\u2019ve ever taken a subway ride, you\u2019ll recognize right away how difficult it is to block out the outside noise with your own music unless you compete and crank up the output.\n\nExpensive headphones have special noise-cancelling technology to both protect your ears from the high music volume and keep out disrupting background noise. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the output levels,\u201d Wolf said. She adds, you don\u2019t have to spend a lot of money on ear protection, but by paying attention to the output level of headphones, ear buds, stereos, and loud noise proximity, your hearing can be greatly saved. The key is valuing what so many of us take for granted every day, like when a noisy car passes by, listening to a baby laugh, or participating in meetings at work.\n\n\u201cAs untreated hearing loss progresses, your job performance decreases and there\u2019s a known compensation decrease that comes with it,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cA big problem is they don\u2019t want to appear stupid and they\u2019ll just nod their head. It\u2019s sad to think of all the things they\u2019re missing throughout the day by faking it.\u201d\n\nApproximately 20 percent of adults in the United States have hearing loss, and an additional 48 percent report experiencing some degree of hearing loss, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. It causes isolation when a person can't hear what's going on around them and oftentimes it causes depression because of the gradual decrease in person-to-person interaction. Technology is changing and improving rapidly, but Wolf said working with patients and fitting them for hearing aids is meant to be a process and not just a product. Every day there are new hearing aids advertised, and it\u2019s difficult to discern which ones are right for them, and sometimes the wealth of information confuses patients and deters them from seeking treatment.\n\nChildren And Hearing Loss\n\n\u201cWe have to education people with information but not too much or it will overwhelm them, said Dr. Lori Trentacoste, an audiologist and owner of Island Better Hearing Inc., who performs hearing tests on kids, works as a consultant at schools and manages and teaches equipment use for inside the classroom. \u201cA vast majority of people have emotional and professional ramifications from untreated hearing loss. In children, untreated hearing loss will cause brains to develop less, their education will suffer, and parents and teachers might think they have selective hearing.\u201d\n\nTwo to three children out of every 1,000 are hard of hearing or deaf. However, Trentacoste has already seen an improvement in technology. Children used to be separated into special schools or misdiagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADHD). Now there are better early intervention systems in place, such as children being checked at infancy for congenital hearing loss, and mainstreaming techniques to better acclimate a student into their classroom with others.\n\n\u201cI think we need to get doctors on board and insurance companies should be asking a few key questions. Most patients don\u2019t know hearing tests are covered and their decision to get one often comes down to cost,\u201d Trentacoste, who has grown up watching her father\u2019s patients experience hearing loss and then taking over the business herself, said she\u2019s seen changes but there\u2019s still a long way to go. \u201cHearing loss shouldn\u2019t be something that stops you when you age or hold a child back from learning.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "can, you, hear, me, now, hearing, loss, and, its, role, our, health, and, happiness", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Hearing loss has become a great concern for parents and the elderly, but what about everyone else?", "title": "Hearing Loss And Its Role In Our Health And Happiness", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/can-you-hear-me-now-hearing-loss-and-its-role-our-health-and-happiness-298180", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/14/hearing-loss-changes-way-we-learn-and-interact.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hearing loss has become a great concern for parents and the elderly, but what about everyone else?", "title": "Hearing Loss And Its Role In Our Health And Happiness", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/can-you-hear-me-now-hearing-loss-and-its-role-our-health-and-happiness-298180", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/14/hearing-loss-changes-way-we-learn-and-interact.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/14/hearing-loss-changes-way-we-learn-and-interact.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-08-15T09:30:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-15T09:31:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Hearing loss has become a great concern for parents and the elderly, but what about everyone else?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd977d\"", "article_summary": "However, she also treats people with congenital hearing loss, which means the person is born without hearing, while gradual hearing loss seen in elderly patients happens over time.\n\u201cHearing loss shouldn\u2019t be something that stops you when you age or hold a child back from learning.\u201d\nYour job and education can suffer, and experts believe hearing loss needs to become prioritized as an important health concern in order to improve the future hearing of others.\n\u201cA vast majority of people have emotional and professional ramifications from untreated hearing loss.\nHearing loss can cause isolation, depression, and saddening frustrations as those who age, are born with, or have damaged their hearing on the job or at a rock concert."}
