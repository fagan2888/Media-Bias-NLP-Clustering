Even after Paton attempted to explain the court cases to her during the debate, she refused to listen and just continued her spiel. She claims that Prop. 122 \u2018leaves checks and balances up in the air,\u2019 whatever that means. In reality, it codifies an important underutilized check and balance that has been underutiliz into the Arizona state constitution.\n\nWhile Paton talked about stopping Obamacare, NSA Spying and other abuses coming down the pike from the federal government, Bahr talked about protecting legislation that could still be enforced even if Prop. 122 is passed. She also talked about protecting wolf populations, and derided her state\u2019s political process as well. Apparently she thinks that a cabal of bureaucrats in Washington D.C. know what\u2019s better for Arizonians than they do themselves.\n\nIn describing Prop. 122 and how it could safeguard the freedoms of Arizona residents, Paton said, \u201cWhen the NSA or federal government wants to take away your basic civil rights by investigating you without due process, a community like Madison, Wisconsin said we are not going to use our resources to assist them in doing that. That applies with [Prop. 122] as well.\u201d\n\nPaton has it right. Prop. 122 is clear step in the right direction toward limiting unwarranted federal control. That is why Bahr and her federal supremacist cohorts out there are so worried. They don\u2019t want the people of Arizona, or anywhere else for that matter, realizing that they will be just fine without Fedzilla.\n\nThat notion may scare certain people, but all progress and change is seen as frightening to some. Prop. 122 will, if enacted, be the first step toward a freer, more independent Republic, regardless of whatever baseless fear mongering is perpetuated by its disingenuous opposition.\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "The debate is on over an Arizona measure on the ballot that could increase resistance to unjust federal power in the state.
