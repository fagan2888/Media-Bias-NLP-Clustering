This means students and staff receiving healthcare from Biola will not see birth control options the university considers to be abortifacients \u2014 such as the morning-after pill \u2014 included in their coverage.\n\nThe decision was released Friday, four days before the law officially went into effect on January 1, 2014, according to an article by The Journal Gazette in Fort Wayne, Ind.\n\nAlso impacted by the reprieve is Grace College and Theological Seminary, which co-sued the federal government alongside Biola on Aug. 23, 2012, as previously reported by the Chimes. In addition, several Catholic institutions were allowed the same exception. The extension is implemented until the courts can make a final ruling in the lawsuit, according to The Journal Gazette.\n\nBiola released a statement in a press release on Dec. 27 in response to the decision becoming public.\n\n\u201cThis case is about whether the government can force Biola University \u2014 under penalty of severe fines \u2014 to violate its deeply held religious convictions about the sanctity of human life. Biola applauds the court for taking this initial step as the university seeks to protect its constitutionally guaranteed religious freedom,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThis most recent step comes nearly one year after the Department of Health and Human Services offered a compromise on the birth control mandate to religious organizations that feel the requirement runs counter to their beliefs about abortion. Under the new law, employees and students covered by their institution\u2019s healthcare plan will have several contraception options \u2014 such as diaphragms and intrauterine devices \u2014 covered by their monthly premiums.\n\n\n\nBy Katie Nelson\n\nOther Stories Virtual tour creates translation possibilities With USC the first to have a multilingual commencement ceremony, Biola implements a multilingual virtual tour.\n\nDiversity department plans for restructuring Funding from SGA supports eight affinity groups, part of reshaping the department currently known as MEPD.\n\nCampus construction on the rise Construction will start over the summer involving office movements in Metzger and parking structure improvements.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Chimes | Biola University", "description": "Birth control requirement for Biola postponed by district judge.", "title": "Birth control requirement for Biola postponed"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd752\"", "article_summary": "Tweet Email Birth control requirement for Biola postponedUnited States district courts granted Biola, along with several other religiously-affiliated schools, a temporary reprieve on enforcing the contraception requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\nThis means students and staff receiving healthcare from Biola will not see birth control options the university considers to be abortifacients \u2014 such as the morning-after pill \u2014 included in their coverage.\n\u201cThis case is about whether the government can force Biola University \u2014 under penalty of severe fines \u2014 to violate its deeply held religious convictions about the sanctity of human life.\nBiola applauds the court for taking this initial step as the university seeks to protect its constitutionally guaranteed religious freedom,\u201d the statement read.\nBiola released a statement in a press release on Dec. 27 in response to the decision becoming public."}
