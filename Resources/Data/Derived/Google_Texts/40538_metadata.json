Munro said King called injustice in health care \u201cshocking.\u201d\n\nRegarding health-care financing, Professor of Political Science Greg Shaw spoke about two dominant models: government-financed or market-driven. \u201cWe have this rather messy hybrid way of doing it in the United States,\u201d explained Shaw, who is the author of The Healthcare Debate, a book that traces the history of the government\u2019s role in health-care financing. \u201cWe have a lot of public dollars, we have a lot of private dollars, and we mainly have private providers, with lots of nonprofit providers as well.\u201d\n\nIn explaining a consumer-driven health care (CDHC) movement, Shaw noted the CDHC\u2019s main tenet says when individuals more directly experience the true cost of the health-care goods and services they might consume, they consume fewer services, and in ways that most appropriately meet their needs.\n\nCiting findings from a federally funded study \u2014 the late 1970s-era RAND Corporation project that remains the \u2018gold standard\u2019 on the topic \u2014 Shaw noted that people do not consume medical services in any direct proportion to their incomes.\n\n\u201cWealthy people do not care about a new intestinal procedure and say \u2018I\u2019m going to go out and get that right away,\u2019 the way they might about a new vehicle or a house,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cOn the other end of things, lower-income people do not refrain from services altogether, especially for their kids. They go and find a way to get those.\u201d\n\nShaw said approximately 70 percent of U.S. health-care dollars are spent on 10 percent of the population in a typical year.\n\n\u201cThe healthy 50 percent of the population only account for about three percent of the health-care dollars we spend,\u201d explained Shaw. \u201cWe need to understand that imposing cost-sharing on the wealthy won\u2019t save us much.\u201d\n\nShaw reminded the audience that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) focuses mostly on enhanced coverage; it focuses very little on quality or costs. The Affordable Care Act will extend coverage for more than 40 million people who have not been insured in recent years, while America still spends 17 to 18 percent of gross domestic product on health care.\n\nA market-driven model is a piece of the puzzle, but \u201cit\u2019s not going to be our salvation,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cWe do have some coverage of a generalized nature, Medicare, Medicaid, county health, but those are not intended to be universal. So we do have this hybrid model. But I do want us to think about efficient ways to get to universal coverage, that don\u2019t involve imagining that buying surgery or a band-aid or an antibiotic is just like buying a sweater or a car.\u201d\n\nTeach-In speakers Trina Scott of the Immanual Health Center (left) and Angie McLaughlin of the Community Health Care Clinic talk with President Richard F. Wilson.\n\nOther speakers included Dr. Trina Scott, medical director of Immanuel Health Center in Bloomington, and Angie McLaughlin, executive director of Community Health Care Clinic in Normal. Both spoke about local health-care delivery and financing issues. Immanuel Health Center opened in 2013 to provide a holistic approach for primary medical care, social and behavioral services, counseling and spiritual care, and community referrals for Medicare, Medicaid, uninsured and underinsured clients.\n\nMcLaughlin explained that even with expanded coverage for millions under the Affordable Care Act, there will still be tremendous need for her free clinic which serves uninsured or low-income McLean County residents. She said an information gap remains, noting that many of the clinic\u2019s clients were unaware of the Affordable Care Act or how to enroll for coverage in recent weeks.\n\nChair of Sociology and Anthropology and Associate Professor of Anthropology Rebecca Gearhart and Stutzman Peace Fellow Jennifer Prochotsky \u201916 presented the day\u2019s last session on international models of health-care delivery, particularly in rural areas of the developing world. The two related the characteristics and sustainability of several models.\n\nProchotsky\u2019s experience in international health care comes from her \u201cgap year\u201d between high school and college, when she volunteered in West Africa with Mercy Ships, the largest non-governmental hospital ship in the world. Mercy Ships provide free health care, community development projects, community health education, mental health programs, agriculture projects, and palliative care for terminally ill patients.\n\nGearhart described several models, from the \u201cguinea pig model\u201d to the \u201csurgical safari model.\u201d She said a common problem with these models is that health-care providers trained in Western facilities are not culturally competent everywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cEach society has a unique cultural framework in which its members understand illness and wellness, which health-care providers need to understand in which to successfully operate within it. It is critical to delivering quality healthcare,\u201d Gearhart said.\n\n\u201cThe notion that inadequate health care is better than no health care is also false,\u201d she added. \u201cIf medical intervention does not include necessary follow up and rehabilitation, it\u2019s not a valid form of health care.\u201d\n\nThe Action Research Center, the John and Emma Stutzman Peace Fellows Program and Unraveling Inequality, a liberal arts cluster of courses that explore human rights and social justice issues, sponsored this year\u2019s Teach-In.\n\n\n\n\n\nContact: Kim Hill, (309) 556-3960", "article_metadata": {"referrer": "always", "msapplication-TileColor": "#23965a", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc74c\"", "article_summary": "Mercy Ships provide free health care, community development projects, community health education, mental health programs, agriculture projects, and palliative care for terminally ill patients.\n\u201cThe notion that inadequate health care is better than no health care is also false,\u201d she added.\nHealth Care Part of King's Social Justice LegacyJennifer Prochotsky '16 (left) and Rebecca Gearhart (right) spoke about health-care delivery in rural areas of the developing world.\nOther speakers included Dr. Trina Scott, medical director of Immanuel Health Center in Bloomington, and Angie McLaughlin, executive director of Community Health Care Clinic in Normal.\nMunro said King called injustice in health care \u201cshocking.\u201dRegarding health-care financing, Professor of Political Science Greg Shaw spoke about two dominant models: government-financed or market-driven."}
