Do you have eyes? Is your vision unimpaired? Then of course you know, because you can see, and Rihanna\u2019s beauty is not a matter of opinion. Disagree? This website may help. She looks good with makeup, without it, with clothes, without them. Rihanna could wear a loose-fitting trash bag while dumpster-diving for candy corn and it would be considered a Fashion Moment.\n\nWhat do you remember about 2010? Do you remember that Obamacare was signed into law that year? No. You remember Rihanna\u2019s red hair, because she is an icon and that look was major. Fans have long lamented the loss of that bold shade, but now that it\u2019s back we can all breathe steady again, sleep well again, finally live our lives once more. There is a Goddess, and Her name is Rihanna.\n\nThe \u201cBitch Better Have My Money\u201d singer first debuted a reddish-brown bob at the 2015 Met Gala, but the blogosphere did not care nearly as much as it should have because did you see her yellow cape? It was like seven million canaries were skinned alive and sewn together, but in such a beautiful way.\n\nWe figured that bob was as close as we\u2019d get to Loud-era Rihanna, but then she was seen walking around and her hair was red and it was long and all the terrible things that have happened over the past five years suddenly faded into the recesses of our minds, because nothing else matters.\n\nHave you ever had red hair? It is an impossible color to maintain. But Rihanna\u2019s red could fade into that brassy, orange-brown sewer-water looking mess and still look good on her. We\u2019re ready for it, Rihanna.\n\nYou can \u2014 and should \u2014 check out a photo of Rihanna\u2019s red hair over at MTV.\n\nSee Yearbook Photos of Rihanna + More Celebs\n\nNext: Rihanna's Upcoming Album May Get TIDAL Exclusive After All", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://popcrush.com/files/2015/05/Rihanna2.jpg", "sailthru.author": "aliszubiak", "description": "Rihanna finally dyed her hair red again and all is right with the world.", "og": {"site_name": "PopCrush", "description": "Rihanna finally dyed her hair red again and all is right with the world.", "title": "Rihanna Has Red Hair Again, Nothing Else Matters", "url": "http://popcrush.com/rihanna-red-hair-again-photo/", "image": "http://popcrush.com/files/2015/05/Rihanna2.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"site": "@popcrush", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-08 14:49:35", "sailthru.title": "Rihanna Has Red Hair Again, Nothing Else Matters", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-popcrush, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, rihanna, celebrity-news, music-news, news", "fb": {"admins": 9806076, "app_id": 182203965156817}, "keywords": "rihanna red hair, rihanna red hair 2015, rihanna hair 2015 photo", "sailthru.description": "Rihanna finally dyed her hair red again and all is right with the world.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://popcrush.com/files/2015/05/Rihanna2.jpg", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbcf2\"", "article_summary": "You can \u2014 and should \u2014 check out a photo of Rihanna\u2019s red hair over at MTV.\nYou remember Rihanna\u2019s red hair, because she is an icon and that look was major.\nDimitrios Kambouris, Getty ImagesRihanna finally dyed her hair red again, and all is right with the world.\nHave you ever had red hair?\nBut Rihanna\u2019s red could fade into that brassy, orange-brown sewer-water looking mess and still look good on her."}
