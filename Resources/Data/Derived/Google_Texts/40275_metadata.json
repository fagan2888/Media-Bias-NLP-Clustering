(AP) - Jim Harbaugh is done as coach of the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nHarbaugh said after a 20-17 victory against playoff-bound Arizona on Sunday that he is leaving the 49ers, but did not say if he was resigning or was fired.\n\nAsked whether it was his choice to move on, he said, \u201cYou work at the pleasure of the organization, that\u2019s what we all do.\u201d\n\nHarbaugh departs with one season remaining on the $25 million, five-year contract he signed in January 2011. He led the 49ers (8-8) to three NFC title games and one loss in the Super Bowl in his four seasons.\n\nHarbaugh sprinted off the Levi\u2019s Stadium field for the final time, cradling the game ball and the players doused him with a celebratory ice bucket.\n\n\u201cJim and I have come to the conclusion that it is in our mutual best interest to move in different directions,\u201d said 49ers CEO Jed York. \u201cWe thank Jim for bringing a tremendous competitive nature and a great passion for the game to the 49ers. He and his staff restored a winning culture that has been the standard for our franchise throughout its history.\u201d\n\nColin Kaepernick threw a go-ahead 3-yard touchdown pass to Bruce Miller late in the third quarter. Anquan Boldin caught a 76-yard TD pass and went over 1,000 yards receiving. Frank Gore ran for 144 yards on 25 carries to go over 1,000 yards rushing for the eighth time in 10 NFL seasons with San Francisco.\n\nThe franchise\u2019s all-time rushing leader hopes to return to the only team he has known and the team has publicly expressed a mutual interest.\n\nNot so for Harbaugh, who would depart with one season remaining on the $25 million, five-year contract he signed in January 2011.\n\nHarbaugh spoke briefly on the field to York before the game amid unconfirmed reports the coach is bound for alma mater Michigan. Harbaugh said \u201cannouncements\u201d will be made.\n\nSan Francisco missed the playoffs following three straight trips to the NFC championship game and a runner-up Super Bowl finish after the 2012 season. The 49ers, plagued by injuries to key players all season, snapped a four-game losing streak, their first under Harbaugh\n\nThe Cardinals (11-5) missed the franchise\u2019s first 12-win season.\n\nRyan Lindley threw touchdown passes of 20 and 41 yards to Michael Floyd in the first half, but couldn\u2019t deliver late.\n\nFloyd finished with eight catches for 153 yards. Coach Bruce Arians went with Lindley under center after he originally planned to start rookie Logan Thomas before changing his mind.\n\nLindley was intercepted three times.\n\nThe No. 5 seed Cardinals missed the division title, too, as defending Super Bowl champion Seattle beat St. Louis 20-6 to win the NFC West and the overall top seed. The Cardinals play at Carolina next weekend.\n\nLindley threw his first career touchdown pass on his 229th attempt with a 20-yard completion to Floyd on Arizona\u2019s opening drive.\n\nArians has been optimistic Drew Stanton will be back next week from a sprained right knee that got infected.\n\nBoldin caught a 9-yard touchdown pass that was negated by rookie center Marcus Martin\u2019s chop block penalty. Alfonso Smith also had his short scoring run negated when Harbaugh called timeout. Then came Miller\u2019s TD catch.\n\nFranchise rushing leader Gore provided a bright spot at $1.3 billion Levi\u2019s Stadium, where San Francisco finished 4-4. Gore, with his family in attendance and wearing his No. 21 jersey, became the 11th player in NFL history with eight 1,000-yard seasons and 20th player to reach 11,000 yards rushing.\n\nPhil Dawson kicked a 53-yard field goal early in the second quarter, just clearing the crossbar, then also hit from 37 yards before halftime.\n\nBoldin caught a 76-yard touchdown pass from Kaepernick, the second-longest TD catch of his career. Boldin became the fourth player in 49ers franchise history with multiple 1,000-yard receiving seasons, joining Jerry Rice (12), Terrell Owens (5) and John Taylor (2).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jim Harbaugh is done as coach of the San Francisco 49ers.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jim Harbaugh is done as coach of the San Francisco 49ers.", "title": "49ers win 20-17 in Jim Harbaugh\u2019s last game", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/28/49ers-win-in-jim-harbaughs-likely-last-game/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/28/4351dd2afed18f32690f6a7067002fbb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/28/4351dd2afed18f32690f6a7067002fbb.jpg", "description": "Jim Harbaugh is done as coach of the San Francisco 49ers.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "49ers win 20-17 in Jim Harbaugh\u2019s last game"}, "Author": "JANIE McCAULEY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jim Harbaugh, San Francisco 49Ers, Anquan Boldin, San Francisco"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb011\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe thank Jim for bringing a tremendous competitive nature and a great passion for the game to the 49ers.\nBoldin caught a 9-yard touchdown pass that was negated by rookie center Marcus Martin\u2019s chop block penalty.\nLindley threw his first career touchdown pass on his 229th attempt with a 20-yard completion to Floyd on Arizona\u2019s opening drive.\nRyan Lindley threw touchdown passes of 20 and 41 yards to Michael Floyd in the first half, but couldn\u2019t deliver late.\nBoldin caught a 76-yard touchdown pass from Kaepernick, the second-longest TD catch of his career."}
