Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.\u201d Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nThere is something very wrong with (and for) many white men in America. They are so damned angry.\n\nIt is a phenomenon that is distinctly un-lovable, and yet love may be the most effective response.\n\nAs a member of that cohort, I get it: every rule we were taught growing up has changed, every promise that was made has been broken. How we interact with women, privilege and all that it manifested for our fathers, grandfathers and forefathers, and everything it meant in terms of being a man, a provider and protector\u2026. Gone. The problem is the role of virile alpha male provider/protector is hard-wired into our brain. It is our very definition of \u201cmanhood.\u201d Faced with uncertainty and change, the response of circling up protection around what we \u201cknow\u201d and responding aggressively against the unknown, is second nature. The racism we see in America today is inseparable from the broken promise of a \u201cbirthright\u201d and privilege, and the scaling back of hopes and expectations as wages decline. Being AGAINST something focuses that energy like a laser, whereas being FOR something diffuses positive energy into an array of options. This is why right-wing talk radio works and attempts at liberal talk radio have failed miserably. Conservatives have bulleted talking points that are relentlessly AGAINST something. Even when they say they are \u201cpro-life,\u201d the focus is so narrow, that it comes down to being AGAINST abortion and nothing more. They\u2019re AGAINST \u201cObamacare,\u201d but press them for an alternative and you get a look of canine puzzlement. Progressives, meanwhile, want to include everybody and can\u2019t seem to herd the cats. Applied to light, it is almost literally the difference between generating heat and illumination. Negativity feeds on its own energy. The harder part is seeing what fuels the fire \u2014 fear \u2014 and responding with compassion and empathy. The racism we see in America today is inseparable from the broken promise of a \u201cbirthright\u201d and privilege, and the scaling back of hopes and expectations as wages decline. As in pre-WWII Germany, racism whispers in the ears of white men, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault you can\u2019t provide for your family, that you\u2019re not going to do as well as your father did; it\u2019s THEIR fault!\u201d and it points it\u2019s bony finger at women who\u2019ve gone to work (\u201cbecause if you were man enough, she wouldn\u2019t HAVE to work, taking a job away from a man.\u201d), Or at immigrants. Or anyone else who is \u201cdifferent.\u201d It\u2019s easy to feel bowled over by the laser-focused blast of anger and negativity, or feel the need to match it in kind. The harder part is seeing what fuels the fire \u2014 fear \u2014 and responding with compassion and empathy. I get it. Angry white guy is exhausting and distinctly unsympathetic. There is much to hate about hatred, but that can only yield more of the same. If we can bring ourselves to recognize bigotry, gun culture, misogyny and white male rage as merely the outward symptoms of a very real fear, we can meet fear with empathy, compassion and even love.\n\n\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\n\nThe solution is found in realizing that our fathers\u2019 definition of what is to be a man doesn\u2019t work anymore and we haven\u2019t filled that void. Packing a sidearm for a Starbucks run and curtailing the rights of others doesn\u2019t make one a man, it makes one a frightened bully.\n\nFew things are as dangerous as a person who has what he perceives to be a righteous anger and nothing to lose.\n\nA man is someone who calls fear by its name and leans into it anyway. He is not owned or diminished by it. He realizes that evolution favors not the strongest, but the most adaptable. He realizes that complicated times demand agility. He applies his solution-finding skills in new and innovative ways, as his forefathers did before him.\n\nAngry white men are in their final throes because they refuse to find a way to adapt and evolve. Few things are as dangerous as a person who has what he perceives to be a righteous anger and nothing to lose. That\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing terrorism, fascism and a spike in suicide among working class white males. It\u2019s a fine line between offing oneself and making it a political statement by taking others with you.\n\nHurt people hurt others. We can stop the hurt if we can re-frame a masculine response to a very uncertain time. It may be that the most effective tool against angry white guy is the one weapon he doesn\u2019t have in his arsenal: empathy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Good Men Project", "description": "Instead of ignoring the anger, put it to a positive use.", "title": "Why Angry White Men are so Angry -", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 588, "identifier": "http://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/angry-white-man.jpg", "height": 350}, "updated_time": "2015-12-20T11:37:57-04:00", "url": "http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/angry-white-men-wcz/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thegoodmenproject", "section": "Featured Content", "tag": "white men", "published_time": "2015-12-20T08:30:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-20T11:37:57-04:00"}, "fb": {"admins": 1467427114, "app_id": 794063960644791}, "twitter": {"description": "Instead of ignoring the anger, put it to a positive use.", "creator": "@goodmenproject", "image": "http://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/angry-white-man.jpg", "title": "Why Angry White Men are so Angry -", "site": "@goodmenproject", "card": "summary"}}, "article_summary": "Angry white men are in their final throes because they refuse to find a way to adapt and evolve.\nIt may be that the most effective tool against angry white guy is the one weapon he doesn\u2019t have in his arsenal: empathy.\nThere is something very wrong with (and for) many white men in America.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing terrorism, fascism and a spike in suicide among working class white males.\nAngry white guy is exhausting and distinctly unsympathetic."}
