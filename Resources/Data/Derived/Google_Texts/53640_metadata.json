And after hyping the alleged benefits for nearly a decade, the RAND Corporation finally fessed up that its cost-savings predictions of $81 billion a year \u2014 used repeatedly to support the Obama EMR mandate \u2014 were (like every other Obamacare promise) vastly overstated.\n\nIn June, the Annals of Emergency Medicine published a study warning that the \u201crush to capitalize on the huge federal investment of $30 billion for the adoption of electronic medical records led to some unfortunate and unintended consequences\u201d tied to \u201ccommunication failure, poor data display, wrong order/wrong patient errors and alert fatigue.\u201d\n\nAlso this summer, Massachusetts reported that 60 percent of doctors could not meet the EMR mandate and will face the potential loss of their licenses in 2015.

Zwerling, an internal-medicine physician in Massachusetts who is also president of ComChart Medical Software, blasted the Obamacare EMR mandate in a recent open letter: \u201cAs the developer of an EMR, I sincerely believe that a well-designed EMR is a useful tool for many practices. However, the federal and state government\u2019s misguided obsession to stipulate which features must be in the EMRs, and how the physician should use the EMRs in the exam room, places the politicians in the middle of the exam room between the patient and the physician, and seriously disrupts the physician-patient relationship.\u201d\n\nZwerling\u2019s call to arms appealed to fellow doctors to pressure the feds to repeal the mandate. \u201cIt is past time that physicians reclaim control of their offices, if not the practice of medicine.\u201d\n\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned previously, my own primary-care physician in Colorado Springs quit her regular practice and converted to \u201cconcierge care\u201d because of the EMR imposition. Dr. Henry Smith, a Pennsylvania pulmonary doctor, also walked away. \u201cFaced with the implementation costs and skyrocketing overhead in general,\u201d he told me, \u201cI finally threw in the towel and closed my practice.\u201d He said, \u201cAs EMRs proliferate, and increased Medicare scrutiny looms, medical documentation is evolving from its original goal of recording what actually was going on with a patient, and what the provider was actually thinking, to sterile boilerplate documents designed to justify the highest billing codes.\u201d\n\nDr. Michael Laidlaw of Rocklin, Calif., abandoned the Obamacare EMR \u201cincentive\u201d program when he realized that he \u201cspent the first two to five minutes of each visit endlessly clicking a bunch of garbage to make all the green lights show up on the [meaningful use] meter,\u201d he told EHR Practice Consultants. \u201cI said to myself: \u2018I\u2019m not wasting precious seconds of my life and my patients\u2019 time to ensure some database gets filled with data.
