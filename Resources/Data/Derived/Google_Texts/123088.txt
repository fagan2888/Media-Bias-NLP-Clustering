Wednesday on Newsmax TV’s “The Steve Malzberg Show,” Rep. Steve King (R-IA) said Rep. Peter King’s (R-NY) criticisms of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and the reported targeting of Tea Party conservatives by House Speaker Boehner (R-OH) with political ads is “cannibalism.”

King was reacting to reports that Boehner has denied that he was involved with the American Action Network’s ad campaign targeting GOP Reps. Tim Huelskamp (R-KA), Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Jim Bridenstine (R-OK) for opposing the DHS funding bill to fight President Barack Obama’s amnesty.

Boehner’s former chief of staff, Barry Jackson is a board member at American Action Network.

King said this all goes back to the establishment branch of the Republican Party being angry over the Cruz led 2013 government shutdown in opposition to the Affordable Care Act.
