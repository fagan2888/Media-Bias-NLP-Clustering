Bowe Bergdahl, a former prisoner in Afghanistan, for five Taliban leaders, government investigators said Thursday.\n\nThe nonpartisan Government Accountability Office said the Defense Department failed to notify the relevant congressional committees at least 30 days in advance of the exchange\u2014violating a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation\u2019s Cully Stimson, manager of the think tank\u2019s national security law program, previously coordinated the Pentagon\u2019s global detention policy and operations, including at Guantanamo Bay and in Iraq and Afghanistan. Stimson has questioned the constitutionality the law in question. Nonetheless, he said, \u201cthat\u2019s not the point.\u201d\n\nThe GAO report did not touch on the constitutionality of that section of the law. The law was on the books, and the administration broke it. There is no remedy, no trial or no enforcement mechanism that will come from this [report], but it\u2019s embarrassing for the administration.\n\nGAO investigators also said the Defense Department used $988,400 of a wartime account to make the transfer.\n\nBecause the Pentagon\u2019s use of funds hadn\u2019t been expressly appropriated, the expenditure violated the Anti-Deficiency Act, the GAO concluded.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the meaning of the (law) is clear and unambiguous,\u201d the GAO wrote to nine Republican senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and various committees. \u201cSection 8111 prohibits the use of \u2018funds appropriated or otherwise made available\u2019 in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2014, to transfer any individual detained at Guantanamo Bay to the custody or control of a foreign entity\u2019 except in accordance\u201d with the law.\n\nEarly this summer, the Obama administration released five senior Taliban leaders from detention at Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Bergdahl, who had disappeared from his post in Paktika province in eastern Afghanistan on June 30, 2009.\n\nThe five Taliban are to supposed remain in Qatar for a year.\n\nAt the time of the exchange, Republican lawmakers criticized Obama for not telling them about it before it happened.\n\nObama defended his actions, saying that if word of the deal were leaked out, Bergdahl would have been killed.\n\nBergdahl is currently on active duty doing administrative work at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio while the Army investigates the circumstances surrounding his capture.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Pentagon broke the law when it swapped Army Sgt.
