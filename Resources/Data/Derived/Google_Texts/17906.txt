A new poll found 76 percent of Americans are concerned about Obamacare’s 40 percent tax on premium health plans, better known as the Cadillac tax, going into effect.

The survey, put out by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Business Roundtable on Wednesday, shows just 9 percent said they didn’t see the implementation as a problem while 15 percent said they were unsure.

The tax was intended to generate $87 billion over the course of 10 years to expand government health care.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, one in four employers will be affected by the looming tax increase, likely leading to higher out-of-pocket costs for the insured party. Politicians on both ends of the political spectrum have spoken out against the tax, including Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernard Sanders .

House Republicans included eliminating the provision in their reconciliation bill, designed to unravel several key parts of Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood.

If it isn’t repealed, the non-deductible excise tax will go into affect in 2018.

Morning Consult surveyed 1,543 registered voters from Sept. 24-27. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5.
