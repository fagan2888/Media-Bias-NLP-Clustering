After being closed for more than 15 months, management of Boulder's Gondolier Italian Eatery announced that the restaurant will again be welcoming guests at its new location beginning Thursday.



According to an update posted on its Facebook page this week, the restaurant, now located at 4800 Baseline Road, Suite A-104, will accept a limited number of reservations for Thursday.

To place one, potential customers are asked to call 303-443-5015.



The Gondolier last served patrons on Sept. 22, 2012, when it was located at 1600 Pearl St., one of four locations it inhabited since debuting in Boulder in 1960.



At the time of its the closure, owner Nelson Kugel said the "family friendly" business needed to find a smaller location.
