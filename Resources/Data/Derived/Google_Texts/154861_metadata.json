The attack centered around the fact that Kelly, who served as a federal public defender in Iowa for nearly 20 years, once arranged a plea deal for a client charged with receiving and possessing child pornography. National Review suggested that\u2019s disqualifying for Kelly.\n\nNote: Public defenders are paid to advocate for clients and sometimes those clients are guilty. (The whole point of the job is written into the Constitution.) Attacking a jurist for previously serving the state by providing accused criminals their constitutionally mandated right to legal representation is, of course, a duplicitous cheap shot.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this guilt-by-association playbook used before when conservatives try to demean jurists promoted by Democrats. And according to Republicans, who have already vowed to block Obama\u2019s nomination and to not even hold hearings, the ugly attacks are only going to intensify when Obama\u2019s pick is announced. \u201cI think they will bear some resemblance to a pi\u00f1ata,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) said of the soon-to-be nominee. (A day after Cornyn\u2019s \u201cpi\u00f1ata\u201d remark, video was unearthed of Cornyn saying in 2006, \u201cThe current regime treats Supreme Court nominees more like pi\u00f1atas than human beings. And that\u2019s something none of us should be willing to tolerate.\u201d)\n\nEarly indications are those pi\u00f1ata attacks will be specious, mean-spirited, and detached from reality. And yes, Republicans will surely be working behind the scenes with the conservative media in an attempt to degrade the next high court nominee. So while Republicans obstruct in the Senate, the Fox News-led noise machine will likely be blaring out attacks and misinformation.\n\nThe third leg of the attack apparatus is made up of conservative groups like the Judicial Crisis Network and America Rising, which churn out hit pieces on Obama judicial picks that are repeated endlessly by the right-wing media. \u201cTop Republican senators are also expected to meet with conservative groups involved in the strategy,\u201dPolitico recently reported.\n\nTrue story: Under President George W. Bush, Judicial Crisis Network\u2019s name was Judicial Confirmation Network and its guiding principle was to \u201censure that the confirmation process for all judicial nominees is fair and that every nominee sent to the full Senate receives an up or down vote.\u201d\n\nToday, not so much.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that with the GOP\u2019s radical blockade surrounding this nomination, we\u2019ve already entered uncharted political waters. With the Republicans\u2019 refusal to even meet with Obama\u2019s nominee, the GOP has opted to systematically shred more than 100 years of Washington, D.C. protocol for Supreme Court nominations. But that doesn\u2019t mean the press should allow the conservative media to also rewrite the norms of the nomination process. And that shouldn\u2019t give the far-right press the power to dictate the public debate that will soon unfold.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives are already smearing jurists thought to be under consideration -- with zero pushback from our press", "author": "Eric Boehlert", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Conservatives are already smearing jurists thought to be under consideration -- with zero pushback from our press", "title": "They\u2019re never letting him govern: How the right has conspired to form a Supreme Court blockade", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/13/theyre_never_letting_him_govern_how_the_gop_and_the_right_wing_media_have_conspired_to_form_a_supreme_court_blockade_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/barack_obama30.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservatives are already smearing jurists thought to be under consideration -- with zero pushback from our press", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/barack_obama30.jpg", "title": "They\u2019re never letting him govern: How the right has conspired to form a Supreme Court blockade", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "They\u2019re never letting him govern: How the right has conspired to form a Supreme Court blockade", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Antonin Scalia, Harvard Law School, Media Matters, Supreme Court", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But that doesn\u2019t mean the press should allow the conservative media to also rewrite the norms of the nomination process.\nAnd that\u2019s something none of us should be willing to tolerate.\u201d)Early indications are those pi\u00f1ata attacks will be specious, mean-spirited, and detached from reality.\nAnd yes, Republicans will surely be working behind the scenes with the conservative media in an attempt to degrade the next high court nominee.\n(A day after Cornyn\u2019s \u201cpi\u00f1ata\u201d remark, video was unearthed of Cornyn saying in 2006, \u201cThe current regime treats Supreme Court nominees more like pi\u00f1atas than human beings.\nWith the Republicans\u2019 refusal to even meet with Obama\u2019s nominee, the GOP has opted to systematically shred more than 100 years of Washington, D.C. protocol for Supreme Court nominations."}
