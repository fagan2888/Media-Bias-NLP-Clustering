I entered the case management field in the \u201990s when it was common practice to work in your own silo. And the lines of communication between facilities or individuals weren\u2019t always open.\n\nThis defined case management in the acute setting for many years.\n\nIf you\u2019re still in this model, there\u2019s no better time to transition to an updated, outcomes-driven model (that focuses on the big picture) than right now! Your organization simply can\u2019t afford to wait.\n\nAs case managers, we must take ownership of the challenge and rise to the occasion, paving the path to better coordination (which ultimately leads to better outcomes). Not only dealing with the acute episode, but thinking about how we position our patients to be as successful as possible when they leave the hospital and transition to the next level.\n\nThe IHI Triple Aim (improving the experience of care, improving the health of populations and reducing per capita costs of healthcare) is great news for assertive, proactive case managers who have long yearned for teamwork, and have historically spent the majority of their day trying to figure out the patient\u2019s plan and get team members on the same page \u2013 all while engaging the patient at the same time.\n\nThis is not-so-good news if you\u2019re a case manager that enjoyed a case management model strictly focused on discharge planning and retroactive utilization reviews. This model and continued mindset isn\u2019t acceptable to produce optimal outcomes in today\u2019s environment.\n\nThe acute case manager in today\u2019s world should be viewed as a leader in the organization, who is committed to contributing to quality and financial outcomes.\n\nHaving said this, case management departments and personnel must have the organizational support, education, tools and appropriate resources to meet the expectations. Not to mention a shared organizational vision, responsibility for care coordination and the realization that everyone in the organization plays a part in that process.\n\nOrganizations must also recognize that case management departments alone can\u2019t solely control metrics like readmissions, length of stay, cost per case, throughput, etc. Care managers can certainly impact and influence these metrics, but need the entire culture to be proactive with a shared sense of urgency to deliver high-quality, cost-effective care.\n\nTeamwork is a beautiful thing! Get your case management in order (if needed) then invite and educate others in the organization to share in your vision for timely, well-coordinated, cost-effective, high-quality care across the continuum! Your patients will thank you for it.\n\nThis post appeared first at Action for Better Healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/acute-care-case-management-model-must-change", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Is your hospital's case management model strictly focused on discharge planning and retroactive utilization reviews?
