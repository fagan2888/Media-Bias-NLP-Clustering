It was the second go-round, as they had first offered living wills in 2012 that the regulators found unsatisfactory. The news yesterday wasn\u2019t much better, as the FDIC and Federal Reserve announced they had sent all 11 plans back to be rewritten.\n\nRelated: Why Too Big to Fail Is a Bigger Problem than Ever\n\nIn a press release, the agencies said that while all the plans had individual problems, there were a number of issues common to all of them, including \u201cassumptions that the agencies regard as unrealistic or inadequately supported, such as assumptions about the likely behavior of customers, counterparties, investors, central clearing facilities, and regulators.\u201d Regulators also noted \u201cthe failure to make, or even to identify, the kinds of changes in firm structure and practices that would be necessary to enhance the prospects for orderly resolution.\u201d\n\nThe regulators continued, \u201cBased on the review of the 2013 plans, the FDIC Board of Directors determined\u2026that the plans\u2026are not credible and do not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Federal Reserve Board determined that the 11 banking organizations must take immediate action to improve their resolvability.\u201d\n\nCritics of the Dodd-Frank Act pounced, saying that the agencies\u2019 finding proves that, even now, large banks would still have to be bailed out in the event of a bankruptcy filing.\n\nRelated: The Next Financial Crisis Is Brewing Right Now, and Regulators Are Missing It\n\nThis is one of the three legs of the stool from Dodd-Frank, and they just had it kicked out from under them,\u201d said Prof. Cornelius Hurley, who directs the Boston University Center for Finance, Law & Policy. \u201cIt validates what almost everybody that has taken a look at the plan thinks. I say hooray for their candor.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, the banking industry had a different take.\n\n\u201cWhen everybody fails the test it says as much about the test as it does about the tested,\u201d said Wayne Abernathy, executive vice president for financial institutions policy at the American Bankers Association. \u201cIt says we\u2019re learning how to do this. It\u2019s a brand new idea.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cRegulators were really unspecific about what they wanted. The statement today just reinforces that they are just trying to work their way through this.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Obama administration promises that no U.S. banks are \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d anymore.
