Two more lectures are upcoming this month.\n\nOne of the doctors spearheading the effort is Dr. Edwin Feliciano, who works as UCSB\u2019s behavioral health director for student health.\n\nFeliciano said the idea started as a casual one, with local physicians.\n\n\u201cSome of us started talking about how it would have been so helpful if someone had explained the ins and outs of going into the field when we were in college,\u201d he told Noozhawk.\n\nAbout a year ago, Feliciano began talking with his friend, Dr. Ben Taylor, a cardiothoracic surgeon, about the lack of doctors and health-care reform.\n\n\u201cOne of the slowest parts of that is getting students into medical school,\u201d he said.\n\nWithout a local medical school to capture students who are interested in the health-care field, he said Taylor \u201cwanted to start somewhere and suggested the lecture series.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter speaking with several physicians in the community, I realized there was a great deal of interest in giving back to the community in the form of educating college students and creating interest in the medical profession,\u201d Feliciano said.\n\nHe mentioned the idea to Claudine Mitchel, assistant vice chancellor for student affairs, and the idea took off.\n\nThe lecture series has already seen two speakers, and \u201cit\u2019s been incredibly interesting,\u201d Feliciano said. \u201cThese students considering health careers have wonderful questions.\u201d\n\nDoctors are asked about the high cost of medical school and how they made it work for them, as well as the pressure of their careers.\n\nFeliciano said he was surprised to discover that about 15 pre-health organizations exist on UCSB\u2019s campus. About 100 students have showed up for each talk so far.\n\nThe opening lecture, on Jan. 13, featured Dr. Dave Thoman, a bariatric surgeon who described his personal experience in deciding to attend medical school and specializing in surgery.\n\nFeliciano said Thoman recounted for students how he joined the Navy to help pay for medical school, and ended up in the middle of the ocean on an aircraft carrier, conducting surgeries.\n\nDr. Miguel Pedroza, a family practitioner, spoke on Jan. 27.\n\nThe series will continue Monday with Dr. Pamela Lee, a colorectal surgeon. On Feb. 24, Dr. Karen Lin DDS will be the featured speaker.\n\nA guest speaks for about an hour, talking about his or her journey in the medical field, then takes questions from the audience.\n\n\u201cAll these people are doing this on a volunteer basis,\u201d Feliciano said,\n\nThe lectures are from 7 to 8:30 p.m. every other Monday at Broida Hall, Room 1610.\n\nLocal students not enrolled at UCSB but interested in health fields are invited to attend, and Feliciano said even high school students interested in the field are welcome.\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk staff writer Lara Cooper can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) .
