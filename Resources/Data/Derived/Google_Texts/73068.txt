Jeb Bush comes in second among millionaires, with 18 percent. But among Republican millionaires, the former Republican Florida governor is far and away the top choice, with 36 percent support. The runner-up among GOP millionaires is Governor Christie, with 19 percent, followed by Governor Walker, with 18 percent.

Christie attracted more Independent millionaires than any other Republican candidate, with 19 percent (second only to Clinton among Independent millionaire voters).

The wealthier millionaires, however, are split between Clinton and Jeb Bush, each getting 27 percent of the vote.

While millionaires have outsized impacts on elections—with their money, influence and votes—they have not always proved to be good predictors of presidential candidates. Before the 2008 election, polls showed that a majority of millionaires planned to support Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), while Barak Obama had the support of the super-wealthy, those with $30 million or more.

In the 2008 election itself, Obama won more than half the votes of people who earned $200,000 or more, while 46 percent supported Senator McCain. Those measurements were by income, however, and not by wealth like the CNBC millionaire survey.

Before the 2012 election, most millionaires supported Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for president and former governor of Massachusetts.
