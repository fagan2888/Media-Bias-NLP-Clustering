She\u2019s battled a severe case of Crohn\u2019s disease for the last decade, along with CVID (common variable immune deficiency) and HLRCC (hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer), the latter of which resulted in a nephrectomy for renal cell cancer.\n\nGarrett is 5\u201910\u201d and although she was once a healthy 145 pounds, her weight dropped to 93 pounds earlier this year. She\u2019s in chronic pain, unable to work, and has to live with her parents.\n\nShe lost her health insurance several years ago when she changed jobs, and couldn\u2019t purchase coverage on her own because of her pre-existing conditions. But Obamacare fixed that, right?\n\nVictims of anti-ACA politics\n\nWell, it tried. But Garrett lives in Florida, and Florida\u2019s leadership has resisted Obamacare at every turn. When the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion, Florida took them up on that. Garrett should be eligible for Medicaid because she\u2019s too sick to work and has no income. But instead she\u2019s in the coverage gap, with no realistic access to health coverage.\n\nGarrett resorted to GoFundMe in an effort to cover the cost of the treatments that could make her well. She\u2019s raised a little over $2,400 in three months, but that doesn\u2019t go very far when the medications she needs are $8,000 per month.\n\nJanis Cox Case also lives in Florida. She has lupus, and fibromyalgia so painful she\u2019s sometimes confined to bed. She can\u2019t work as a result of her illness, so her family of three lives on about $1,000 a month. If she lived in another state, she\u2019d be eligible for Medicaid and able to get the healthcare she needs. But instead, she has to hope that strangers will be kind enough to cover her medical bills.\n\nGarrett and Case are essentially in the same boat with Luis Lang, who\u2019s also in the coverage gap in South Carolina. But Lang\u2019s GoFundMe appeal went viral last week, largely because he\u2019s controversial: he rejected Obamacare, missed open enrollment, and then \u2013 faced with huge medical bills \u2013 he crowdfunded for help. (His saga continues \u2013 and that\u2019s great for his crowdfunding goal.)\n\nMillions of other Americans are in similar \u2013 or worse \u2013 predicaments, often through no fault of their own, and their financial struggles are ongoing.\n\nDaunting out-of-pocket costs\n\nFor people with ACA-compliant health insurance, the good news is that out-of-pocket expenses are now capped at $6,600 for an individual, and $13,200 for a family. But those costs can still be insurmountable to families living paycheck to paycheck. Nearly half of American households don\u2019t save any of their income. Even for people with health insurance, paying for care is a growing struggle. Are we willing to stand by and watch people endure debilitating medical conditions simply because they don\u2019t have any savings?\n\nDenise Tolosi needs cataract surgery. She can\u2019t drive anymore, and her husband, Frank, reports that she\u2019s close to losing her job because of her failing eyesight. Frank told me they pay $170 a week for health insurance through his employer, but they can\u2019t afford the $6,600 in out-of-pocket costs for the surgeries Denise needs.\n\nThe first surgery has been completed; the hospital told them it would cost about $2,000, but they ended up with a bill for $2,823 that must be paid in full before Denise can have the two remaining surgeries she needs. Denise is going blind because she and her husband can\u2019t afford cataract surgery.\n\nCharda Hastings has hereditary polycystic kidney and liver disease (PKD), and has been on dialysis for a decade. She\u2019s wheelchair-bound, and lost part of a foot and several fingers following a staph infection. Fortunately for Hastings, she has Medicare because of her kidney failure, and it will cover the cost of a kidney transplant that will greatly improve her quality of life.\n\nBut the hospital requires her to have three weeks of round-the-clock care following the transplant, and her GoFundMe account is an effort to pay for that care (Medicare covers skilled nursing care following a hospital stay, but not custodial care). Her attitude is remarkably positive given her circumstances.\n\nThese are just a few of the 110,000 GoFundMe pages that have been created to help people who are in dire straits at the intersection of health and finances. Their situations are ample proof that regardless of what elected officials might say, we don\u2019t all have access to healthcare in the United States.\n\nA great number of Americans are falling through the cracks in our healthcare system, and they deserve better than having to resort to crowdfunding.", "article_metadata": {"description": "These are just a few of the 110,000 GoFundMe pages that have been created to help people who are in dire straits at the intersection of health and finances.
