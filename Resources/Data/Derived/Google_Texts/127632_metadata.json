The total price of the feast increased 70 cents (or 1.4 percent) to $50.11 from 2014. The average cost of food for the celebration has remained around $49 since 2011.\n\nThe most expensive item on the list is a 16-pound turkey, which costs an average of $23.04 this year. That\u2019s up $1.39 from last year, or 6.42 percent, the largest percentage increase of all the grocery items.\n\nThe increase is largely due to production issues caused by a bird flu outbreak in the Midwest earlier this year. But turkey prices have been falling in the last week, the AFB said, as retailers aggressively market them for the holidays.\n\nRelated: Black Friday Shopping Guide: Who\u2019s Offering Deals on Thanksgiving Day\n\nFears that a pumpkin shortage from wet weather would affect Thanksgiving pies also appear to be overblown.
