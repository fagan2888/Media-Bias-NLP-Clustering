People who are sure of themselves tend to do better at interviews, on dates, and in accomplishing tasks. In our extrovert-centric society, confidence can get you a job, a girlfriend, and the courage to say no to people or situations that are toxic to you. Confidence is knowing yourself and taking care of yourself, too. Unfortunately, this societal view of exuberant confidence \u2014 where people who talk a lot are considered more competent than people who actually know more and do better \u2014 can be good in some ways, and harmful for introverts.\n\nBut it\u2019s always a fine balance. While being sure of yourself is important, it\u2019s not exactly great to be overly-confident, either, especially if you lack competence. Exuding an overabundance of confidence can be seen as arrogant, or having the assumption that you are better than you really are. Finding a balance \u2014 being aware of your weaknesses but also your strengths \u2014 is the best way to roll. Self-assess to the reality in the middle. Know that quiet competence is often more important than blatant confidence. And if you\u2019re currently feeling like you\u2019re worthless, read the below tips that can assist you in boosting your sense of self-worth so that you can start gaining that much-needed competence.\n\nExercise Consistently\n\nExercise goes a long way for a lot of aspects of life, from health and stress reduction to even confidence. When you work out, your brain releases feel-good hormones that give you that \u201crunner\u2019s high,\u201d a natural feeling of accomplishment, happiness, and relaxation. After a good run, your body feels happy tired, your stomach ever so slightly more toned, and you\u2019ve set the pace for a productive day. Exercising consistently will do wonders for both your mind and body. Being fit and feeling attractive can a huge self-esteem boost.\n\nDress Well\n\nThis may seem rather shallow, but grooming is an important part of our biology as mammals and social beings. Taking care of yourself \u2014 including little things like keeping your nails trim, flossing your teeth, and showering \u2014 can make a big difference in how you feel about yourself. Finding new clothes to wear in fresh combinations, or going out and buying a few new outfits, can give your self-confidence the small boost it needs to get going. Are you having a bad day, procrastinating, and feeling gross? Take a shower. Being clean is a refreshing feeling, and will give you the kick you need to start getting things done.\n\nStay Social\n\nGetting involved with other people will help bring you out of your negative head space. If you\u2019re finding yourself experiencing anxiety about your life\u2019s problems, spend some time helping others with their own. Assisting someone in need boosts happiness and self-worth; even if you don\u2019t have your life in order, you can feel like you are being helpful and productive to someone else.\n\nSquash Negative Thoughts Like Bugs\n\nIt\u2019s often easy to get into negative self-talk mode: Why haven\u2019t you done this yet? When will you find a better job? Why are you still single or still with this loser? What\u2019s wrong with you? Once these thoughts start popping up, squash them like bugs, then replace them with more positive ones.\n\nOn that note, resilience is an important part of staying confident. Don\u2019t beat yourself up when you get rejected by a job, love interest, or when you fail. Life doesn\u2019t always turn out to be what we think it will, and being prepared for this \u2014 as well as being able to adapt \u2014 is called resilience. Stronger resilience naturally boosts your confidence, since you won\u2019t be too hard on yourself. \u201cWhen life doesn\u2019t quite turn out the way you expect it will or want it to, give yourself a little wiggle room,\u201d Sara Elliott writes on How Stuff Works. \u201cThe more you reward yourself for stepping out of your comfort zone and trying something new instead of bashing yourself for a less-than-stellar performance, the easier it will be to tackle the next challenge with confidence.\u201d\n\nPractice Until You\u2019re Competent\n\nLearning a new skill or language can help boost your confidence, especially if it\u2019s outside of work. While \u201cfaking it till you make it\u201d can work in some situations, know that you actually have to put in the time and hard work to gain a skill or get better at something. Once you\u2019ve put in your hours, you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised to find that you can play a full song on the piano or that you've written your first good essay after all the crap.\n\nBut remember this all involves little steps. \u201cIf you want to be a more competent writer, for example, don\u2019t try to tackle the entire profession of writing all at once,\u201d Leo Babauta writes on zenhabits. Instead, take baby steps: write a little bit every day. \u201cJournal, blog, write short stories, do some freelance writing. The more you\u2019ll write, the better you\u2019ll be.\u201d Practicing even a little bit every day will increase your competence, and the better you get at something, the stronger your confidence will be.\n\nSmile\n\nHappy body language can make you feel better about yourself. In a study completed by social psychologist Amy Cuddy, researchers found that manifesting fake \u201chigh-power poses\u201d reduced cortisol, or the stress hormone, and boosted testosterone and self-confidence. Smiling, standing up straight with your shoulders back and chin up, and manifesting more \u201copen\u201d and relaxed poses will actually help you feel more confident.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "confidence, competence, boost your self-confidence", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Building your confidence (and competence) will help you achieve the things you once thought you couldn't do.", "title": "6 Scientifically-Proven Ways To Boost Your Confidence", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-boost-your-confidence-6-scientific-ways-feel-better-about-yourself-282620", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/14/dude-high-self-esteem.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Building your confidence (and competence) will help you achieve the things you once thought you couldn't do.", "title": "6 Scientifically-Proven Ways To Boost Your Confidence", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-boost-your-confidence-6-scientific-ways-feel-better-about-yourself-282620", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/14/dude-high-self-esteem.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/14/dude-high-self-esteem.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-05-14T17:42:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-14T17:48:59-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Building your confidence (and competence) will help you achieve the things you once thought you couldn't do."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1acc\"", "article_summary": "Taking care of yourself \u2014 including little things like keeping your nails trim, flossing your teeth, and showering \u2014 can make a big difference in how you feel about yourself.\nExuding an overabundance of confidence can be seen as arrogant, or having the assumption that you are better than you really are.\nSmileHappy body language can make you feel better about yourself.\nPeople who are sure of themselves tend to do better at interviews, on dates, and in accomplishing tasks.\nThe more you\u2019ll write, the better you\u2019ll be.\u201d Practicing even a little bit every day will increase your competence, and the better you get at something, the stronger your confidence will be."}
