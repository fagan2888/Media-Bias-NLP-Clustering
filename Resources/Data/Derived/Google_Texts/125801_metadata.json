In 2015, the state projects it will spend more than $685 million on the same program, a 211 percent increase. In 2003, Medicaid accounted for only 17 percent of Alabama\u2019s General Fund costs, but it has since grown to take up 37 percent in 2014.\n\n\u2018A Bigger and Bigger Problem\u2019\n\nAlabama Policy Institute Vice President Katherine Robertson says the state\u2019s budgetary problems are being driven by the constantly increasing cost of entitlement programs such as Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have to make some reforms to Medicaid,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cThere is not an obvious solution. It is clearly becoming a bigger and bigger problem.\u201d\n\nAlabama is one of 15 U.S. states refusing to expand Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare.\n\nRobertson says Medicaid expansion would have made the problem wors\n\n\u201cWe are against that,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cIt only makes the problem worse. It\u2019s expanding a program that we already can\u2019t afford.\u201d\n\nExpensive \u2018Woodwork Effect\u2019\n\nAlabama is not alone in struggling with how to deal with the rising costs of Medicaid, says Nicole Kaeding, a budget analyst with the Cato Institute.\n\n\u201cMedicaid growth is an issue in many states,\u201d Kaeding said. \u201cNationally, Medicaid is 25 percent of all state spending, with a large portion of that coming from the federal government. As a result, many states feel the weight of this large entitlement.\u201d\n\nObamacare is not the sole reason for the growth, but it is an important part of the equation, Kaeding says.\n\n\u201cMany individuals sought out coverage options in 2014 to avoid the individual mandate. As they applied for coverage, they found out that they were already eligible for Medicaid. This is called the \u2018woodwork effect,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cMedicaid is also growing rapidly at the federal level. As the federal government looks to control its growth, cuts in state reimbursements are likely, putting even more pressure on state budgets.\u201d\n\nTom Gantert (gantert@mackinac.org) is the Mackinac Center for Public Policy\u2019s senior news correspondent.\n\nInternet Info:\n\n\u201cHow Obamacare Burdens Already Strained State Budgets,\u201d Lanhee Chen, Heritage Foundation, http://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/how-obamacare-burdens-already-strained-state-budgets/\n\nThe photo, \u201cPills and money,\u201d is copyright \u00a9 2008 Ragesoss, and was made available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4303\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are going to have to make some reforms to Medicaid,\u201d Robertson said.\n\u201cMedicaid growth is an issue in many states,\u201d Kaeding said.\nThe state of Alabama is projecting a $265 million deficit this year, caused primarily by ballooning costs for entitlement programs such as Medicaid.\n\u2018A Bigger and Bigger Problem\u2019Alabama Policy Institute Vice President Katherine Robertson says the state\u2019s budgetary problems are being driven by the constantly increasing cost of entitlement programs such as Medicaid.\nIn 2015, the state projects it will spend more than $685 million on the same program, a 211 percent increase."}
