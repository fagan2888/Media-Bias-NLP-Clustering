Overall, women have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease related to diabetes than men do, due to lower adherence to meeting treatment goals. Researchers are thus considering develop a form of \"gender-based\" therapy that could better aim treatment at both women and men.\n\n\u201cThe findings suggest the need for gender-based evaluation and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors in these patients,\u201d study author Dr. Pendar Farahani of the Department of Medicine and Department of Public Health Sciences at Queen\u2019s University, said in a press release.\n\nResearchers found that only 64 percent of women were able to lower their LDL cholesterol, compared to 81 percent of men. Women were also less likely to stick to statin medication \u2014 possibly due to the medicine\u2019s different effect on the female body, which can lead to adverse side effects that are worse for women than men. \u201cThe finding that women were not able to lower their so-called bad cholesterol sufficiently is a concern,\u201d Farahani continued. \u201cWomen with diabetes have a considerably higher rate of cardiovascular-related illness and death than men with diabetes. This pattern is likely related to poorer control of cardiovascular risk factors.\u201d\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been much research on the notion of gender-based therapy options for diabetics. Currently, research is still needed to better understand why women respond differently to diabetes treatment than men.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death for diabetics. About 65 percent of diabetes patients die from one of these conditions, as they\u2019re four times more likely to have heart disease or a stroke than people who don\u2019t have diabetes. Researchers hope to better examine how different treatment options affect males and females, and develop a form of therapy that can lower cholesterol more effectively.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "diabetes, women and diabetes, cholesterol, heart disease", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers found that women respond less effectively to diabetes treatment than men, and were less likely to improve their cholesterol conditions.", "title": "Diabetic Women Have Higher Risk Of Heart Disease Than Men With Diabetes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/scientists-suggest-gender-based-therapy-diabetics-women-less-likely-stick-treatment-men-have-higher", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/24/diabetes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers found that women respond less effectively to diabetes treatment than men, and were less likely to improve their cholesterol conditions.", "title": "Diabetic Women Have Higher Risk Of Heart Disease Than Men With Diabetes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/scientists-suggest-gender-based-therapy-diabetics-women-less-likely-stick-treatment-men-have-higher", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/24/diabetes.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/24/diabetes.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-24T20:38:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-24T20:42:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers found that women respond less effectively to diabetes treatment than men, and were less likely to improve their cholesterol conditions."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd69fa\"", "article_summary": "Overall, women have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease related to diabetes than men do, due to lower adherence to meeting treatment goals.\nResearchers are thus considering develop a form of \"gender-based\" therapy that could better aim treatment at both women and men.\nCurrently, research is still needed to better understand why women respond differently to diabetes treatment than men.\nResearch shows that women are less likely to lower their bad cholesterol and LDL than men.\n\u201cWomen with diabetes have a considerably higher rate of cardiovascular-related illness and death than men with diabetes."}
