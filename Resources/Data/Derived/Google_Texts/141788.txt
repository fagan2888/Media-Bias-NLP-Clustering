Jim Cramer takes a look at one drug distributor that is down 40 percent since all-time highs. He figures out what went wrong, and if there's any hope.

Drug distributor AmerisourceBergen has been one of the most consistent winners in the market during the past few years. Yet, over the course of the past year, Jim Cramer has watched as it transformed into a total house of pain.

"The stock has gone from market darling to dirty dog in almost no time flat," the "Mad Money" host said.

Is there any hope in sight for one of the largest drug distributors in America?

AmerisourceBergen hit an all-time high of $121 a little over a year ago, up from $14 in generational lows of 2009. It has now lost 26 percent since the beginning of 2016. The company is one of the largest pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services in the world, and handles approximately 20 percent of all drugs sold and distributed throughout the U.S.
