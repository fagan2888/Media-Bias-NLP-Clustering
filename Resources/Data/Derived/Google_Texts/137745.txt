The Wall Street Journal thinks congressional Republicans are idiots for pretending they can force the president to defund Obamacare. Karl Rove agrees that defunding is plainly impossible and everyone knows it. Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, says the whole defunding campaign is nothing more than "theatrics," and a clean budget bill will end up passing the House in short order.

This is not a bunch of RINOs talking. They'd repeal Obamacare in a heartbeat if they could. But they're smart enough to know that tea-party Republicans are boxing themselves into a corner with no exit possible except a humiliating and ruinous capitulation. That's Highway 1.

Alternatively, they could drive a hard bargain on other items and quite possibly come out the other end with half a dozen genuine victories. That's Highway 2.

So which road are Republicans going down? Highway 1, of course. As a native Californian, I can confirm that this is indeed a very scenic route that will satisfy your yearning for a dramatic—and occasionally even hair-raising—ride. Unfortunately, it doesn't always get you where you want to go.
