A soccer complex in Valley Center is seeing more attendees than the parking lots can handle.

The McKay-Petrie Sports complex has around 80 parking spots for visitors to the soccer portion of the complex, with additional parking spots at McLaughlin Park.

Some parents at the complex found that there is not enough convenient parking.

"You come to a soccer game, there are people from out of town, they come up here and try to find a parking place and there is no where to park," said one parent.

"We pay 100 dollars for a kid to play soccer and then not to be able to drop them off and being able to walk a decent distance is aggravating," said another parent.

During a match last week, some people parked in no parking zones and were ticketed. Others parked in a grassy lot, just to find that was also illegal and ticketed. The tickets cost over $100.

There is a stretch of dirt road that has marked no parking zones. According to the Valley Center Police Department, if too many cars are parked along the side of the road, it narrows it to one lane and makes it so an ambulance or fire truck could not make it down the road.

"There is only so much area that the rec owns that they can put parking on, so they put as much parking in as they could at the time with the money that they had. The rest is really city property and park property, which they are not allowed to build parking on at this point," said Shawn Ehrstein of the American Youth Soccer Organization.

The Valley Center Recreation Commission says that there are times where one game is ending and another game is waiting to start and it causes a limit in parking.

The primary parking lot is on the soccer complex, but there are auxiliary lots. There are two parking lots in McLaughlin Park and the commission has gotten permission to use the front lot of the fire safety building according to Ehrstein.

The most anyone should have to walk is less than 850 feet according to the recreation commission.
