Bernie Sanders in the delegate count: 2,165 to 1,357, with 1,243 still available. The candidates need to get 2,383 delegates to secure the nomination. Kentucky is expected to send 60 delegates to the Democratic National Convention.\n\nRelated Story Bernie Sanders Surging In Kentucky\u2019s Donation Dollars\n\nDuring Friday\u2019s event, Chelsea Clinton criticized the Republican presidential candidates for engaging in \u201chate speech\u201d against Muslims and pushing to \u201ctake away a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d\n\nShe also took several shots at the conservative elements of Kentucky\u2019s state government, including Gov.

The cuts are the latest in nearly a decade of reductions to Kentucky\u2019s higher education institutions.\n\nClinton said her mother believes public community colleges should be tuition free and that those who go to other higher education institutions should be able to graduate debt free.\n\nFormer Gov. Martha Layne Collins, the first female governor of Kentucky, and Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes attended the rally.\n\nGrimes introduced the younger Clinton, saying \u201cI am ready to see a female president in Washington D.C.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we have folks who are committed heart and soul to making sure we don\u2019t just have cracks in that glass ceiling, we finally shatter it,\u201d Grimes said.\n\nThough Democrats have a majority of voters registered in Kentucky, the state hasn\u2019t voted in favor of a Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton\u2019s re-election race in 1996.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaking to about 200 people at Clinton\u2019s field office, the younger Clinton called this year\u2019s presidential election the most important of her lifetime.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "Speaking to about 200 people at Clinton\u2019s field office, the younger Clinton called this year\u2019s presidential election the most important of her lifetime.", "title": "Chelsea Clinton Campaigns For Hillary In Lexington", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1632, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Slack-for-iOS-Upload-1.jpg", "height": 1224}, "updated_time": "2016-05-03T19:58:37-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/chelsea-clinton-campaigns-hillary-lexington/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Speaking to about 200 people at Clinton\u2019s field office, the younger Clinton called this year\u2019s presidential election the most important of her lifetime.", "creator": "@RylandKY", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Slack-for-iOS-Upload-1.jpg", "title": "Chelsea Clinton Campaigns For Hillary In Lexington", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Politics", "tag": "election 2016", "published_time": "2016-04-29T13:50:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-03T19:58:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Ahead of Kentucky\u2019s May 17 Democratic presidential primary, Chelsea Clinton stopped in Lexington on Friday to stump for her mother, Hillary Clinton.\nThe cuts are the latest in nearly a decade of reductions to Kentucky\u2019s higher education institutions.\nSpeaking to about 200 people crowded into Clinton\u2019s storefront field office, the younger Clinton called this year\u2019s presidential election the most important of her lifetime.\nDuring her 2008 presidential run, Hillary Clinton took 65 percent of the vote over Barack Obama in the Kentucky primary election, though Obama was already the presumed nominee.\nClinton said her mother believes public community colleges should be tuition free and that those who go to other higher education institutions should be able to graduate debt free."}
