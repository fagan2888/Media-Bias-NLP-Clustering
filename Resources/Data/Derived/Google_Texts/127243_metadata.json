Perhaps nowhere is that more apparent than in federal initiatives to broadly improve health by extending care beyond clinics and pharmacies into neighborhoods and homes.Federal funding for population-health efforts \u2014the management of health and medical care for an entire group of patients or a community\u2014has expanded under the Affordable Care Act. It's included financing for states and providers to experiment with ways to better coordinate healthcare and other needs that affect health, such as housing and transportation. But the initiatives are not without risk or challenges, a point three federal officials underscored in the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.Efforts are still underway to identify what works and how to make widespread use of the most effective strategies, write Dr. William Kassler, Naomi Tomoyasu and Dr. Patrick Conway of the agency that oversees Medicare and Medicaid. The CMS Innovation Center , in a report to Congress last month, also said results were largely not yet available for nearly two dozen initiatives to bolster population health, improve quality and increase efficiency in healthcare, financed with $2.6 billion through last year.Calculating a dividend from those investments presents another challenge, the trio wrote. Kassler is one of the CMS' chief medical officers; Tomoyasu is deputy director of the prevention and population health care models group within the CMS Innovation Center; and Conway is the CMS' deputy administrator for innovation and quality.The return on any investment in prevention will necessarily take time, raising the risk that \u201ccurrent actuarial methods used to evaluate return on investment may underestimate potential savings,\u201d they warned.Investment at the federal level is not small. Medicare and Medicaid\u2014which combined account for $1 of every $3 the nation spends on healthcare\u2014have increasingly poured money into strategies for disease prevention and health promotion.Those strategies extend the reach of healthcare beyond hospitals, clinics and pharmacies into neighborhoods, homes and schools. Such extended investment can include help with housing, transportation, literacy, day care and groceries, the officials wrote.But with that expanded reach comes a debate \u201cregarding the specific population-based activities that fall within healthcare providers' scope of practice,\u201d wrote the CMS officials. \u201cBecause so many factors lie outside clinicians' control, we need to understand what factors the healthcare system can reasonably be expected to act on, given professionals' training, infrastructure and scope of practice,\u201d they said. \u201cWe also need to determine the appropriate levels of health system accountability for population health outcomes.\u201dFollow Melanie Evans on Twitter: @MHmevans", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Perhaps nowhere is the value of promoting healthy behaviors more uncertain than in federal initiatives to extend care into neighborhoods and homes.", "title": "Population health improvement still a riddle wrapped in an enigma", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Perhaps nowhere is the value of promoting healthy behaviors more uncertain than in federal initiatives to extend care into neighborhoods and homes.", "title": "Population health improvement still a riddle wrapped in an enigma", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150108/blog/301089997", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Perhaps nowhere is the value of promoting healthy behaviors more uncertain than in federal initiatives to extend care into neighborhoods and homes.", "title": "Population health improvement still a riddle wrapped in an enigma", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150108/blog/301089997", "published_at": "2015-01-08", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe also need to determine the appropriate levels of health system accountability for population health outcomes.\u201dFollow Melanie Evans on Twitter: @MHmevans\nThe push to invest more of the healthcare industry's time and money into promoting good health is, so far, uneven and uncertain in terms of effectiveness.\nIt's included financing for states and providers to experiment with ways to better coordinate healthcare and other needs that affect health, such as housing and transportation.\nMedicare and Medicaid\u2014which combined account for $1 of every $3 the nation spends on healthcare\u2014have increasingly poured money into strategies for disease prevention and health promotion.Those strategies extend the reach of healthcare beyond hospitals, clinics and pharmacies into neighborhoods, homes and schools.\nSuch extended investment can include help with housing, transportation, literacy, day care and groceries, the officials wrote.But with that expanded reach comes a debate \u201cregarding the specific population-based activities that fall within healthcare providers' scope of practice,\u201d wrote the CMS officials."}
