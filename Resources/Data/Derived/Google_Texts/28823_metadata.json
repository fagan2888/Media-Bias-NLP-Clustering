Romney himself has become one of Trump\u2019s most vocal detractors inside the party. \u201cHe\u2019s someone to whom civility means a lot. The whole Trump thing really bothers him,\u201d a close Romney adviser told me \u2014 and some Romney-ites are only too happy to talk up the prospect of their man jumping into the race if the Establishment fails to stop Trump, whose support in Iowa and New Hampshire is currently greater than Jeb Bush\u2019s, Scott Walker\u2019s, Marco Rubio\u2019s, Chris Christie\u2019s, and John Kasich\u2019s combined.\n\n\u201cMitt wants to run. He never stopped wanting to run,\u201d a senior member of his 2012 team told me. Other Romney-ites, watching this cycle\u2019s candidates falling short, feel a sense of vindication after all the attacks they endured after Romney\u2019s failed 2012 bid. \u201cThese guys like Walker and Perry, they were big deals in their states, but you get them onto the national stage and it\u2019s a different story,\u201d a former Romney adviser told me. \u201cIt\u2019s like they were in middle school, and now they\u2019re freshmen in high school and they\u2019re getting their faces slammed in the toilets.\u201d Another former Romney adviser complained about Bush\u2019s decision not to go all-in on New Hampshire, a state a moderate must win. \u201cRomney did 100 town halls in New Hampshire from announcement to the primary. It\u2019s madness. Bush has done only 23.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the prospect of Romney jumping back into the race at this late date remains exceedingly slim \u2014 he\u2019s made no visible signs of reassembling his political operation. But he may be able to influence the race more indirectly from the perch he\u2019s begun carving out for himself as party elder.\n\nRead the rest of the story here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mitt Romney is disappointed by the Republican establishment failing to take out Donald Trump--which may pull him into the 2016 primary.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Mitt Romney is disappointed by the Republican establishment failing to take out Donald Trump--which may pull him into the 2016 primary.", "title": "NY Mag: Mitt Romney's Contempt for Trump Gets Him Up in the Bullpen - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Romney-extends-hand-David-Goldman-AP-Photo.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/01/ny-mag-mitt-romneys-contempt-for-trump-gets-him-up-in-the-bullpen/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mitt Romney is disappointed by the Republican establishment failing to take out Donald Trump--which may pull him into the 2016 primary.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Romney-extends-hand-David-Goldman-AP-Photo.jpg", "title": "NY Mag: Mitt Romney's Contempt for Trump Gets Him Up in the Bullpen - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Mitt Romney,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,mitt romney", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Mitt Romney", "published_time": "2015-09-01T14:14:23-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f8d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThese guys like Walker and Perry, they were big deals in their states, but you get them onto the national stage and it\u2019s a different story,\u201d a former Romney adviser told me.\nBut he may be able to influence the race more indirectly from the perch he\u2019s begun carving out for himself as party elder.\nRomney himself has become one of Trump\u2019s most vocal detractors inside the party.\nOther Romney-ites, watching this cycle\u2019s candidates falling short, feel a sense of vindication after all the attacks they endured after Romney\u2019s failed 2012 bid.\nHe never stopped wanting to run,\u201d a senior member of his 2012 team told me."}
