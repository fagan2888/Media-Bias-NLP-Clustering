He's owned Freeman's Liquors for about 18 years but the place has been in business since 1959.\n\nNow, the legislature is considering a bill that would allow voters to decide whether supermarkets and convenience stores should be able to sell wine and full strength beer.\n\nOklahoma is one of only five states in the country that still require grocery stores to sell 3.2 percent beer. Backers say it's all about convenience.\n\n\"People will actually be able to just walk into a grocery store like we\u2019re in now and grab a bottle of wine, grab their beer instead of having to go anywhere else, travel or anything else,\u201d said Tyler Moore with Oklahoman\u2019s for Consumer Freedom. \u201cModern convenience is the biggest aspect to this.\u201d\n\nBa Luong owns Super Cao Nguyen Market in Oklahoma City. He said the new law would allow him to sell the types of wine and beer that complement the food he sells.\n\n\u201cAs an international grocery store, if the laws get changed what I\u2019d like to do is to offer an assortment of international beers and wines that people would come in for and pick those up as they\u2019re doing their grocery shopping,\u201d Luong said.\n\nBut opponents fear it will put a lot of small, ma and pop liquor stores out of business while bigger businesses cash in.\n\n\u201cI think Walmart and Anheuser-Busch and Quick Trip and 7-Eleven, and it's all big money versus little money,\u201d Hancock said.\n\nIf the bill fails in the legislature, backers are planning a petition drive to have the measure placed on the November ballot.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A state House of Representatives committee this week is expected to hear a bill that would allow voters to decide whether wine and full strength beer can be sold in supermarkets and convenience sto...", "author": "Aaron Brilbeck", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/31640730/committee-to-hear-bill-concerning-alcohol-sales-laws", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10254028_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A state House of Representatives committee this week is expected to hear a bill that would allow voters to decide whether wine and full strength beer can be sold in supermarkets and convenience sto...", "title": "Committee To Hear Bill Concerning Alcohol Sales Laws"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10254028_G.jpg", "description": "A state House of Representatives committee this week is expected to hear a bill that would allow voters to decide whether wine and full strength beer can be sold in supermarkets and convenience sto...", "card": "summary", "title": "Committee To Hear Bill Concerning Alcohol Sales Laws"}, "wnreadableurl": "committee-to-hear-bill-concerning-alcohol-sales-laws", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2016/04/04", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,Alcohol, Laws, Walmart, Liquor, store, supermarkets", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS21", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,Alcohol, Laws, Walmart, Liquor, store, supermarkets"}, "article_summary": "Oklahoma is one of only five states in the country that still require grocery stores to sell 3.2 percent beer.\nNow, the legislature is considering a bill that would allow voters to decide whether supermarkets and convenience stores should be able to sell wine and full strength beer.\n\u201cI think the changes should come more as evolution.\u201dThose changes scare Hancock.\n\u201cI think the changes that they are making are a little extreme,\u201d said Chris Hancock.\n\u201cI think Walmart and Anheuser-Busch and Quick Trip and 7-Eleven, and it's all big money versus little money,\u201d Hancock said."}
