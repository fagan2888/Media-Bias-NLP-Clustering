Despite the increase in the coverage, critics say this number fails to prove that Obamacare is achieving its goal of truly covering the uninsured.\n\nThe Obama administration has failed to produce ACA enrollment numbers since the end of March, and it\u2019s difficult to know exactly how many enrollees were previously uninsured. According to President Obama, as of March 31, eight million people had signed up under Obamacare.\n\nAccording to reports from the Daily Signal, that number is a bit deceptive. The eight million signups included those who had insurance prior to Obamacare. In some cases, they switched over voluntarily.\n\nIn other cases, they switched over by force because their existing plans were canceled for failing to fit with Obamacare\u2019s new guidelines for health insurance policy.\n\nEdmund Haislmaier, a health-care expert for the Heritage Foundation, said those sign-ups do not reflect an increase in the number of insured.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got coverage now and a government program offers a replacement with more subsidies, then you\u2019re going to have an incentive to move to that,\u201d Haislmaier said. \u201cNo doubt it helps people by helping them buy something that they already had. \u2026 But it isn\u2019t a net increase.\u201d\n\nIn addition, many of these previously insured customers experienced a spike in premiums under Obamacare.\n\nHealth policy analyst, Robert Laszewski, said this isn\u2019t surprising.\n\n\u201cIt was not uncommon to see [insurers] increase their [rates] by 35 percent to bring policies into compliance with Obamacare,\u201d Laszewski said. \u201cSo, they have the same relatively healthy people with perhaps more benefits but for 35 percent more premium. That may be good news for the insurance companies but not for the individuals who are forced to pay more than a third more.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Signal also estimates that one-third to one-half of those covered by Obamacare were previously uninsured before the health-care marketplace opened. But the number of truly uninsured has never been clear-cut. Critics quote the number that champions of Obamacare often use: Roughly 45.7 million uninsured.\n\nUsing that estimate, of the 45.7 millionuninsured, 11.8 million were eligible for public health coverage, but never signed up. An additional 18.3 million of those uninsured were young people who chose not to be covered and nearly 10 million of those uninsured were immigrants\u00ad \u2014 both illegal and legal.\n\nThe remaining number included those who were in transition periods. If those numbers proved to be true, the final number of uninsured Americans before the implementation of Obamacare was less than five percent of the U.S. population.\n\nThe Daily Signal also notes that Obamacare\u2019s massive Medicaid expansion might be puffing up the true \u201cpreviously uninsured\u201d enrollment numbers.\n\nLast month, Forbes reported that Medicaid signups grew 15 percent in the states that embraced the expansion, which brings the number to roughly six million newly insured.\n\nCMS projects that Medicaid enrollees will reach 8.6 million in 2014. The Daily Signal also notes that this can be attributed to the 26 states that have embraced Medicaid expansion. The federal government will be picking up the tab for the next three years, but then the burden will gradually shift back to the states.\n\nAccording to information for a Gallup Daily tracking poll, five percent of Americans claim to be newly insured so far this year, but only 2.8 percent of those people actually gained coverage under Obamacare.\n\nWith these numbers, critics say they can only assume the numbers of paying customers and those who were truly uninsured prior to Obamacare are very few.
