WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito voted Friday for the Restoring Americans’ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, a bill that repeals Obamacare, while Sen. Joe Manchin voted against the bill.

“Americans deserve a health care system that works for them and Obamacare is not it. I have consistently voted to repeal and replace this disastrous health care law, and I am glad that a repeal bill will finally reach the president’s desk,’ Capito said in a statement. “This legislation will enable us to revisit the problems caused by Obamacare and replace them with reforms that provide quality, affordable care for all Americans.”

Manchin favored changes to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), but not a full repeal.

“I have always said that this law is not perfect but we need to repair, not repeal it. It’s reckless to repeal a law when, before it, we spent more than any other country on health care but still ranked only 43rd in the world in health and wellness,” Manchin said in his release.

“In 2015 alone, more than 29,000 West Virginians enrolled in health insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchange. Nationally, 11.7 million people signed up. According to one study, West Virginia has benefited more than any other state in the country except New York under the Affordable Care Act.”
