Leno denied Claudio Pizarro early in the second and then stopped Goetze\u2019s second big chance.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for us was to avoid any injuries. It will be difficult in Barcelona but we\u2019ll put everything into it,\u201d Neuer said after what was only Bayern\u2019s third defeat of the season.\n\nEarlier, Klaas Jan Huntelaar ended his goal drought with a brace as Schalke defeated Stuttgart 3-2, while Borussia Dortmund was held 1-1 at Hoffenheim.\n\nHuntelaar, who hadn\u2019t scored in 1,187 minutes before kickoff, scored in the ninth minute and equalized in the 78th after Martin Harnik and Filip Kostic put Stuttgart ahead.\n\n\u201cI knew that I\u2019d be successful again soon but you never know exactly when,\u201d the Dutch striker said.\n\nStuttgart striker Daniel Ginczek had a role in both of his side\u2019s goals. He set up Harnik, who scored with a delicate chip in the 22nd, and Kostic in the 51st.\n\nSchalke fans turned their backs to the pitch with about 15 minutes remaining, before Huntelaar equalized, and then substitute Kevin-Prince Boateng\u2019s 89th-minute volley was deflected in by Stuttgart defender Florian Klein.\n\nFifth-place Schalke\u2019s first win in seven games left Stuttgart bottom, three points from safety with three rounds remaining.\n\nDortmund captain Mats Hummels\u2019 35th-minute header from a corner salvaged a point at Hoffenheim, which remained a point in front with both sides fighting for Europa League qualification.\n\n\u201cWe have three games left, two of them at home. I still feel we\u2019re within striking distance,\u201d Dortmund coach Juergen Klopp said.\n\nKevin Volland opened the scoring in the 33rd, eluding Marcel Schmelzer, turning and then firing past emerging goalkeeper Mitch Langerak to the far corner.\n\n\u201cA win wouldn\u2019t have been undeserved. But after such a game I can be, and have to be, happy with a point,\u201d Klopp said.\n\nElsewhere, second-place Wolfsburg drew 2-2 with Hannover, Paderborn boosted its survival hopes with a 2-1 win at Freiburg, Werder Bremen beat Eintracht Frankfurt 1-0 and Augsburg drew 0-0 with Cologne.\n\nWolfsburg midfielder Kevin de Bruyne crossed for Bas Dost to score in the 24th. It was the Belgian\u2019s 18th assist of the season, matching the Bundesliga record set by Zvjezdan Misimovic, also for Wolfsburg, in 2008-09.\n\nPaderborn\u2019s seventh win of the season lifted the promoted side out of the relegation zone, one point above Hannover in the relegation playoff place. Only goal difference separates Freiburg and Hannover.\n\nFrankfurt coach Thomas Schaaf was given a warm welcome on his first return to Bremen, where he spent more than 40 years as player and coach.\n\nDavie Selke scored the game\u2019s only goal with his chest in the 66th for Bremen to climb to seventh, one point behind Augsburg in the last Europa League place.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bayer Leverkusen substitute Julian Brandt scored on his 19th birthday Saturday to inflict a 2-0 defeat on Bayern Munich in the German champion's first league game since sealing the title.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Bayer Leverkusen substitute Julian Brandt scored on his 19th birthday Saturday to inflict a 2-0 defeat on Bayern Munich in the German champion\u2019s first league game since sealing the title.", "title": "Bayern Munich slumps to 2-0 loss at Leverkusen in Bundesliga", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/2/schalke-beats-stuttgart-in-bundesliga-dortmund-dra/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/02/d8fb2fefa5435613750f6a7067004b7d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/02/d8fb2fefa5435613750f6a7067004b7d.jpg", "description": "Bayer Leverkusen substitute Julian Brandt scored on his 19th birthday Saturday to inflict a 2-0 defeat on Bayern Munich in the German champion's first league game since sealing the title.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Bayern Munich slumps to 2-0 loss at Leverkusen in Bundesliga"}, "Author": "CIARAN FAHEY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f56\"", "article_summary": "BERLIN (AP) - Bayer Leverkusen substitute Julian Brandt scored on his 19th birthday Saturday to inflict a 2-0 defeat on Bayern Munich in the German champion\u2019s first league game since sealing the title.\nBayern coach Pep Guardiola handed Bundesliga debuts to midfielder Rico Strieder, who started, and forward Lukas Goertler, who came on in the second half.\nFifth-place Schalke\u2019s first win in seven games left Stuttgart bottom, three points from safety with three rounds remaining.\nBayern, which sealed the title with four games to spare, next plays Barcelona away for the first leg of their Champions League semifinal on Wednesday.\nLeverkusen, which is provisionally third, dominated the game but Bayern had the better chances."}
