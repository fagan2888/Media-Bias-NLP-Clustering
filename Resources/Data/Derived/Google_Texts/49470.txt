On this weekend’s The Progressive Underground, one of techno music’s founding fathers Kevin Saunderson stops by to offer up some sample cuts from his discography. We also bump tracks from Julio Bashmore, Jazzanova, Nosaj Thing, Kendrick Lamar, Yaeji, Aquaphresca, Theo Parrish, Slum Village, Fat Freddy’s Drop and many more!

We also unveil a new atmospheric mix as well as explore the outer reaches of electronica through the genres of deep house, techno, future soul, nu-jazz, b-sides and rare groove. We go from 8-11 pm EST on 101.9 WDET and wdet.org.
