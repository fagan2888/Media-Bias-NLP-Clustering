One feature amid Apple Inc.’s much-hyped rollout of several new products on Tuesday is a health and fitness app called HealthKit that will be included in the company’s new wristwatch computers.

This latest gizmo in the Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed /quotes/zigman/68270/lastsale AAPL family has the potential to save lives, but the company also is hoping that users don’t remember the recent troubles it has had with hackers tapping into celebrities’ computers and obtaining compromising photos.

Regardless, the application known as HealthKit is geared primarily to take medical data that users have stored and share that with doctors and hospitals. Produced with its partner, the Mayo Clinic, Apple’s program is designed to gather information from various types of wearable devices, such as heart and blood-pressure monitors, translate it into a common format, and pass it on to whoever needs to keep an eye on the user’s health.

Such a device would prove useful not only with the elderly, but with multiple-sclerosis patients as well, medical professionals told the trade magazine Modern Healthcare after Tuesday’s rollout.

“I think is going to radically change our ability to coordinate care,” Dr. John Halamka, chief information officer at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, told the publication.

The concern is whether the wrong people will be keeping an eye on your medical condition. Forbes notes the launch of the product comes in the wake of hackers who tapped into Apple’s cloud to collect nude photos of actress Jennifer Lawrence and model Kate Upton.

Apple reportedly will not be using its iCloud to store medical data, and is planning out a new operating system, iOS8, along with the watch. But the publication points out hacker attacks on hospitals are up 600% since November.
