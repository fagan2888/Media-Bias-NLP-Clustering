SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — When Nolan Arenado was a senior at El Toro High School in Lake Forest, Calif., he batted .517 (45-for-87) with 14 doubles, one triple and five homers. He hit safely in 27 of 28 games.

That was nothing.

Check out what the Rockies’ third baseman has done to Cactus League pitchers so far this spring. By hitting 2-for-3 with a double on Sunday against the Giants, he boosted his average to .606 (20-for-33). He’s hit five doubles, a triple and two homers. The three-time Gold Glove third baseman has a hit in all 12 games in which he’s played, and has multiple hits in seven straight games. His OPS is a mind-boggling 1.600.

Before the game, manager Walt Weiss was asked if Arenado should be in the conversation with the likes of the Angels Mike Trout and the Nationals’ Bryce Harper as one of the game’s greatest young players. Weiss couldn’t wait to say yes.

“There are a lot of great young players in the game right now,” Weiss said. “It’s really an exciting time. Nolan is one of those guys. He has to be in that conversation about the best young players in the game. He’s 24 years old, he’s already got three Gold Gloves and already hit (42) home runs (last) season.”

Arenado got both of his hits on Sunday by swinging at the first pitch. In his third at-bat, he flied out to right, going for the fences on a 3-0 pitch.

“It was my game plan going in,” he said. “I just told myself I was going to be aggressive and swing at the first pitch if it was there. I usually don’t do that during the season, but I wanted to try it out and see what happens.”

Hale’s chance. Right-hander David Hale, finally recovered from a hamstring injury, is scheduled to throw 30-35 pitches Monday against the Rangers. Hale wants to compete for a spot in the starting rotation, but if he can’t build up enough innings, he can be optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque.
