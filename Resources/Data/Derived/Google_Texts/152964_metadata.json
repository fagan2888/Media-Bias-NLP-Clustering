But in a blog post months earlier, the administration announced a one-year delay. Then came another delay. Kawa\u2019s business is now subject to the mandate in January 2016.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent over 100 hours and thousands of dollars (in attorneys\u2019 and accountant fees) to make sure I was compliant with the law. But all that was wasted, and now I\u2019ll have to do it all over again,\u201d he told Watchdog.org in an interview.\n\nThe delay, Kawa argues, amounts to a change in the law.\n\nHis lawsuit is the only legal challenge to any of the administration\u2019s 41 Obamacare-related executive actions.\n\nU.S. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, threatened to sue the administration over the employer mandate in July, but he hasn\u2019t followed through.\n\nJudicial Watch, a conservative government watchdog, will represent Kawa during oral arguments in front of a three-judge panel at the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.\n\nA lower court in Florida dismissed Kawa\u2019s case for lack of standing, or the ability to show an actual damage. In the ruling, a federal judge determined the employer mandate, an act of Congress, was only delayed and not changed.\n\nKawa vehemently disagrees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a delay. It\u2019s a cancellation of an existing law,\u201d he said. \u201cA delay means you\u2019re going to do the same thing relatively soon. That\u2019s not accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn express date was changed within a law that was passed in March 2010. Four years later they changed it, then they changed it again.\u201d\n\nKawa said he\u2019s likely to spend more resources in anticipation of the mandate progressing.\n\nUnder the law, Kawa Orthodontics is considered a large employer subject to the mandate because he employs more than 50 full-time equivalent workers. If it\u2019s determined by the government he\u2019s not in compliance with the health-care law, he faces $2,000 to $3,000 in tax penalties per worker.\n\nIronically, if Kawa were to win his lawsuit, the employer mandate would go into effect.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually suing them to tax me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather pay than have the government pick and choose when to enforce a law. It\u2019s not partisan, because we\u2019re also trying to stop any future president from changing laws.\u201d\n\nDelaying, or changing, the employer mandate is expensive.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, employer penalties for 2014 were expected to top $10 billion and help offset Obamacare\u2019s $1.375 trillion price tag.\n\nInstead, taxpayers are picking up the bill, Kawa says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a tax break to large employers. If it\u2019s about giving up my money or giving up the rule of law, I\u2019ll give up my money,\u201d Kawa said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Larry Kawa isn\u2019t backing down from a fight he picked with the Obama administration.", "title": "Orthodontist takes Obamacare fight to federal appeals court | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/458181721.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/10/13/orthodontist-takes-obamacare-fight-to-federal-appeals-court/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Larry Kawa isn\u2019t backing down from a fight he picked with the Obama administration.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/458181721.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "Larry Kawa isn\u2019t backing down from a fight he picked with the Obama administration."}}, "article_summary": "In the ruling, a federal judge determined the employer mandate, an act of Congress, was only delayed and not changed.\nIt\u2019s not partisan, because we\u2019re also trying to stop any future president from changing laws.\u201dDelaying, or changing, the employer mandate is expensive.\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, employer penalties for 2014 were expected to top $10 billion and help offset Obamacare\u2019s $1.375 trillion price tag.\nKawa, of Boca Raton, sued the administration after it delayed the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate more than a year ago.\nU.S. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, threatened to sue the administration over the employer mandate in July, but he hasn\u2019t followed through."}
