Berman handed down his written decision one week to the day before the Sept. 10 season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Judge Berman had to either uphold the suspension or throw it out completely, but could not author a lesser punishment for Brady. Judge Berman said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell went too far in affirming punishment of the Super Bowl winning quarterback in a case the NFL claimed threatened the very integrity of the game.\n\n\u201cWith respect to \u2018general awareness\u2019 of others\u2019 misconduct \u2014 which is the principal finding in both the Wells Report and the Vincent Letter \u2014 Brady had no notice that such conduct was prohibited, or any reasonable certainty of potential discipline stemming from such conduct,\u201d Judge Berman wrote in his decision. \u201cThe court concludes that, as a matter of law, no NFL policy or precedent notifies players that they may be disciplined (much less suspended) for general awareness of misconduct by others.\u201d\n\nThe decision came as a surprise to some legal experts and NFL followers who believed Berman wanted the league to settle and was reluctant to get involved in collective bargaining disputes. Nevertheless, the Brady camp, the NFL union and Patriots fans are all rejoicing in the decision that allows Brady to begin preparing for the first game of the season.\n\n\u201cThis decision should prove, once and for all, that our Collective Bargaining Agreement does not grant this Commissioner the authority to be unfair, arbitrary and misleading,\u201d the NFL Players Association said in a statement. \u201cWhile the CBA grants the person who occupies the position of Commissioner the ability to judiciously and fairly exercise the designated power of that position, the union did not agree to attempts to unfairly, illegally exercise that power, contrary to what the NFL has repeatedly and wrongfully claimed.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Goodell made his decision based upon the findings of an investigation conducted by New York-based attorney Ted Wells, which was released in May. However, the report stopped short declaring it a fact that the balls were deliberately deflated on Brady\u2019s orders. Yet, the NFL\u2019s threshold for imposing discipline requires merely a finding of strong probability of wrongdoing, and the report found that it was \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that Brady was \u201cat least generally aware of the inappropriate activities\u201d in the balls being deflated. Brady\u2019s attorney, Don Yee, called the outcome of the report pre-determined, and Judge Berman somewhat seemed to agree.\n\n\u201cWith respect to \u2018general awareness\u2019 of others\u2019 misconduct \u2014 which is the principal finding in both the Wells Report and the Vincent Letter \u2014 Brady had no notice that such conduct was prohibited, or any reasonable certainty of potential discipline stemming from such conduct,\u201d Berman wrote in his decision. \u201cThe court concludes that, as a matter of law, no NFL policy or precedent notifies players that they may be disciplined (much less suspended) for general awareness of misconduct by others.\u201d\n\nWorth noting, the Patriots absolutely routed the Colts by a 45-7 score in the Jan. 18 AFC Championship game, propelling them to their win at the Super Bowl against the Seattle Seahawks. Brady, who was named the MVP, finished the game with 37 completions in 50 attempts for 328 yards and four touchdowns, winning his fourth Super Bowl ring.\n\nThe NFL has the option to appeal the judge\u2019s decision, and has had some success in the past with overturning appellate decisions. However, a request for comment from the commissioner was not immediately returned by the NFL.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Sports, New England Patriots, Tom Brady, Roger Goodell", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "A federal judge has tossed out the NFL imposed four-game suspension on New England Patriot quarterback Tom Brady for his alleged role in DeflateGate.", "title": "Tom Brady Wins Appeal Against NFL, Judge Overturns DeflateGate Suspension", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 740, "identifier": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Roger-Goodell-Tom-Brady-AP.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/sports/2015/09/03/tom-brady-wins-appeal-against-nfl-judge-overturns-deflategate-suspension/", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "A federal judge has tossed out the NFL imposed four-game suspension on New England Patriot quarterback Tom Brady for his alleged role in DeflateGate.", "creator": "@PPDNews", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Roger-Goodell-Tom-Brady-AP.jpg", "title": "Tom Brady Wins Appeal Against NFL, Judge Overturns DeflateGate Suspension | People's Pundit Daily", "site": "@PPDNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/sports/2015/09/03/tom-brady-wins-appeal-against-nfl-judge-overturns-deflategate-suspension/", "should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/29880", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "package": "com.zeen101.peoplespunditdaily.app.android"}, "ios": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/29880", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "app_store_id": 1019177493}}, "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:ef63637f2cb1a477b40092f3568d5f17a64208c9|user_id:1413|width:660|height:371|autoplay:0|site:1938|player:2077|question:1|upload:1|intro_enabled:1|ovr_yt:1|ovr_def:1|aspect:1|visual:0", "keywords": "Sports, New England Patriots, Tom Brady, Roger Goodell", "article": {"section": "Sports", "tag": "Tom Brady", "published_time": "2015-09-03T11:59:47-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesPunditDaily"}, "description": "A federal judge has tossed out the NFL imposed four-game suspension on New England Patriot quarterback Tom Brady for his alleged role in DeflateGate."}, "article_summary": "Judge Berman had to either uphold the suspension or throw it out completely, but could not author a lesser punishment for Brady.\nJudge Berman said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell went too far in affirming punishment of the Super Bowl winning quarterback in a case the NFL claimed threatened the very integrity of the game.\nBrady\u2019s attorney, Don Yee, called the outcome of the report pre-determined, and Judge Berman somewhat seemed to agree.\nThe NFL has the option to appeal the judge\u2019s decision, and has had some success in the past with overturning appellate decisions.\nNevertheless, the Brady camp, the NFL union and Patriots fans are all rejoicing in the decision that allows Brady to begin preparing for the first game of the season."}
