Cornerstone local issues from hurricane recovery to coliseum redevelopment and lightning-rod national concerns over shutdowns and health-care reform made for another tumultuous year here, full of change and never boring.\n\nHere, then, is Long Island\u2019s 2013 business news in review: A year of people, places and issues that set up 2014 as another make-or-break moment for our suburban home.\n\nBANKING & FINANCE\n\nFive years after the mortgage meltdown and one year after Sandy, Long Island banks largely rebounded in 2013 \u2013 but uncertainty over some regulations kept the celebrations to a minimum.\n\nBankers still bemoaned ongoing low interest rates, which made it difficult to boost profit margins, and to shoulder the burden of new compliance regulations many financial institutions stepped up their IT efforts. Now, finally, the industry appears ready to emerge from the shadows of devastating mortgage scandals.\n\nRegulation, regulation, regulation\n\nIf \u201clocation\u201d is the No. 1 real estate watchword, then \u201cregulation\u201d must describe banking.\n\nNever was that more evident than 2013, but 2014 promises at least temporary relief, as the long-awaited Basel III regulations \u2013 governing minimum capital levels \u2013 have been put on hold.\n\nIn fact, instead of clamping down further on banks, Congress considered and approved many pieces of legislation this year that will actually loosen restrictions in 2014 \u2013 though finance remains one of the most heavily regulated industries in the land.\n\nIn 2013, for instance, banks spent time and resources preparing for regulations dividing mortgages into qualified and non-qualified piles, set to take effect in 2014.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of system changes needed to comply,\u201d noted Joe Blaston, head of mortgages for Santander Bank. \u201cThere\u2019s training and marketing. There\u2019s always a cost associated with any new regulation.\u201d\n\nCredit competition\n\nRegulators might have given banks a break heading into 2014, but credit unions are giving banks a run for their money.\n\nBig banks still dwarf even the largest credit unions, but some Long Island credit unions grew bigger than many local banks \u2013 many by increasing their business lending.\n\nIn 2013, Bethpage Federal Credit Union reached $5.7 billion in assets, Hauppauge-based Teachers Federal Credit Union topped $4.9 billion and Westbury-based Nassau Educators Federal Credit Union topped $2 billion.\n\nNassau Educators CEO Edward Paternostro said such expansion matters because \u201cany organization needs to grow to be sound financially.\u201d\n\nCredit unions also rolled out new brick-and-mortar branches: Bethpage planned to top 30 branches by 2014, Nassau Educators grew to 12 this year and Teachers Federal Credit Union headed into Nassau in 2013 with its 25th branch opening in Merrick.\n\nUpward Mobility\n\nOnline banking is old hat, but mobile banking took off in 2013, with customers using smart phones to check balances, scan checks and handle transactions.\n\nNew Jersey-based Valley National Bank, which has 14 Long Island branches, launched a free app offering remote check deposits as part of the mobile migration, while Islandia-based Empire National Bank also began marketing its free mobile services via a dedicated app.\n\nMeanwhile, Buffalo-based M&T Bank \u2013 which has eight branches in Nassau and Suffolk \u2013 debuted \u201cMobile for Merchants,\u201d letting retailers process credit card payments through smartphones and tablets.\n\nA survey by the Independent Community Bankers of America found that 37 percent of community banks offer the ability to make mobile payments, up 23 percent since 2011.\n\nAt banks with between $251 million and $500 million in assets, nearly half \u2013 46 percent \u2013 offer mobile bill-paying; for banks with more than $501 million in assets, it\u2019s above 54 percent.\n\nTrimming branches\n\nMobile banking caught on, but some banks closed branches \u2013 while others continued to expand physically.\n\nSuffolk Bancorp closed branches in Water Mill and Middle Island and plans to close four more by March 2014 \u2013 in Mattituck, Port Jefferson Station, Manorville and Montauk. But even as it closes those doors, it\u2019s opened new ones, debuting in Garden City almost exactly one year after opening a Melville branch.\n\nLake Success-based Astoria Financial, meanwhile, made a bid for Big Apple business by opening its first Manhattan business banking office in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a big expansion,\u201d Astoria CEO Monte Redman said. \u201cIt\u2019s to help bring about the expansion of our business banking operation. That\u2019s the key.\u201d\n\nAlternative thinking\n\nWhile banks looked for high credit scores and other signs of solvency, alternative lenders aggressively pursued borrowers.\n\nAsset-based lenders used machinery, vehicles and just about everything else they could think of as collateral in a Herculean effort to extend credit. Even industrial banks \u2013 basically, lenders launched by non-banks \u2013 made Long Island inroads in 2013. For instance, TAB Bank, a 15-year-old Utah-based lender that originally made loans exclusively to transportation industry professionals, made its first loans here.\n\nGoing global\n\nMany Long Island firms capitalized in 2013 as the world continued its slow march toward a single global economy.\n\nAtlanta-based First Data, which has an office in Melville, stepped up its multi-currency transactions, while Long Beach-based Planet Payment, which also processes multi-currency transactions, expanded around the world.\n\n\u201cWe can use our technology platform anywhere in the world that banks need us,\u201d Planet Payment CEO Philip Beck told LIBN. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for banks to outsource the complexities of credit and debit cards to our platform.\u201d\n\nPlanet Payment has signed 62 banks in 22 countries, including the United States, Canada, China and India. It also provides services for Visa and has expanded into nations expecting large international crowds \u2013 such as Brazil, site of the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nAs always, 2013 provided plenty of palace intrigue, with Long Island\u2019s corridors of power bristling with hot-button issues and enigmatic personalities. Fiscal cliffs, federal shutdowns and fallout from Hurricane Sandy \u2013 including scuffling on various levels about the speed and efficacy of government recovery payouts \u2013 led this year\u2019s oversized serving of political pugilism.\n\nKing blasts House GOP\n\nThe federal government started 2013 by narrowly avoiding going over the fiscal cliff, approving a compromise measure late on New Year\u2019s Day, with the nation teetering on the brink. Fireworks ensued, but not celebrating the fiscal cliff deal.\n\nInstead, it was Rep. Peter King, R-Massapequa, making headlines less than a day into 2013 by decrying his own party\u2019s leadership, after Republican lawmakers blocked a $60.4 billion Hurricane Sandy relief package. The House leaders\u2019 decision meant the measure couldn\u2019t be voted on in the 112th Congress, and that the whole lengthy process of getting a storm-recovery bill through the House and Senate would have to begin again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying right now, anyone from New York or New Jersey who contributes one penny to Congressional Republicans is out of their minds,\u201d King said in one of several televised appearances. \u201cBecause what they did last night was put a knife in the back of New Yorkers and New Jerseyans. It was an absolute disgrace.\u201d\n\nKing later relented on his GOP-bashing, after a $50.5 billion Sandy aid package was approved on Jan. 28.\n\nPSEG replaces LIPA\n\nAlso churning in Hurricane Sandy\u2019s wake was the effective end of the Long Island Power Authority \u2013 the public utility blamed for weeks-long power outages across the region after the October 2012 superstorm.\n\nIn July, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed legislation transferring all decision-making powers to Newark, N.J.-based PSEG; and the utility will assume management of Long Island\u2019s power grid in 2014.\n\nFormer manager LIPA will instead become a holding company, administrating the authority\u2019s $6.7 billion in debt and allowing for tax-exempt financing. LIPA\u2019s staff of about 90 employees \u2013 mostly political placements \u2013 will also be reduced, to just 20.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining to Hurricane Sandy is that it\u2019s ending the LIPA tragedy that went on for far too long,\u201d Cuomo said at the July bill signing at Mitchell Field. \u201cThis is a system that should have exited a long time ago.\u201d\n\nCuomo\u2019s father, former Gov. Mario Cuomo, created LIPA in the 1980s as a vehicle to decommission the Shoreham nuclear power plant and issue public debt. But under Gov. George Pataki, the LIPA concept was expanded to serve as an overseer of the Long Island transmission grid, and also began contracting for power.\n\nShakeup at NIFA\n\nIn September, just two days before he was scheduled to depart public office, North Hempstead Supervisor Jon Kaiman was tapped by Cuomo to lead the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, the county\u2019s state-imposed fiscal watchdog.\n\nKaiman, who announced earlier in 2013 that he was leaving his town post to take another Cuomo-appointed position, this one as special adviser to the state\u2019s Long Island Storm Recovery task force, replaced long-time NIFA Chairman Ronald Stack.\n\nStack was first appointed to the NIFA board in June 2000 by Gov. George Pataki. When his term expired on Dec. 31, 2012, Stack stayed on, since Cuomo hadn\u2019t appointed anyone to replace him. The move was panned by other NIFA board members.\n\nNIFA entered a control board status in 2011, giving it final approval on the county\u2019s borrowing and spending practices.\n\nMacArthur lands new airlines\n\nAfter years of losing flights, Long Island MacArthur Airport got two big wins this year, attracting both Alaska-based PenAir and Nevada-based Allegiant Air to the Town of Islip-owned airport.\n\nPenAir began operating out of MacArthur in July, offering travelers daily flights to and from Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport on its 34-passenger Saab 340 aircraft. PenAir had considered several Northeast airports for expansion \u2013 it offers various flights around the Northeast separate from its Northwest flight schedule \u2013 and settled on MacArthur because of Long Island\u2019s large population base.\n\nAllegiant Air, which runs routes all over the country, began its own MacArthur operations on Dec. 20, with twice-a-week flights to and from Punta Gorda Airport in Florida. The airline\u2019s MD-83 commercial jets can transport up to 166 passengers per flight.\n\nPenAir and Allegiant joined Southwest Airlines and U.S. Airways as the main carriers at the Ronkonkoma airport.\n\nLIREDC wins $83M\n\nAfter missing out on the top prize in 2012\u2019s second round of Regional Economic Development Council awards, Long Island once again rose to the top in December, taking home $83 million in grants and awards.\n\nThat $83 million is the largest award given to any of the five regional \u201ctop performers\u201d designated at this year\u2019s awards ceremony. Millions in funding have been allocated for projects including a new Innovation and Discovery Facility at Stony Brook University, the creation of a Therapeutics Discovery Center at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, high-performance computing and robotics initiatives at Brookhaven National Laboratory and Hofstra University, and infrastructure improvements at the Enterprise Park at Calverton.\n\nLong Island was last named a top performer in the competition\u2019s 2011 inaugural year, when the regional council received $101.6 million. In total, Long Island has been awarded more than $250 million in economic development grants and tax credits through the Regional Economic Development Council program since its inception.\n\nTonna: Hello and goodbye\n\nIn 2013, the Suffolk County Industrial Development Agency welcomed a new chairman, and bid him farewell, within a matter of months.\n\nIn February, former Suffolk Legislature Presiding Officer Paul Tonna was appointed chairman of the Suffolk IDA, filling a position Jim Morgo vacated in May 2012.\n\nBut just six months later, Tonna stepped down, citing too many instances of having to recuse himself from voting due to potential conflicts of interest concerning companies doing business both with the IDA and Molloy College\u2019s Energeia Partnership leadership program, where Tonna serves as executive director.\n\nThere was some speculation that Tonna\u2019s resignation resulted from a memo he wrote lambasting Cuomo\u2019s plan to privatize LIPA operations, but Tonna denied that had anything to do with his decision, saying he had never discussed the memo with Cuomo or the governor\u2019s office.\n\nJoanne Minieri, Suffolk\u2019s economic development commissioner, was elected to replace Tonna atop the IDA.\n\nMangano beats Suozzi, again\n\nDespite a lackluster off-year election, 2013 did feature one marquee November matchup: the rematch for Nassau County executive between Ed Mangano and Tom Suozzi.\n\nWhat started as a three-way battle \u2013 Suozzi defeated upstart Adam Haber in the Democratic primary \u2013 came down to a mano-a-Mangano street fight, complete with smear tactics, nasty ads and other less-than-noble tactics from both corners.\n\nMangano once again defeated Suozzi, who held the county executive seat from 2001 to 2009, when Mangano unseated him by a narrow margin. This time, incumbent Mangano won by an overwhelming 18 points; poll results showed Suozzi was unable to produce voter turnout in key Democratic communities including Long Beach and North Hempstead.\n\nMangano begins his second term in January.\n\nLI ladies battle corruption\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Cuomo tapped two of Long Island\u2019s leading ladies to stem the corruption perceived as running rampant in Albany.\n\nCuomo\u2019s 25-member Moreland Commission to Investigate Public Corruption is being led by three co-chairs, including Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice. The commission\u2019s day-to-day operations, meanwhile, are being handled by former Suffolk Chief Deputy Executive Regina Calcaterra, who was named Moreland\u2019s executive director.\n\nThe commission, which is scheduled to release a final report by the end of 2014, is Cuomo\u2019s answer to a slew of bills he was unable to get passed in the Legislature before the end of session this past June. The governor filed those bills in response to the indictments of several state elected officials this spring, most from New York City.\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nLove it or hate it, Obamacare is law.\n\nIn a year of momentous change in American health-care policy, the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act was easily the No.1 national headline \u2013 the biggest medical makeover since the 1966 implementation of Medicare, and one of the nation\u2019s all-time divisive political issues.\n\nBut there was plenty of local earth-shaking as well, including the ascension of Dr. Alan Guerci to the top of Catholic Health Services of Long Island and CEO Michael Dowling\u2019s attempts to expand the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System.\n\nClosed in late 2012 by Hurricane Sandy, the Long Beach Medical Center remained shuttered for all of 2013, even as several former employees filed a class-action lawsuit.\n\nAnd while the federal government\u2019s online health-insurance exchange stumbled badly out of the starting gate, the New York State Health Benefit Exchange enjoyed a much smoother start.\n\nExchange rate\n\nRiding $185.8 million in federal grants, New York flipped the switch on its digital insurance exchange in October, and according to spokesman Bob Meissner of Families USA, which tracks the progress of federal and state-based health insurance exchanges, the Empire State\u2019s site was among the best.\n\n\u201cThe ones that have operated smoothly have been a dream,\u201d Meissner said. \u201cNew York seems to be doing well.\u201d\n\nSeveral thousand New Yorkers have signed up for insurance coverage through the state exchange, thanks in part to an assist from various local organizations lending the Health Benefit Exchange a hand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been extremely busy enrolling individuals and business into insurance plans,\u201d noted Janine Logan, a spokeswoman for the Nassau-Suffolk Hospital Council, which has been helping with the state\u2019s enrollment process.\n\nWhat\u2019s your policy?\n\nWhile the exchanges were making bad and good news, health insurance went through other important transformations in 2013 \u2013 some lifetime coverage limits disappeared, some deductibles and co-pays increased and some policies were simply discontinued.\n\nIn one of the most overlooked changes to health insurance in 2013, many insurers worked hard to shrink their provider networks \u2013 the \u201ccomeback of managed care,\u201d according to John Sardelis, associate chairman of health administration at St. Joseph\u2019s College in Patchogue.\n\nThese attempts were not without their repercussions: UnitedHealthcare \u2013 an operating division of Minnesota-based UnitedHealth Group, the largest U.S. Health carrier \u2013 faced litigation after removing thousands of doctors from its Medicare Advantage network; in the case of 600 Connecticut doctors pulled from Medicare Advantage, UnitedHealthcare lost, thanks to the efforts of attorney Roy Breitenbach of Great Neck firm Garfunkel Wild.\n\nOne reason major insurers began limiting networks and otherwise changing products was stiff competition from providers like North Shore-LIJ, which in July became licensed to sell its own insurance plans. The North Shore-LIJ CareConnect Insurance Co. now offers coverage to residents of Long Island, Queens, Staten Island and Manhattan \u2013 \u201cone of the first times in state history that a major health system has created a controlled insurance company to sell commercial health insurance,\u201d according to North Shore-LIJ spokesman Terry Lynam.\n\nWhile providing their own insurance is a risk for hospitals, it\u2019s also a potential cost-saver through improved care and preventative efforts. Hospitals and health systems providing their own insurance \u201ccan be good,\u201d Sardelis noted, \u201cbut can they do it without affecting the quality?\u201d\n\nElectric companies\n\nThe use of electronic medical records expanded greatly in 2013.\n\nCatholic Health Services, for instance, stepped up its use of its Epic electronic medical records, passing production milestones that led to significant government reimbursements; North Shore-LIJ also increased electronic record keeping among its hospitals and associated doctors.\n\nBenefitting from the surge are various Long Island companies that provide the technologies behind electronic record-keeping. Kevin Scalia, executive vice president of Great River-based Netsmart Technologies, said new federal funding was behind the increased demand.\n\n\u201cThe rollout of electronic health records has increased greatly over the last four or five years because of that,\u201d Scalia said.\n\nQuality vs. quantity\n\nThe way health-care providers are paid continues to evolve. In 2013, many systems signed contracts through which their compensated per patient, rather than per procedure.\n\n\u201cThe key will be competing on the quality of care, since payment systems like Medicare are moving away from paying for volume and rewarding better quality,\u201d Sardelis noted. \u201cThis creates a delicate balance in areas where control is an issue.\u201d\n\nThe shift drove more doctors into systems and larger practices, however, since it became harder for solo practitioners to compete.\n\nOutpatient care\n\nOut is in: While many hospitals expanded older inpatient facilities in 2013 or built new ones, providers in general shifted toward outpatient care.\n\nWhen Catholic Health Services opened its new cancer institute at St. Francis Hospital this year, it included an outpatient infusion center; its Mercy Medical Center includes an outpatient rehabilitation center.\n\nAdding to the ambulatory upsurge, more urgent care centers \u2013 designed to be a cheaper and quicker alternatives to emergency rooms for minor injuries \u2013 cropped up on Long Island in 2013.\n\nPayback\u2019s a\u2026\n\nHealth-care providers took a hit from the federal sequestration in 2013, and they\u2019re bracing for another round in 2014, when 2 percent cuts in Medicare reimbursements \u2013 another side effect of the sequestrations \u2013 are slated to hit hospitals.\n\nAnd the feds are considering further cuts, in part to avoid gutting the nation\u2019s defense budget.\n\nWhile nobody in the health-care industry denies a need for a strong national defense, many insiders are starting to feel like the national piggybank.\n\n\u201cOur industry maintains that it\u2019s highly unfair to continue to cut the hospital industry to lessen the impact on another industry,\u201d said Logan of the Nassau-Suffolk Hospital Council. \u201cEspecially when we have shouldered the burden in the past.\u201d\n\nREAL ESTATE\n\nAfter being derailed by the economic downturn that cast a pall over the industry five years ago, Long Island real estate got back on track in 2013.\n\nThe improvement was evident across all sectors, as the residential and commercial markets both made significant gains.\n\nHome sales were up nearly 22 percent this year compared with 2012, with prices firming. Activity also soared on the commercial side, with asking rents and sale prices up and positive absorption in the office, industrial and retail markets.\n\nContinued low interest rates, pent-up demand and an improving jobs picture contributed to the rebound and infused confidence among brokers, developers, landlords and tenants. A better overall business climate has also fueled momentum for the Island\u2019s mega-redevelopment efforts and a slew of company expansions, and has given rise to a host of new merchants.\n\nOne mega-project starts \u2026\n\nWhile there was only one groundbreaking among Long Island\u2019s proposed mega-developments this year, growing appetites for rental housing and jobs created momentum for others.\n\nThe Albanese Organization broke ground this fall on the much-ballyhooed Wyandanch Rising project, a $500 million reboot of the historic Babylon Town hamlet that in the early 1950s offered the first \u2013 and at the time, only \u2013 interracial housing on Long Island.\n\nAlready 10 years in the making, the Wyandanch overhaul is centered on 60 acres around the Babylon Long Island Rail Road station, currently a mix of struggling retail, shuttered stores and commuter parking lots.\n\nAlbanese\u2019s firm has begun construction on the first of three planned buildings in Rising\u2019s first phase, a $38 million, five-story mixed-use structure that will feature 91 rental apartments above 20,000 square feet of retail space on four acres.\n\nAbout 50 of the apartments, which are expected to be completed late next year, will be priced at affordable \u201cworkforce\u201d levels. Next up is a $38 million, four-story structure with 86 apartments over 20,000 square feet. A 60,000-square-foot office building with ground-floor retail space is the third project on the Albanese drawing board, with construction set for some time next year.\n\nCompany principal Russell Albanese said other projects, including condos or other for-sale housing, will follow based on market demand.\n\n\u2026 other mega-projects inch ahead\n\nLong Island\u2019s largest mega project, the $4 billion Heartland Town Square plan in Brentwood, has been gaining traction. The project, a massive 460-acre redevelopment of the former Pilgrim State Hospital land into more than 9,000 rental apartments, 1 million square feet of retail space and more than 3 million square feet of offices, is awaiting approval of its final environmental impact statement and could come to a vote by the Town of Islip in the next few months.\n\nThe planned mix of rental apartments, shops, restaurants and offices will eventually generate about 23,000 permanent jobs, and at least 1,500 construction jobs annually throughout its build-out, which developer David Wolkoff said could easily eclipse 20 years. Wolkoff said he\u2019s hoping to get started on the plan\u2019s first phase, which includes some 3,500 rental apartments, sometime in 2014.\n\nIn Glen Cove, the long-awaited redevelopment of 55 acres of property along once-toxic Glen Cove Creek was rechristened Garvies Point. Site-clearing work began this year on the $1 billion mega project that promises more than 800 rental and condominium residences, a 250-suite hotel and conference center and 75,000 square feet of office and retail space, with construction of the mixed-use complex to begin next year.\n\nRenaissance fares\n\nSpeaking of major redevelopments, Plainview-based Renaissance Downtowns landed yet another Long Island revitalization gig in 2013.\n\nThe Southampton Town Board recently selected the company as master developer to spearhead planning and development for Riverside, a mostly blighted area bereft of commerce that\u2019s home to the Suffolk County jail and has one of the lowest median incomes on the Island.\n\nRenaissance Downtowns is already the master developer for the property surrounding the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, the downtown makeover of Hempstead Village and the revitalization of Huntington Station\u2019s downtown.\n\nWhile nothing has been built yet at those projects, a hotel is now on tap as the first development in Huntington Station\u2019s revival and Renaissance says it will break ground on the first construction in Hempstead, a 336-unit rental apartment building, in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nNew in store\n\nThis year saw a slew of new retailers establishing Island beachheads.\n\nA $40 million, 72,000-square-foot expansion and renovation of Walt Whitman Shops in Huntington Station made room for more than two dozen new stores including newcomers Carhartt, Free People, Henri Bendel, Sophie Reese and Triumph International. Its roster of new eateries features Brio Tuscan Grille and Zinburger Wine & Burger Bar.\n\nIn another Long Island retail first, discount retail giant Wal-Mart opened one of its smaller, grocery-only Neighborhood Market stores here in July. The 49,000-square-foot store in the Levittown Mews shopping center was formerly occupied by Waldbaums.\n\nAnd there were plenty more. Noodles & Company, a Colorado-based fast-casual concept, opened its first Long Island location this summer in the Gallery at Westbury Plaza, the first of an expected two dozen it plans locally. The Island\u2019s first Muscle Maker Grill opened this spring on Merrick Road in Amityville.\n\nBetter burger restaurants also made their mark here this year. North Palm Beach, Fla.-based Burger Fi opened its first location in Oceanside, Queens-based Bareburger opened in Great Neck and Smashburger opened in New Hyde Park, its fourth Long Island restaurant in less than two years.\n\nDairy Queen came back to Long Island after more than 25 years, opening a 2,800-square-foot DQ Grill & Chill on Sunrise Highway in Massapequa in May.\n\nThe Island\u2019s first PGA Tour Superstore opened this month in a 44,000-square-foot space at Roosevelt Raceway Center in Westbury. The space leased by the national pro shop chain had been part of the Home Depot Expo store that closed four years ago.\n\nCurtain raisers\n\nTwo Long Island downtowns starving for revitalization cut the ribbons on restored theaters in 2013. The historic Suffolk Theater on Main Street in Riverhead was first built in 1933; it had been dark for 26 years. It was acquired in 2005 by construction executive and restoration expert Bob Castaldi, who painstakingly restored the theater to its former Art Deco elegance.\n\nThe Space at Westbury, an $8 million redevelopment by Lowes Properties, debuted this fall. The original Westbury Theater opened in 1927. It closed in 2001 after years of decline and was acquired by Lowes for $1.65 million in 2004. Its newest incarnation sports a two-screen art cinema, a multipurpose event space, a restaurant and four live-and-work lofts for artists.\n\nLocals say the revivals of both downtown theaters have been catalysts for other renewal projects in Riverhead and Westbury, and a boon to their existing merchants.\n\nRoom to move\n\nCanon USA sent thousands of change-of-address letters to Long Island\u2019s business community this spring, marking the opening of its new Melville headquarters.\n\nThe company relocated from leased space in Lake Success, bringing about 1,400 employees to the nearly 700,000-square-foot complex with its own address \u2013 One Canon Park.\n\nCanon built its new headquarters on a former pumpkin farm it bought from the Tilles family for $103 million in 2006. The company\u2019s other global headquarters are located in London and Tokyo.\n\nCanon opened its first office in Manhattan in 1955 with five employees. The company moved to Woodside in 1968, and then to Lake Success in 1971.\n\nThe digital imaging giant recorded about $40 billion in global revenue in 2012.\n\nHomebuilding returns\n\nAfter a six-year slump, there was renewed activity at many of Long Island\u2019s new home subdivisions this year.\n\nAnd while the industry continues to shrink as land becomes scarce and profit margins decrease, there are more new homes being built now than in recent years.\n\nFor the Long Island Builders Institute, the regional homebuilding trade group, the mini-boom was long overdue, after the economic downturn took a heavy toll on much of its membership. The builders\u2019 group credits the renewed vigor in new-home construction in 2013 to movement in the region\u2019s overall residential real estate market, where the number of home sales jumped nearly 22 percent from a year ago.\n\nThe numbers show permits for new single-family homes were up in most Long Island towns.\n\nIn Brookhaven, where the lion\u2019s share of the Island\u2019s new-home construction has been taking place for the past 30 years, the town issued 502 permits for new single-family homes in the first eight months of 2013, a whopping 50 percent jump from the 334 permits approved in the same time last year.\n\nThe 55 new-home permits issued by the Town of Islip from January through August were the most the town has issued since 2008, when Islip gave out 71 in the same eight months.\n\nAnd because there are fewer existing homes listed for sale these days \u2013 with inventory down about 12 percent from 2012 \u2013 demand for new homes should continue to rise next year, too.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nYou win some, you lose some. It\u2019s a healthy outlook for life in general, but when it comes to the technology industry on Long Island \u2013 according to most economic insiders, the Island\u2019s last, best hope for a solid fiscal future \u2013 every loss hurts.\n\nMany in the tech industry will remember 2013 on Long Island not for product development or significant breakthroughs, but for titanic employment shifts. Among technological enterprises, there were many significant losses on the Island in 2013, including a continued migration of some of the Island\u2019s oldest tech employers. But there were also gains, many of which were equally significant.\n\nNorthrop Grumman guts 850\n\nOnce the largest employer on Long Island with more than 25,000 employees, Northrop Grumman announced in March that it would severely reduce its local workforce by October 2014.\n\nThe consolidation, which began in November, will reduce the company\u2019s 1,400-employee Island workforce by 850, part of a massive reshuffling of divisions that will result in the creation of five \u201ccenters of excellence\u201d around the nation. The 850 relocated jobs will mostly be moved to Melbourne, Fla., where Northrop Grumman has created a \u201cManned Aircraft Design Center of Excellence,\u201d including all of the design work that has for years been done in Bethpage.\n\nBethpage, meanwhile, will become the company\u2019s \u201cElectronic Attack Center of Excellence,\u201d a designation that carries no regional employment benefits. However, Northrop Grumman officials have said electronic-attack research \u2013 including aircraft-mounted technology and cyber-security protocols \u2013 has large growth potential because it\u2019s a core government focus.\n\nMore losses and gains\n\nNorthrop Grumman wasn\u2019t the only tech company moving employees on or off Long Island in 2013.\n\nIn May, CA Technologies CEO Michael Gregoire announced the giant software developer would lay off 1,200 workers around the globe \u2013 60 percent of them in the United States \u2013 by the end of June in an attempt to boost revenue. CA Technologies posted a 2 percent drop in revenue in 2012.\n\nAs part of its plan to build a second headquarters, Melville-based MSC Industrial Supply Co. relocated 120 Long Island employees to its new office outside Charlotte, N.C. Despite building the $37 million, 180,000-square-foot North Carolina sister headquarters, MSC officials have insisted they are not relocating the company to the Tarheel State.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all goodbyes for Long Island. Great Neck-based Genadyne Biotechnologies in March agreed to relocate its Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based subsidiary here as part of a 10-year deal with the Nassau County Industrial Development Agency. Genadyne, which makes wound-care treatments and therapeutic mattresses, will create 72 jobs as a result of the relocation.\n\nAnd Estee Lauder announced in January it was moving its northern New Jersey operations to the beauty company\u2019s existing Melville offices, including as many as 31 new jobs.\n\nBut in one of the toughest blows of the year to the Long Island economy, OSI Pharmaceuticals \u2013 the Farmingdale tech company born out of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories 25 years ago \u2013 shocked everyone, including its own employees, when it informed workers in May they were all being let go.\n\nThe move, part of a larger restructuring by parent company Astellas Pharma that involved severing all ties with Long Island, resulted in more than 100 OSI employees being laid off.\n\nAstellas purchased OSI, maker of the lung cancer drug Tarceva, in 2010. Despite initially planning to move the company upstate, Astellas officials eventually agreed to leave OSI\u2019s 90 employees in place, following an action by the governor that allowed OSI to expand into the second building at the Broad Hollow Bioscience Park.\n\nThat deal was sweetened by $1.8 million in performance-based tax credits Astellas was to receive from the Suffolk County Industrial Development Agency and New York State. In total, Astellas only received roughly $750,000 in benefits as the agreement hadn\u2019t matured yet.\n\nSuffolk IDA attorneys in October were successful in recouping that $750,000 from OSI and Astellas.\n\n3, 2, 1 \u2026 LaunchPad\n\nIn one of the Long Island tech scene\u2019s most promising new developments in years, a new startup incubator and co-working facility launched this year in Mineola.\n\nLaunchPad Long Island officially opened in February inside a transformed, three-story, 12,000-square-foot building that most recently housed a law firm and deli. Venture capitalists and serial entrepreneurs Andrew Hazen and Richard Foster put up the $100,000 needed to get the facility off the ground, including second-floor offices for companies the duo is personally willing to gamble on.\n\nThe space has attracted many companies and organizations, including the Long Island Software and Technology Network, which relocated from the now-shuttered Long Island Tech Mall, which only opened in Hauppauge in 2012.\n\nBeyond the space, though, LaunchPad Long Island also serves as a seed-investment engine. The organization itself made its first investment shortly after opening, throwing a five-figure bone to Melville-based GroupGifting.com, the social gifting service started by Tyler Roye and the Invision founding team.\n\nThere\u2019s more of that collaboration coming in 2014. Roye is currently in the process of transforming space in the heart of downtown Huntington Village into LaunchPad Huntington, a spinoff of the Mineola site set to open in January.\n\nAccelerate gains and loses partners\n\nA little more than a year after its official inception, Accelerate Long Island added and lost some powerful allies.\n\nThe research commercialization driver announced in November it had forged an alliance with Roslyn Heights-based venture capital fund Topspin Partners. Not only did the $213 million venture capital firm commit an undisclosed amount of money to the Long Island Emerging Technologies Fund \u2013 a $1.25 million pre-angel stage investment fund for fledgling tech companies \u2013 it also offered Accelerate Long Island permanent space at its offices in Roslyn Heights. Accelerate Long Island had been operating out of the Long Island Association\u2019s Melville headquarters since its inception.\n\nBut only a month later, Accelerate Long Island lost the support of its largest private sector backer. Executives from Islandia-based CA Technologies informed Mark Lesko, head of Accelerate Long Island, the company would be severing ties, including withdrawing its $50,000 budget contribution.\n\nLesko said CA\u2019s board had made a \u201cbusiness decision\u201d to only support initiatives directly related to the company\u2019s core business of software development. Accelerate Long Island has been focusing primarily on startups in the biotech and life-sciences fields.\n\nTopspin Partners will replace CA Technologies on the Accelerate Long Island Board of Directors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As 2013 ends, Long Island finds itself right where it was at the end of 2012: refining its commercial identity and fighting an unpromising residential tide.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "LIBN Staff", "og": {"site_name": "Long Island Business News", "description": "With another year over and a new one just begun, Long Island finds itself right where it was at the end of 2012: refining its commercial identity and fighting a", "title": "Newsmakers of the year", "url": "http://libn.com/2013/12/27/newsmakers-of-the-year/", "image": "http://libn.com/files/2013/12/2014-200x200.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Newsmakers of the yearLong Island Business News", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "fb": {"admins": 1425649256}, "keywords": "revitalization, planning, zoning, heartland town square, mega-projects, real estate, projects, redevelopment, construction, nassau-suffolk hospital council, affordable care and patient protection act, obamacare, travel, transportation, health care, energy, power, long island power authority, nassau educators federal credit union, banking, finance, hurricane sandy, coliseum redevelopment, housing, hurricane recovery, business, economy, long island, newsmakers,banking,business,construction,economy,energy,finance,healthcare,heartland town square,housing,hurricane sandy,long island,long island power authority,nassau educators federal credit union,nassau-suffolk hospital council,obamacare,planning,power,projects,real estate,redevelopment,transportation,travel,zoning", "google-site-verification": "prJM0F6_hLVnSjClKqHN9f0yCvgWPpfGJpTRzyS7lpo", "y_key": "3dbc4b23a8d3ae0b", "thumbnail": "http://libn.com/files/2013/12/2014-180x120.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda165\"", "article_summary": "Accelerate Long Island had been operating out of the Long Island Association\u2019s Melville headquarters since its inception.\nThe space has attracted many companies and organizations, including the Long Island Software and Technology Network, which relocated from the now-shuttered Long Island Tech Mall, which only opened in Hauppauge in 2012.\nGoing globalMany Long Island firms capitalized in 2013 as the world continued its slow march toward a single global economy.\nFor the Long Island Builders Institute, the regional homebuilding trade group, the mini-boom was long overdue, after the economic downturn took a heavy toll on much of its membership.\nBig banks still dwarf even the largest credit unions, but some Long Island credit unions grew bigger than many local banks \u2013 many by increasing their business lending."}
