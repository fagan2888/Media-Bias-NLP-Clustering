Nice work, NSA! For the most part, the reports don't appear to contain anything especially new, but I was struck by this particular violation:\n\nThe OIG's Office of Investigation initiated an investigation of an allegation than an NSA analyst had conducted an unauthorized intelligence activity. In an interview conducted by the NSA/CSS Office of Security and Counterintelligence, the analyst reported that, during the past two or three years, she had searched her spouse's personal telephone directory without his knowledge to obtain names and telephone numbers for targeting....Although the investigation is ongoing, the analyst has been advised to cease her activities.\n\nWait a second. She was caught using NSA surveillance facilities to spy on her husband and was merely told to cease her activities? Wouldn't it be more appropriate to, say, fire her instantly and bar her from possessing any kind of security clearance ever again in her life? What am I missing here?", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/12/nsa-surprisingly-open-minded-analysts-spying-their-spouses", "type": "article", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "title": "The NSA is surprisingly open-minded about analysts spying on their spouses"}, "twitter": {"creator": "kdrum", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/12/nsa-surprisingly-open-minded-analysts-spying-their-spouses", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "title": "The NSA is surprisingly open-minded about analysts spying on their spouses", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Civil+Liberties,Crime+and+Justice", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec76\"", "article_summary": "She was caught using NSA surveillance facilities to spy on her husband and was merely told to cease her activities?\nVia Bloomberg, we learn that the NSA chose Christmas Eve to release its latest set of reports on violations of surveillance rules by its analysts.\nNice work, NSA!\nWouldn't it be more appropriate to, say, fire her instantly and bar her from possessing any kind of security clearance ever again in her life?\nFor the most part, the reports don't appear to contain anything especially new, but I was struck by this particular violation:The OIG's Office of Investigation initiated an investigation of an allegation than an NSA analyst had conducted an unauthorized intelligence activity."}
