He called her \u201cdefinitely an inspiring boss, a combination of spontaneity and seriousness.\u201d\n\nHmm, what sort of adult wouldn't want to work for a \"Mom in chief\"? And what sort of citizen wouldn't want to live in a country run by pols who treat them like children?\n\nFull story here.\n\nHat tip: Instapundit and Reason's own P.M.
