A man wearing no pants was arrested after police said he broke into a Piedmont elementary school and vandalized school property.

According to police, at about 11:30 a.m. Saturday, officers responded to a suspicious activity report at Northwood Elementary school, located at 14100 Northwood Drive.

An employee called the principal after she saw a suspicious man walking around the school. The man was barefoot, and was not wearing any pants.

The man had already left the scene when officers arrived. Police said they found the suspect, 22-year-old Austin Anderson, walking in and out of the eastbound lanes of NW Expressway, and took him into custody.

According to police, Anderson threw a brick through the gym door window to gain entry into the school. He reportedly left his underwear on a chair in the gym, and his shorts in the lounge area.

As Anderson was walking through the school, police said he poured relish and apple cider vinegar by every entry/exit door of the school. He also urinated by several doors and rooms of the school.

Police said Anderson vandalized several items inside the school and placed computers by a door possibly to steal when he left.

Anderson was listed as a missing endangered person through Edmond police, authorities said. He was taken into custody and booked into the Oklahoma County Jail on one count of second-degree burglary.
