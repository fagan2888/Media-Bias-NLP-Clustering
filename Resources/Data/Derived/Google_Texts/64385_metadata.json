I\u2019ve been all over the country. Last night I was in South Carolina \u2014 we had 12,000 people. It set up in about 4 days. We\u2019ve created a movement. A lot of it has to do, for example, the question on drugs. I\u2019m the first one who said build a wall. But a real wall, not a toy wall like they have right now, and you\u2019ll solve lots of problems. But we will galvanize the people of this country and we will beat Hillary Clinton because \u2014 assuming that she runs, by the way. How she gets away with the email stuff is hard to believe. So I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s gunna be running. But on the assumption she runs\u2026 But if she runs she\u2019s gunna be able to run for one reason and that\u2019s because the Democrats are protecting her. So many people have done so much less than her and their lives have been destroyed. But on the assumption they protect her, we will win the election handily.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump On 'Handily' Beating Hillary: 'We've Created a Movement'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Trump On 'Handily' Beating Hillary: 'We've Created a Movement'", "title": "Trump On 'Handily' Beating Hillary: 'We've Created a Movement' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1001, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/GettyImages-508799352-e1454809682392.jpg", "height": 748}, "updated_time": "2016-02-06T19:20:45-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/06/trump-on-beating-hillary-weve-created-a-movement/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump On 'Handily' Beating Hillary: 'We've Created a Movement'", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/GettyImages-508799352-e1454809682392.jpg", "title": "Trump On 'Handily' Beating Hillary: 'We've Created a Movement' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "ABC News Debate, Donald Trump 2016,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-02-06T19:19:59-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2016-02-06T19:20:45-07:00", "tag": "Donald Trump 2016", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "But on the assumption she runs\u2026 But if she runs she\u2019s gunna be able to run for one reason and that\u2019s because the Democrats are protecting her.\nSo I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s gunna be running.\nWe\u2019ve created a movement.\nBut we will galvanize the people of this country and we will beat Hillary Clinton because \u2014 assuming that she runs, by the way.\nBut a real wall, not a toy wall like they have right now, and you\u2019ll solve lots of problems."}
