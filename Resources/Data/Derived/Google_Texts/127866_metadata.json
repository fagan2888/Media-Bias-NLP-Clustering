And we are leading the way, in large part, because civic and grass-roots leaders in our state were committed to an aggressive approach to enrollment.\n\nWe think that Obamacare could be even more successful with one important reform.\n\nMore than a million and a half undocumented Californians don\u2019t have access to Obamacare because they and all undocumented Americans are barred from participating. Anyone who believes that their exclusion from the law saves dollars is mistaken.\n\nUndocumented Californians contribute tens of billions of dollars to our state\u2019s economy, and their lack of insurance coverage results in lost productivity and increased reliance on emergency rooms and other government health services. And perhaps more important, their exclusion undermines the principle of health care as a human right.\n\nWe are proud of our state\u2019s success story with Obamacare. We will be even prouder when all Californians are part of that story.\n\nROBERT K.
