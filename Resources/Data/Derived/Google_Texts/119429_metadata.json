While much attention has been paid to the report\u2019s finding that Obamacare will reduce employment by as much as 2.5 million workers, buried on page 117 (Appendix C) is this bombshell: \u201cCBO estimates that the ACA will cause a reduction of roughly 1 percent in aggregate labor compensation over the 2017-2024 period, compared with what it would have been otherwise.\u201d\n\nTranslation: Obamacare means a 1 percent pay cut for American workers.\n\nHow much does that come to? Since wages and salaries were about $6.85 trillion in 2012 and are expected to exceed $7 trillion in 2013 and 2014, a 1 percent reduction in compensation is going to cost American workers at least $70 billion a year in lost wages.\n\nIt gets worse. Most of that $70 billion in lost wages will come from the paychecks of working-class Americans \u2014 those who can afford it least. That\u2019s because Obamacare is a tax on work that will affect lower- and middle-income workers who depend on government subsidies for health coverage. The subsidies Obamacare provides depend on income. If your income goes up, your subsidies go down. This means Obamacare effectively traps people in lower-income jobs by imposing an additional tax on every dollar of additional income they earn. Working hard to earn a promotion or get a raise, or taking on additional part-time work \u2014 all the things people do to pursue the American Dream \u2014 are discouraged by Obamacare. As Keith Hennessey, former chairman of the White House National Economic Council, explains it, \u201cObamacare punishes additional work, education, job training and professional advancement, anything that generates additional income for those trying to climb into the middle class.\u201d\n\nThis makes a mockery of the \u201copportunity agenda\u201d President Obama announced with such fanfare in his State of the Union address a few weeks ago. In his address, Obama bemoaned the fact that over the past four years, \u201caverage wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled.\u201d\n\nPut aside for a moment the fact that Obama is describing the economy after five years of his economic stewardship. How can Obama complain that \u201caverage wages have barely budged\u201d when the CBO says the signature initiative of his presidency will cut average wages by $70 billion? How can Obama complain about \u201cincome inequality\u201d when Obamacare is reducing the incomes of working-class families? How can Obama say he is for upward mobility when the law that bears his name stifles mobility by encouraging millions of Americans to work less? How can Obama promise to \u201cbuild new ladders of opportunity into the middle class\u201d when Obamacare kicks the ladder of opportunity out from under working-class Americans?\n\nObamacare is an economic disaster for the country \u2014 because it will shrink the economy by encouraging people to work less. It is also a political disaster for Obama \u2014 because it turns his promise to focus on opportunity into nothing more than empty rhetoric. The biggest obstacle to Obama\u2019s \u201copportunity agenda\u201d is Obamacare. For millions, the price of Obamacare is sacrificing their rise up the ladder of opportunity.\n\nWhat this means is that, two weeks after he announced it, Obama\u2019s \u201copportunity agenda\u201d is dead. The signature initiative of Obama\u2019s second term has been killed by the signature initiative of his first.\n\nBut it\u2019s not too late for Congress to address opportunity, upward mobility and income inequality. Lawmakers can start by heeding the president\u2019s call to \u201cgive America a raise\u201d \u2014 a $70 billion raise, to be precise. And the best way to do that is to repeal Obamacare.\n\nRead more from Marc Thiessen\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The biggest obstacle to Obama\u2019s \u201copportunity agenda\u201d is Obamacare", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The biggest obstacle to Obama\u2019s \u201copportunity agenda\u201d is Obamacare", "title": "Marc Thiessen: Obamacare\u2019s $70 billion pay cut", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/marc-thiessen-obamacares-70-billion-pay-cut/2014/02/10/f4de89d6-9259-11e3-b227-12a45d109e03_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/Images/201401/obamacare-300x199.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marcthiessen"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/marc-thiessen-obamacares-70-billion-pay-cut/2014/02/10/f4de89d6-9259-11e3-b227-12a45d109e03_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Marc Thiessen, obamacare, affordable care act, cbo report, cbo obamacare, cbo affordable care act, obamacare jobs, obamacare workers, aca jobs, aca workers, aca cbo,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen"}, "eomportal-uuid": "f4de89d6-9259-11e3-b227-12a45d109e03", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Marc Thiessen, obamacare, affordable care act, cbo report, cbo obamacare, cbo affordable care act, obamacare jobs, obamacare workers, aca jobs, aca workers, aca cbo,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd38b6\"", "article_summary": "Lawmakers can start by heeding the president\u2019s call to \u201cgive America a raise\u201d \u2014 a $70 billion raise, to be precise.\nMost of that $70 billion in lost wages will come from the paychecks of working-class Americans \u2014 those who can afford it least.\nHow can Obama complain that \u201caverage wages have barely budged\u201d when the CBO says the signature initiative of his presidency will cut average wages by $70 billion?\nIn his State of the Union address, President Obama urged Congress to \u201cgive America a raise.\u201d Well, it turns out that Obama is giving America a $70 billion annual pay cut, courtesy of Obamacare.\nThis means Obamacare effectively traps people in lower-income jobs by imposing an additional tax on every dollar of additional income they earn."}
