Chesterton (1874-1936), called by his admirers the greatest writer and thinker of the 20th century, published a curious novel titled \u201cThe Flying Inn.\u201d On the cusp of World War I, he imagined the Ottoman Empire conquering Great Britain and imposing Shariah law.\n\nChesterton rides this implausible scenario as a vehicle to ridicule progressivism \u2014 that same arrogant, \u201cscientific,\u201d top-down, and leftist approach to government that characterizes the age of Obama. \u201cThe business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes,\u201d Chesterton rightly explained, and \u201cThe Flying Inn\u201d mordantly exposes their failings. Along the way, his vision of an Islamized sceptered isle has arresting features deserving celebration on its centenary.\n\nChesterton tells of a war in which \u201cthe greatest of the Turkish warriors, the terrifying Oman Pasha, equally famous for his courage in war and his cruelty in peace\u201d wins a famous victory over British forces, leading to the occupation of England, to Turks taking over the constabulary, and the growing influence of an \u201ceminent Turkish mystic,\u201d Misysra Ammon, who argues for such Islamic customs as not eating pork, prohibiting representative images, taking one\u2019s shoes off at the front door and practicing polygyny.\n\nBut the most prominent Islamic custom, and the one around which \u201cThe Flying Inn\u201d revolves, is Oman Pasha\u2019s decree for the destruction of vineyards and the banishment of alcohol. Lord Philip Ivywood, an eager, progressive dhimmi adept of Ammon, passed in 1909 a prohibition of alcohol, which allowed only minor exceptions: buildings with inn signs outside them (pending their universal disappearance) and two famous watering holes for (of course) members of Parliament, Claridge\u2019s Hotel and the Criterion Bar. Otherwise, pubs served lemonade, tea and other of what Chesterton dubs \u201cSaracen drinks.\u201d\n\nTaking advantage of the former loophole, a valiant Irish sailor and an English publican roll through the countryside carrying with them the sign of \u201cThe Old Ship\u201d pub, a giant keg of rum, and a great drum of cheddar cheese. Their bacchanalian exploits, and Lord Ivywood\u2019s growing fury, make up the bulk of this fantasy novel, culminating in an English revolt against Ivywood, against Londonistan, against the fez-wearing Turkish police force, and their teetotaler ways. Hating \u201cthe fact of being crushed by the weapons of men brown and yellow had made the English what they had not been for centuries.\u201d Their heroic insurgency leaves Oman Pasha dead \u201cwith his face toward Mecca\u201d and pubs reopening.\n\nAlthough a challenge to read, this overdrawn narrative uncannily anticipates the left-Islamist alliance of our times, a phenomenon otherwise nearly invisible until the 1980s. Anticipating George Galloway and Carlos the Jackal, the lefty Ivywood called Islam a \u201cgreat religion\u201d and a \u201creligion of progress.\u201d He even appealed for full unity between Christianity and Islam, to be called \u201cChrislam\u201d (a term actually in use in 2014), while a trendy parson wanted St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral to sport \u201csome sort of double emblem combining cross and crescent.\u201d\n\nWe learn, amusingly, that Ivywood wrote a biography of the tyrannical Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II for the \u201cProgressive Potentates\u201d series, anticipating (among other books) Patrick Seale\u2019s puff biography of Syria\u2019s Hafez Assad. Today\u2019s left finds excuses for female genital mutilation, and Ivywood abandoned Western girls abducted to Turkish harems on the grounds that \u201cthere should be no new disturbance of whatever amicable or domestic ties have been formed.\u201d Echoing today\u2019s liberals, he argued that Turkish women enjoy \u201cthe highest freedom\u201d while belittling the lot of their British counterparts.\n\nLikewise, Chesterton anticipated other themes then nonexistent and now in full bloom. Ivywood speculated about our own day: In \u201ca century or two to come,\u201d he said, \u201cwe may see the cause of peace, of science and of reform everywhere supported by Islam.\u201d In this spirit, he advocated \u201cAsia in Europe,\u201d something that Muslim immigration has achieved.\n\nThe Turkish mystic Ammon promulgated \u201csome fad about English civilization having been founded by the Turks [and] seemed to think that Englishmen would soon return to this way of thinking.\u201d Indeed, it\u2019s banal in 2014 to hear Islamists declaim how Muslims reached the Americas in the 10th century A.D., and that Islam had a leading role in the writing of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe Flying Inn\u201d memorably sketches out a preliminary, wild and weird picture of Islam in Great Britain, one far more real these days than when long ago published in a very different era.\n\nDaniel Pipes (DanielPipes.org) is president of the Middle East Forum.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exactly one century ago, the renowned British writer G.K.
