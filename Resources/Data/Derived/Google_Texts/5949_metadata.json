She will tie her future even closer to Obama, who remains a deeply beloved figure among black Americans.\n\nClinton also plans to intensify her focus on issues of importance to minority voters, such as immigration, civil rights and gun control, \u2013 dispatching African-American supporters to make her case and launching a flurry of attacks to undermine any credibility Sanders may be building within the black community.\n\nFocus-group surveys conducted by Clinton\u2019s campaign with undecided black voters in Charleston before the New Hampshire voting found that the former secretary of state has retained a high degree of trust with African-Americans, even as her numbers on trust and honesty have declined overall, according to Clinton aides.\n\nWhile the voters were open to Sanders and liked his economic message, their views shifted after hearing about his plans to replace the Affordable Care Act with a single-payer health care systems and his past opposition to gun control measures, according to Clinton aides.\n\n\u201cHe only started talking about the issues concerning African-Americans in the past 40 days,\u201d said South Carolina state legislative leader Todd Rutherford, who formally endorsed Clinton on Wednesday. \u201cSecretary Clinton has been talking about these issues for the last 40 years.\u201d\n\nWhile Clinton still holds a big lead among party insiders known as superdelegates, who can support the candidate of their choice, the first two contests made clear that Sanders has undermined her once dominant position as the favorite for her party\u2019s nomination.\n\nHer aides believe the next two contests and the primaries that follow in March, where minority voters make up a larger slice of the electorate than in overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire, could essentially decide the race by setting a tone for a campaign that\u2019s likely to evolve into a state-by-state slog for the 2,382 delegates needed to win the nomination.\n\nIn the two days since her New Hampshire loss, Clinton has launched a full-scale press for black voters, unveiling a series of endorsements from top African-American leaders, including the backing of the Congressional Black Caucus\u2019 political action committee on Thursday.\n\nMembers of the group\u2019s board, including Georgia Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights icon, said they would travel to South Carolina to campaign for her.\n\nHer team will also be rolling out the support of 119 black legislators in the March voting states and is pressuring South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, who\u2019s pledged to remain neutral in his state\u2019s contest, to back her candidacy before the Feb. 27 primary.\n\nLater this week, she\u2019ll be endorsed by a group of faith leaders in Flint, Michigan, adding to the 28 ministers and 50 black mayors who\u2019ve already expressed their support for her candidacy.\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton supporters are targeting Sanders\u2019 record on issues like racial equality and criminal justice, even playing down his early support for the civil rights movement as a college student who joined the 1963 March on Washington.\n\n\u201cThousands of people walked on Washington. What are the real policy issues or legislation that he has presented?\u201d said Dr. Hazel Dukes, president of the NAACP\u2019s New York State Conference. \u201cShe\u2019s been there when it matters most.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Clinton will head to rural Bamburg County, South Carolina, a poor, majority-black area of the state to hold a town hall on racial and economic disparities. She\u2019s holding a Monday campaign event in Riviera Beach, Florida, a majority African-American city, before meeting with civil rights leaders on Tuesday and holding a campaign event with the mother of Sandra Bland, the Chicago-area woman whose death in a Texas jail cell has become a rallying cry for criminal justice reform.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton is being dispatched to Memphis, Atlanta and Florence, South Carolina, in the coming days, and the Clintons\u2019 daughter, Chelsea, is heading to majority-black Flint, where the crisis over water has become a symbol of racial and economic inequality.\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign plans to promote his personal story, arguing that his early work as a college civil rights activist and his message of economic equality will help diversify his support. On Wednesday, he held a heavily publicized breakfast with civil rights activist Al Sharpton in Harlem, and Ta-Nehisi Coates, an influential writer on racial issues, said he would vote for Sanders.\n\nBut his team also acknowledges that his constituency may be far stronger in states with less diverse Democratic electorates, like Oklahoma, Minnesota, and Massachusetts \u2013 all states where they launched new ads on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders has an incredibly powerful story to tell,\u201d said adviser Tad Devine. \u201cHis fight for equality and civil rights, his fight against inequality and economic injustice is very, very powerful. It\u2019s going to resonate with the African-American community.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\n\u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
