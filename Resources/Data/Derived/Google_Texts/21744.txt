Conservatives have long complained (not without reason) about how prejudiced and partisan the major news networks are. But perhaps no annual event exposes the depths of this bias more transparently than the March for Life. Hundreds of thousands of pro-lifers showed up this year to defend and lift up their voices for the unborn—facing some unhappy and virulent pro-choice activists along the way. And yet, despite the seriousness of this issue, the major news networks devoted altogether 15 seconds of attention to it.

NewsBusters has the exclusive (emphasis theirs):

On Jan 22, 200,000 people descended on Washington, D.C. for the annual March for Life, commemorating the 57 million babies destroyed since 1973’s Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. Of the three broadcast networks, only CBS mentioned the 2015 March for Life, allotting it just 15 seconds. That’s one second for every 13,000 people who put work and school aside and traveled from as far away as the West Coast. It’s one second for every 3.8 million babies aborted in the last 42 years.
