Tupelo\u2019s unique Major Thoroughfare Program is up for renewal Tuesday, May 3, as city residents head to the polls to vote to renew the program for a sixth time.\n\nSince 1991, this program has widened and improved the city\u2019s major roadways and even built some new ones to alleviate traffic congestion.\n\nWhile I wasn\u2019t here at the time, I often hear people refer to the constant backlog of traffic around parts of the city prior to some of the improvements done through the Major Thoroughfare Program. At that time, Tupelo had been steadily growing. The city absorbed an additional 6,700 residents between 1980 and 1990 \u2013 an increase of 28 percent \u2013 as well as a substantial surge in commercial development.\n\nBut the city\u2019s network of mostly two-lane roads hadn\u2019t changed much over the years, and the extra traffic load threatened to choke various parts of the community.\n\nThe city needed to widen its roads and intersections. But an undertaking that vast would take serious money \u2013 millions of dollars \u2013 and the general fund budget couldn\u2019t support it.\n\nCity leaders got together then and hatched a plan. They formed a committee to compile a list of major thoroughfare needs \u2013 both long and short term \u2013 that eventually totaled $96 million. From that list, city leaders set priorities and established a funding plan. They\u2019d decided to pay for the work through a 10-mill property tax levy tacked onto the city\u2019s existing 19.97 mills.\n\nThe group also decided to appoint an oversight committee to manage the program, later dubbed the Major Thoroughfare Program.\n\nThe tax that drives the funding amounts to $1 for every thousand dollars of assessed property. Somebody with a $100,000 house, for example, pays $100 annually for the program along with regular property taxes. The money is collected each tax season, from December to early February, and deposited into a special account.\n\nAll money raised is spent by the Major Thoroughfare Committee, a 19-member group made up of volunteer citizens appointed by the mayor and City Council to oversee the program.\n\nThe members meet monthly with a project manager, a head engineer and the city\u2019s chief financial officer to monitor the program\u2019s implementation and to plan additional work.\n\nTo determine what work needs to be done with the funds, members consult traffic studies, accident reports and direct feedback from community members.\n\nThe list of possible projects for Phase VI of the program was compiled using a combination of traffic studies estimating the area\u2019s needs in the next 10 to 20 years, as well as significant public involvement, such as responses from 600 public surveys conducted at meetings and online.\n\nPlanned projects for the upcoming phase include items all over the city ranging from adding right-hand turn lanes at certain places on North Gloster Street to alleviate traffic backups from people turning into the shopping centers to widening West Jackson Street between the stretch of Clayton and Robins streets.\n\nThis phase also includes some traffic signal timing and optimization work for the city\u2019s two biggest arterial roadways \u2013 Main and Gloster streets. That project would work to link traffic signals to available fiber optic cable infrastructure and implement signal timing plans.\n\nAnyone who has ever been stopped at, what seems like at times, every single stop light on one of those roads will appreciate this part of the program \u2013 myself included. Phase VI also includes dedicating $5 million of the funds for maintenance of the city\u2019s arterial and major collector roads. These include roadways like Barnes Crossing Road, Cliff Gookin Boulevard and Lawndale Drive, among others, that see a high volume of traffic every day and feed into major thoroughfares in the city.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, not unlike the rest of the program, those funds can\u2019t be moved around or used to improve roadways that aren\u2019t on a predetermined and approved list. Rest assured, those funds won\u2019t be used to improve basic neighborhood streets, which fall under the purview of the city to repair, or the street in front of the home of a committee member or city official.\n\nMaintaining those arterial and collector roads now in order for them to be able to successfully and safely move motorists throughout our city for years to come is and should be a top priority.\n\nThe Major Thoroughfare Program was created with the intent to anticipate and facilitate growth in Tupelo \u2013 undoubtedly one of the major hubs of Northeast Mississippi. The program is unique to Tupelo because many cities across our region and state don\u2019t have such a vehicle to pay for improving the major arteries that keep traffic flowing into, around and out of their cities. Thanks to five successful rounds of phases and numerous roadway improvement projects, Tupelo is a much better place to get around in than it was prior to the program\u2019s creation.\n\nBut the demands of economic growth remain and are just as vital now as they were in 1991 when the program was first created.\n\nIn order for us to continue thriving, our city must be supported by good infrastructure planning that is executed effectively and financed responsibly with significant oversight.\n\nA vote to renew the Major Thoroughfare Program for a sixth time will keep Tupelo on the right course to achieving those goals.\n\nRod Guajardo is editor of the Daily Journal.
