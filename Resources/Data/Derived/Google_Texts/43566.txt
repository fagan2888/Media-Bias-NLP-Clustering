Police on Saturday arrested a third suspect in Thursday’s drive-by shooting in Northglenn.

Fort Collins Police arrested the suspect, a 16-year-old boy, and recovered a handgun, on Saturday evening, according to a Northglenn Police Department release.

“It is unknown at this time if it is the weapon used in the drive-by shooting,” the release said.

The bust follows the arrest of two other suspects on Thursday. They are Filiberto Bustos, 20, and April Alvarado, 18.

Police say the suspects wounded a 19-year-old man as he walked with another near the intersection of Garland Drive and Logan Court.

The occupants of a gold Mercury sports-utility vehicle drove by and opened fire.

Police say the teen, who was taken to a local hospital, was shot in the stomach. The victim remains in the hospital.

The victims ran to the parking lot of the Studio School located across the street at 10604 Grant Drive, where an unrelated person called police.

At 4:15 p.m. on Thursday, police arrested Bustos and Alvarado at the Golden Scoop in connection with the shooting. They also recovered a suspect’s vehicle.

Both are being held at the Adams County Detention Facility. Bustos faces charges including attempted first-degree murder. Alvarado faces an attempted first-degree murder charge.

The shooting does not appear random, police said.
