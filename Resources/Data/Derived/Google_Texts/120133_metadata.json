Grassley says, \u201cMost importantly, it\u2019s a stand that we took in the last couple of elections that once we have a chance to carry out, we ought to carry out what we\u2019d promised the voters we\u2019d do.\u201d\n\nThe Senate is now under Republican control and House Republicans have a broader majority in their chamber. Grassley is confident the repeal of what he calls Obamacare will succeed in the House. \u201cNow, as a practical matter, it will pass the House of Representatives,\u201d Grassley says. \u201cIf we can get over a Democratic filibuster, it will pass the Senate. If we don\u2019t get over a Democratic filibuster, it won\u2019t pass the Senate, but we\u2019re going to bring it up for debate.\u201d\n\nAny effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act will be vetoed by President Obama, who has two more years in office. Grassley says he\u2019d welcome working with the president for, in his words, \u201cfine tuning, or through amendment, change some of the really bad things\u201d in the health care legislation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Radio Iowa", "description": "Many Republicans in the U.S. House say their top priority this year is to repeal the Affordable Care Act, an effort Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley says he\u2019d also support. \u201cThe answer is ye\u2026", "title": "Senator Grassley confident U.S. House will vote to repeal Obamacare", "url": "http://www.radioiowa.com/2015/01/07/senator-grassley-confident-u-s-house-will-vote-to-repeal-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://cdn.radioiowa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Chuck-Grassley.jpg", "height": 579}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-07T15:43:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-07T15:43:43+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.radioiowa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Chuck-Grassley.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfae2\"", "article_summary": "Grassley is confident the repeal of what he calls Obamacare will succeed in the House.\nMany Republicans in the U.S. House say their top priority this year is to repeal the Affordable Care Act, an effort Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley says he\u2019d also support.\n\u201cNow, as a practical matter, it will pass the House of Representatives,\u201d Grassley says.\n\u201cThe answer is yes, because it\u2019s something I voted against,\u201d Grassley says.\n\u201cIf we can get over a Democratic filibuster, it will pass the Senate."}
