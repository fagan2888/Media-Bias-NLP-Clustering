Speeds ranged from 7 to 95 miles per hour during the chase, the release said.\n\nThe suspects were allegedly throwing items out of the vehicle that officials later recovered and believed to be narcotics, the release said.\n\nDeputies used a tire deflation device on the suspect\u2019s vehicle as they were pulling into the Promenade Shops at Centerra. The deputies then took the pair into custody. The suspects were evaluated by medical professionals for minor injuries suffered during the incident.\n\nJessica Padilla was booked into the Larimer County Jail on the following allegations: vehicular eluding, criminal impersonation, unlawful possession of a controlled substance, tampering with physical evidence and six other offenses.\n\nGilbert was booked into jail on suspicion of tampering with physical evidence, criminal impersonation and two warrants he failed to appear for.\n\nThree Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office vehicles were damaged during the chase, but no officers were injured, the release said.\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or @ehernandez", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Two in custody in Larimer County after high speed chase", "title": "Two in custody in Larimer County after high speed chase", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/05/two-in-custody-in-larimer-county-after-high-speed-chase/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-05T14:44:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-05T14:44:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Two people were taken into custody by Larimer County authorities after leading deputies on a high speed chase, officials said Saturday.\nThree Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office vehicles were damaged during the chase, but no officers were injured, the release said.\nJessica Lynn Padilla, 30, and Gilbert Padilla, 40, allegedly provided false information to a Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputy who pulled the two over on 601 SW Frontage Road for allegedly having fake license plates, according a Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office news release.\nDeputies used a tire deflation device on the suspect\u2019s vehicle as they were pulling into the Promenade Shops at Centerra.\nJessica Padilla was booked into the Larimer County Jail on the following allegations: vehicular eluding, criminal impersonation, unlawful possession of a controlled substance, tampering with physical evidence and six other offenses."}
