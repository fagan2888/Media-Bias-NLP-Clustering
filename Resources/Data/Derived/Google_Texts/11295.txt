He holds his license as a Certified Public Accountant and since 1995 has been a fellow member of the American College of Medical Practice Executives. He also serves as a Faculty Associate for the University of Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.

In 1988, Patterson began serving as Teaching Chief for Practice Management at the McLennan County Family Residency Training Program.

In 1984, he began serving as the Secretary and Treasurer for the McLennan County Education and Research Foundation.

“I am really looking forward to becoming fully integrated into the efforts of Community Healthcare Center in serving the primary health care needs of north central Texas. I know I have big shoes to fill in trying to follow Phyllis Hiraki as CEO,” Patterson said.

The Community Healthcare Center was established in 1992 to serve lower-income residents in the Wichita Falls area.
