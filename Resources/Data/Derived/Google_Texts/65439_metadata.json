Brooklyn has gotten so cool these days that it now has its own group of superheroes.\n\nThe original musical \u201cBrooklynite\u201d stars six brand-new crusaders with superpowers protecting the borough, a mysterious substance in an asteroid and a look influenced by the old \u201cBatman\u201d TV show starring Adam West.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s silly and fun. We\u2019re having a blast,\u201d said Tony Award-winning director Michael Mayer, who is helming and co-writing what he calls \u201cthe love child of \u2018Batman\u2019 and \u2018Scooby-Doo.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBrooklynite,\u201d which opens Wednesday off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre, has a 13-member cast, songs by the much-buzzed about composer Peter Lerman and choreography by Steven Hoggett, who has enlivened such shows as \u201cOnce\u201d and \u201cThe Last Ship.\u201d\n\nThe plot will have elements familiar to any avid comic book reader: An asteroid hits Brooklyn and releases gamma rays of a substance called Brooklynite, which gives superpowers to anyone nearby the crash site.\n\nSix people get various doses of the stuff, including a short order cook who develops the power of fire, a bike messenger who becomes the fastest man alive and a marine biologist who then controls water.\n\nThe woman closest to the asteroid becomes the powerful superhero Astrolass, while the one farthest from the crash site - an unemployed gamer called Angelo - gets only a little bit of a superpower: really good parking karma.\n\nWhy are there only a half-dozen crusaders in the show? \u201cWe can only afford to have six superheroes. This is off-Broadway,\u201d said Mayer, whose other works include \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d and \u201cHedwig and the Angry Inch.\u201d\n\nAstrolass, who helps make Brooklyn safe and hip, soon grows tired of constantly being on call and hopes to hang up her cape. A love story with her and a hardware store clerk develops but there is also a villain who hopes to lay waste to Brooklyn.\n\n\u201cThrough all the color and comedy and silliness, the message really is to be yourself,\u201d said Nick Cordero, the Tony-nominated star of \u201cBullets Over Broadway\u201d who stars in the new show. \u201cLet your freak flag fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrooklynite\u201d has as complicated an origin story as the plot itself. Producer Amanda Lipitz was originally inspired by the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company, which, in reality, is a tutoring center for kids in the Park Slope section of the borough.\n\nLipitz and Mayer developed an early idea for the show featuring tutors with author Michael Chabon (\u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\u201d) and his wife, Ayelet Waldman. But what they came up with was, in Mayer\u2019s words, \u201cvery after-school special.\u201d\n\nSo Mayer, Chabon and Waldman switched gears and created the colorful superhero characters. Mayer then connected with Lerman, a Jonathan Larson Award winner and composer for \u201cModern Family.\u201d The two men tried to hire a playwright but none got their daffy, idiosyncratic point of view so they went ahead and wrote their own script and songs.\n\nThe show sounds like \u201cindie rock, slightly retro with a contemporary feeling,\u201d Mayer said. The music is very influenced by TV classic superhero theme songs, including the animated shows \u201cSuperman,\u201d \u201dSpeed Racer\u201d and \u201cMighty Mouse.\u201d\n\nThe show also gently goofs on the real Brooklyn, which has lately become the hippest part of the city. There are jokes about artisanal taco bars, smug artist collectives and, of course, facial hair.\n\nMayer lived in several Brooklyn neighborhoods for many years and recalls the days before it became so fun and cool. He was twice mugged - once at gunpoint - in the 1980s and now lives in Manhattan.\n\nIf he could pick his own superpower, Mayer doesn\u2019t hesitate. It\u2019s not invisibility or the power to fly or bend steel. It\u2019s simply to commute faster.\n\n\u201cNot a day goes by that I don\u2019t wish I could teleport,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always late. I feel like, for me, that would be the superpower I would have. I really do think about it. For real. Long before this. I was like, \u2018Couldn\u2019t I just get there now?\u2019\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline: http://www.vineyardtheatre.org\n\n___\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits", "article_metadata": {"description": "Move aside, Gotham.
