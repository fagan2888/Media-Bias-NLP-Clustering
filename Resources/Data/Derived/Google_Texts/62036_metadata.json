Things like knowing Oklahoma City is going to be devastating on the fast break.\n\nThe trick is to limit what Oklahoma City does well as much as you can. If not, you\u2019ll get blown out of Chesapeake Energy Arena, as happened to the Nuggets here Sunday night, 117-93.\n\nRed flags about how the Nuggets were playing began early. The Thunder opened up a huge rebounding edge. The Nuggets struggled to get up good shots. They couldn\u2019t get out in the open court to get easy buckets and alleviate some of the defensive pressure. And the Nuggets weren\u2019t able to capitalize on the few turnovers they forced.\n\nDespite all that went wrong the Nuggets were only down eight points at halftime.\n\nBut, at the start of the third quarter, Oklahoma City, which debuted their orange \u2018Sunset\u2019 uniforms, turned the lights out. It sprinted out on an 18-4 run and were never challenged the rest of the way.\n\n\u201cThe third quarter is where we lost the game,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cWe were in it, we were competing. But the third quarter, they just turned it into a blowout pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nSaid rookie guard Emmanuel Mudiay: \u201cWe didn\u2019t come out ready to play in the second half. We were just being too selfish with the ball, one-on-one basketball. That\u2019s not going to cut it.\u201d\n\nOn top of all that was going wrong, the Nuggets lost starting center Joffrey Lauvergne in the third quarter. He aggravated a strained lower back and did not return.\n\nLauvergne was one of the few players who was finding consistent success. He had 11 points, seven rebounds and three assists in 20 minutes. The Nuggets lost reserve big man Nikola Jokic in the fourth to a lower right back strain. Both Jokic and Lauvergne will be evaluated on Monday.\n\nThe Nuggets starting five struggled throughout. Danilo Gallinari scored nine points in the first quarter but just six more in the final three quarters and was 3-of-13 from the field. No other starter outside of Lauvergne and Gallinari were in double figures by the time the game was out of hand. Mudiay had six points on 3-of-14 shooting.\n\nDurant led five Oklahoma City players in double figures with 25 points. Westbrook flirted with a triple-double before settling for15 points, nine rebounds and eight assists.\n\n\u201cWe just have to go out and be more aggressive,\u201d Nuggets forward Darrell Arthur said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take care of the basketball, take care of the paint and play inside out.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Nuggets get blown out by Oklahoma City Thunder", "title": "Denver Nuggets get blown out by Oklahoma City Thunder", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/01/denver-nuggets-get-blown-out-by-oklahoma-city-thunder/", "image": {"width": 653, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151101__nuggets-fariedp1.jpg", "height": 491}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151101__nuggets-fariedp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-01T19:24:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:13:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 There are things that you want to do against Oklahoma City, then there are things you\u2019re just going to have to accept when playing the Thunder.\nBut, at the start of the third quarter, Oklahoma City, which debuted their orange \u2018Sunset\u2019 uniforms, turned the lights out.\nThe trick is to limit what Oklahoma City does well as much as you can.\nThe Nuggets lost reserve big man Nikola Jokic in the fourth to a lower right back strain.\nThings like knowing Oklahoma City is going to be devastating on the fast break."}
