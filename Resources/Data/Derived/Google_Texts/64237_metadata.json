Most human beings have an instinct towards fairness. My idea of fairness may be a redistribution of the wealth and the workers owning the means of production. Your idea of fairness may be a free market \u201csink or swim\u201d type situation, or somewhere in between.\n\nWhen we talk about birth control or abortion, it\u2019s the same thing. Tea Party Sen. Mike Lee (R-Your Junk) argued on Monday that it wasn\u2019t fair for people to expect Hobby Lobby to \u201cpay\u201d for a woman\u2019s \u201crecreational activities.\u201d This is how many people see birth control. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice,\u201d they think, \u201cif these women could just keep their damn legs closed?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a question that has been asked many times, by many cultures and groups of people men\u2013and many of them have come up their own creative solutions. For instance, women in Ireland (and America) who were deemed \u201cfallen\u201d were sent to live in abusive Magdalene Laundries and convents run by nuns. In some cultures, women are beheaded. In others, they cut off a woman\u2019s clitoris to prevent her from feeling anything but horrible pain during intercourse. In some, they even sew her up until she\u2019s married. Women have been and still are sold into arranged marriages.\n\nHere in America, today, we send them off to purity balls. We teach abstinence-only sex education classes in public schools. All with the same goal in mind as the other solutions\u2013to prevent women from having recreational sex. The idea of women having recreational sex is beyond enraging to some people\u2013so much so that they very much do believe that she needs to be punished for it. With a child.\n\nKeep in mind, the \u201cpain of childbirth\u201d was supposed to be one of the ways women atoned for Eve\u2019s sin in the Garden of Eden. This is a thing a large part of our country very much believes in. If you look at it this way, you might think that women avoiding pregnancy are like criminals avoiding sentencing.\n\nThere\u2019s not the same kind of seething rage surrounding the idea of men having sex for recreational reasons. Medicare covers Viagra and penis pumps, and no one except angry feminists like me bats an eyelash. This is because most cultures believe that women are supposed to be the ones in charge of keeping men chaste. Failure to do so is a violation of the social contract- a failure on the part of the woman, not the man.\n\nThe debates surrounding free birth control and safe and legal abortions\u2013on a gut level\u2013are often much less about precious fetuses than they are about the idea of consequence-free recreational sex\u2013which many people see as an avoidance of \u201cpersonal responsibility.\u201d They also, quite honestly, have to do with the fact that widely available birth control and safe and legal abortions have been the biggest factor in women\u2019s liberation. When we got birth control, they lost \u201cwoman control.\u201d\n\nWe had a comment sometime last week, not unlike many other comments I\u2019ve seen in the past, from a fella who thought of abortion as a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card. Who thought that it wasn\u2019t fair for women to refuse to live with the \u201cconsequences of their actions.\u201d You know, \u201cif you do the crime, you have to do the time\u201d\u2013the crime, in this case, being recreational sex, and the time being giving up your life and your dreams to have a child. Which I\u2019m pretty sure is less \u201ctime\u201d than for some instances of homicide.\n\nThis mode of thinking is a large part of the reason why some people who are opposed to abortion in other circumstances, will make an exception for rape. Because, you know, in that case, the woman wasn\u2019t necessarily committing a sin herself\n\nWhat I want to know, though\u2013is who is it that wins in this scenario, where we imagine children as some kind of just retribution? I mean like, in actual reality. Not in some weird made up utopian universe the Christian Right has pipe dreamed up. Not in a schadenfreude or \u201csense of justice\u201d sense.\n\nIt\u2019s not the women, for sure. Duh.\n\nIt\u2019s not the kid who\u2019s being raised, possibly, by someone who doesn\u2019t want him or her and can\u2019t necessarily afford to take care of them. Who has to grow up being someone else\u2019s \u201cjust retribution.\u201d Even if you firmly believe that children are a just punishment for women who have engaged in the sin of recreational sex, why should the kid be the one to bear that burden? Don\u2019t we already have enough kids in shitty situations? Why do you want more? What is it that you are you getting out of that?\n\nChildren aren\u2019t \u201cconsequences\u201d of failed morality\u2013 they\u2019re human beings. Who deserve to have all the love and care it is possible to give them. In a million years, I would not have a kid if I weren\u2019t prepared to love and take care of that child\u2013not because I\u2019m some evil selfish bitch, but for precisely the opposite reason.\n\nIt\u2019s not society. The same people who scream and cry about how birth control and abortion are bad are the exact same people who don\u2019t want to do shit for them the second they\u2019re out of the womb. The people who fiercely loathe and condemn \u201cwelfare mothers\u201d and gasp in horror at the idea of universal daycare or preschool. In the years since Roe v. Wade, there has been a drastic reduction in crime. Why? Because children who grow up unwanted are a lot more likely to commit crimes than kids born into a loving family.\n\nAs much as the idea of bad sex-having women being punished with children may make you \u201cfeel good\u201d or \u201cfeel like there is a sense of justice in the world\u201d there is literally no one this works out well for. It shouldn\u2019t be about you or your schadenfreude or your weird god who is still mad at a lady for eating an apple one time. Sure, you can imagine a scenario where a bad sex-having woman is \u201cpunished\u201d with a child and learns the error of her ways through hard work and sacrifice and then goes on to be a \u201cscared straight\u201d type example for young women to whom she will teach the important lesson of not having recreational sex, and then they will totally keep their legs closed until their husband says they can open them. But seriously\u2013how often do you think that is actually going to happen?\n\nIn fact, our society ought to have an invested interest in preventing unwanted pregnancies. In real ways, not in the dumb \u201cWELL THEN JUST DON\u2019T HAVE SEX\u201d ways. This is why the Affordable Care Act was designed to provide women with free birth control. It\u2019s not only women\u2019s our best interest as human beings (if we count as that anymore), but in society\u2019s best interest as a whole. We\u2019re better off with every child being wanted. We\u2019re better off with allowing people to wait to have children until they can adequately support them and give them a good life.\n\nIf you want to talk about \u201cpersonal responsibility,\u201d fine. So will I. I don\u2019t think \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d means having a child you don\u2019t want and can\u2019t afford to take care of. I think kids deserve more than that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s responsible for a country to just cross their fingers and hope that women will just give up and say \u201cFine, we just won\u2019t have sex anymore. Happy?\u201d Because unless you\u2019re going to sew our vaginas shut until we\u2019re married, there is not a chance in hell of that happening. Sorry. You have to deal with the reality you have, not the reality you want. For thousands of years, society has been trying to figure out how to prevent women from having sex society doesn\u2019t want them to have. It hasn\u2019t worked. It\u2019s not going to work. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nIn the long run, it doesn\u2019t matter if\u2013as Sen. Mike Lee thinks\u2013we are expecting society to \u201cfund\u201d our \u201crecreational activities.\u201d What matters is what\u2019s best for everyone in the long run, and what actually works. What\u2019s best for women, what\u2019s best for children, what\u2019s best for society. I\u2019d rather pay for someone\u2019s \u201crecreational activities\u201d than pay for the actual cost of raising a child. I\u2019d rather pay for \u201crecreational activities\u201d than have another unwanted kid in this world. And I\u2019d certainly rather pay for women\u2019s birth control than men\u2019s Viagra and penis pumps.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Children aren't \"consequences\" of failed morality--they're human beings.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "Children aren\u2019t \u201cconsequences\u201d of failed morality\u2013they\u2019re human beings.", "title": "Who is it that wins when we think of babies as \u2018just retribution\u2019 for recreational sex?", "url": "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/223895/who-is-it-that-wins-when-we-think-of-babies-as-just-retribution-for-recreational-sex/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2014/07/pregnant.woman_.birth_.rates_.us_.depopulation_theusindependent-e1404231411273.jpg", "height": 425}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Children aren\u2019t \u201cconsequences\u201d of failed morality\u2013they\u2019re human beings.", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 119986914707220}, "keywords": "abortion,birth control,mike lee,recreational sex,news", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-01T12:45:35Z", "modified_time": "2014-07-01T16:10:27Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea6d\"", "article_summary": "All with the same goal in mind as the other solutions\u2013to prevent women from having recreational sex.\nThere\u2019s not the same kind of seething rage surrounding the idea of men having sex for recreational reasons.\nFor thousands of years, society has been trying to figure out how to prevent women from having sex society doesn\u2019t want them to have.\nThe idea of women having recreational sex is beyond enraging to some people\u2013so much so that they very much do believe that she needs to be punished for it.\nSo will I.
