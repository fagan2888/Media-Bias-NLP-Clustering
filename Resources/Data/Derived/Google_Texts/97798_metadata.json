What\u2019s even more ridiculous is that this bill would have repealed Obamacare, in case you were wondering what Restoring American\u2019s Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation meant. This is truly a mind-boggling feat, considering this marks the fiftieth-plus time that Congress has attempted to repeal Obamacare.\n\nHow could this happen? Congress is clearly firing on all cylinders \u2013 they\u2019ve already put a bill on the president\u2019s desk this year!\u2026 If there were ever a time for a heartfelt \u201cThanks, Obama,\u201d this is it. Honestly, I don\u2019t know how it is that we don\u2019t have a healthcare system that actively hurts patients at this point. Restore my healthcare freedom, dammit!\n\nWell, for better or worse, it happened: Obama vetoed an Obamacare repeal act. Who woulda thunk? But what does this mean for future repeal attempts? Is this still going to be a once in-a-blue-moon sort of thing, where Congress tries to repeal the same law 50+ times before finally passing a new bill? Couldn\u2019t it just schedule a standing meeting, like, once a year for the president to veto its bill and just cut out the 535 middlemen? I guess at this rate, we would only need Congress twice a year or so. Now that\u2019s an efficient use of tax dollars, if you ask me.\n\nOr has this last big push finally garnered enough public attention to get steam next time, and has it done it so much that it\u2019s influencing swing votes in the 2016 presidential election?\n\nWe don\u2019t see a way that a Republican president wouldn\u2019t repeal Obamacare \u2013 and as ridiculous as that sounds, is it really that much crazier than the current state of Congress?\n\nIt certainly wouldn\u2019t be the first time that a tight Democratic primary aided a Republican candidate in the general election. And if you think Donald Trump is just too dumb for the job, keep in mind we re-elected George W. Bush after we \u201cmisunderestimated him.\u201d\n\nWhether Obama prolonged the inevitable or not, why is Congress so polarized \u2013 or dense \u2013 that it sent an Obamacare repeal to Obama, after he had promised, multiple times, to veto any such bill?", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "What\u2019s even more ridiculous is that this bill would have repealed Obamacare, in case you were wondering what Restoring American\u2019s Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation meant.\nThis is truly a mind-boggling feat, considering this marks the fiftieth-plus time that Congress has attempted to repeal Obamacare.\nhamster!\u201d exclaimed literally every member of Congress on Jan. 8, after President Obama vetoed the Restoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act.\nWell, for better or worse, it happened: Obama vetoed an Obamacare repeal act.\nWe don\u2019t see a way that a Republican president wouldn\u2019t repeal Obamacare \u2013 and as ridiculous as that sounds, is it really that much crazier than the current state of Congress?"}
