Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, has defended her use of social media for town halls as a better way to keep in touch with constituents.\n\nBut during a recent town hall on her official Facebook page, the senator appeared to skip over a question about Obamacare inflating health insurance costs for students.\n\nThat begs the question: Are virtual town halls a way for politicians to dodge the tough issues?\n\nThe North Dakota State University student who asked the question said Heitkamp likely wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that if the event had been held in person.\n\n\u201cI had hoped that she would at least acknowledge my questions and maybe say something along the lines of \u2018we\u2019re looking at how to fix the issue\u2019. But to ignore my question was ridiculous,\u201d finance major Bryce Heustis told Watchdog via email after the event. \u201cI was not satisfied that she cherry picked questions. She even replied to people who didn\u2019t ask a question and just said \u2018no question, but I love the job you\u2019re doing as senator\u2019 or something along the lines of that. It is very unprofessional and unstatesman to ignore the tough questions.\u201d\n\nHeitkamp promoted this latest Facebook event as a venue for questions about college affordability and student-loan debt.\n\nHeustis\u2019 question concerned the cost of his health insurance. He told the senator Obamacare had cost him $61 per month in a plan he purchased through a program sponsored by NDSU and that he\u2019s since replaced it with a more costly $161-per-month plan.\n\n\u201cWhat changes do you support to the \u2018Affordable Care Act\u2019 that will help lower the costs of healthcare for thousands of college students across North Dakota who are on the NDUS healthcare plan?\u201d he asked.\n\nHeustis said he submitted his question in plenty of time to get an answer.\n\nWatchdog captured a screenshot of the Facebook thread. In it, Heitkamp appears to answer questions submitted both before and after Heustis\u2019, sometimes responding to questions from the same person more than once, but the question about Obamacare didn\u2019t get a response.\n\nThis latest social media town hall comes amid an ongoing statewide debate over how politicians should communicate with voters.\n\nHeitkamp falls in the middle between extremes set by the two Republican members of North Dakota\u2019s congressional delegation when it comes to holding town hall events.\n\nU.S. Sen. John Hoeven has held just one town hall event since being elected in 2010. The event was sponsored by the North Dakota Chamber of Commerce with the group requiring an admission fee to get in.\n\nU.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer, on the other hand, has held dozens of in-person town halls in communities across the state. He\u2019s also held social media town halls on Facebook and Twitter and appears weekly on the What\u2019s On Your Mind talk radio show, which is broadcast to radio stations in Bismarck, Minot, Fargo, Dickinson and Tioga.\n\nHeitkamp previously has claimed she goes to great lengths to connect with constituents via social media, events she says are superior for that goal than in-person events.\n\n\u201cI think that social media is more accessible for the average North Dakotan,\u201d she told the Minot Daily News in February.\n\nShe also told the newspaper the biggest challenge with social media town halls \u201cwas keeping up with the questions as they came in,\u201d claiming she used two typists to input responses at a previous Facebook event.\n\nDuring the Facebook event Heitkamp held Wednesday, there were 37 comments and questions posted. Heitkamp responded to 22. A picture posted with the question and answer thread showed Heitkamp sitting by herself at a laptop. A request for comment sent to Heitkamp spokesman Todd Deutsch, including a question about the use of typists to respond to questions during Wednesday night\u2019s event, has gone unanswered.\n\nMany of Heitkamp\u2019s responses were short, consisting of just a sentence or an Internet link.\n\nContact Rob Port at rport@watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Senator Heidi Heitkamp has touted social media as an effective way to connect with constituents but skipped a tough question about Obamacare.", "title": "Senator dodges Obamacare question during Facebook town hall - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/05/heitkampfacebookphoto.png", "updated_time": "2014-05-22T11:52:25+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/146079/heidi-heitkamp-facebook/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "Facebook,Heidi Heitkamp,North Dakota,ObamaCare,town halls", "published_time": "2014-05-22T11:49:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-22T11:52:25+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Senator Heidi Heitkamp has touted social media as an effective way to connect with constituents but skipped a tough question about Obamacare.", "title": "Senator dodges Obamacare question during Facebook town hall - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/05/heitkampfacebookphoto.png"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Senator Heidi Heitkamp has touted social media as an effective way to connect with constituents but skipped a tough question about Obamacare."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd43b0\"", "article_summary": "This latest social media town hall comes amid an ongoing statewide debate over how politicians should communicate with voters.\nBut during a recent town hall on her official Facebook page, the senator appeared to skip over a question about Obamacare inflating health insurance costs for students.\nDuring the Facebook event Heitkamp held Wednesday, there were 37 comments and questions posted.\nThat begs the question: Are virtual town halls a way for politicians to dodge the tough issues?\n\u201cI think that social media is more accessible for the average North Dakotan,\u201d she told the Minot Daily News in February."}
