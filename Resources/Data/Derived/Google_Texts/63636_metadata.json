James Clayborne, of Downstate Belleville, has endorsed the former secretary of state. Clayborne is the Illinois Senate majority leader and also a member of the Democratic National Committee, which makes him a superdelegate to the national nominating convention in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cAfter careful consideration, it\u2019s become clear to me that no other candidate will fight harder to advance the interests of my constituents and break down the barriers that hold them back than Hillary Clinton,\u201d Clayborne said in a statement.\n\nClinton so far has amassed 1,052 delegates and superdelegates to 427 for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to a New York Times estimate. A total of 2,383 is needed to secure the Democratic nomination.\n\nSanders is scheduled to speak Friday at a rally at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, near St. Louis. The Missouri primary is March 15, the same day as the Illinois primary. (Rick Pearson)\n\nWhat's on tap\n\n*Mayor Rahm Emanuel has no public schedule.\n\n*Gov.
