Studies are inconsistent, yet seem to show that 2,300 to 3,000 milligrams a day is most desirable.\n\nIt is widely believed that too much salt can increase blood pressure. But the myth that the lower the sodium the better is just that: a myth.\n\nIn 2013, the Institute of Medicine reviewed 34 studies concerning sodium. \u201cThere\u2019s no data \u2014 none \u2014 showing that curtailing sodium intake below 2,300 milligrams provides better health outcomes,\u201d Brian Strom, who chaired the review and resulting report, said at the time. One study tracked 28,880 individuals with heart disease or diabetes and found that those who consumed less than 2,000 milligrams of sodium a day were 37 percent more likely to die of heart disease than those who consumed 4,000 to 6,000 milligrams.\n\nIf you believe you need to limit your sodium, start by limiting your processed foods. More than 75 percent of the sodium Americans consume comes from processed foods. This is not surprising, since refined salt is both a preservative and a flavor enhancer.\n\n\u2014 Casey Seidenberg, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/05/iStock_000050740978_Large.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Q: How much salt does a person need each day?\nIf you believe you need to limit your sodium, start by limiting your processed foods.\nMore than 75 percent of the sodium Americans consume comes from processed foods.\nStudies are inconsistent, yet seem to show that 2,300 to 3,000 milligrams a day is most desirable.\nThis is not surprising, since refined salt is both a preservative and a flavor enhancer."}
