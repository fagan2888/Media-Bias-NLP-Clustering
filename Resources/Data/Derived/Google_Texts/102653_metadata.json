And a press conference held Friday by Jeff McIntyre, president of the West Virginia American Water Co., which provides most of the area\u2019s household water, provided few answers. Officials still don\u2019t know when the leak started, how much of the chemical spilled into the Elk River or when the water will be safe to drink again.\n\nThey also don\u2019t know much about the chemical that spilled: 4-Methylcyclohexane Methanol, or MCHM. According to the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection, MCHM is used in coal preparation plants to wash coal of impurities. But McIntyre was at a loss to explain more, saying only, \u201cthis not a chemical that\u2019s typical to be in water treatment process.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working for 25 years on water-related issues, and this is the first I\u2019ve heard of this chemical,\u201d Paul Ziemkiewicz, director of the West Virginia Water Research Institute, told Salon. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that its use is unprecedented, he said, but it does mean that there\u2019s little safety information available.\n\nMCHM is classified as an irritant, and isn\u2019t considered toxic unless consumed orally. Some studies have shown that chronic exposure to the chemical can cause serious health problems, but it\u2019s not expected to remain in the water long enough for that to be a concern. Still, Ziemkiewicz said, \u201cI think the state has been prudent in advising people not to drink it or bathe in it. You don\u2019t want to get it in your eyes or breathe it in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Authorities aren't sure how much of the chemical spilled or when water will be safe to drink again", "title": "Little is known about the chemical contaminating West Virginia\u2019s tap water", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/10/little_is_known_about_the_chemical_contaminating_west_virginias_tap_water/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "Authorities aren't sure how much of the chemical spilled or when water will be safe to drink again", "title": "Little is known about the chemical contaminating West Virginia\u2019s tap water"}, "twitter": {"description": "Authorities aren't sure how much of the chemical spilled or when water will be safe to drink again", "title": "Little is known about the chemical contaminating West Virginia\u2019s tap water", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@readingirl"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, chemical spill, water safety, West Virginia", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe11c5\"", "article_summary": "Topics: chemical spill, water safety, West Virginia, Sustainability News, NewsHundreds of thousands of West Virginians across nine counties are without tap water following a chemical leak that occurred upstream of the state\u2019s largest water treatment facility.\nAnd a press conference held Friday by Jeff McIntyre, president of the West Virginia American Water Co., which provides most of the area\u2019s household water, provided few answers.\nOfficials still don\u2019t know when the leak started, how much of the chemical spilled into the Elk River or when the water will be safe to drink again.\nThey also don\u2019t know much about the chemical that spilled: 4-Methylcyclohexane Methanol, or MCHM.\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that its use is unprecedented, he said, but it does mean that there\u2019s little safety information available."}
