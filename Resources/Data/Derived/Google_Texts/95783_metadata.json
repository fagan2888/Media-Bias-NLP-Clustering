They will say 'Well, we're taking steps. We are protecting people's information. But that is just not true.\"\n\nThe Government Accountability Office reports between 2006 and 2014, the number of threats or attacks to our federal information system has gone up by more than a thousand percent.\n\nThis report shows the most recent hacks compromising our personal information, starting with the IRS in June 2015.\n\nTaxpayers birthdates, social security numbers and addresses have been accessed from almost 400,000 tax accounts.\n\nWe've already seen two breaches at the Office of Personnel Management starting in June 2015.\n\nAltogether, more than 25 million Americans' personal information have been stolen from this one agency within two months.\n\nAccording to Congressman Blackburn, these cyber attacks for that one agency cost the federal government about $350 million dollars.\n\n\"That is taxpayer money out of your pocket that had to be used to clean up a mistake that they've already gotten the money for so that there wouldn't be a problem. And guess what, they're using the money for other things.\"\n\nMore than a billion of our tax dollars have been spent beefing up our nation's cyber security since 2009.\n\nThat spending is expected to jump to nearly $6 billion by 2018.\n\nA January 2016 Government Accountability Office report calls out almost all of 23 federal agencies for not protecting our information.\n\nJust five agencies are using prevention services.\n\nOnly one of them is fully implementing intrusion prevention for its email though they're all taking our money to do so.\n\nWith every day, the amount of information obtained and held by the federal government grows.\n\nNashville Computer Guru Victor O'Rourke says, \"We just have a lot of information that's vulnerable and it keeps on growing. And without us attacking it, we're gonna get attacked.\"\n\nVeterans Affairs, national intelligence and the postal service have all been breached in recent months.\n\nAnd there have been more than 300 attempts to hack healthcare.gov in the past year.\n\nLogicForce Consultant Jim KempVanEe says, \"Once those people have that information that it's out there, they really -- they own you.\"\n\nKempVanEe says the only way to really protect yourself is with strong passwords.\n\nChange those passwords often and make them things that no one could easily learn about you.\n\nMeanwhile, the GAO continues to investigate these government agencies and has found these attacks not only becoming more common but also more damaging and disruptive.\n\nCongressman Blackburn, who serves on the Privacy and Data Security Task Force, says there is legislation she hopes to get passed this year requiring these agencies to keep our information safe.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- It's the information that can make or break us: our birth date, where we live and our social security number.It's kept on file by the federal government through the IRS, Department of Homeland Security and in health documents through th", "title": "Billions of your cyber-security tax dollars wasted", "og": {"site_name": "WZTV", "description": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- It's the information that can make or break us: our birth date, where we live and our social security number.It's kept on file by the federal government through the IRS, Department of Homeland Security and in health documents through th", "title": "Billions of your cyber-security tax dollars wasted", "url": "http://fox17.com/news/local/millions-of-your-cyber-security-tax-dollars-wasted", "image": "http://static-12.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/78098a3a-3bea-42ea-a1bd-c23dcec92b2f-large16x9_CYBERSECURITY.jpg?1461983387587", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@foxnashville", "image": "http://static-11.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/78098a3a-3bea-42ea-a1bd-c23dcec92b2f-large16x9_CYBERSECURITY.jpg?1461983387587", "description": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- It's the information that can make or break us: our birth date, where we live and our social security number.It's kept on file by the federal government through the IRS, Department of Homeland Security and in health documents through th", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Billions of your cyber-security tax dollars wasted"}, "author": "Sinclair Broadcast Group", "blitz": "mu-cc36119f-f4dca522-3261b206-4b3bbd3f", "robots": "index, follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 212542299079163}, "keywords": "news,local,TN", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/foxnashville/", "published_time": "2016-04-29T22:29:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=0.5"}, "article_summary": "More than a billion of our tax dollars have been spent beefing up our nation's cyber security since 2009.\nA January 2016 Government Accountability Office report calls out almost all of 23 federal agencies for not protecting our information.\nAccording to Congressman Blackburn, these cyber attacks for that one agency cost the federal government about $350 million dollars.\nAnd guess what, they're using the money for other things.\"\nOne of the most targeted systems in the world, the federal government's network, is now considered at \"high risk.\""}
