Rosser Motorsports

Rosser Motorsports is a family owned and operated Waynesboro Virginia used car dealer. When you call us or come onto our lot you’ll be greeted by Lee, the owner, to help you find vehicle that fits your needs. Lee has over 16 years of experience buying and selling cars and has been a licensed used car dealer in Waynesboro since 2012. Lee is a knowledgeable “car guy” who knows the features, performance and vehicle history of the cars he sells. You won’t find that at the large franchise dealers and at the corporate “Max” retail car stores. The inventory at Rosser Motorsports is always changing and will often have vehicles from Honda, Toyota, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Scion and Kia.Buyers who have worked with Lee appreciate his straight forward and honest style. You will get top dollar for your trade on any vehicle we sell. Lee makes car-buying easy with our GUARANTEED CREDIT APPROVAL! You can drive away with peace of mind because Rosser Motorsports offers extended warranty coverage through ASC WARRANTY that’s honored anywhere in the USA or Canada. Rosser Motorsports is conveniently located off of Interstate 64 at Exit 94, right beside the Cracker Barrel.
