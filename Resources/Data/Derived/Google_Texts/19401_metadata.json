Bush\u2019s rating at the same point of his presidency..Making matters even worse, it\u2019s believed Democrats will face an uphill battle in the 2014 mid-term elections, and the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAs previously reported by The Inquisitr, a Paxil SNL skit mocked President Obama and Obamacare by claiming he needed to take drugs in order to bring Republican-like performance back for Obama\u2019s second term in office. Even the CMAs roasted Obamacare because of the slow Healthcare.gov website and all the myriad problems the Affordable Care Act is causing.\n\nThe Obama approval rating has fallen to 42 percent in a new ABC News, Washington Post poll, although previous polls had President Obama at only 37 percent in October. In contrast, George W. Bush\u2019s approval rating stood at 49 percent near the beginning of his second term in office. But America\u2019s current opinion of Bush is getting even better as time progresses:\n\n\u201cAmericans\u2019 opinions of George W. Bush have improved with the passage of time, and now the public\u2019s ratings of the former president tilt positive. Bush left office with decidedly negative favorability ratings as well as approval ratings, so the recovery in his image is notable.\u201d\n\nAs a comparison, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton all exceeded a 60 percent approval rating when last measured.\n\nUnfortunately, President Obama\u2019s disapproval rating also set a new record, with 55 percent disliking Obama and 70 percent saying the \u201ccountry\u2019s headed seriously off on the wrong track.\u201d He also isn\u2019t considered a strong leader, is said to not understand average Americans, and is not considered trustworthy. But, as might be expected, 84 percent of Democrats still approve of President Obama\u2019s performance.\n\nMuch of the decline in the Obama approval rating can be blamed on the botched implementation of the Affordable Care Act. President Obama apologized for Obamacare causing approximately 15 million people to lose their health insurance plans. And then several weeks later, Obama offered an Obamacare \u201cfix\u201d that supposedly allowed people keep their plans, but 71 percent of Americans still oppose the individual mandate.\n\nThe numbers surrounding the Obama approval rating will also cause trouble for Democrats in upcoming elections. Any person up for re-election in 2014 who has favored Obamacare in the past has a 37 percent chance of being opposed, compared to 21 percent odds of being supported. 45 percent of American also consider Obama \u201ctoo liberal\u201d and 46 percent say the same for the Democratic Party as a whole.\n\nDo you think George W. Bush was actually a better president than the current President, based upon the Obama approval rating?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama approval rating has plummeted even further because of Obamacare, and is now lower than George W.
