That's what health care is about, and it's why our biggest health care institutions are granted charity status.\u201d\n\nUPMC officials declined to comment.\n\nPittsburgh officials have highlighted executive compensation as one of the reasons they believe UPMC should be stripped of its nonprofit status. A lawsuit filed last year by former Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, which continues under Mayor Bill Peduto, challenged UPMC's property and payroll tax exemptions, and said the system does not meet the criteria as a purely public charity under state law.\n\nPeduto spokesman Tim McNulty declined to comment.\n\nThe federal government requires tax-exempt organizations such as UPMC to file public tax returns. The filings disclosed on Friday cover the financial year that ran from July 1, 2012, to June 30, 2013. Compensation figures for top-paid employees are for the 2012 calendar year.\n\nIn the past, UPMC officials have justified Romoff's pay by citing the size and complexity of the health system he runs. It owns 21 hospitals, employs 3,500 doctors and has an insurance division with more than 2.3 million members.\n\nUPMC is ranked in the top 10 by U.S. News & World Report as one the nation's best hospitals.\n\nIt is financially successful. In fiscal year 2013, UPMC earned $140 million from operations on total revenue of $10.2 billion. Its net income that year was $359 million.\n\nRomoff has been leading UPMC through a turbulent fight with Highmark Inc., the state's largest health insurer, since 2011 that will culminate at the end of this year when most UPMC facilities and doctors become out-of-network for Highmark insurance subscribers. And Romoff is leading UPMC through the implementation of federal health reform under the Affordable Care Act, the single biggest change to the medical industry in decades.\n\nThe CEOs of large urban teaching hospitals such as UPMC had a median salary of $1.7 million in 2009, according to the Harvard study. The median pay of all nonprofit hospital CEOs was less than $600,000 that year.\n\nRomoff was ranked as the third-highest paid CEO among the nation's largest nonprofit hospital systems in 2011, according to Kaiser Health News. His compensation was more than twice that of the CEOs of Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic \u2014 hospital systems in U.S. News & World Report's top 10 list.\n\nBy comparison, Highmark Inc., the state's largest health insurer and the owner of Pittsburgh's second-largest health system, paid CEO William Winkenwerder $4.3 million in 2013, his first full year on the job. The insurer paid nine other executives more than $1 million each.\n\nWest Penn Allegheny Health System, which Highmark bought last year and made the core of its Allegheny Health Network, paid former CEO Christopher Olivia $1.9 million in 2012, including $1.25 million in severance, according to tax documents released on Thursday. Olivia resigned in 2011. The system paid one other executive and seven doctors $1 million or more in 2012.\n\nAlex Nixon is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
