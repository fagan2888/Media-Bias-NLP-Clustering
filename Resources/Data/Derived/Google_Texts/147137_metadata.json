With fellow senior Garrett Grayson hitting his first 13 passes of the game and ultimately throwing for 390 yards and five touchdowns, the Rams improved to 7-1 and remained in contention for a Mountain West division championship Saturday in a game that turned out to be deceptively close on the scoreboard.\n\nTwo of Grayson\u2019s TDs came in familiar fashion for the Rams this season, with Rashard Higgins, the elusive sophomore from Mesquite, Texas, turning short, quick throws from Grayson into scoring plays of 43 and 73 yards. Often, it has been when Grayson spots a cornerback playing well off the line of scrimmage and taking care not to get beat deep. Then Grayson adjusts and tosses it quickly to Higgins.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really good feeling to be able to throw a negative 3-yard route and have him take it 80 yards,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cAnytime I can get that kid the ball, I\u2019m trying to do that. It\u2019s something I do try to force at times, but he saves me a lot of times. \u2026 I try to get him the ball as much as I can. I know he\u2019s that playmaker for us.\u201d\n\nHiggins had five catches for 174 yards against the Cowboys.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing my job,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way they game-planned me, and at the end of the day, I\u2019m just catching the ball, getting upfield and doing what I\u2019m supposed to do. I expect big plays out of myself.\u201d\n\nHiggins now has 59 receptions for 1,137 yards for the season \u2014 an average of 19.3 yards per catch.\n\n\u201cI expect to turn a 1-yard route into 80, turning it into 90,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cThat\u2019s the goal I have for myself, and others expect that out of me as well.\u201d\n\nThe other Grayson TD passes went for 21 yards to Dee Hart, 65 yards to Joe Hansley and 21 yards to Xavier Williams on a night when CSU took a 24-3 lead and command of the game early in the second quarter in front of their second consecutive sellout crowd (32,529).\n\nAfter becoming the Rams\u2019 all-time passing yardage leader against Utah State the previous week, Grayson also took over the top spots in the CSU record book for career completions and TD passes against the Cowboys. Early in the second quarter, Grayson passed Kelly Stouffer, who had 577 career completions. Grayson\u2019s fourth TD pass of the night, to Williams in the third quarter, was the 52nd of his CSU career, pulling him ahead of Moses Moreno.\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado State vs. Wyoming in Mountain West football, Oct. 25, 2014\n\nHiggins came into the game tied for the CSU single-season record for TD receptions with Dion Morton and Jeff Champine, and his first scoring play of the night gave him sole possession of the record \u2014 with four regular-season games to play.\n\nAfter the Rams were up 45-17 early in the fourth quarter, Wyoming rallied to get two Cody Kirkegaard touchdown passes.\n\n\u201cIn the locker room afterward, I can really tell how this team has grown,\u201d CSU coach Jim McElwain said. \u201cIt was almost like they lost the game. There wasn\u2019t a lot of energy, a lot of excitement. I think that had to do with how we closed out the game. I thought it got sloppy. \u2026 And yet, know what? We\u2019ll take a rivalry win anytime.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei\n\nGame balls\n\nGarrett Grayson, CSU, QB \u2014 Hit first 13 passes, threw for five TDs and took over school records for completions and TD passes.
