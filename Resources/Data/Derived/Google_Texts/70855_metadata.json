They were obsessed 24/7 with the divisions in the GOP. Under President Obama, the Democrats have lost state houses in most of the country, the U.S. House, and then the U.S. Senate.\n\nAdd the fact that Obamacare is falling apart, and you have a very restless base that didn't get to enjoy any of that \"Hope and Change\" that they were promised. The base's anger is what the Sanders campaign is all about. I should add that Mr. Sanders is the only Democrat telling the truth about the Obama economy. Enter Dr. Jill Stein of the Green Party. I just read their platform, and it could have been written by Senator Sanders! Where are all of those \"Sanderistas\" going this November? Many will go Green. I believe it's very possible that Dr. Stein could get 5% of the vote in many states and deny Mrs. Clinton a lot of those blue states that she's supposed to win. Can Mr. Trump carry New Jersey or Pennsylvania? Yes, with a little help from the Greens! There have been a lot of other women in the Clintons' story. However, the one who may deny her presidency is one named Dr. Jill Stein! P.S. You can listen to my show (Canto Talk) and follow me on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/05/hillarys_other_woman_may_be_named_jill.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Hillary's other woman may be named Jill"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "However, the one who may deny her presidency is one named Dr. Jill Stein!\nHillary's other woman may be named JillThe media didn't see the great Democratic crackup of 2016 coming.\nEnter Dr. Jill Stein of the Green Party.\nI should add that Mr. Sanders is the only Democrat telling the truth about the Obama economy.\nUnder President Obama, the Democrats have lost state houses in most of the country, the U.S. House, and then the U.S. Senate."}
