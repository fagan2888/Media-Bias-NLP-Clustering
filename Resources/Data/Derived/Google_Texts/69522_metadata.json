Some have been following carefully every guidance issued, while others didn\u2019t know what counted as a large business, Mahoney said.\n\n\u201cTo me, that\u2019s one of the more challenging things I see and one of the more concerning things as we approach some of these penalties and deadlines,\u201d she said.\n\nMahoney said she doesn\u2019t know if the federal government will offer any additional leniency as some of the mandates are implemented. The U.S. chamber has asked for an approach where the federal government helps those trying to comply instead of penalizing them, she said, but so far there\u2019s been some leniency exceptions only for specific situations.\n\nMahoney said small-business owners should be connecting with advisers such as accountants or insurance brokers to help them understand the law.\n\n\u201cTheir job is to follow this stuff, because it\u2019s ever-changing and very, very complicated,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As deadlines approach, Maine business leaders vary in how clearly they understand the federal requirements.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "As deadlines approach, Maine business leaders vary in how clearly they understand the federal requirements.", "title": "Forum spotlights Affordable Care Act mandates - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 998, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/547718_457204-20141202-Chamber-F3.jpg", "height": 442}, "updated_time": "2014-12-02T21:21:33-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/12/03/forum-spotlights-affordable-care-act-mandates/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As deadlines approach, Maine business leaders vary in how clearly they understand the federal requirements.", "title": "Forum spotlights Affordable Care Act mandates - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/547718_457204-20141202-Chamber-F3.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2014-12-03T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-02T21:21:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd87f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey\u2019re creating an atmosphere that makes it much more difficult to make difficult decisions for everyone\u2019s health insurance,\u201d she said.\nBabb said her company has been working with its health insurance broker from Harvard Pilgrim Health Care to understand the law and what the company\u2019s options are for dealing with upcoming requirements.\nAdditional Images Katie Mahoney, executive director of health policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, speaks Tuesday at a health care forum organized by the Maine State Chamber of Commerce at the Senator Inn in Augusta.\nAUGUSTA \u2014 The federal government delayed multiple Affordable Care Act mandates for businesses over the past two years, but some business leaders in Maine say they remain uncertain about how the 2010 federal health care overhaul will affect companies here.\nMahoney said small-business owners should be connecting with advisers such as accountants or insurance brokers to help them understand the law."}
