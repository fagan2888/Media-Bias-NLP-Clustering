The plan also describes resources and activities that can contribute to the development of measures applicable to a wide variety of stakeholders.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese programs move the Medicare program and our overall health care system toward paying for the quality rather than the quantity of care delivered to patients.\u201d\n\nThe Measure Development Plan concentrates on numerous identified gaps in currently implemented quality measure sets for PQRS, VM, and the EHR Incentive Program, Goodrich says.\n\nCMS offers a series of recommendations for how these presented problems can best be addressed.\n\n\u201cFuture measure development will prioritize person-[centered] and caregiver-centered experience of care, patient-reported outcomes and patient health outcomes, communication and care coordination, and appropriate use of resources across six quality domains.\u201d\n\nCMS identifies these quality domains as follows:\n\nClinical Care\n\nSafety\n\nCare Coordination\n\nPatient and Caregiver Experience\n\nPopulation Health and Prevention\n\nEfficiency and Cost Reduction\n\nGoodrich says any comments, questions, or thoughts regarding the aforementioned information are due either online, via email, or via snail mail by March 1.\n\nSelected highlights from CMS\u2019s Quality Measurement Development Plan\n\n\"Building on the principles and foundation of the Affordable Care Act, the Administration announced a clear timeline for targeting 30 percent of Medicare payments tied to quality or value through alternative payment models by the end of 2016 and 50 percent by the end of 2018,\u201d says CMS.\n\n\u201cThese are measurable goals to move the Medicare program and our healthcare system at large toward paying providers based on quality, rather than quantity, of care.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe passage of the Medicare Access and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) supports the ongoing transformation of healthcare delivery by furthering the development of new Medicare payment and delivery models for physicians and other clinicians.\u201d\n\nOne of CMS\u2019s quality initiatives includes measure development. First released two years ago and updated earlier this year, the CMS Quality Strategy outlines 6 goals to help improve quality of care, including making care more affordable.\n\nCMS additionally presents a \u201cMeasure Development Timeline,\u201d outlining key dates from 2016 to the beginning of 2019.\n\nUpdates will be either be published annually or \u201cotherwise as appropriate,\u201d CMS says, to report on items such as newly identified measure gaps and new challenges.\n\n\u201cCMS is committed to reducing provider burden through the use of measures aligned across federal and private-payer quality reporting programs. We stress harmonization of data elements and specifications among measure developers, whose cooperation and sharing are essential to creating aligned measures,\u201d CMS writes.\n\n\u201cToward that end, we also intend to leverage the optional pre-rulemaking process and MAP review for MIPS and to participate with other stakeholders in efforts that promote measure alignment. This draft MDP acknowledges the associated challenges and identifies opportunities for measure developers to share information to reduce duplication of efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe successful implementation of the MDP depends on collaboration with multiple stakeholders to develop measures that are meaningful to patients and providers and can be used across payers and healthcare settings.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services posted a Measure Development Plan, a strategic framework for future clinician quality measurement development.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/cmss-quality-measurement-development-plan-supports-mips-apm", "type": "article", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_5_9159788072.jpg", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "title": "CMS\u2019s Quality Measurement Development Plan Supports MIPS, APM"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services posted a Measure Development Plan, a strategic framework for future clinician quality measurement development.", "title": "CMS\u2019s Quality Measurement Development Plan Supports MIPS, APM", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_5_9159788072.jpg"}, "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Measure Development Plan outlines how we\u2019ll draw from our quality measure development experience to build a measure portfolio for MIPS and APMs.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recently posted a 63-page Measure Development Plan, a strategic framework for future clinician quality measurement development that aims to alleviate provider burden.\n2016 may be an especially good year for healthcare providers when it comes to matters of revenue cycle management.\nFirst released two years ago and updated earlier this year, the CMS Quality Strategy outlines 6 goals to help improve quality of care, including making care more affordable.\nCMS additionally presents a \u201cMeasure Development Timeline,\u201d outlining key dates from 2016 to the beginning of 2019."}
