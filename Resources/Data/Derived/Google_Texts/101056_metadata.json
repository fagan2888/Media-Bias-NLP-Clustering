The suspect\u2019s name has not been released. He was taken to a juvenile detention facility and is being held on suspicion of vehicular homicide, The Gazette reported, identifying the driver as a recent transfer from Palmer Ridge to a Parker high school.\n\nBeau Begier, 17, and Ryan Pappas, 18, both from Monument, were killed in the accident, according to a news release by Trooper Eric Zachareas. Both Begier and Pappas were seniors at Palmer Ridge High School in Monument, according to their Facebook pages and online sports records\n\nAnother 17-year-old passenger in the car \u2014 who The Gazette identified as Palmer Ridge senior Mitchell Clark \u2014 was taken to Penrose-St. Francis Health Services hospital in Colorado Springs by medical helicopter for treatment of serious injuries.\n\nThe Lewis-Palmer School District sent a letter to the community outlining the crash as a \u201ca tragedy this morning impacting many families in our community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a tragic reminder of what can be the outcome of young people drinking and driving,\u201d Reid said.\n\nBegier was a member of the Palmer Ridge wrestling team while Pappas played baseball. Several people took to social media remembering the teens.\n\n\u201cBeau Begier was one of the funniest people I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of knowing,\u201d Bailey Ferrari posted on Twitter.\n\n\u201cRyan Pappas, my friend, I\u2019ll miss you more than I can say,\u201d Carter Thorne said on Twitter. \u201cI know you\u2019re in a better place now, but I can\u2019t help wishing you were still here.\u201d\n\nThe one-car accident happened just after 1 a.m.\n\nThe 17-year-old driver was going east on Baptist Assembly Road at high speed and failed to stop at a stop sign, the patrol said. The convertible Mini Cooper went airborne and slammed head-on into a pine tree.\n\nBegier who was not wearing a seat belt, was ejected from the car. The others were all wearing seat belts.\n\nThe accident happened just days after the four high school students began the 2014-15 school year.\n\nStaff Writer Jesse Paul contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Two dead, two injured in El Paso County crash", "title": "Two dead, two injured in El Paso County crash", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/01/two-dead-two-injured-in-el-paso-county-crash/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140901__teencrashp1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140901__teencrashp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-01T07:59:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:36:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda62\"", "article_summary": "Two Palmer Ridge High School students were killed and two others injured early Labor Day morning in a one-vehicle El Paso County wreck, authorities say.\nColorado State Patrol officers took the 17-year-old driver, suspected of drunken driving, to a hospital for treatment and later arrested him, said Trooper Nate Reid, CSP spokesman.\nThe accident happened just days after the four high school students began the 2014-15 school year.\nThe 17-year-old driver was going east on Baptist Assembly Road at high speed and failed to stop at a stop sign, the patrol said.\nBegier was a member of the Palmer Ridge wrestling team while Pappas played baseball."}
