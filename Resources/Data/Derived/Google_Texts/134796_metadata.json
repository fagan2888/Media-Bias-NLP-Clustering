Lutman/Special to The CJ)Buy Photo\n\nForty abortion-rights supporters demonstrated against what they called \"deceptive tactics\" of a counseling center located next to a downtown Louisville abortion clinic Saturday morning.\n\nThe protesters were from the Kentucky Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, a statewide nonprofit that group president Caitlin Willenbrink said unites people of faith who believe women have the right to control their reproductive health.\n\n\"We are here to draw awareness to the practices of crisis pregnancy centers,\" she said during the hourlong protest at First and Market streets. \"We believe that people who may or may not want to have a child deserve to have all their options shared with them in a way that is non-judgmental and non-shaming.\"\n\n\"When a woman comes into a crisis pregnancy center, she may arrive there expecting a free pregnancy test but her receiving those things might be predicated on her getting counseling that draws incorrect connections between abortion and cancer and abortion and mental health issues,\" she said.\n\nWillenbrink said she herself underwent a pregnancy test at the Woman's Choice crisis pregnancy center recently as a ruse and was told she would have to receive counseling.\n\nShe said that included questions about her relationship to God and information that abortion is linked to breast cancer and suicide.\n\nThe Woman's Choice center was closed Saturday afternoon and a call seeking comment was not immediately returned.\n\nAnti-abortion activist Donna Durning, who said she has protested abortion every weekday for the last two decades, arrived at the tail end of the demonstration.\n\n\"We are talking about babies here,\" she said. \"We are trying to save lives.\"\n\nAnne Ahola, director of the EMW Women's Surgical Center next door, said most of its practice involves dispensing a regimen of \"morning after\" medication that results in at-home miscarriage and the surgical termination of early, first-term pregnancies on site.\n\nThe clinic has treated patients as young as 12 and as old as 51, Ahola said.\n\nThe protest took place before the National Right to Life convention begins Thursday at the Galt House downtown. Activists from around the U.S. who oppose abortion will converge on Louisville during the three-day meeting, which will include remarks next Saturday morning by U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nJere Downs can be reached at (502) 582-4669, Jere Downs on Facebook and Jeredowns on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/T0aMqe", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Kentucky Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice calls center's practices \"deceptive.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Kentucky Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice calls center's practices \"deceptive.\"", "title": "Abortion-rights group protests counseling center", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2014/06/21/abortion-rights-group-protests-counseling-center/11216935/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kentucky Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice calls center's practices \"deceptive.\"", "title": "Abortion-rights group protests counseling center", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ed43a10013b68cca9bfd2d32c5cb85733de0db06/c=466-0-2534-2068&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/21/0621abortdeceptionprotest016drl.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "Jere Downs"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0a81c5d19601666ac24af8ac05a90248e5cdf91a/c=724-0-2275-2068/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/21/0621abortdeceptionprotest016drl.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/88a0ca48329e9ff5bccf1572b76d538091d317a7/c=466-0-2534-2068/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/21/0621abortdeceptionprotest016drl.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce339183155d0f59bf96ab8879aacb45cc2c4c18/c=122-0-2879-2068/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/21/0621abortdeceptionprotest016drl.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d1ce9510d63d9347b76d225435c828669b20e2f5/c=0-190-3000-1878&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/21/0621abortdeceptionprotest016drl.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-06-21T17:43:25.737000-04:00", "shorthed": "Abortion-rights group protests center", "articleid": 11216935, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/548b52fe38d32d35dfa3fe5bc25fcbee3fa06140/c=0-190-3000-1878/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/21/0621abortdeceptionprotest016drl.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/739e0a1e0f1e3b4b11cb38d0752c2c9d743bea8d/c=918-0-2081-2068/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/21/0621abortdeceptionprotest016drl.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Abortion-rights group protests counseling center", "pageclass": "article", "author": "Jere Downs"}, "news_keywords": "abortion, Kentucky Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, anti-abortion, protest"}, "article_summary": "Willenbrink said she herself underwent a pregnancy test at the Woman's Choice crisis pregnancy center recently as a ruse and was told she would have to receive counseling.\nThe Woman's Choice center was closed Saturday afternoon and a call seeking comment was not immediately returned.\nHere KRCRC members picket the CPC\u2019s \u201cA Woman\u2019s Choice Resource Center,\u201d which the KRCRC said is a non-medical facility trying to convince women not to have abortions.\n\"We are here to draw awareness to the practices of crisis pregnancy centers,\" she said during the hourlong protest at First and Market streets.\n21 June 2014 (Photo: David R.
