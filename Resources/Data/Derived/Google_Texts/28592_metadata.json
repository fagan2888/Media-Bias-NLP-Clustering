But it is defined here, just as it was with Bush, by Brown's eyebrows shooting up toward each other to form an inverted \u201cV\u201d and his eyes widening as he looks into the camera. And the nervousness suggested by that facial expression is accentuated by jerky arm movements and sudden swings of the head from side to side.\n\nHis answers are just this side of bureaucratic doublespeak \u2013 exactly the rhetoric of Washington and Annapolis unaccountability that makes some voters want to scream. And he regularly has an expression on his face when he looks into the camera that I have not seen on a veteran politician since George W. Bush.\n\nAnd he was. But he was an even bigger loser Monday in showing up for the debate on Maryland Public Television. No wonder he doesn\u2019t want to do these TV debates. It\u2019s not just incumbency; he\u2019s terrible on television.\n\nLast week, I thought Lt. Governor Anthony Brown was the loser among Democratic candidates for not showing up at WBFF\u2019s TV debate.\n\nIn an hour-long format, he is almost painful to watch. Scratch almost.\n\nAnd the staging of this debate by the League of Women Voters and MPT was absolutely deadly for him, because each time a candidate was given a question, he or she would get up from a stool, walk toward the audience, look into the camera and speak.\n\nA good media coach might have compensated by telling Brown to walk right up to the edge of the studio audience, make eye contact with and speak one on one to the person who asked the question. Then, the camera would be looking upon that visual exchange between candidate and audience member, rather than directly into Brown\u2019s eyes.\n\nBut the words were worse than the visuals.\n\nThe debate format was messy with moderator Jeff Salkin changing instructions and even rules for the candidates as it went along. State Delegate Heather Mizeur expressed her frustration when the end of her closing statement, which had already been cut to just 60 seconds, was clipped by Salkin.\n\nSalkin\u2019s best moment came when he used what he described as one of his only chances to ask a question of his own, to query Brown about a Baltimore Sun editorial questioning Brown\u2019s exact role in the disastrous rollout of the Affordable Care Act in Maryland.\n\nQuoting the Sun, Salkin said voters \u201cstill haven\u2019t got a satisfactory answer\u201d as to whether Brown was a \u201cfailed manager,\u201d or talk of him being in charge was merely \u201cpolitical puffery.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s answer when you cut through all the bureaucrat-speak was that he was indeed in charge of one committee overseeing the rollout, but it wasn\u2019t the right committee, the one that actually had the information about how things were going.\n\nSo, yes he was in charge, but not really responsible for the debacle, because he wasn\u2019t on the right committee.\n\nIncredible. It would be laughable if hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars had not been squandered and so many state residents had not suffered.\n\nAttorney General Douglas Gansler had his most consistent TV outing to date. His best moment came when Salkin asked, \u201cIf I could focus in on your corporate tax proposal\u2026 Of all the taxes that are out there, why is that one your focus?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my focus,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lieutenant governor made it my focus with three mailings and a television [attack] ad.\u201d\n\nAs unnecessary as it should be, it was a nice reminder to the moderator and other members of the press not to let their perceptions of the candidates be shaped by media ads -- especially attack ads.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-baltimoresun", "description": "Last week, I thought Lt.
