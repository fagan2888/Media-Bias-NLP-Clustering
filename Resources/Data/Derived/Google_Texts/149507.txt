About 300 Bombardier Learjet employees will face furloughs during the first half of 2014, KAKE News has learned.

Learjet 70 and Learjet 75 production and direct support workers at the Wichita plant will be affected, according to an internal memo sent to all Wichita employees Friday. The memo said a total of six weeks of furloughs will be implemented in two-week blocks. Affected employees will be told sometime this month when the furloughs will take place, the memo said.

In the memo, Ralph Acs, Vice-President and General Manager of Learjet, said, "Bombardier continues to see encouraging signs in the U.S. economy, but the aviation industry still faces challenges, particularly in the light category business aircraft segment."

Acs' memo said the furloughs are necessary to ensure the long-term success of Learjet.

The furloughs will not affect Bombardier Aircraft Services, Bombardier Flight Test Center, Learjet 85, parts services and customer support employees, according to the memo.
