El Nino expected to bring record weather extremes this year

Federal officials say this year's El Nino weather pattern could turn out to be the most powerful on record. It is already the second strongest in the 60 years in which records have been kept. The phenomenon starts out with extra warm water in the eastern Pacific, which can affect weather all over the world. This year's El Nino could bring heavy winter rains to drought stricken California, and produce the warmest year ever recorded. "This definitely has the potential of being the Godzilla El Nino," a NASA climatologist said.
