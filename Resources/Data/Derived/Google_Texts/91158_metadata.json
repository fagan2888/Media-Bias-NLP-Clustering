My first grade teacher at Woodside Elementary School in suburban Maryland made the entire class learn to sing \u201cHail to the Redskins\u201d right along with other classic American songs. People may not like the team\u2019s name, but this is a simple free speech issue. The Redskins are privately owned. If the public doesn\u2019t like the name, they don\u2019t have to support the team. I have some very dear friends who decided to stop supporting the Redskins because of this issue. That\u2019s fine by me. If enough people join them, maybe the ownership will actually decide to comply with their wishes. But trying to force change through heavy-handed tactics such as government intervention is draconian. Daniel Snyder, the owner of the Washington Redskins, is clear that he has no plans to change the name of this historic and storied team. There aren\u2019t many things I will applaud Daniel Snyder for, but this is definitely one of them. If people want to talk to Daniel Snyder about something important, ask him if he is going to support the coach on his quarterback decisions. Ask him why he moved the training camp from Carlisle, Pennsylvania to Richmond, Virginia. When he did that, central Pennsylvania became Baltimore Ravens territory. How smart was that? There aren\u2019t more important things on which the Fritz Pollard Alliance can focus? Was the issue of long-term effects of head trauma suddenly solved and I missed it? I think it\u2019s incredibly telling and hypocritical that John Wooten, a former Redskins player, is now blasting the team that once paid his salary. Where was his interest in \u201crespect and dignity\u201d when he was cashing his paychecks? Is he planning to return this apparent blood money to the team or donate it to charity?\n\nAdditionally, Project 21 Co-Chairman Horace Cooper, a legal commentator who taught constitutional law at George Mason University and was a former leadership staff member for the U.S. House of Representatives, said:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/P21HoraceCooper.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1422219444431", "description": "While most other football fans are fixated on deflated game balls right now, there&rsquo;s ...", "title": "Black Conservatives Say Newest Drive for Redskins Name Change Fouls Free\u00a0Speech - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf39f\"", "article_summary": "There aren\u2019t many things I will applaud Daniel Snyder for, but this is definitely one of them.\nDaniel Snyder, the owner of the Washington Redskins, is clear that he has no plans to change the name of this historic and storied team.\nIf people want to talk to Daniel Snyder about something important, ask him if he is going to support the coach on his quarterback decisions.\nNot only does it seem off the group\u2019s mission of \u201cpromot[ing] diversity and equality of job opportunity,\u201d but threatens free speech as well.\nPeople may not like the team\u2019s name, but this is a simple free speech issue."}
