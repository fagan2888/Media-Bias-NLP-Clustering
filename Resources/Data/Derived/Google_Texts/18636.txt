A new center on International Drive is hoping to help more Central Floridians sign up for insurance coverage during the third enrollment period of the Affordable Care Act.

SRA International, a federal contractor, has opened the Orlando Enrollment Assistance Center at 5628 International Drive.

Trained enrollment specialists will help individuals and families review their coverage options and find out if they quality for financial assistance.

The center will be open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. until the end of January. You can also contact the center at 407-340-0844.

Your other free sources for finding insurance in the marketplace are local certified navigators. You can set up an appointment with them by dialing 2-1-1 or visiting signupcentralfl.com.

The open enrollment for ACA started on November 1 and will end on January 31, 2016. If you want coverage by January 1, you must sign up for a plan by December 15.
