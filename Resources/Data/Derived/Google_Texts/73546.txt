The media and fashion industries use Photoshop so much these days that it’s pretty rare to see an untouched photograph of a celebrity or model on a magazine cover: What you’re seeing is essentially not real.

A Dutch artist has taken that trend and reversed it in a new series of photographs that re-imagines the human body and what the skin is capable of. In her series, called REK, Juuke Schoorl aims to explore the malleability and flexibility of human skin. REK, which means “stretch” in Dutch, involves several photographs of the human body up-close, but there’s something odd about every figure — the skin is in some way manipulated — physically, not digitally. Schoorl used cheap items like tape and nylon fishing threads to reshape the skin into new textures and shapes.
