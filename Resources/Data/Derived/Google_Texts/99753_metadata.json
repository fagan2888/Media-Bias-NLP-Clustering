Prayuth Chan-ocha spoke at a news conference just after King Bhumibol Adulyadej endorsed him to run the country in a royal command that called for \u201creconciliation among the people\u201d and was concerned about increasingly violent confrontations between the ousted government and dispersed demonstrators who had called repeatedly for the army to intervene.\n\nPrayuth also justified the putsch that was declared last Thursday, saying he had to restore order after seven months of violent confrontations and political turmoil between the now-ousted government and demonstrators who had called repeatedly for the army to intervene.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing right now is to keep peace and order in the country,\u201d Prayuth said. \u201cWhen the conflict intensified, and there was the threat of violence, we had to act.\u201d\n\nIn sporadic violence since last November, 28 people have been killed and more than 800 injured in grenade attacks, gun fights and drive-by shootings.\n\n\u201cI am not here to argue with anyone. Our intentions are pure, and we will remain transparent \u2026 everyone needs to help me,\u201d Prayuth said, before adding, \u201cdo not criticize, do not start problems.
