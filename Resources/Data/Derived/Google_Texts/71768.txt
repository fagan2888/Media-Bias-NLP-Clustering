In light of the recent and absurd calls from University of Missouri students to self-segregate based on race, demands for "safe spaces," the attempts to boot reporters from covering public protests, claims of a poop swastika and more, Young America's Foundation decided to send Harvard Law Graduate and Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro to Mizzou to debunk false, progressive narratives swirling on campus and being promoted through national media.

The words "toughen up spoiled children" were written in chalk outside of the hall where he spoke and during his speech, Shapiro took protesters and the leftists who support them to task in epic fashion. The title of his lecture was, "Truth is a Microaggression."

"I don't care about your feelings. Lets make something perfectly clear, I care nothing about your feelings," Shapiro said.

The entire speech is worth your time to watch.
