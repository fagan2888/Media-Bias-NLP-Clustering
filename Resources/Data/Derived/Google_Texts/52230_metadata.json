And right now, sources say, those people are thinking happy thoughts about digital health and other health-related IPOs.\n\nWhy now? The quick answer is that the most recent handful of health IPOs have been strong performers. Fitbit (fitness wearables), TeleDoc (telemedicine), Evolent Health (hospital analytics), and Press Ganey Holdings (patient surveys, information) each came out above the original offer price on opening day.\n\nBut there may be another, deeper, sentiment that\u2019s settling in. Technology will play a huge role in fixing health care.\n\nToday, the health care industry is often compared \u2014 unfavorably \u2014 to other industries in terms of the state of its information technologies.\n\n\u201cThe thing about health care is that it\u2019s a $3 trillion industry, and the computer systems used in the industry are probably the worst in terms of its twenty-first century-ness of it, maybe second only to education,\u201d said Stephen Kraus of Bessemer Venture Partners. \u201cMy partners in other industries almost laugh at the green screen computer systems used in health care \u2014 it\u2019s literally stuck in the 1980s.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no question that the health care industry is rife with costly inefficiencies and waste, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the industry is ripe for disruption. It\u2019s a slow-moving industry that evolves workflows and technologies slowly, and sticks to them. Health care providers are overburdened, too, making it very hard to drop everything and set up a new computer system.\n\n\u201cInvestors are buying the core thesis that tech will finally start to automate the bloated health care industry,\u201d said Jeff Tangney, CEO of the doctor networking service Doximity. Tangney has been around health IT since co-founding his first company, Epocrates, back in 1998.\n\nThe regulatory environment has created some strong tail winds for digital health companies.\n\nHealth care reform and new value-based and population health reimbursement models are gradually changing the economics of health care \u2014 that is, they\u2019re changing the way providers are getting paid. Provider organizations need to use all kinds of analytics and engagement technologies to care for entire populations of people in a cost-effective way.\n\nInvestors may be seeing that these forces aren\u2019t going away. Wall Street may feel more confident about health care IPOs given the recent political climate around health care reform, which seems far less in flux than it was a year ago.\n\n\u201cI think interest is driven by widespread recognition that the incentives changes and information liberation catalyzed by the Affordable Care Act are working and going to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d said Bob Kocher, a partner at Venrock, which invests in digital health companies.\n\nThe importance of the Obama Administration\u2019s huge victory with the Supreme Court win in King v. Burwell can\u2019t be overstated. The decision removed a major challenge to the right of the government to implement the ACA. There was a sense of decisiveness around the decision. It seemed to announce \u201cObamacare is here to stay.\u201d\n\nKocher: \u201cNow that the Supreme Court has settled the legal disputes and people are realizing that the upcoming election is not going to lead to a Senate majority that could repeal and replace the ACA, investors are fully committing to backing start-ups that benefit from the fact the healthcare will grow to upwards of 22 percent of GDP over the next decade and adopt lots of new technology in this process.\u201d\n\nBefore joining Venrock, Kocher served in the Obama Administration where he was one of the key shapers of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBessemer Venture Partners\u2019 Kraus said the current warm feeling about digital health companies might have less to do with court decisions and recent IPOs, and more to do with the natural maturation of the digital health space.\n\n\u201cHealth care reform and regulatory changes \u2014 one of which was the HITECH Act (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health) \u2014 have poured billions into the digital health space, so it\u2019s no surprise that disruption-minded entrepreneurs [are] jumping in,\u201d Kraus said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising that these digital health companies that started five or six years ago are now maturing and accessing the public markets.\u201d\n\nAnd the fun may be just getting started, Kraus believes. \u201cI think we\u2019re in innings one, two, and three in the game. I think you\u2019ll see five health IPOs every year for the next ten years,\u201d Kraus said.", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2015-08-17T16:15:45+00:00", "author": "mark-sullivan", "modDate": "2015-08-20T00:13:20+00:00", "keywords": "bessemer-venture-partners,bob-kocher,digital-health,doximity,ipos,jeff-tangney", "type": "news", "id": 1786736}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "A\u00a0relatively small group of people from underwriting banks on Wall Street define the market's appetite for the year's IPOs.\u00a0And right now, sources say, those people are thinking happy thoughts about digital health and other health-related IPOs.", "title": "This year\u2019s digital health IPOs have put the market in the mood for\u00a0more", "url": "http://venturebeat.com/2015/08/17/this-years-digital-health-ipos-have-put-the-market-in-the-mood-for-more/", "image": "http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/watson-health-ibmphoto24-flickr-780x553.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "A\u00a0relatively small group of people from underwriting banks on Wall Street define the market\u2019s appetite for the year\u2019s IPOs.\u00a0And right now, sources say, those people are thinking happy thoughts about digital health and other health-related IPOs.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd8ce\"", "article_summary": "Health care reform and new value-based and population health reimbursement models are gradually changing the economics of health care \u2014 that is, they\u2019re changing the way providers are getting paid.\nWall Street may feel more confident about health care IPOs given the recent political climate around health care reform, which seems far less in flux than it was a year ago.\nAnd right now, sources say, those people are thinking happy thoughts about digital health and other health-related IPOs.\nThe quick answer is that the most recent handful of health IPOs have been strong performers.\nBessemer Venture Partners\u2019 Kraus said the current warm feeling about digital health companies might have less to do with court decisions and recent IPOs, and more to do with the natural maturation of the digital health space."}
