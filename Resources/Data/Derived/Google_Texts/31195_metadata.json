However, the IACHR has said \"it will not renew the experts' term because the government was opposed to an extension,\" according to Reuters.\n\nAs Carrie has previously reported, the students from Ayotzinapa went missing in 2014:\n\n\"Authorities contend the 43 were kidnapped, then murdered by a local drug gang. All the bodies were allegedly burned in one night at a garbage dump. That version has been publicly challenged by relatives and international experts.\"\n\nShe reports that today, \"the group says it concludes that there was no burning of the 43 students at the garbage dump as the government has claimed.\"\n\nAs the presentation concluded, Carrie reports the crowd gave the panel a lengthy standing ovation, shouting, \"Don't leave!\"\n\nShe adds that, according to the head of the IACHR, there was no government representative present at the news conference to receive the panel's report.\n\nThe government did not immediately comment on the findings, Reuters reports.\n\nThe New York Times sheds light on the significance of the group's departure:\n\n\"The arrival of the international experts inspired hope and a shot at closure, if only vicariously, for those who suffer their losses quietly on the margins of Mexican society. In an exceptional gesture, Mexico was granting foreigners permission to conduct a true investigation. Now their departure is a bitter one.\"", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Merrit Kennedy", "og": {"site_name": "WAMU 88.5", "description": "An independent group of experts, which was charged with investigating the notorious case of 43 students who disappeared and were allegedly slain in 2014, is now accusing the Mexican governmen", "title": "Mexico Accused Of Torturing Suspects In Missing Students Probe", "url": "http://wamu.org/news/16/04/24/mexico_accused_of_torturing_suspects_in_missing_students_investigation", "image": "http://www.google-analytics.com/__utm.gif?utmac=UA-5828686-4&utmdt=Mexico+Accused+Of+Torturing+Suspects+In+Missing+Students+Probe&utme=8(APIKey)9(MDAxNzk1MDc4MDEyMTU0NTY4ODBlNmE3Yw001)", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 0, "nid": 226622, "google-site-verification": "8AyE7rFVyUE7ZiqFGJ29mxnUk_L6YMXe4KHsLRUvvmQ"}, "article_summary": "She reports that today, \"the group says it concludes that there was no burning of the 43 students at the garbage dump as the government has claimed.\"\nAs Carrie has previously reported, the students from Ayotzinapa went missing in 2014:\"Authorities contend the 43 were kidnapped, then murdered by a local drug gang.\nPanel member Claudia Paz y Paz tells the Times that \"the conditions to conduct our work don't exist.\"\nAn independent group of experts, which was charged with investigating the notorious case of 43 students who disappeared and were allegedly slain in 2014, is now accusing the Mexican government of failing to cooperate with its investigation and torturing suspects.\nSeventeen of the approximately 100 suspects \"showed signs of beatings, in some cases, dozens of bruises, cuts and scrapes,\" The Associated Press reports."}
