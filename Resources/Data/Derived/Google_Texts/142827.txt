VenueNext CEO and founder John “JP” Paul Terrell Lloyd, San Francisco 49ers

Sports venues are increasingly embracing enterprise software and mobile apps to improve their business from the way they market and distribute tickets, to management of concessions, merchandise and parking on-site.

And venture investors are pouring money into tech startups that make these tools with recent rounds for GameTime, SeatGeek, Bypass Mobile, Fever and several others.

Now VenueNext Inc. has raised $9 million for its smartphone app that gives people access to different amenities and information they may want around their visit to a venue.

Using the company’s app, for example, a ticket holder at a game at Levi’s Stadium, in Santa Clara, Calif., can order snacks or merchandise and have them delivered right to their seats during a game. People could also use it to look up information about the nearest bathroom and find out whether or not it has a long line before getting up to go.

Causeway Media Partners, a fund that focuses on sports technology and media, led the Series A investment in VenueNext with participation from Live Nation Entertainment, Twitter Ventures and Aruba Networks.

Along with the funding, Mark Wan, managing partner at Causeway Media Partners, joined VenueNext’s board. Mr. Wan is also a co-owner of the San Francisco 49ers, where the VenueNext app was created.

Mr. Paul said VenueNext plans to use its Series A capital to expand into a number of new venues. VenueNext has 30 venues in the U.S. signed up to use its technology.

Mr. Wan said his firm expects VenueNext to take its technology beyond sports venues, including to theme parks, college campuses, concert venues and hotels, given the new funding.
