For several years now, criminal justice reform reporting has been gaining momentum, which has undoubtedly contributed to the record number of wrongful convictions overturned last year and the newly-renewed Black Lives Matter movement, spotlighting the at-times flagrant racial bias of the system.\n\nBut while the journalism community has passionately reported on the innocents who have been harmed by the justice system, there is decidedly less attention paid exclusively to those who are guilty and their stories.\n\n\u201cWe fear our readers can\u2019t possibly develop compassion for anyone who robs, beats, rapes, or kills,\u201d writes Steve Bogira for the Social Justice News Nexus. \u201cWe ourselves have trouble feeling compassion for such offenders; to do so violates a taboo. Only if the violent offender has the mitigating factor of youth, or sometimes mental illness, are we likely to take on his or her story.\u201d\n\nIs that true? How often do we cover the stories of violent, hardened criminals? But more importantly, what would be the value in a story showcasing these prisoners? They\u2019re already imprisoned, their guilt is not in question, and they have committed a crime that deserves a just punishment. Where is the social justice story here?\n\nAccording to Bogira, when we pass over guilty, violent prisoners, we miss the opportunity to show the real-life impact of concentrated poverty that can lead to the violence that results in mass incarceration\u2014particularly among African Americans, who are disproportionately affected by the system:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a crying need for stories that make the crucial connections between concentrated poverty and violence, and that shift the focus from individual responsibility to our collective culpability. In the context of criminal justice stories, it\u2019s not a connection journalists can make when their subjects are innocent or non-violent.\u201d\n\nMore prominent portrayals of the connection between poverty and mass incarceration are certainly needed. Indeed, they are prerequisite to truly understanding how to report on reforming the criminal justice system. And, of course, it\u2019s not as though this connection has escaped the notice of journalism. Both past and recent coverage has focused on African Americans in poverty and their increased likelihood of ending up in prison. But this coverage almost never stems from or involves a conversation with a violent inmate. Rather, when profiling guilty inmates, coverage rarely steers away from profiling drug dealers, inmates with mental illnesses, and other non-violent offenders. If violent inmates are portrayed, they are usually juveniles.\n\nBut what can be learned about a prisoner raised in an abusive home in the projects and routinely subjected to situations that have conditioned him or her to react violently? Even though we know a child raised in a violent household is more likely to be to become violent himself, as a society, we just don\u2019t have sympathy or understanding for those offenders. Without a mitigating handicap like a mental illness or being a juvenile, an adult making his or her own decisions that harms another individual is plainly guilty\u2014no excuses.\n\nThe problem with this thinking is that it actually prevents us from pursuing any kind of true criminal reform. We need to acknowledge that the same systematic poverty that prevents a mentally-ill man from getting treatment and leads him to violence can also lead another child, steeped in the same poverty trap growing up, to commit a similarly violent act. The intersection of these various social ills needs to be addressed, and it can start with the journalism community. However, social justice journalists must shed any preconceptions they have of \u201cthe guilty.\u201d\n\nThe Boston Globe published a fascinating article in late January on the defense attorneys behind the most violent defendants. How can attorneys manage to represent the worst of the worst\u2014the child rapists, the mass murderers, the serial killers?\n\n\u201cZealous representation requires the lawyer to subordinate all other interests \u2014 ideological, career, personal \u2014 to the legitimate interest of the client,\u201d says defense attorney Alan Dershowitz. Prominent defense attorney Judy Clarke has advocated for the likes of Jared Lee Loughner, Ted Kaczynski, Eric Rudolph (who detonated a series of bombs in the \u201990s), Susan Smith (who murdered her two young sons), and most recently Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bomber. Clarke\u2019s clients seek her services because she has been able to famously prevent her infamous clients from receiving the death penalty. She does this through humanizing her clients by dismantling the jury\u2019s picture of them as the monsters living on the fringes of society.\n\nCan social justice journalism take the same steps in the legitimate interest of reporting on the truth of the justice system\u2014a truth that requires the voices of the damned and the innocent?\u2014Shafaq Hasan", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a very long period during which there was no opening for criminal justice reform, now there is\u2014but are social justice journalists up to the challenge?", "original-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/02/24/what-are-social-justice-journalists-missing-about-criminal-reform/", "og": {"site_name": "Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly", "description": "After a very long period during which there was no opening for criminal justice reform, now there is\u2014but are social justice journalists up to the challenge?", "title": "Social Justice Journalists and Criminal Justice Reform: Get Real!", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2015-02-24T16:26:43+00:00", "url": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/02/24/what-are-social-justice-journalists-missing-about-criminal-reform/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a very long period during which there was no opening for criminal justice reform, now there is\u2014but are social justice journalists up to the challenge?", "title": "Social Justice Journalists and Criminal Justice Reform: Get Real! - Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly", "site": "@npquarterly", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ShafaqHasan"}, "syndication-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/02/24/what-are-social-justice-journalists-missing-about-criminal-reform/", "article": {"tag": "public defenders", "published_time": "2015-02-24T15:19:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-24T16:26:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "criminal justice reform,  defense attorneys,  incarceration,  investigative journalism,  jails and prisons,  justice system,  poverty and crime,  prisoner rights,  racial inequality,  right to an attorney"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf517\"", "article_summary": "February 18, 2015; Social Justice News NexusHere at NPQ, we like to believe we are more than just habitual commentators and observers of the nonprofit world; we are also fervent social justice journalists, activists, and advocates.\n\u201cWe fear our readers can\u2019t possibly develop compassion for anyone who robs, beats, rapes, or kills,\u201d writes Steve Bogira for the Social Justice News Nexus.\nIndeed, they are prerequisite to truly understanding how to report on reforming the criminal justice system.\nCan social justice journalism take the same steps in the legitimate interest of reporting on the truth of the justice system\u2014a truth that requires the voices of the damned and the innocent?\u2014Shafaq Hasan\nWhere is the social justice story here?"}
