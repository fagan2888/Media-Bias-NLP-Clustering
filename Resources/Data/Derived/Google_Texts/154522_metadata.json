She could end up in court toward the end of next year along with her husband Inaki Urdangarin, an Olympic handball medalist turned businessman, and 15 others targeted in the case.\n\nThe princess is accused of benefiting financially from an alleged scheme with Urdangarin\u2019s nonprofit Noos organization that allegedly embezzled public funds and syphoned them into Aizoon, a private company owned by the couple.\n\nUrdangarin faces allegations he used his \u201cDuke of Palma\u201d royal title that he has since lost to land contracts.\n\nProbing suspected abuse of company funds to cover the couple\u2019s personal expenses from their Aizoon real estate and consulting firm, an investigative judge compiled detailed lists of alleged examples. They included purchases for the couple\u2019s Barcelona mansion, salsa dancing classes and vacations at luxury hotels.\n\nMost news of the alleged excesses emerged while Juan Carlos was king. And Juan Carlos in 2012 himself eroded much of the respect he earned in decades on the throne after he went on a secret elephant-hunting trip to Botswana at the height of Spain\u2019s financial crisis.\n\nDuring his own Christmas Eve speech in 2011, Juan Carlos said that Spanish law \u201cis the same for everyone.\u201d He made the statement as the investigation into Cristina\u2019s husband was intensifying amid speculation she might have had a role.\n\nFelipe also said Spain\u2019s sluggish economic recovery with unemployment at 24 percent is \u201cunacceptable\u201d because young Spaniards who face much higher joblessness are becoming disillusioned with their prospects.\n\nMany have left Spain to seek work abroad and those who remain often end up in dead-end, low paying jobs despite having college educations.\n\nThe king\u2019s take on the economy contrasted sharply with recent declarations by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and members of his administration, stressing that Spain\u2019s economy is rebounding and is growing faster than other European nations, thanks to austerity measures they invoked that prevented a financial meltdown.\n\nRajoy must call national elections by the end of next year and faces a tough battle to try to maintain the absolute majority his Popular Party won in 2011.\n\nAiming to reduce secessionist fervor in the northeastern region of Catalonia, Felipe said Catalans who speak their own language and pride themselves with a culture they say is distinct are an important part of Spain\u2019s social fabric.\n\n\u201cMillions of Spaniards have Catalonia in their hearts,\u201d Felipe said.\n\nThe king made his appearance seated in a gray suit and a light-blue tie rather than the military uniforms favored by his father.\n\nChristmas lights on a tree in the background and a poinsettia plant added to the informal atmosphere of the staged speech that was recorded before being aired on Spanish television.\n\nFelipe ended his speech by wishing viewers a merry Christmas in Spanish and in Spain\u2019s other three official languages - Basque, Catalan and Galician.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Spain's new King Felipe VI insisted in his first Christmas Eve speech Wednesday that seemingly endless examples of corruption across the country incensing voters must be stamped out.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Spain\u2019s new King Felipe VI insisted in his first Christmas Eve speech Wednesday that seemingly endless examples of corruption across the country incensing voters must be stamped out.", "title": "Spain: New king says corruption must be eliminated", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/24/spain-new-king-says-corruption-must-be-eliminated/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/24/7d1510f06ddd2c32690f6a706700978c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/24/7d1510f06ddd2c32690f6a706700978c.jpg", "description": "Spain's new King Felipe VI insisted in his first Christmas Eve speech Wednesday that seemingly endless examples of corruption across the country incensing voters must be stamped out.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Spain: New king says corruption must be eliminated"}, "Author": "ALAN CLENDENNING and HAROLD HECKLE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfbbe\"", "article_summary": "\u201cLogically, his sister and brother-in-law are included in the references to corruption,\u201d said Rayon, the author of four books about Spain\u2019s royal family.\nMADRID (AP) - Spain\u2019s new King Felipe VI insisted in his first Christmas Eve speech Wednesday that seemingly endless examples of corruption across the country incensing voters must be stamped out.\nThe king made his appearance seated in a gray suit and a light-blue tie rather than the military uniforms favored by his father.\n\u201cThere must not be favored treatment for those occupying a position of public responsibility,\u201d Felipe said.\nMost news of the alleged excesses emerged while Juan Carlos was king."}
