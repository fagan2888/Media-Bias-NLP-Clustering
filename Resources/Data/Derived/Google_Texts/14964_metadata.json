Burwell.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cPart of what I\u2019m hoping is, with the Supreme Court case now behind us, what we can do is now focus on how we can make it even better,\u201d Obama said in Nashville. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not as if we\u2019ve solved all of the problems in our healthcare system.\u201d\n\nThe response from Republicans: not yet.\n\nWhite House aides say the president isn\u2019t under any illusions that Republicans will drop their objections to the Affordable Care Act just because the administration won the latest Supreme Court fight. So as he called on the country to move beyond politics and work on the less controversial missions of reducing costs and improving quality of care, Obama took pains to avoid being too confrontational. In particular, he praised the efforts of Tennessee\u2019s Republican governor, Bill Haslam, who has embraced key parts of Obamacare, while treading lightly on the GOP-controlled state legislature that has twice rejected expanding Medicaid.\n\nThe goal, White House officials say, is to take the debate off the political front burner and hope Republicans will be open to collaborating with the administration.\n\nBut it may be too soon.\n\n\u201cA lot of folks who believe that King was wrongly decided are still trying to wrap their heads around what happened last week,\u201d said Lanhee Chen, a Stanford professor who served as Mitt Romney\u2019s top domestic policy adviser in 2012. \u201cBut it is certainly the case that there are opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to work together.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s visit to Nashville also serves as a reminder of the partisan tensions that still surround Obamacare more than five years after it passed amid fierce Republican opposition. For instance, Haslam didn\u2019t attend the event, fearing that appearing side by side with Obama would undermine his bid to persuade the GOP-controlled legislature to pass the Medicaid expansion \u2014 a key part of the health care reforms and a top Obama priority.\n\nObama, who did not name Haslam even as he touted the medical innovation initiatives the governor has spearheaded, acknowledged that his association with the law is still toxic. In response to a question from a Democratic state legislator in the audience asking for advice on how to persuade her colleagues to expand Medicaid, Obama replied that politicians respond to public opinion, and \u201cmisinformation\u201d has poisoned public opinion against Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIf you stop the average Tennessean on the street,\u201d Obama said, and asked if he supports the rule that prevents insurers for rejecting people for pre-existing conditions, an \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d in both parties would support that. But if you ask him if he knows that the Affordable Care Act is responsible for that rule, Obama continued, \u201cYou\u2019d get an argument with at least half those folks; \u2018Nah that\u2019s not what it\u2019s doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdministration officials say the political debate over Obamacare\u2019s approach to expanding coverage has overwhelmed its other goals, including transforming the way medical care is delivered and paid for. The ACA includes sweeping measures to encourage doctors and hospitals to emphasize quality of care over quantity. It aims to change financial incentives in the private sector and encourage states to experiment with new ways of structuring their health systems.\n\nPayment reform, as these efforts are broadly known, is a key area \u201cwhere there could be common ground,\u201d Chen said.\n\nTennessee is already an example of the potential for cooperation. In 2013, Haslam launched an ambitious payment reform initiative that aims to improve coordination among the various doctors who might treat an individual patient and pay providers based on outcomes, not per procedure.\n\nDuring his discussion at Taylor Stratton Elementary School in Nashville\u2019s Madison neighborhood, Obama heaped praise on Tennessee\u2019s \u201cstrong history of innovation of healthcare\u201d and noted that the state won $65 million in federal Obamacare grant funds to help.\n\nBut Haslam skipped the event and did not greet Obama at Nashville\u2019s Berry Field Air National Guard Base. It\u2019s not the first time Haslam \u2014 who is now term-limited after a landslide reelection in November \u2014 has steered clear of Obama\u2019s visits to the Volunteer State. But this time his absence served their shared goal.\n\nAt a news conference on Tuesday, Obama said his next health-related priority is to persuade \u201csome governors \u2014 that have been holding out and resisting expanding Medicaid primarily for political reasons \u2014 to think about what they can do for their citizens.\u201d Haslam has been open since last year to accepting millions of federal Obamacare dollars to expand Medicaid eligibility to about 200,000 -income Tennesseans.\n\nLike other conservative governors \u2014 such as Mike Pence in Indiana, Gary Herbert in Utah and Matt Mead in Wyoming \u2014 Haslam negotiated an alternative to traditional expansion that leans more on private insurance and calls on some beneficiaries to help pay for their own coverage.\n\nBut like Herbert and Mead, Haslam has been unable to gain the support of his Legislature. (Pence was able to enact expansion without getting statehouse signoff.) It has already failed twice, and advocates are pessimistic about its prospects next session.\n\n\u201cOur perception is that expansion is off the table in the General Assembly right now,\u201d said Bradley Jackson of the Tennessee Chamber for Commerce and Industry, which supports Haslam\u2019s effort. Instead, legislators are increasingly calling for reforms to the existing Medicaid program.\n\nAdvocates have blamed advertising by the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity for blocking expansion, dubbed \u201cInsure Tennessee,\u201d in part to differentiate it from \u201cObamacare.\u201d But it\u2019s also true that Obama, and by extension his signature law, remains deeply unpopular in red states.\n\n\u201cIf Obamacare was the success this president claims it is, it would not have landed at the Supreme Court on three separate occasions to begin with and he would not be traveling cross country to rally support for the failing law five years after it was enacted,\u201d Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) said in a statement released Monday. \u201cThe President has picked the wrong location to take a victory lap on the Supreme Court\u2019s irresponsible ruling and my conservative colleagues and I will not relent in the fight to fully repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nStill, Obama sought to remind Republicans that some of the most contentious parts of Obamacare incorporate ideas they once endorsed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mind stealing from Mitt Romney,\u201d Obama said, referring to the exchange system his 2012 rival set up as governor of Massachusetts.\n\nChen, the former Romney adviser, thinks there will be a \u201cnarrow window\u201d for Obama to work with Republicans on issues like payment reform, but it will probably last just a few weeks. As the GOP primary heats up in the fall, Chen said, it will be \u201cvery, very difficult for anything to get done because all that energy is going to get sucked up in the campaign.\u201d\n\nRachana Pradhan contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The president visits Tennessee in an effort to convince Republicans to `move on.\u2019", "title": "Obama takes an Obamacare victory lap", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/barack-obama-takes-an-obamacare-victory-lap-119615.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/25/150625_obama_gty_11601.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Barack Obama,Health Care,Republicans,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The president visits Tennessee in an effort to convince Republicans to `move on.\u2019", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca146\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare is the law of the land, President Barack Obama says, and it\u2019s time for Republicans who oppose it to move on.\nSo as he called on the country to move beyond politics and work on the less controversial missions of reducing costs and improving quality of care, Obama took pains to avoid being too confrontational.\nThat\u2019s the message a jocular, relaxed Obama delivered during a visit to Tennessee on Wednesday, taking victory lap just six days after the Supreme Court upheld the legislation that created Obamacare in a case known as King v.
