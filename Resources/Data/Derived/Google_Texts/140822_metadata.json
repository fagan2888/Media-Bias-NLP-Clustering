Mr. Obama blasted the GOP\u2019s actions and warned that he will act on his own soon to deal with the surge of illegal immigrants at the Mexican border.\n\nPHOTOS: See Obama's biggest White House fails\n\nBut Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, chairman of the House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, said Mr. Obama refuses to work with the GOP on measures that would grow the economy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve focused on solutions to rein in big government, and help grow our economy,\u201d Mr. Walden said in the weekly Republican address. \u201cThe House has passed more than 40 jobs bills, but the president and his party refuse to give them a hearing.\u201d\n\nMr. Walden accused the president of being \u201cdisengaged when he should be leading.\u201d\n\n\u201cEspecially when we have an economy leaving people behind \u2026 a debt bigger than the size of our economy \u2026 a humanitarian crisis at our southern border \u2026 the IRS targeting Americans for their political beliefs \u2026 the rolling disaster that is ObamaCare,\u201d Mr. Walden said. \u201cThese are the problems he promised to solve, but instead he\u2019s become a part of them.\u201d\n\nHe said the most certain way to improve the situation will come in November\u2019s mid-term elections.\n\n\u201cIn 94 days, we get to do more than just hope,\u201d Mr. Walden said. \u201cWe have the chance to deliver the accountability that cannot come soon enough.\u201d\n\nIn his address, the president hailed the new employment report Friday that showed the creation of more than 200,000 jobs in July, on top of about 300,000 jobs in June.\n\n\u201cThe economy is clearly getting stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cThings are clearly getting better. But imagine how much farther along our economy would be \u2014 how much stronger our country would be \u2014 if Congress would do its job.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama said if voters pressure lawmakers during the month of August, \u201cwhen they return from vacation next month, instead of trying to pass partisan bills on party lines, hopefully we can come together with the sense of common purpose that you expect.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama urged Americans Saturday to pressure Republican lawmakers who are on vacation in their districts to support his economic agenda, including a hike in the federal minimum wage.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama urged Americans Saturday to pressure Republican lawmakers who are on vacation in their districts to support his economic agenda, including a hike in the federal minimum wage.", "title": "Obama says GOP must be hounded on economy; Republicans cite 40 jobs bills passed by House", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/2/obama-says-gop-must-be-hounded-jobs-republicans-ci/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/01/immigrationjpeg-010cf.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/01/immigrationjpeg-010cf.jpg", "description": "President Obama urged Americans Saturday to pressure Republican lawmakers who are on vacation in their districts to support his economic agenda, including a hike in the federal minimum wage.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama says GOP must be hounded on economy; Republicans cite 40 jobs bi"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor, Social Issues, Politics, Congress, Greg Walden"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019ve focused on solutions to rein in big government, and help grow our economy,\u201d Mr. Walden said in the weekly Republican address.\nPresident Obama urged Americans Saturday to pressure Republican lawmakers who are on vacation in their districts to support his economic agenda, including a hike in the federal minimum wage.\n\u201cIn 94 days, we get to do more than just hope,\u201d Mr. Walden said.\nMr. Obama blasted the GOP\u2019s actions and warned that he will act on his own soon to deal with the surge of illegal immigrants at the Mexican border.\n\u201cIf you see your Member of Congress around home this month, tell him or her what\u2019s on your mind,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his weekly address."}
