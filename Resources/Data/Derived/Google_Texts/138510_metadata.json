The strike is a result of breakdowns in contract negotiations that have been ongoing between the technicians and the administration since May 2014.\n\nTechnicians operate machines and shop spaces in RISD\u2019s studios, ensuring a safe environment for students. Without the technicians, professors are unable to use these spaces during classes.\n\n\u201cThe campus has been basically shut down,\u201d said Erik Lack, president of the RISD Student Alliance, adding that many professors have moved classes to the Fleet Library, other school buildings, cafes or parks.\n\nStudent responses to the strike range from impassioned to respectful, Lack said, adding that some refuse to cross the picket lines and enter the technicians\u2019 workplaces, while others have supported the technicians by joining the picket lines, Lack said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any students that don\u2019t value the work that the techs do,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cRISD believes in freedom of expression and respects the technicians\u2019 right to strike,\u201d wrote Jaime Marland, RISD director of public relations, in an email to The Herald. \u201cAt the same time, the college\u2019s primary concern is students\u2019 education. Arrangements are being made to minimize the impact of such an action.\u201d\n\nThough RISD administrators have expressed hope that the strike will conclude soon, neither the administration nor the technicians are currently willing to budge in contract negotations that have spanned several months.\n\nNegotiations began in May in preparation for the previous contract\u2019s June expiration date.\n\nIn June 2014, the union proposed a wage increase of 3 percent and an increase in retirement contributions from 8 to 10 percent, said Tucker Houlihan, president of the RISD Technical Association. The latter increase would return technician\u2019s retirement contributions to pre-2008 recession levels.\n\nThe contract RISD proposed in the summer \u201cmade no change to their retirement contributions, nor were the technicians singled out in 2008,\u201d said Brian Goldberg, associate vice president for strategic initiatives in the office of the RISD president.\n\nHealth care premiums emerged as another major sticking point in the negotiations.\n\nThe most significant disagreement came over the university\u2019s proposal to increase the percentage that technicians paid for their health care premiums by 5 percent, citing the passage of the Affordable Care Act and increasing premium costs as motivating factors, Houlihan said.\n\nBut \u201cthe premiums did not go up this year,\u201d Houlihan said, adding that nonetheless, the administration \u201cshifted the cost on us.\u201d\n\nThis fall, RISD offered a \u201cpackage deal,\u201d in hopes of settling the dispute, Houlihan said. The terms of the proposal included a 5 percent health care premium increase, a 2.25 percent wage increase and an 8 percent retirement contribution. The deal would also replace the retroactive wage increase for the months spent during contract negotiations with a signing bonus slightly lower in sum.\n\nIn October, union negotiators brought the university\u2019s contract proposal to union membership for ratification on two occasions, with the proposal failing each time, Goldberg said.\n\nWhen Houlihan brought the proposal to the union membership for a vote, he warned that it would be \u201chard to get a majority,\u201d he said. Only four out of 44 members supported the proposal.\n\nAfter the first proposal failed to pass, the administration offered the same proposal again as its \u201clast, best proposal,\u201d Houlihan said. Still, the proposal remained unpopular, with just seven out of 44 members in support.\n\nThe school then chose to declare an impasse, which legally allows the administration to implement the terms of the proposal without a finalized contract, Goldberg said.\n\n\u201cRISD felt it was important to implement the terms of the October agreement so that technicians would receive raises prior to the holiday season,\u201d Marland wrote.\n\n\u201cThey very wisely declared an impasse and made us start paying more for our health costs, even though the premiums didn\u2019t go up,\u201d Houlihan said. Under the new health care costs, employees who made under $100,000 saw their share of premium costs increase, those earning between $100,000 and $150,000 saw a decrease and those making over $150,000 saw their share stay the same.\n\n\u201cThrough a federal mediator, RISD continued a dialogue with the (Technical) Association over the winter,\u201d Marland wrote. \u201cIn late March, RISD and the union\u2019s bargaining team reached another agreement (also signed by the union president), which extended the contract from a three-year to a four-year term. Again, RISD technicians did not ratify the agreement.\u201d\n\nSince the impasse, the two sides have met twice \u2014 on Dec. 19 and again on March 25, Houlihan said.\n\nOn both occasions, Joe Whelan \u2014 a contract labor lawyer hired by RISD in December \u2014 said the administration was \u201cnot going to negotiate,\u201d and that \u201cif we talk about anything, it has to be revenue-neutral,\u201d meaning that it would not incur further costs to RISD, Houlihan said.\n\nThe technicians have demonstrated more willingness to compromise.\n\nThe union proposed a pre-ratified offer that accepted the terms implemented after the impasse, with a stipulation asking the administration to put the 8 percent retirement contribution into the contract. The contribution is currently a benefit, not a contractual obligation, for anyone who is not a full-time faculty member, Houlihan said. The union also included a concession that, in the case of another economic downturn, RISD could lower the 8 percent, he added.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a guarantee we don\u2019t make to any of our staff unions,\u201d Goldberg said, adding that the contract has a clause that requires the administration to give unions 60 days notice if the retirement benefit changes.\n\nThe \u201cunion filed an unfair labor practice with the National Labor Board in Boston three weeks ago,\u201d Houlihan said. \u201cWe want (the administration) back at the table to negotiate. Not to talk, to negotiate.\u201d\n\n\u201cRISD\u2019s offer remains open, and we are willing to meet with the technicians to discuss these issues at any time,\u201d Marland wrote. \u201cThe college is hopeful the strike will conclude quickly.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Brown Daily Herald", "description": "Forty-four RISD technicians have been on strike since Thursday, shutting down many of the school\u2019s studios and impeding access to certain buildings.", "title": "RISD tech strike impedes academics", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Wang_Risd-Protest_Danielle-Perelman.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-06T02:05:28+00:00", "url": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/04/06/risd-tech-strike-impedes-academics/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Metro", "tag": "Top Stories", "published_time": "2015-04-06T00:30:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-06T02:05:28+00:00"}, "description": "Forty-four RISD technicians have been on strike since Thursday, shutting down many of the school\u2019s studios and impeding access to certain buildings.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Elaina Wang"}, "article_summary": "\u201cRISD believes in freedom of expression and respects the technicians\u2019 right to strike,\u201d wrote Jaime Marland, RISD director of public relations, in an email to The Herald.\nAfter the first proposal failed to pass, the administration offered the same proposal again as its \u201clast, best proposal,\u201d Houlihan said.\nAgain, RISD technicians did not ratify the agreement.\u201dSince the impasse, the two sides have met twice \u2014 on Dec. 19 and again on March 25, Houlihan said.\nIn October, union negotiators brought the university\u2019s contract proposal to union membership for ratification on two occasions, with the proposal failing each time, Goldberg said.\nThe strike is a result of breakdowns in contract negotiations that have been ongoing between the technicians and the administration since May 2014."}
