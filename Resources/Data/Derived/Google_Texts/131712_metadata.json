Luckily for Whitehead, Cheetah Mobile\u2019s CM Locker app snapped a picture of the man who later found the device.\n\nWhitehead is now using Facebook to share the photo of the man believed to have her son\u2019s phone, hoping someone will recognize him and the device can be returned to its rightful teenage owner.\n\nAccording to a Cheetah Mobile spokesman, the app was made to do exactly what it did for Whitehead\u2019s son \u2014 catch phone intruders and eliminate the threat of phone theft.\n\n\u201cWe saw Heidi\u2019s story on the news and how she was trying to get her son\u2019s phone back based on pictures they obtained using our app, and it struck a nerve with us,\u201dsaid Josh Ong, the director of communications for Cheetah Mobile. \u201cWe all know how it feels to lose a phone, and it doesn\u2019t feel good.\u201d\n\nThe concept is simple \u2014 when the phone passcode is entered incorrectly three times, the app will automatically snap an \u201cintruder selfie\u201d and e-mail the photo to the device\u2019s owner.\n\nBecause the Whitehead family has yet to locate the missing phone, Cheetah Mobile decided to introduce a little incentive.\n\nThey are now offering a brand new Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge for anyone who helps finding the lost device by sharing Whitehead\u2019s Facebook posts.\n\n\u201cEssentially we saw this as a something we could do for people who lose their phones,\u201d said Tyler Hayes, senior communications manager for Cheetah Mobile. \u201cIf somebody can identify the person in the photo or somehow lead us to his phone, then we\u2019ll give you a brand new phone.\u201d\n\nOng said that while the app can\u2019t guarantee that every phone can be found, the company hopes it will act as a deterrent for people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise think twice about finding and keeping a lost device.\n\n\u201cMaybe people will think more before their photo will end up all over the Internet, or maybe people who find phones will be a little more honest,\u201d Ong said. \u201cWe\u2019re not accusing this particular guy of a crime, but I\u2019m a few years out from being a teen myself, and I can feel this kid\u2019s pain. This stuff happens, but it\u2019s tough to go without.\u201d\n\nCheetah Mobile said that in a week, if Whitehead\u2019s son hasn\u2019t found his phone, the company will give the Samsung Galaxy to him as compensation for his loss.\n\nNatalie Munio: 303-954-1666, nmunio@denverpost.com or @nataliemunio", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Help Denver teen find his phone, get a new one yourself", "title": "Help Denver teen find his phone, get a new one yourself", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/14/help-denver-teen-find-his-phone-get-a-new-one-yourself/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160214__SamSung_Galaxyp1.jpg", "height": 444}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160214__SamSung_Galaxyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-14T11:38:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T03:04:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd576d\"", "article_summary": "Because the Whitehead family has yet to locate the missing phone, Cheetah Mobile decided to introduce a little incentive.\nLuckily for Whitehead, Cheetah Mobile\u2019s CM Locker app snapped a picture of the man who later found the device.\nAccording to a Cheetah Mobile spokesman, the app was made to do exactly what it did for Whitehead\u2019s son \u2014 catch phone intruders and eliminate the threat of phone theft.\nA teenager losing a cell phone is not a new phenomenon, but for a mobile app developer and one lucky Denver teen, this classic case of everyday misfortune has turned into a full-fledged Internet investigation.\nHeidi Whitehead reported last month that her son, Jesus, lost his cell phone while taking their family dog for a walk."}
