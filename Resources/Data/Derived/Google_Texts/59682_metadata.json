(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nMaybe the fan flying overhead will get his wish.\n\nBefore host Miami suffered a 58-0 obliteration at the hands of No. 6 Clemson, someone again commissioned a private jet to send a message to the University of Miami brass, an act which has become as customary as the Cuban sandwiches at Sun Life Stadium.\n\nThe plane dragged a banner through sunny skies before kickoff, proclaiming \u201cOur pilot has as many Top 25 wins #FireAlGolden.\u201d\n\nUnless the pilot entered Saturday morning with three wins over ranked opponents, the sign is inaccurate \u2014 in addition to grammatically unsound. Golden dropped to 3-15 in his coaching career against ranked opponents, and 3-10 with Miami.\n\nThe spirit of the sign lingers over Miami, which is still seeking its first ACC championship in its 12th year in the league. Fans chanted \u201cFire Golden\u201d starting in the second quarter Saturday.\n\nGolden is now 32-25, and 17-18 in ACC play, in his fifth season coaching the Hurricanes.\n\nThe day was an all-around disaster for Miami, on and off the field. Fans were fighting amongst themselves in the first half Saturday, arrested and escorted from the stadium.\n\nThe Hurricanes did honor multiple alumni on the field Saturday, including former NFL players Willis McGahee, Kellen Winslow Jr., Santana Moss, Reggie Wayne and Vinny Testaverde.\n\nMiami athletic director Blake James told the Sun-Sentinel after Saturday\u2019s game the loss was \u201cdisappointing,\u201d but would not make a coaching change and \u201cwe\u2019ll go and get ready to play Duke\u201d next weekend.\n\nKaaya out\n\nMaking matters worse for Miami: sophomore quarterback Brad Kaaya, the ACC\u2019s leader in passing yards, was knocked out with concussion symptoms in the second quarter.\n\nWhen Clemson defensive end Shaq Lawson slammed Kaaya to the ground for his second sack of the day, that marked the end of the afternoon for Kaaya. The Tigers only brought two rushers on that particular third-down sack.\n\n\u201cProbably the best hit I\u2019ve had since I started playing football,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cPut my mind on that (Jadeveon) Clowney hit a little bit.\u201d\n\nKaaya finished 6 of 10 for 51 yards and an interception.\n\nLeggett sets record\n\nOn the visitor\u2019s sideline, tight end Jordan Leggett got the party started with a nifty 34-yard touchdown reception on a throwback play from Deshaun Watson.\n\nThat marked Leggett\u2019s sixth touchdown catch, and his fifth straight game with a score, which sets an all-time record among Clemson tight ends. The Tigers\u2019 entire arsenal of tight ends totaled six touchdown catches in the 2013-14 seasons combined.\n\nReader returns\n\nSenior defensive tackle D.J. Reader checked into the game with 18 seconds remaining in the first quarter, making his season debut after missing the first six games due to undisclosed personal reasons.\n\nReader recorded a tackle early in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cI feel fresh,\u201d Reader said afterward. \u201cI\u2019m not going to try to rush myself into anything, just go out and take advantage of the time I\u2019ve got left.\u201d\n\nCain unable\n\nWide receiver Deon Cain, a true freshman from Tampa, entered Saturday as the team\u2019s No. 2 receiver with 263 yards this season. He did not play due to a coach\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cI needed to get his attention. A little attitude adjustment, really,\u201d Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s good for some of these guys to stand over there and realize you can win without them. But he handled it the right way.\u201d\n\nSenior wideout Charone Peake led the Tigers with five receptions and 44 yards.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Clemson notes: Leggett stands out, Cain sits out, Reader speaks out, Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Clemson-Miami,D.J.
