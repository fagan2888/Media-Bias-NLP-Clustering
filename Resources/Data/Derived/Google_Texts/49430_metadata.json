The stays had only left him weaker, harder to care for at home and more prone to the infections that sent him back to the hospital.\n\nThis time she had fiercely opposed his being discharged to anywhere but home, a small apartment in Manhattan her parents had shared for half a century before her mother\u2019s death.\n\nYet over her protests and his own, he had been transferred here anyway, to Jewish Home Lifecare in Manhattan, a sprawling institution an hour from where she lived. Later, he would ask, \u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t put me here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter what I do, they want you in a nursing home,\u201d Stefanides told him, promising the placement would be temporary. \u201cI think they\u2019re making money off you.\u201d\n\nA BAFFLING SYSTEM\n\nRecords would show that her father\u2019s case let the nursing home collect $682.48 a day from Medicare, about five times the cost of a day of home care.\n\nBy now Stefanides was a veteran of battles with the health care system, but it still baffled her. A public-school teacher, she could not afford out-of-pocket home care, and though her father qualified for both Medicaid and Medicare, the flow of money seemed to bypass what he actually wanted at the end of life.\n\nHome care agencies abruptly dropped or refused high-needs cases like her father\u2019s as unprofitable under changes in the state\u2019s Medicaid program. Hospitals, eager to clear beds, increasingly sent patients to nursing homes. The nursing homes were often too short-staffed to reliably change diapers but still drew premium Medicare rates, ordering hours of physical therapy that studies showed was often useless or harmful.\n\nEven hospice was limited. Now mostly for-profit, hospice companies would provide supervision and visits through Medicare if a doctor certified that Andrey had six months to live. The catch: He would lose all Medicaid home care, the daily help he needed to be home at all.\n\nAt 54, Stefanides was still slim as a girl and fragile-looking. For most of the past year, she had lifted and rolled and washed her father by herself after the home care aide\u2019s eight-hour shift ended. She would rush to her father\u2019s place from the East Harlem school where she taught fifth grade, feed him supper and get him in pajamas, leave him sleeping and then head home to her husband and dogs. She was prepared to do as much again, but she could not quit her job. And now the home care agency had refused to reinstate her father\u2019s aide services.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in and out of the hospital too much,\u201d an office manager for the agency said. \u201cThis is not allowing our girls to make any money.\u201d\n\nHer father was a World War II veteran who had worked the night shift in the Murray Hill post office. She was his health care proxy and had power of attorney. But what good was all that?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible situation they\u2019ve put us in,\u201d Stefanides said in an agitated message left on this reporter\u2019s voice mail. \u201cMy father wants to die at home; he knows he\u2019s dying. And here I am proving I\u2019m power of attorney, that I\u2019m guardian, and it means nothing, it falls on deaf ears.\u201d\n\nDYING IN AMERICA\n\nWhile Joseph Andrey\u2019s daughter battled the system, a panel appointed by the federally funded Institute of Medicine was preparing a sweeping critique of such cases. The report, \u201cDying in America,\u201d calls for a fundamental overhaul of end-of-life care.\n\nFor most people, death does not come suddenly, the report points out. With 48 times as many people reaching 85 than a century ago, the likely course of death is long and unpredictable. The immediate family is older, too, often literally unable to do the heavy lifting for the long haul.\n\nYet the system was never engineered to support families through this, and its financial incentives reward harmful transitions among homes, hospitals and nursing homes, said Dr. Joan M. Teno, a gerontologist and one of the report\u2019s authors.\n\n\u201cWe have these frail older people moving about in the medical-industrial complex that we\u2019ve constructed,\u201d Teno said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about profit margins. It\u2019s not about caring for people.\u201d\n\nMany geriatric experts say that if the wasteful medical spending on this stage of life could be redirected, it could pay for all the social supports and services actually needed by today\u2019s fragile elders and their families. Instead, public money benefits health care businesses but not necessarily patients.\n\nAs for dying at home, \u201cyou can\u2019t believe the forces of the system that are arrayed against it,\u201d said Jack Resnick, once a health system executive and now a doctor with a geriatric house-call practice. \u201cThe way the reimbursement system works, these decisions are not made on the basis of what the individuals need. They\u2019re based on what the institutions need.\u201d\n\nTo Dr. Joanne Lynn, a hospice physician consulted for the report, the problem goes beyond perverse financial incentives. Most developed countries spend much less on medical care than the United States, but nearly twice as much on social supports.\n\n\u201cWhy can I get a $100,000 drug but I can\u2019t get supper?\u201d she asked, pointing to the budget sequestration that slashed federal spending on meals for seniors last year.\n\nIn the end, only a humane case-by-case approach can provide the right care for the last chapter of a long life like Joseph Andrey\u2019s, added Lynn, who directs the Center for Elder Care and Advanced Illness at the Altarum Institute.\n\n\u201cYou have to get to know the real situation, what this person really needs to live comfortably and to have some meaning in their lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are more than just bodies with heartbeats.\u201d\n\n\u2018REHABILITATION\u2019\n\nAndrey\u2019s health worsened after he was widowed in 2009. But the less he could walk, the more he loved being home after brief hospital stays, nested with his Nat King Cole albums, cared for by live-in aides through Medicaid.\n\nHe was in Lenox Hill Hospital for a urinary tract infection in spring 2011 when a discharge worker called Stefanides at school: He would not be sent home, because his home health agency had ended his services. Instead, he was to go to a nursing home for rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Stefanides declared, rushing over. His hospital bed was empty. \u201cWhere\u2019s my dad?\u201d she cried.\n\nHe had been whisked to a nursing home. And for more than a year, as his legs atrophied and he begged to go home, she was unable to get him out: No home health agency would take him.\n\nAt the last moment, Stefanides cobbled together his escape: She persuaded a company to provide eight hours of home care on weekdays \u2014 much less than the live-in care he had before \u2014 while her husband signed papers promising to do the rest. In reality, the schedule relied on her visits and a neighbor.\n\nBut in 2013, the home care company, under new ownership, dropped her father, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital sent him for rehabilitation to another nursing home.\n\nThat facility sent him to the hospital after 10 days, with a recurrent infection from an improperly placed catheter, medical records show. The hospital soon discharged him to the next nursing home, where orders for therapy and skilled services brought the price of his care up to $682.48 daily under Medicare.\n\nDay by day, he was sinking. On arrival May 22 last year, Andrey was \u201calert and verbal,\u201d with a good appetite, clinical notes said. Less than a week later, he was eating half his food. On Day 12, he was found on the floor: He had fallen from bed, hurting his knee.\n\nBy Day 14, when Medicare had spent nearly $10,000 on his care, a pressure sore was eroding the flesh of his right heel. Ulcers later covered his left buttock and feet. When physical therapy ended, the wounds became another reason for the institution to extend his stay, now costing Medicare $585.49 a day.\n\n\u2018MY FATHER\u2019S DYING!\u2019\n\nIn mid-August 2013, emaciated Alzheimer\u2019s patients wandered into Andeey\u2019s shabby room. From a skinny 138 pounds on admission, he was dwindling to 128.\n\n\u201cWhy am I with these people?\u201d he would ask his daughter. \u201cWhy am I losing this weight?\u201d\n\n\u201cDad, this is all through atrophy,\u201d she told him. \u201cWe have to get you moving again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey never move me,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m lucky if they come to change me.\u201d\n\nOne Sunday evening, Stefanides and her husband found her father falling from bed, in agony from his contracted legs. His pain medication, Oxycodone, had been halted \u2014 \u201cdoctor\u2019s orders,\u201d the head nurse said when Stefanides confronted her, adding something about preventing kidney damage.\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s dying; put him on goddamn morphine!\u201d Stefanides cried. The flustered nurse gave her a number to reach a doctor. But the one who picked up said angrily that he was off the clock, and hung up. Not until Monday could a doctor be found.\n\nBy then, Stefanides felt as though she were petitioning for her father\u2019s release from prison. Another month went by. All told, four months, 11 days and $61,033.62.\n\nAt 6:45 p.m. on Oct. 2, 2013, Joseph Andrey left the nursing home by stretcher, his daughter at his side. He was carried up the stairs to the old apartment, newly equipped with a special bed.\n\nNearly immobile, his skin frayed and flesh gaping, Andrey needed more care than his aides could give. When one asked for more help, Stefanides called the case manager. The case was already too costly, she was told.\n\nWhen he had trouble breathing, his aide called 911, and he went by ambulance to the emergency room. Ten days later, he had a septic ulcer in his scrotum.\n\nThe result: Emergency surgery, a different antibiotic, 13 days in the hospital ($108,895.37), followed by a brief discharge home without pain pills or a refill for his anti-seizure medicine \u2014 and a seizure that sent him back. Two days in medical isolation while doctors ruled out multidrug-resistant bacteria ($20,721.82). Home again, increasingly incoherent.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, suffering chills, fever and mental confusion, he went back to the hospital for the third time in three months.\n\n\u201cThank you for keeping me alive,\u201d he told his daughter, teary with gratitude, when he emerged from days of delirium. \u201cAre you taking me home?\u201d\n\nThe doctors said there was nothing more to be done. Now they wanted him sent somewhere to die. They urged hospice. On Jan. 29, her father unintelligible again, she reluctantly signed the papers.\n\nHe died on the third morning, before Stefanides arrived, on Feb. 1, three weeks before his 92nd birthday.\n\nRecords showed that in the last year of his life, his care cost at least $1 million. Was that the best, she wondered, that $1 million could buy?\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t die in his bed, and that\u2019s what he wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cI still feel that I let him down.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/10/END_LIFE_CARE_1.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf22c\"", "article_summary": "Now she was determined to fulfill her father\u2019s dearest wish, the wish so common among frail, elderly people: to die at home.\nBy now Stefanides was a veteran of battles with the health care system, but it still baffled her.\nShe was his health care proxy and had power of attorney.\nInstead, public money benefits health care businesses but not necessarily patients.\nHer father had been discharged by a hospital to a nursing home so many times she had lost count."}
