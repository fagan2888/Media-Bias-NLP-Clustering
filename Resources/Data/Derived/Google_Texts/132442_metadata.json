(David Royal - Monterey Herald)\n\nSalinas >> It\u2019s only been 5\u00bd years since Ray Bullick took over as Monterey County\u2019s director of health, but plenty of change has occurred in the Health Department during his short tenure.\n\nBullick, who plans to retire from heading up the county\u2019s largest department next week, has overseen everything from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act to the designation of the county\u2019s first Level II trauma center at county-owned Natividad Medical Center, as well as a shift toward community health policymaking.\n\nThe 62-year-old Bullick is retiring as the head of a 1,000-employee department with a $200 million annual budget for personal reasons, although he won\u2019t get into specifics. He says part of him would also like to stay on until he was 65.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot left to be done, and we have a core of department managers really on board, and that makes it really difficult to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes the decision is made for you.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors is set to recognize Bullick\u2019s work at the head of the department charged with everything from behavioral health and emergency medical services to environmental health and animal services.\n\nBullick says his proudest achievement during his tenure was an \u201cevolution\u201d toward long-term strategic planning and policy aimed at improving community health and health equity.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m most proud of is changing our strategic plan approach,\u201d Bullick said. \u201cThat\u2019s been the driving force to moving in the direction we\u2019re going. If I\u2019m going to be known for one thing, that would be it. That\u2019s going to be an asset for a long time, and the Board of Supervisors has been very supportive. The board established community health as a priority and we need that long-term thinking.\u201d\n\nUnder his watch, the county health department initiated its first-ever five-year strategic plan covering 2011-15 that established a policy blueprint for taking aim at addressing health inequities based on ethnicity, environment and education, and established a new policy and planning unit headed by Dr. Krista Hanni.\n\nDuring that time, the department implemented a Health in all Policies initiative that sought to incorporate community health into decisions involving everything from land use to public safety, and helped implement an Early Childhood Development initiative that focused on the link between third-grade literacy and crime. It also helped influence the direction of the county\u2019s Gang Violence Prevention initiative, renamed the \u201cAction Plan for Building Safe and Thriving Communities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the department actively worked with the California Endowment-funded Building Healthy Communities program focused on improving community health in East Salinas through a range of initiatives including political activism.\n\nSupervisor Simon Salinas said Bullick brought \u201ca lot of new ideas\u201d to bear on improving community health during his time with the county, noting that Bullick oversaw expansion of health services to his constituents in the Salinas Valley.\n\n\u201cHe really pushed for accessibility to health and mental health services,\u201d Salinas said.\n\nSupervisor Jane Parker said Bullick was instrumental in developing both the ViaCare program for the uninsured as a bridge to the ACA and the pilot program offering limited health care services to county residents in the country illegally. Parker said he also devoted a lot of time and energy to collaborating with other county departments and community organizations. He worked on everything from alternatives to incarceration and rehabilitation and treatment for substance abuse to homelessness.\n\n\u201cHe was in the middle of all these big changes happening,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sad to see him leave.\u201d\n\nBullick said he plans to return to Visalia, where he previously headed up the Tulare County health department, to spend time with family in retirement. He said he would have liked to have stayed with Monterey County until age 65, noting a list of initiatives that still need to be completed. Those range from developing a \u201cstronger nexus\u201d between the county health department and Natividad offering fully coordinated services to a safe drinking water ordinance and joint management of animal services between the county and the city of Salinas.\n\nThe department is also poised to attain national accreditation status after years of effort by this summer.\n\nBullick rejected any notion that his departure was related to several lawsuits filed by current and former county health employees, mostly from Behavioral Health and the Public Guardian unit, calling them simply personnel issues.\n\nJim Johnson can be reached at 831-726-4348.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salinas >> It\u2019s only been 5\u00bd years since Ray Bullick took over as Monterey County\u2019s director of health, but plenty of change has occurred in the Health Department during his short tenure.Bullick, who plans to retire fro", "title": "Retiring county health director led way on community health policy shift", "og": {"url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20160220/NEWS/160229971", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.montereyherald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NF/20160220/NEWS/160229971/AR/0/AR-160229971.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1142px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Retiring county health director led way on community health policy shift"}, "twitter": {"domain": "montereyherald.com", "description": "Salinas >> It\u2019s only been 5\u00bd years since Ray Bullick took over as Monterey County\u2019s director of health, but plenty of change has occurred in the Health Department during his short tenure.Bullick, who plans to retire fro", "title": "Retiring county health director led way on community health policy shift", "url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20160220/NEWS/160229971", "image": {"src": "http://www.montereyherald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NF/20160220/NEWS/160229971/AR/0/AR-160229971.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@montereyherald", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id507308258", "iphone": "id507305181", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.montereyherald"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "county,news_local,public health, Public health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "county,news_local,public health, Public health"}, "article_summary": "Monterey County Health Director Ray Bullick said he plans to return to Visalia, where he previously headed up the Tulare County health department, to spend time with family in retirement.\n\u201cHe really pushed for accessibility to health and mental health services,\u201d Salinas said.\nBullick says his proudest achievement during his tenure was an \u201cevolution\u201d toward long-term strategic planning and policy aimed at improving community health and health equity.\n\u201cI\u2019m sad to see him leave.\u201dBullick said he plans to return to Visalia, where he previously headed up the Tulare County health department, to spend time with family in retirement.\nHe said he would have liked to have stayed with Monterey County until age 65, noting a list of initiatives that still need to be completed."}
