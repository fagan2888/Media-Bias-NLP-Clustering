He walked two consecutive batters, then allowed a home run that cleared the bases.\n\nHis performance anxiety, diagnosed by the Rockies last year, remains an issue. So pitching coach Steve Foster and Weiss decided to pull him from what was supposed to be a build-up, rebound appearance in an unofficial game on a side field at Salt River Fields.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to attack it. We\u2019ll put together a plan and work on some things,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cJust go to work and try to fight through.\u201d\n\nWeiss said they\u2019re still trying to find his best path, as a starter or a reliever.\n\nRaburn hits 2-for-2. New Rockies outfielder Ryan Raburn went 2-for-4 with a run scored in the \u201cB\u201d game against Arizona. Pitching prospect Antonio Senzatela was the game\u2019s standout. He threw three innings, with four strikeouts and four groundouts, while allowing two hits.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tyler Matzek scratched from \u201cB\u201d game as his Rockies struggles continue", "title": "Tyler Matzek scratched from \u201cB\u201d game as his Rockies struggles continue", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/06/tyler-matzek-scratched-from-b-game-as-his-rockies-struggles-continue/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160224__Tyler-Matzekp1-1.jpg", "height": 485}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160224__Tyler-Matzekp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-06T18:26:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:44:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "GOODYEAR, Ariz. \u2014 Tyler Matzek, the Rockies\u2019 left-hander still battling mental demons affecting his command, was scratched from a scheduled \u201cB\u201d game start Sunday.\nNew Rockies outfielder Ryan Raburn went 2-for-4 with a run scored in the \u201cB\u201d game against Arizona.\nMatzek on Wednesday gave up three runs without an out in a Cactus League game against Arizona.\nHe threw three innings, with four strikeouts and four groundouts, while allowing two hits.\nHis performance anxiety, diagnosed by the Rockies last year, remains an issue."}
