Not this time. Heading into Labor Day, gasoline averaged $3.59 a gallon. That\u2019s a slight increase over the past week. But gas still dropped 6 percent from a year ago and a few cents over the past month, according to the AAA\u2019s Daily Fuel Gauge Report.\n\nOne reason for the falling prices has been a decline in usage. American drivers burned through 9.09 million barrels of gasoline a day in 2007, according to the Energy Department. That average dropped to 8.44 million a day in the first five months of this year\u2014a 7.7 percent decrease.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing the beginning of the end of an era of high gasoline prices,\u201d said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst for the Price Futures Group. \u201cWe are as a country better positioned in our gasoline market than we have been in decades.\u201d\n\nThere are several reasons for this:\n\n\u2022 OPEC no longer has as tight a grip over consumers as it did during the 1970s, as new fracking technologies have boosted domestic oil and natural gas reserves by more than 35 percent, according to the Energy Department. North Dakota has suddenly emerged as the center of an economic boom.\n\n\u2022 An aging population means drivers are logging fewer miles on the road, so baby boomers will likely demand less gasoline with each passing year. The Federal Highway Administration found that drivers between the ages of 55 to 64 years old average 11,972 miles on the road, a total that drops to 7,646 once they pass the age of 65.\n\n\u2022 At the same time, gas mileage has improved. President Obama raised fuel standards last year, mandating that cars and light trucks will average 54.5 miles-per-gallon by 2025. This should save $8,000 over 13 years for a typical American family, according to White House estimates. \u201cThese fuel standards represent the single most important step we\u2019ve ever taken to reduce our dependence on foreign oil,\u201d Obama said at the time.\n\n\u2022 Over the last year, electric car company Tesla has become a darling of Wall Street investors and Consumer Reports\u2014which gave the Model S its highest rating of all-time. Despite the mixed reception of the Chevy Volt and Nissan Leaf, Tesla\u2019s rise has analysts believing that the era of gasoline engines is drawing to a close.\n\nRELATED: WILL A MILITARY STRIKE IN SYRIA SINK THE STOCK MARKET?\n\nThis all indicates that\u2014despite seasonal differences\u2014daily gasoline usage will continue to drop from its peak of 9 million barrels a day.\n\n\u201cI hate to put numbers on it, but do I think we could get below 8 million? Absolutely,\u201d said Flynn. \u201cCould we get below 7 million? Absolutely. \u2026 We\u2019re rewriting history as we speak, writing the last chapter of the gas guzzler.\u201d\n\nFor all the concerns caused by a lukewarm economic recovery, the United States has\u2014since the 2008 oil price spike\u2014benefitted from its waning reliance on petroleum. The change from last year\u2014when Americans spent a record percentage of their paychecks on gasoline\u2014could not be more pronounced. It just might be the most underappreciated shift in the economy, one that insulates the country from geopolitical shocks such as the potential military intervention Syria that Obama is putting before Congress.\n\nIn fact, oil and gasoline prices are poised to drop, even if the United States and its international partners retaliate against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for his use of chemical weapons in that country\u2019s civil war.\n\n\u201cDespite some of the rhetoric you hear and saber rattling about a big Persian Gulf War, you won\u2019t see tremendous disruptions out of the region,\u201d said Tom Kloza, chief analyst at the Oil Price Information Service. \u201cMy instincts tell me we\u2019re going to move lower.\u201d\n\nKloza explained that the United States is \u201cmuch more insulated vis-\u00e0-vis global oil price shocks than we were during the first Arab Spring\u201d in 2011 when the governments of Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia were overthrown. U.S. production is roughly two million barrels a day higher than in the first quarter of 2011.\n\nMost of the 400,000 barrels a day pumped out by a pre-civil war Syria was exported to Europe. That output has shrunk to 50,000 barrels a day. If the fighting in Syria spread across the Middle East, it would put at risk 1.85 million barrels a day that Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait export to the United States.\n\nProduction in America and Canada can provide 10-million daily barrels\u2014more than half of what the United States needs. \u201cThrow in Mexico and other \u2018friendlies\u2019 and we are nowhere near as vulnerable as we were in 2003 or 1990,\u201d said Kloza, referring to past incidents in which the United States waged war against Iraq.\n\nBut more importantly, the market is pointing to lower prices as Americans come out of what has been a return the traditional summer driving season in July and August. The futures market suggests that gasoline costs for the end of the year will be about $2.90 a gallon, according to Kloza\u2019s analysis.\n\nEven if oil prices climb in response to what happens in Syria, U.S. motorists should be safe from any of the swings, Kloza concluded in a written overview.\n\n\u201cWithout question, the U.S. will fare better than every other [country] if the sabers are unsheathed,\u201d he wrote", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Curious thing about the turmoil in Syria-it suggests that America is breaking its decades-long oil addiction.", "title": "Why Bombing Syria Won't Spike Gas Prices", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/03/Why-Bombing-Syria-Wont-Spike-Gas-Prices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/1880720_Oil_Iraq_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/03/Why-Bombing-Syria-Wont-Spike-Gas-Prices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/1880720_Oil_Iraq_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@joshboak"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Curious thing about the turmoil in Syria-it suggests that America is breaking its decades-long oil addiction.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde14b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are seeing the beginning of the end of an era of high gasoline prices,\u201d said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst for the Price Futures Group.\nProduction in America and Canada can provide 10-million daily barrels\u2014more than half of what the United States needs.\nEven if oil prices climb in response to what happens in Syria, U.S. motorists should be safe from any of the swings, Kloza concluded in a written overview.\nAmerican drivers burned through 9.09 million barrels of gasoline a day in 2007, according to the Energy Department.\nU.S. production is roughly two million barrels a day higher than in the first quarter of 2011."}
