Obama's dispute with unions has provided political ammunition to Republicans, who have already cited unions' complaints about Obamacare. 2013 Getty Images

The White House announced Friday that low-income workers on union health plans will not be eligible for the same federal subsidies available to those who buy insurance in the new state health care marketplaces under “Obamacare.”

However, top labor leaders left the White House after a meeting with President Barack Obama, still hoping to address concerns that Obamacare -- officially called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- will hurt their members’ health care plans.

The Obama administration’s announcement Friday is a major disappointment for labor unions. For months labor leaders have argued that without the subsidies, Obamacare would drive up the cost of some union plans.

They said this would cause employers to drop health care coverage, and would jeopardize coverage for millions of union members.

The White House is citing a Treasury Department letter saying there is no legal way for union members in multi-employer group health plans to receive subsidies.

In a statement, the White House said it will work with unions and encourage them to offer their multi-employer plans "through the marketplace, on an equal footing," and create "new, high-quality affordable options for all Americans."

But the unions would have to turn their private plans into public competitive plans open to all workers, not just union members.
