At least since the 2008 presidential race, Republicans have sought to improve health care by lessening government involvement. Democrats have favored a larger government role, culminating in the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe debate over which approach costs less while providing quality care is an endless one.\n\nMost private care is run on a fee-for-service basis, though, where health care providers have an incentive to do more care rather than less. VA doctors are salaried. A Rand Corp. study a decade ago found the VA system was significantly less expensive.\n\nMany in both parties agree that patients forced to wait weeks or months to see a doctor should instead see private caregivers, with the government paying the tab. While Democrats look at this as a temporary fix, many Republicans want the choice made permanent.\n\n\u201cVeterans who want to continue to get care through the VHA should be able to do so; those who don\u2019t should be provided private insurance just like federal employees have,\u201d said Maryland Republican Rep. Andy Harris.\n\nWaiting for care has been an issue since at least 2005, as pointed out in several reports by the inspector general\u2019s office of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe last two Republican nominees for president \u2014 Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney \u2014 supported private care for the health needs unrelated to military service of veterans. Romney backed away when the American Legion denounced his plan.\n\nPresident Barack Obama opposed the idea, and said better management and adequate funding would fix the problems with veterans\u2019 health care. The problems remain. On Friday, Obama accepted the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki.\n\nVA system\n\nThe Veterans Health Administration is the largest health care provider in the nation. It spends nearly $56 billion a year treating more than 6.2 million veterans at over 1,700 hospitals, clinics and other care facilities.\n\nThe VA health system got its start after World War I, both as a benefit for veterans and because the lifetime health needs of wounded service members were different from those of civilians. As a benefit, VA care is considerably less expensive than private health insurance or Medicare, the government health insurance for seniors and the disabled.\n\nThe VA has specialized in prosthetics, post-traumatic stress disorder and other service-related injuries.\n\nIn times of war, Congress has tended to extend veterans health benefits, while funding has lagged. Long waits for initial physician appointments have been a characteristic of the system in the aftermath of conflicts.\n\nAccess to care is now determined on a priority basis based on seven classifications. Those totally disabled during military service have top priority.\n\nTask force\n\nIn the 1980s, Congress required wealthier veterans to share in the cost of VA care. The VA also bills the private insurance carriers of veterans for nonmilitary medical needs. (About half of veterans have Medicare or private insurance.) Those provisions now pay about 6 percent ($3.1 billion) of the VA\u2019s health costs.\n\nIn 1973, Congress created a VA health benefit (CHAMPVA) for dependents and survivors of veterans killed or disabled during military service. The benefit doesn\u2019t provide access to VA medical facilities, however. It\u2019s an insurance program covering 75 percent of the cost of private medical care.\n\nThat\u2019s similar to the approach for veterans favored by several Republicans. Rep. Harris\u2019 bill would provide health insurance to veterans modeled on the federal government\u2019s plans. Veterans with service disabilities and lower incomes would not face premiums, while others could pay up to 28 percent of the premium cost.\n\nDespite repeated scandals over waiting and the quality of care received, veterans have supported their separate health care system and have given it good marks for quality. The American Legion has operated a roving task force for the last decade that seeks upgrades at various VA facilities called \u201cA System Worth Saving.\u201d\n\nFollow Jim Landers on Twitter at @landersjim.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In times of scandal, conservatives seek to privatize veterans\u2019 health care.
