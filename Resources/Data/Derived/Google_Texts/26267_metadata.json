In Vermont, however, they see a potential first step toward the kind of national government-run health care system some have advocated for years. Filmmaker Michael Moore, in a column last week blasting ObamaCare, said Vermont's plan could \"change everything.\"\n\nBut critics say the proposal goes too far and would kill thousands of jobs. \"It\u2019s not practical,\u201d Vermont state Rep. Patti Komline, who voted against the plan, told FoxNews.com. \u201cThere are too many complications involved.\u201d\n\nA single-payer plan would largely sideline the insurance industry, and instead set up a government-managed insurance system to collect all health care fees and pay out all health care costs.\n\nFull implementation of Vermont\u2019s single-payer plan could be held up for another three years, at least. In order for Green Mountain Care to fully launch in 2017, the health care exchange would have to get approval from the federal government to use federal money to fund the state program.\n\nMore On This... ObamaCare blunders part of larger single-payer plan?\n\nState law would also require Vermont to define the benefits of the single-payer program and provide a three-year budget that clocks in less than current health care costs.\n\nUniversity of Virginia public policy professor Raymond Scheppach said it will take another half decade to determine whether Vermont\u2019s controversial plan even works and if there are any real benefits associated with it. He also says that regardless of outcome, Vermont\u2019s political makeup differs from other states and therefore would not provide an accurate view of what\u2019s to come.\n\nThe single-payer debate recently resurfaced in national headlines following the Dec. 31 op-ed piece in the New York Times by Moore. In it, Moore called ObamaCare \u201cawful\u201d and said liberals have avoided speaking in public about the problems with it because they didn\u2019t want to provide the president\u2019s critics with additional ammunition.\n\nMoore went on to sing the merits of a single-payer system and said that the real problem with ObamaCare is that it is a \u201cpro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go.\u201d\n\nSupporters say the single-payer system would cut down on the administrative waste and complications associated with having multiple billers and billing systems. Opponents say such a widespread overhaul would be bad for business.\n\nVermont became the first state in the country to lay the groundwork for single-payer health care. Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, signed the plan into law in May 2011.\n\nThe initiative, which was approved by the Democratic-controlled House and Senate, promises to extend coverage to all of Vermont\u2019s 620,000 residents, of which around 47,000 residents are uninsured and 150,000 are underinsured.\n\n\"This law recognizes an economic and fiscal imperative,\" Shumlin said during a press conference when he signed the bill. \"We must control the growth in health care costs that are putting families at economic risk and making it harder for small employers to do business.\u201d\n\nThe exchange, Green Mountain Care, will set reimbursement rates for health care providers and streamline administration into a single, unified system.\n\nSome experts say a revised system would save an estimated $580 million annually, and $1.9 billion by 2019. But the single-payer system\u2019s creator, Harvard economist William Hsiao, says it could generate even greater profits for Vermont.\n\nHsiao predicts his plan would save the state 25.3 percent a year in total health care spending, lower household and employer health care spending, boost job growth and create a higher economic output for the state.\n\nThe savings, he said in a 2011 Health Affairs article, would come from tort reform for malpractice suits, better governance and lower administrative expenses. Vermont would rack up $4.6 billion in savings during the first five years of the program which he says would be used in part to cover the state\u2019s uninsured as well as to expand benefits and services.\n\nVermont\u2019s health care spending runs about $5 billion annually, with costs rising between 6.5 percent and 8.5 percent in recent years.\n\nBut not everyone is on board with the plan. It is still unknown how Vermont will pay for the plan and whether that money will come from additional taxes on its residents.\n\nKomline says despite the plan's passage, she doesn\u2019t see Vermont residents warming up to the idea of a single-payer system any time soon. She also said that Vermont, because of its small size and political makeup, is open to influence from special interest groups.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much money for special interest groups to come in and influence votes,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Vermont was among the first to legalize pot and same-sex marriages.\u201d\n\nCalls to the governor's office for comment were not
