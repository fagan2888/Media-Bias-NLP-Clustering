That was not the intention of the ACA.\u201d\n\nUnion members made national headlines Wednesday when they passed a resolution complaining that Obamacare will drive up costs of union-sponsored health plans to the point members and employers will abandon them.\n\nThe resolution says the AFL-CIO still supports the Affordable Care Act but \u2026\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to change it,\u201d Hendry told New Mexico Watchdog. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from anyone who thinks this (implementation) is moving smoothly \u2026 The rollout has been problematic.\u201d\n\nSome union leaders at the convention were much more vocal.\n\nTerry O\u2019Sullivan, president of the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, and Sean McGarvey, head of the AFL-CIO\u2019s Building and Construction Trades Department, even used the \u201cR\u201d word \u2014 repeal.\n\n\u201cIf the Affordable Care Act is not fixed and it destroys the health and welfare funds that we have fought for and stand for, then I believe it needs to be repealed,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to be repealed. We want it to be fixed, fixed, fixed.\u201d\n\nUnions have been among President Obama\u2019s biggest supporters and embraced the ACA when it was signed. But they soured on it when the administration delayed for one year the requirement that employers with at least 50 full-time workers offer health coverage.\n\nPlus, the unions complain that the act, as written, will encourage employers to hire fewer union workers or ditch their health plans altogether, forcing union members to seek lower quality coverage in the new health exchanges offered by states.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to blow it up because we don\u2019t like some parts of it,\u201d Hendry said. \u201cIt\u2019s a damn lot better than what we had before \u2026 If it doesn\u2019t get worked out then less companies will offer insurance and more people will go on Medicare and Medicaid, which is a single-payer system, which I think is a great system.\u201d\n\nFor years now, many liberals in the U.S. have called for a single-payer system entirely supported by taxpayers, such as those in Europe.\n\nThe White House is starting a national public relations campaign in support of the insurance exchanges, scheduled to launch in about three weeks.\n\nThere were reports the Obama administration tried to urge the AFL-CIO to not adopt a resolution criticizing the ACA and sent top officials to smooth things over.\n\nU.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez and Obama Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett were in Los Angeles and assured union leaders the administration is working to find solutions.\n\nIn the meantime, some Republicans want to muster an effort to stop Obamacare in its tracks by defunding it on Capitol Hill.\n\nNot surprisingly, Hendry is against that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure it out, to implement this thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to live with what we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nContact Rob Nikolewski at rob@nmwatchdog.org and follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The love affair the AFL-CIO had with the Affordable Care Act is on the rocks, but the head of the union's chapter in New Mexico still thinks the troubled marriage could work.", "title": "NM union leader on Obamacare: They're going to have to change it - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Jon-Hendry-flickr.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-13T09:24:37+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/105725/nm-union-leader-on-obamacare-theyre-going-to-have-to-change-it/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,afl-cio,New Mexico Federation of Labor,New Mexico Watchdog,ObamaCare", "published_time": "2013-09-13T08:53:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-13T09:24:37+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The love affair the AFL-CIO had with the Affordable Care Act is on the rocks, but the head of the union's chapter in New Mexico still thinks the troubled marriage could work.", "title": "NM union leader on Obamacare: They're going to have to change it - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Jon-Hendry-flickr.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce655\"", "article_summary": "The resolution says the AFL-CIO still supports the Affordable Care Act but \u2026\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to change it,\u201d Hendry told New Mexico Watchdog.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to blow it up because we don\u2019t like some parts of it,\u201d Hendry said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to live with what we\u2019ve got.\u201dContact Rob Nikolewski at rob@nmwatchdog.org and follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to be implemented in such a way that we lose what we\u2019ve got.\nIn the meantime, some Republicans want to muster an effort to stop Obamacare in its tracks by defunding it on Capitol Hill."}
