Although Farber bases his piece upon a report in The Guardian, he improves upon his source by adding substantial recent background on Smith's faith journey.\n\nThe lede is provocative, like Smith herself:\n\nPatti Smith wasn\u2019t sorry for her words then - and she isn\u2019t sorry for her actions now.\n\nLast week, the Godmother of Punk drew criticism from all sides after accepting the invitation of Pope Francis to sing at the Vatican\u2019s upcoming Christmas concert.\n\nOne Italian Catholic organization labeled the star \u201cblasphemous.\u201d Meanwhile, some hipsters found Smith\u2019s proposed appearance hypocritical, considering she opened her very first album, \"Horses,\u201d with the famous sneer, \u201cJesus died for somebody\u2019s sins/but not mine.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Smith answered her critics during a talk at the Museum of The Moving Image in New York. After being asked about the controversy by The Guardian\u2019s Vivien Goldman, who was in the audience, the rocker said, \u201cI like Pope Francis and I\u2019m happy to sing for him. Anyone who would confine me to a line from 20 years ago is a fool.\u201d\n\nFarber then goes into rock-historian mode. By his own admission, he's been writing about music since the Ford Administration, and he's well familiar with Smith's oeuvre:\n\nActually, the line comes from 40 years ago, kicking off a song called \u201cGloria (In Excelsis Deo).\u201d The track melded Smith\u2019s own transgressive poetry with a cover of Van Morrison \u2019s \u201860s hit with his band Them, \u201cGloria.\u201d\n\nThen comes the closest thing Smith offers to a mea culpa:\n\n\u201cI had a strong religious upbringing and the first word on my first LP is Jesus,\u201d Smith explained. \u201cI did a lot of thinking. I\u2019m not against Jesus, but I was 20 and I wanted to make my own mistakes. And I didn\u2019t want anyone dying for me. I stand behind that 20 year old girl, but I have evolved. I\u2019ll sing to my enemy! I don\u2019t like being pinned down and I\u2019ll say what the f--k I want - especially at my age.\u201d (Smith is now 67).\n\nGranted, Smith's coarse language (which, unlike a famous slip by Francis, was clearly intentional) won't win her any awards among Catholics who value reverence. Still, as Farber goes on to observe, there are indications she's been God-haunted for a while, and more so in recent years:\n\nThe poet-rocker has often used religious imagery in her work, for a variety of purposes. She titled her most popular album, 1978\u2019s \u201cEaster,\u201d and included in the disc lyrics that quote Psalm 23. On the cover, a cross was placed on the credits below each band member\u2019s name. The last sentence of the liner notes quotes the Second Epistle to Timothy: \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course...\"\n\nThe legendary rocker first met the Pope last spring, shaking his hand in St. Peter\u2019s Square. She has called Pope Francis \u201cvery interesting.\u201d...\n\nRecently, Smith told The Independent newspaper in the U.K. that she finds the Bible \u201cvery resonant\u201d today.\n\n\"It has everything \u2013 creation, betrayal, lust, poetry, prophecy, sacrifice,\" Smith told the paper. \"It doesn't really matter what religion you are or if you have no religion, those stories are still relevant to what people go through in their lives and they're also beautifully written passages.\"\n\nOne thing Farber neglects to note, perhaps for reasons of space, is that the topic of the Bible was raised in Smith's Independent interview because the singer had written a song for the film \"Noah\" on one of Pope Francis's favorite topics -- mercy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Veteran\u00a0Daily News\u00a0rock critic Jim Farber made a rare venture into Godbeat \r\nyesterday with a story on\u00a0Patti Smith's response to criticism\u00a0over her \r\nplanned performance at the Vatican's Christmas concert.
