But advocacy groups such as the American Health Care Association indicate the government's plans don't do nearly enough.\n\nMeaningful implementation requires a looser schedule, more implementation time and revised cost estimates, according to the Association, particularly when getting patients to buy into the concept can be such a challenge. The current proposals don't seem to acknowledge that high-quality care carries a price tag, according to John Vrba, CEO of Westmont, Illinois' Burgess Square Health Care & Rehabilitation Center, a provider that implements various patient-centered measures, such as giving some residents coffee as soon as they wake up or giving residents trips into downtown Chicago.\n\nVarious other providers are developing their own unique strategies for patient-centered care as well; for example, at Roanoke, Virginia's Carilion Clinic, a team-based, physician-led approach helps patients transition from primary care to patient-centered medical homes, FierceHealthcare previously reported, which has cut emergency department use 34 percent.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\n- check out the survey findings\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWhat patients really want from hospitals\n\nFeds speed plans for value-based payments\n\nConsumer-driven healthcare: How three organizations respond to the demands of patient-centered care\n\nDrive hospital bottom line with culture of kindness, compassion\n\nThe link between compassionate care and patient satisfaction\n\n3 ways hospitals can improve hospitality\n\n8 hospital actions for stronger patient engagement\n\nTrue patient-centered care needs a personal touch\n\nGive patients what they want: Trust, compassion\n\n3 ways to improve communication and care coordination--from the patient and family's perspective", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although the healthcare industry sees\u00a0patient-centered care\u00a0as the answer to reduce care costs and improve care quality, such a dramatic change in healthcare delivery can be a hard sell among patients,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Associated Press.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Although the healthcare industry sees\u00a0patient-centered care\u00a0as the answer to reduce care costs and improve care quality, such a dramatic change in healthcare delivery can be a hard sell among patients,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Associated Press.", "title": "Transition to patient-centered care takes patient education, greater financial incentive", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/transition-patient-centered-care-takes-patient-education-greater-financial/2015-11-09", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,fee-for-service care,Financial Incentives,Operations & Business Management,patient education,patient-centered care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "But advocacy groups such as the American Health Care Association indicate the government's plans don't do nearly enough.\n\"The more that we say that patient-centered care is something we value and that it would be rewarded, the faster that it would happen,\" he said.\nAlthough the healthcare industry sees patient-centered care as the answer to reduce care costs and improve care quality, such a dramatic change in healthcare delivery can be a hard sell among patients, according to the Associated Press.\nVarious other providers are developing their own unique strategies for patient-centered care as well; for example, at Roanoke, Virginia's Carilion Clinic, a team-based, physician-led approach helps patients transition from primary care to patient-centered medical homes, FierceHealthcare previously reported, which has cut emergency department use 34 percent.\nIncreased financial incentives are necessary to fully transform healthcare in a patient-centered direction, Marshall Chin, M.D., a professor of medicine and healthcare ethics at the University of Chicago, told the AP."}
