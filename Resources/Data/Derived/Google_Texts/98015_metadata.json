Local residents chew coca leaves, the main ingredient for cocaine when processed but which have only a mild stimulant effect in their natural form.\n\nWearing a white poncho over his white cassock to warm him against the Andean wind, Francis welcomed Bolivia\u2019s social reforms. Morales has nationalized key industries such as oil and gas to finance welfare programs and distribute wealth.\n\n\u201cProsperity understood only in terms of material wealth has a tendency to become selfish \u2026 to be unconcerned about others and to give free rein to consumerism.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstood this way, prosperity, instead of helping, breeds conflict,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his address to the pope, Morales, who had frequently clashed with Church officials in Bolivia before relations improved when Francis was elected in 2013, welcomed the pope as a homecoming hero.\n\n\u201cIn many historic moments, the Church was used for domination, subjugation and oppression. Now the Bolivian people receive you with joy and hope,\u201d said Morales, wearing a dark suit with an indigenous pattern embroidered around the lapels.\n\n\u201cWe welcome you as the chief representative of the Catholic Church coming to support the liberation of our Bolivian peoples.\u201d\n\nThe pope looked bemused when Morales handed him one of the more unusual gifts he has received: a wooden hammer and sickle \u2013 the symbol of communism \u2013 with a figure of a crucified Christ resting on the hammer.\n\nAfter spending a few hours in La Paz, the Pope, who lost part of a lung to an infection when he was a young man, moved on to the low-lying provincial city of Santa Cruz for a two-day stay.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Bolivia, communism, Pope Francis, socialism, tea", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "Leftist Bolivian president Evo Morales presented the pope with a wooden crucifix -- carved on a hammer and sickle.
