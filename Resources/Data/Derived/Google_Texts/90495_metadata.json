Trey Radel of Florida refused to resign Thursday, saying he wants to \u201crebuild the trust\u201d of voters.\n\nAt a news conference held the same day he left a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center, the 37-year-old freshman told reporters at his Cape Coral office that he will cooperate with congressional investigators who are looking into his conduct.\n\n\u201cI love what I do and I\u2019m going to return to what I do, what you sent me to do in Washington D.C., which is working for you and your family while I relish mine,\u201d Radel told voters watching on live television in his district. \u201cNo one \u2014 no one will take away my passion when it comes to serving southwest Florida.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 20, Radel pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of cocaine possession and was sentenced to a year of probation. He admitted to purchasing 3.5 grams of cocaine from an undercover officer in Washington on Oct. 29. He entered rehab on Nov. 21.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee announced Monday that it was launching a formal investigation of the congressman.\n\nSeveral GOP leaders, including Gov. Rick Scott, had asked him to resign. On Thursday, some of those same officials reiterated their calls for Radel to step down. In a statement, Scott said, \u201cI\u2019m glad that Trey has sought help, and it\u2019s my hope he continues to put his attention on rehabilitation and his family.\u201d\n\nBut standing with his wife at the evening news conference, Radel pledged to redouble his congressional efforts \u201cwith a clearer focus and a stronger mind\u201d and regain the trust of his constituents. While he declined to say whether he would run for re-election, he gave what amounted to a campaign speech, vigorously defending his legislative record and repeatedly addressing TV viewers.\n\nRadel, a former local news anchor, timed his announcement for the 6 p.m. newscasts.\n\n\u201cMy situation isn\u2019t the end, and it\u2019s not the whole story,\u201d he said, ticking off a list of priorities, including reducing the deficit and protecting Social Security and Medicare.\n\nFormer Rep. Connie Mack IV, who represented the area for eight years before a failed run for Senate last year, has been mentioned as a possible primary challenger.\n\nRadel said his drug and alcohol abuse never interfered with his official duties. \u201cThis was my personal issue on personal time,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile court documents said the lawmaker purchased cocaine on several occasions prior to his bust in October, he maintained Thursday that he had only used the drug \u201ca handful of times\u201d beginning in college. His treatment, he said, was focused on alcoholism.\n\nAsked about his support for drug testing food-stamp recipients, Radel said members of Congress \u201ccan and should be tested as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it will help someone else in the future.\u201d\n\nRadel had been in office for 10 months when he was charged. His district includes the Gulf Coast cities of Fort Myers and Naples.\n\nThe drug arrest derailed a seemingly promising career.\n\nAfter a stint as a TV news anchor, he started a media-relations firm and hosted an early-morning conservative talk-radio show in southwest Florida. He married another news anchor and they had a baby.\n\nOn Thursday, his wife, Amy, called him a \u201cgreat man\u201d and said she supported his return to public life.\n\nWhen he decided to run for Congress, he became involved in a bruising, six-way GOP primary, openly targeting opponents on the Internet and facing criticism for his firm\u2019s ownership of explicitly named websites. But he was backed by the local tea party movement and Republican luminaries, including Mack and Sen. Marco Rubio, and clinched the GOP nomination. He cruised to victory in November.\n\nThings were seemingly going well for Radel. His wife was featured in a glowing local news segment about how the couple were adjusting to life in D.C., he had sponsored a handful of bills, and he was interviewed by several inside-the-Beltway publications. He was active on Twitter and wrote pieces for Buzzfeed about rap music. (He dubbed Public Enemy\u2019s \u201cFight the Power\u201d a conservative anthem \u201cbecause I believe when government expands it becomes a political tool meant to oppress.\u201d)\n\nHe championed cuts in sheep-farm subsidies, keeping good on his conservative promise.\n\nThen, on Oct. 29, Radel attempted to buy $250 worth of cocaine from an undercover police officer in a Washington, D.C., neighborhood.\n\nAccording to court documents, federal agents confronted the congressman and he invited them to his apartment, where he turned over a vial of the drug. A DEA official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release details of the case in his own name said Radel was identified to authorities as a cocaine buyer by his suspected dealer.\n\nFor the next three weeks, Radel didn\u2019t skip a beat. He held a re-election fundraiser at a Naples country club, continued to cast votes and bashed \u201cObamacare\u201d on Twitter. He did not tell House leaders about the bust until Nov. 19, when reporters broke the news about the case.\n\nWhen his arrest became public, Radel said during a news conference that he had struggled with drug and alcohol abuse \u201coff and on for years.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, he said he would continue to build a support system \u201cfor the rest of my life,\u201d including attending daily meetings and \u201creconnecting with my spiritual side.\u201d\n\nHis first task, he said: setting up the family Christmas tree.\n\n_________\n\nEds: Associated Press writers Tamara Lush in Tampa, Fla., and Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee, Fla., contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Michael J.
