On the national level, most physicians running for Congress are Republicans critical of President Barack Obama\u2019s controversial health initiative.\n\nIn Maryland, the doctors said, Obamacare was just a sliver of the pie representing increasing state health regulation, including everything from approving medical marijuana use to requiring licenses for doctors to mix medications.\n\nEach of the five candidates is a board-certified physician, Maryland State Medical Society \u201cMedChi\u201d CEO Gene Ransom said.\n\nNot just about Obamacare\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the ACA; it\u2019s everything,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cI think as doctors realize that more and more of their care is government-funded and regulated, they\u2019re going to get more involved in how the rules are made -- and that\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nWith more government mandates affecting physicians\u2019 day-to-day work, doctors are concerned about a \u201cfundamental\u201d change in the way healthcare is practiced -- moving away from traditional family-based relationships to more of a corporate structure, said Republican District 42 Senate candidate Dr. Tim Robinson, a retired anesthesiologist at St. Joseph Medical Center in Towson.\n\n\u201cPhysicians are very, very concerned about what is happening with the physician-patient relationship,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThe people making the decisions need to be better informed.\u201d\n\nOften, \u201cseemingly very reasonable and logical regulations and laws can impact people in unexpected ways,\u201d said Democratic District 12 House of Delegates candidate Dr. Terri Hill, who runs a plastic surgery practice in Columbia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about understanding, on a day-to-day basis, what are the things that really affect people\u2019s lives,\u201d Terri Hill said.\n\nPhysicians have been rare\n\nPhysicians are rare in the state\u2019s General Assembly: Only three have served in the past 25 years, MedChi reported. Delegate Dr. Dan Morhaim, D-Baltimore County, who has served since 1995, is the only practicing physician serving in the state legislature.\n\nOften the \u201conly person in the room who\u2019s made clinical decisions,\u201d Morhaim said he\u2019s seen a \u201cdisconnect between those making decisions and those who actually live with them.\u201d\n\nFor instance, a 2013 law requiring doctors to obtain licenses to mix medications causes \u201ca huge amount of confusion\u201d and delay in medical services, Terri Hill said.\n\nThat\u2019s just one example of a law the state passed that needed more input from doctors on the actual on-the-ground effects, the candidates said.\n\n\u201cSometimes when (legislators are) dealing with these issues, it\u2019s helpful to say, \u2018OK, this is what we\u2019re planning on doing -- what does that mean from a practical point of view?\u2019\u201d Ransom said.\n\nNew health care exchange needs oversight\n\nObamacare issues will likely come into the fray again as the administration of Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley aims to roll out the state\u2019s rebuilt healthcare exchange in November.\n\nThe General Assembly needs to \u201cstep up\u201d and ensure \u201cproper oversight and accountability\u201d during that process, said Dr. Clarence Lam, a District 12 Democratic House of Delegates candidate and preventive medicine physician at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.\n\nLam said he also hoped to address rising medication shortages of some drugs that he attributed to ownership issues, quality problems or contamination.\n\nThe candidates said the state has not fully worked out implementation of a new law allowing people with certain illnesses to obtain medical marijuana.\n\nIf elected, Robinson said, he had talked with some fellow candidates about forming a bipartisan physicians\u2019 caucus, though the other candidates said such a group had not yet been formally discussed. Robinson added he hoped more doctors in the legislature could help de-politicize health issues that have become increasingly divisive across the nation.\n\nAlong with Robinson, Morhaim, Hill and Lam, Democrat Jay Jalisi, an ear, nose and throat physician who is not currently practicing, is also running for a House of Delegates seat in District 10.\n\nBalancing medical practice with legislating\n\nThe doctors also said they hoped their background in patient care, including making critical decisions in stressful situations, could bring a more personal and \u201cholistic\u201d way of thinking to issues beyond health.\n\nBut doctors could come with their own set of issues. Balancing clinical work with time in Annapolis isn\u2019t easy, Ransom said. Morhaim works emergency shifts several weekends in session before taking a break until his legislative work ends. Terri Hill said she plans to run the surgical side of her practice for the nine months the General Assembly is out and then do administrative work on weekends and Monday mornings while serving in office.\n\nBut the candidates said the tradeoff would be worth it.\n\n\u201cAll of us got into this business because we wanted to help people,\u201d said Dr. Hugh Hill, an emergency physician and former Democratic District 16 Senate candidate who lost in the primary. \u201c(It was) the sense and duty of not sitting on the sidelines and griping anymore but getting in and pitching.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five physicians are running for seats in the Maryland General Assembly this year, a spike in doctor interest in political service that the candidates say coincides with rising state regulation over health.", "original-source": "http://marylandreporter.com/2014/09/17/more-doctors-run-for-md-legislature-as-health-care-issues-increase/", "og": {"site_name": "MarylandReporter.com", "description": "Five physicians are running for seats in the Maryland General Assembly this year, a spike in doctor interest in political service that the candidates say coincides with rising state regulation over health.", "title": "More doctors run for Md. legislature as health care issues increase", "url": "http://marylandreporter.com/2014/09/17/more-doctors-run-for-md-legislature-as-health-care-issues-increase/", "image": "http://marylandreporter.com/files/2014/09/Stethoscope.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@mdreporter", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://marylandreporter.com/2014/09/17/more-doctors-run-for-md-legislature-as-health-care-issues-increase/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Election 2016, News, Clarence Lam, Dan Morhaim, Gene Ransom, Jay Jalisi, Terri Hill, Tim Robinson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2097\"", "article_summary": "Robinson added he hoped more doctors in the legislature could help de-politicize health issues that have become increasingly divisive across the nation.\nEach of the five candidates is a board-certified physician, Maryland State Medical Society \u201cMedChi\u201d CEO Gene Ransom said.\nNew health care exchange needs oversightObamacare issues will likely come into the fray again as the administration of Gov.\nOn the national level, most physicians running for Congress are Republicans critical of President Barack Obama\u2019s controversial health initiative.\nDelegate Dr. Dan Morhaim, D-Baltimore County, who has served since 1995, is the only practicing physician serving in the state legislature."}
