Planned Parenthood, not the journalists who uncovered its crimes, must be held accountable for crimes in a court of law.\n\n\u2014 Harvey Miller, Milton\n\nGuns, terrorists and Zika\n\nThe Democratic Administration of President Obama has said it will protect us from domestic terrorists and violence by limiting gun access.\n\nHis administration has said it will vet all Middle Eastern immigrants for incoming terrorists.\n\nIt will vet all South American immigrants for criminals and diseases. The Democrats\u2019 and Obama's immigration policies have and are failing the American people.\n\nAt least four counties in Florida, with Santa Rosa being one of the four, are in a state of emergency for the Zika virus. The newest to North America, Zika virus is a member of the virus family Flaviviridae and the genus Flavivirus, transmitted by daytime-active Aedes mosquitoes, such as A. aegypti.\n\nIts name comes from the Zika Forest of Uganda, where the virus was first isolated in 1947. Welcome to Obama\u2019s and the Democrats\u2019 eight years of hope and change. Hope it changes from threats to the American people to protection of the American people. I hope you can afford Obamacare or you die quickly as the liberal Democrats made the former claims!\n\n\u2014 Steven King, Milton\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1Xq7zwe", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Only those who oppose the dream of American homeownership would attempt to dismantle President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal by eliminating two publicly traded, shareholder-owned companies that have single-hand", "og": {"site_name": "Pensacola News Journal", "description": "Only those who oppose the dream of American homeownership would attempt to dismantle President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal by eliminating two publicly traded, shareholder-owned companies that have single-hand", "title": "Letter: FDR\u2019s New Deal", "url": "http://www.pnj.com/story/opinion/2016/02/13/letter-fdrs-new-deal/80339444/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/pnj.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Only those who oppose the dream of American homeownership would attempt to dismantle President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal by eliminating two publicly traded, shareholder-owned companies that have single-hand", "title": "Letter: FDR\u2019s New Deal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a5bc39139221872c6d9c869b2ff55b9e6a2338c6/c=0-12-1722-1734&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/13/Pensacola/Pensacola/635909650580850670-Letter-to-Editor-3.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=816200923", "fb": {"app_id": 179056438789435}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Pensacola, News, Journal, letters, editor, FDR"}, "article_summary": "At least four counties in Florida, with Santa Rosa being one of the four, are in a state of emergency for the Zika virus.\nPlanned Parenthood, not the journalists who uncovered its crimes, must be held accountable for crimes in a court of law.\nThe newest to North America, Zika virus is a member of the virus family Flaviviridae and the genus Flavivirus, transmitted by daytime-active Aedes mosquitoes, such as A. aegypti.\nSeveral other states and Congress continue to investigate Planned Parenthood.\nSecondly, eight states have found that Planned Parenthood broke the law, as follows:\u2022 Ohio and South Carolina found illegal disposal of aborted baby remains in landfills."}
