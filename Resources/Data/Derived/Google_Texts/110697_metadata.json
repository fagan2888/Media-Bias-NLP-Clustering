That\u2019s the finding of researchers from UC San Francisco, Stanford, and the Mexican National Institute of Genomic Medicine. It\u2019s considered the first, large-scale analysis of its kind, and the study could change the way health care is delivered to Mexican-Americans. It helps drive forward the move toward personalized medicine.\n\nKQED News anchor Mina Kim spoke with UCSF Professor Esteban Burchard, one of the co-authors of the study, during a Thursday evening newscast. Burchard described that because of \u201chistorical factors, geographical factors, linguistic factors,\u201d the researchers identified that indigenous populations in Mexico are genetically distinct. The genetic ancestry mirrors the geography of Mexico.\u201d\n\nResearchers looked at contemporary Mexican populations of mestizos, people of mixed European and indigenous blood, and were able to \u201cprecisely trace back their genetic ancestry to particular indigenous groups or tribes,\u201d Burchard said. \u201cIt has tremendous implications for medicine. From there we used a simple case of lung measurements, where we measured the size of (a person\u2019s) lungs, and we demonstrated that the type of Native American ancestry you have determined the size of your lungs.\u201d\n\nThis information can influence the way a doctor might treat a patient with a specific illness, and the findings are relevant far beyond Mexico. Burchard said that the methods the team used, and the findings, are generalizable globally. Part of the impetus for the study was to diversify genetic research itself. Burchard noted that \u201c96 percent of contemporary modern-day genetic studies have been done in populations of European origin or European Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means a vast swath of the world population are not deriving the benefits of the Human Genome Project,\u201d Burchard told Kim. \u201cThat\u2019s important because we know that rates or prevalence of disease vary by race and even response to medications vary by race. By understanding the genetic underpinnings of that, we can better develop medications and therapies precisely for Mina Kim and not for all Asians.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate goal, Burchard said, is to better understand global populations, \u201cso that we can advance precision medicine worldwide.\u201d Burchard talked about his desire to move beyond race or ethnicity \u201cand get down to what is the gene particularly for MIna Kim and avoid the fact that \u2018Esteban, you\u2019re racially mixed,\u2019 or \u2018Mina, you\u2019re Asian\u2019. I would like to find out for a particular gene that causes a disease, what are the mutations that are driving that disease and how do we fix it? Because we have drugs that work for different mutations.\u201d\n\nBut researchers not involved in the study urged caution in focusing so closely on a genetic basis for a disease. In interviews with the Los Angeles Times, some noted that a focus on genetics might mask more critical socioeconomic or environmental factors driving diseae.\n\nFrom the Times:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two people from Mexico may be as genetically different as a white and an Asian person.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"People from Mexico Show Vast Genetic Diversity\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/06\\/13\\/people-from-mexico-show-vast-genetic-diversity-ucsf-stanford-study\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-13 08:42:14\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-06-17 10:55:29\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":19516,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/06\\/11926381495_52cb230228_b.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Two people from Mexico may be as genetically different as a white and an Asian person.", "title": "People from Mexico Show Vast Genetic Diversity", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/06/13/people-from-mexico-show-vast-genetic-diversity-ucsf-stanford-study/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/06/11926381495_52cb230228_b-640x426.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1337\"", "article_summary": "The genetic diversity of the Mexican population is so vast that two people of Mexican descent can be as genetically different from each other as a European and a Chinese person.\nBurchard described that because of \u201chistorical factors, geographical factors, linguistic factors,\u201d the researchers identified that indigenous populations in Mexico are genetically distinct.\nKQED News anchor Mina Kim spoke with UCSF Professor Esteban Burchard, one of the co-authors of the study, during a Thursday evening newscast.\nPart of the impetus for the study was to diversify genetic research itself.\nThe genetic ancestry mirrors the geography of Mexico.\u201dResearchers looked at contemporary Mexican populations of mestizos, people of mixed European and indigenous blood, and were able to \u201cprecisely trace back their genetic ancestry to particular indigenous groups or tribes,\u201d Burchard said."}
