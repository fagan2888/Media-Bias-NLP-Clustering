By the time they\u2019re 35, they should have double their salary in retirement savings. By 40, that total should be three times a person\u2019s salary. The target numbers continue to grow until age 67, when an individual should have 10 times their pay in retirement savings.\n\nGulp.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why More Baby Boomers Won\u2019t Enjoy Retirement Like Their Parents\n\nThe old rules of thumb advised workers to save an amount equal to their salary by age 35 and eight times their salary by age 67 in order to have reasonable financial security in retirement.\n\nEven these more modest guidelines were difficult for most Americans to meet. Around 55 percent of people are at risk of not having enough money saved to completely cover necessary retirement expenses, like housing, health care and food, according to Fidelity Investments\u2019 own study.\n\nFidelity recognizes that not everyone can save such a large portion of his or her paycheck and that the average American isn\u2019t setting aside this kind of money. But much as medical guidelines say people should visit their doctors, eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly in order to lead a healthy lifestyle, Thompson says, following these financial recommendations improve the chances of successful retirement planning.\n\n\u201cThese are rules of thumb meant to give people a quick gauge. It\u2019s important to understand where you\u2019re at, but these are a broad set of guidelines that apply to many people,\u201d says Jeanne Thompson, a vice president at Fidelity.\n\nRelated: Ready for Retirement?

The previous guidelines were based on individuals making $70,000 a year, but the new ones were designed for anyone earning between $50,000 and $300,000 a year.\n\nThe revisions also reflect a more conservative expected rate of return. Instead of assuming a rate of return of 5.5 percent a year, the firm now assumes savings will grow by 3 percent a year on average. The goal of the new guidelines is to allow savers to amass enough money to replace 45 percent of their pre-retirement income.\n\nThese changes are a result of Fidelity using past market performance to simulate what the market might do in the future. \u201cHad you followed these guidelines in historical markets, you would\u2019ve had more success in savings,\u201d says Thompson.\n\nRelated: 7 Common Myths that Can Ruin Your Retirement\n\nFidelity also recommends that people set aside at least 15 percent of their pay throughout their careers, including any employer contributions to retirement plans. Thompson emphasizes the importance of taking the company match on 401(k) plans, because not doing so is \u201clike leaving free money on the table.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re far below that goal, Thompson suggests trying to increase your savings by 1 percent a year until you get to 15 percent. If the new Fidelity guidelines give you a scare, that may be a less-daunting way to start toward better retirement security.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Saving for retirement is already a daunting task, but new savings guidelines from fund", "title": "How Much Money Do You Need to Retire?
