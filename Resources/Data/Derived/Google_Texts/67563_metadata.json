Federico Lombardi, says the pope made the visit between his public events. The visit is a signal of the pope\u2019s support for the religious order, which argues that the requirement violates their religious freedom.\n\nThe order runs several homes in the U.S. that care for elderly people who are poor.\n\nThe Obama administration has provided an accommodation for religious objectors, allowing them to send notice of their opposition, which would trigger a requirement for insurers to provide the coverage instead. But attorneys for the religious order say the accommodation isn\u2019t broad enough and still requires the sisters to cooperate with providing artificial contraception.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the pope called religious freedom \u201cone of America\u2019s most precious possessions\u201d and said Americans are called to \u201cpreserve and defend\u201d it.\n\nSecuring conscience exemptions from the birth control requirement is a top priority for the U.S. bishops. Dozens of American dioceses, charities and schools have sued the Obama administration over the rule. The issue is expected to be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Vatican also released a statement on the U.S. embargo on Cuba \u2013 one of the main issues discussed by the U.S. and Holy See delegations on the sidelines of Pope Francis\u2019 meeting with President Barack Obama.\n\nThe Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, declined to provide details on the private meeting between Francis and Obama.\n\nBut he said the diplomatic delegations headed by Vice President Joseph Biden and the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, discussed the Cuban embargo and the Holy See\u2019s longstanding opposition to it.\n\nLombardi said \u201cthere was a certain readiness to understand from the USA side how it is possible to go on to solve the different problems\u201d about lifting the blockade.\n\nFrancis has said he would not mention the embargo in his speech Thursday to Congress, which has the power to lift the blockade.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2015 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
