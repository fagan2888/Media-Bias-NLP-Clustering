Sandra Fluke is joining the long list of California Democrats running for Rep. Henry Waxman's soon-to-be vacated Congressional seat.

Fluke, the birth control advocate who Rush Limbaugh called a "slut" on his radio show in February 2012, has filed the necessary paperwork to seek an endorsement from the California Democratic Party for a run.

The 32-year-old lawyer had said earlier in January that she was "strongly considering" making a bid for Waxman's seat, adding she was "flattered" that she was being discussed as a potential candidate.

Fluke gained national attention for her testimony before Congress in 2012, when she advocated for health insurers to pay for contraception as part of the Affordable Care Act.

Congress was reviewing the conscience clause, that provided an exemption to religious institutions who object to providing contraception and abortion inducing drugs under their healthcare plans.

Fluke testified about her experience at Georgetown Law School, where the Catholic university would not pay for birth control as part of the student health plan.

She said that she and other female students suffered "financial, emotional and medical burdens" due to the lack of access to contraception.

Waxman, 74, has served in the House of Representatives since 1975. His district includes West Hollywood and Beverly Hills.

He announced on Jan. 30 that he wouldn't run for reelection.

Wendy Greuel, who ran for Los Angeles mayor, and State Sen. Ted Lieu are among the contenders in the Democratic primary.

Marianne Williamson, a best-selling author and spiritual teacher, is also running.
