Tulsi Gabbard, a well-financed war veteran, won\u2019t be easy, but Crowley has just scored a major endorsement from the Maui Chamber of Commerce, something he said will help to kick off his campaign.\n\nHawaii\u2019s most famous radio broadcaster, Michael W. Perry of KSSK\u2019s Perry & Price Morning Show, has known Crowley through the years, and worked together with him on commercials.\n\n\u201cKawika is the most unusual political candidate in Hawaii because he does not fit the politician mold at all, but he is very dedicated and a great guy,\u201d Perry said.\n\nWhile he\u2019s gained notoriety for being homeless, Crowley said he has a \u201chome on wheels\u201d, and plans eventually to return to Hawaii Island and buy a home where housing prices are more affordable that Oahu.\n\nOne of his passions is cutting government spending. He said Washington D.C. has become dysfunctional.\n\n\u201cWe are at present suffering from a huge epidemic in Washington\u2026it is called \u2018obese big government.\u2019 It is a government out of control, drunk on the Kool-Aid of big spending,\u201d Crowley said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is a \u201cdisaster\u201d Crowley said, warning the \u201cVA fiasco and disaster is a microcosm of what is to come with Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is one regulation after another affecting every aspect of our lives. And now, for the first time in our country\u2019s 240-year history as a nation, government has mandated that every citizen be forced to purchase a product or face a penalty. If I am elected, you can count on me to do every thing possible to repeal Obamacare,\u201d Crowley said.\n\nOne position Crowley takes that\u2019s contrary to most conservatives in the islands, he supports a native Hawaiian sovereignty and the creation of a Hawaiian nation operating within the state.\n\nThe proposal originally pushed by the late U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye has repeated failed in Congress for more than a decade, but the controversial movement continues among some native Hawaiian groups.\n\n\u201cIf elected, I will convince both Congress and the president to mandate 200,000 acres towards the new Hawaiian Nation, specifically the South Point region of Hawaii Island. Hawaii Island is made up of 2.5 million acres, much of it barren, sitting unused, especially after the sugar downfall. In 10 to 20 years I see a vibrant nation with trade and financial treaties with dozens of nations across the world. That would be an explosion for the Hawaii economy for years to come.\u201d\n\nCrowley, who beat out a primary opponent in 2014, also ran for Congress in 2012 against Gabbard, and garnered more than 40,000 votes. Before that, in 1991, he made history as the first Hawaii County mayoral candidate to enter the general election as an independent.\n\nAt the state Capitol, Crowley has been the driving force for the past six years to undo Hawaii\u2019s strict smoking ban, which he said hurts businesses. He represents over 150 small businesses affiliated with the Hawaii Bar Owners Association.\n\n\u201cWe have been trying to push through legislation that would simply allow smoking exemptions for bars requesting one. Nevada just amended their smoking ban, and we are confident Hawaii will do as well, as early as next year,\u201d Crowley said.\n\nGovernment\u2019s binge on banning must also come to an end, Crowley said.\n\nCrowley was born in Japan and raised on Hawaii Island. He considers himself a dedicated family man and raised three children on his own.\n\nA well-known songwriter and music producer, he\u2019s won numerous awards in the music industry and is best known for writing the well known song Hawaii 78.\n\nHe\u2019s currently a \u201chandyman,\u201d but has worked as a teacher, radio and television personality, a stand-up comedian and in the advertising industry.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hawaii's most unusual candidate vying to be next congressman", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Hawaii's most unusual candidate vying to be next congressman", "title": "Hawaii's most unusual candidate vying to be next congressman", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/Screen-shot-2014-09-16-at-10.24.33-AM.png", "updated_time": "2014-09-17T14:38:37+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/171009/most-unusual-candidate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Hawaii's most unusual candidate vying to be next congressman", "title": "Hawaii's most unusual candidate vying to be next congressman", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/Screen-shot-2014-09-16-at-10.24.33-AM.png"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Hawaii", "tag": "hawaii congressman,hawaii congressmember,Hawaii elections,kawika crowley,Michael W Perry,us rep tulsi gabbard", "published_time": "2014-09-17T02:33:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-17T14:38:37+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "Hawaii, congress, congressman, Democrat, Republican, Japan"}, "article_summary": "Hawaii Island is made up of 2.5 million acres, much of it barren, sitting unused, especially after the sugar downfall.\nHawaii\u2019s most famous radio broadcaster, Michael W.
