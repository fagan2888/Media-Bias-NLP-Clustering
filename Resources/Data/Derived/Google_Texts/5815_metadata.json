Both homes show off abundant possibilities for decks and daylight walkout basements \u2013including options for finishing the basement now as attractive entertaining and guest-bedroom space \u2014 available from Siena\u2019s west-sloping site, south of Founders Parkway on Woodlands Boulevard.\n\nA finished walkout makes a particularly attractive match-up with a ranch plan. Among the 11 floor plans that KB Home will build here, no less than six are ranches. That includes two designs \u2014 the Box Elder and the Cottonwood \u2013 that\u2019ll have finished basement space included at the base price.Even coming into this weekend\u2019s formal opening, KB Home\u2019s Lori Emch and Kathy Hamlin have seen non-stop visits from home shoppers \u2013 many from the local Woodlands area who have been watching this site for years \u2014 walking distance both to Renaissance Expeditionary School, Douglas County High School, and Castle Rock\u2019s Community Rec Center.\n\nPut that together with the mountain views you get looking west from here and you can see why KB Home has already been logging reservations in advance. And much of that activity is centered on ranches.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuously focusing on what Colorado buyers want, and increasingly they\u2019re telling us that they prefer ranches,\u201d says Randy Carpenter, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at KB Home Colorado.\n\nAlthough the decorated models are ready and waiting, what you won\u2019t see at Siena today are lots of homes ready to deliver, Carpenter notes. \u201cThis is a chance to order a home for delivery late next spring, with plenty of time available to sell your current home, and to buy a new home at prices that could be only a memory by then.\u201d Ordering now, he adds, maximizes the opportunity to use KB Home\u2019s \u2018Built-to-Order\u2019 choices \u2013 including those enticing finished basement options.\n\nEmch and Hamlin will show you numbers of sites where KB Home can deliver a home under $400,000 \u2013 and other ones where a lot premium translates into an advantageous situation for a walkout or other advantage. All of these sites, says Carpenter, are getting attention now because of their ease of access to I-25 \u2013 something that Castle Rock area buyers want.\n\nThere\u2019s another affordable aspect to Siena, Carpenter notes: the tax rate \u2014 0.589, leading to lower monthly payments. To reach the grand opening, take I-25 south to Castle Rock\u2019s first exit, Meadows/Founders Pkwy, turn left on Founders, a mile to Woodlands Boulevard, then turn right to Tippen Place.\n\nGrand opening, Siena at Castle Rock by KB Home, 2 beautiful models including spacious ranch; Energy Star 3 Certified; close to trails, walk to Douglas County High School; refreshments today & Sunday. 3389 Belltop Court, Castle Rock; take I-25 south to Castle Rock\u2019s first exit, Meadows/Founders Pkwy, turn left on Founders, continue 1 mi. to Woodlands Blvd, turn right 0.7 mi to Tippen Place\n\nFrom high $300s\n\nToday, 10 a.m. until 6 p.m.\n\n303-323-1176\n\nMark Samuelson writes on real estate and business; you can email him at mark@samuelsonassoc.com.
