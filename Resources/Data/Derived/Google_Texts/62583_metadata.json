A provision in ObamaCare expanded the number of healthcare facilities that qualify for the discounts.\n\nThe HHS rule issued earlier this year would have only allowed reimbursements to 340B hospitals and clinics when an orphan drug is used to treat a rare disease.\n\nBut the district court judge said the administration did not have the authority to make the rule and issued a permanent injunction halting it after the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America sued the government.\n\nTom Barker, a healthcare attorney with Foley Hoag, said the department is at \u201creal risk\u201d of losing on appeal.\n\nHe said the best option for the government would be to issue an interpretive rule that would outline the department\u2019s interpretation of the 340B program, which doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be followed by hospitals and drugmakers.\n\nUltimately, Barker says Congress would either have to pass legislation explicitly stating the orphan drug rule or pass legislation that gives the HHS secretary the power to interpret the 340B program.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Obama administration plans to fight for rule that gives some medical facilities discounts on \u201corphan drugs.\u201d", "description": "The Obama administration plans to fight for rule that gives some medical facilities discounts on \u201corphan drugs.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Ferdous Al-Faruque", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Obama administration plans to fight for rule that gives some medical facilities discounts on \u201corphan drugs.\u201d", "title": "HHS vows to fight for \u2018orphan drug\u2019 rule", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/209340-hhs-vows-to-fight-for-orphan-drug-rule", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/209340-hhs-vows-to-fight-for-orphan-drug-rule", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-13T15:39-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Ferdous Al-Faruque", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Health, Orphan drug, Medicine, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, United States Department of Health and Human Services,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-13T15:39:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/209340-hhs-vows-to-fight-for-orphan-drug-rule", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Obama administration plans to fight for rule that gives some medical facilities discounts on \u201corphan drugs.\u201d", "card": "summary", "title": "HHS vows to fight for \u2018orphan drug\u2019 rule"}, "dcterms.title": "HHS vows to fight for \u2018orphan drug\u2019 rule"}, "article_summary": "The HHS rule issued earlier this year would have only allowed reimbursements to 340B hospitals and clinics when an orphan drug is used to treat a rare disease.\nThe Obama administration plans to fight for a rule that gives some medical facilities discounts on \u201corphan drugs\u201d that are used to treat rare diseases.\nUltimately, Barker says Congress would either have to pass legislation explicitly stating the orphan drug rule or pass legislation that gives the HHS secretary the power to interpret the 340B program.\nOrphan drugs are medicines designed for patients who have a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 people, but the drugs are often used \u201coff-label\u201d for other purposes.\nThe 340B program was created to help hospitals and clinics that serve low-income people receive discounts on drugs."}
