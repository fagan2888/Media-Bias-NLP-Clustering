One person was killed and three others were seriously injured early Saturday morning after an SUV slammed into the back of a car that stalled on Interstate 70 near Morrison, triggering a three-vehicle pile up.

The person who was killed was in a white, four-door sedan, that was struck after it stalled while climbing in the westbound lanes around 6:52 a.m., said Trooper Nate Reid, spokesman for the Colorado State Patrol.

Two other people who were in the car were taken to a hospital for treatments of injuries.

The driver of the SUV was also injured in the crash and taken to a hospital, Reid said.

The third vehicle involved in the chain-reaction accident was a semi-tractor trailer, which sustained minimal damage, he said. No one in the truck was injured.

Troopers are investigating the cause of the accident. It is believed that the SUV was passing the truck and the SUV driver didnâ€™t see the stalled car until it was too late, Reid said.

The state patrol said on Twitter that two lanes of the westbound interstate were still closed at 11 a.m.
