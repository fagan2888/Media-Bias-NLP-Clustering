Copyright: The British Library Board\n\nAn investigation into allegations that the demolition of Babri Masjid was premeditated has put the Bharatiya Janata Party, India\u2019s national opposition party, in an uncomfortable spot.\n\nThe 16th-century masjid, or mosque, in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya was brought down by Hindu activists in 1992, who were allegedly led by L.K. Advani, a member of Parliament and senior leader in the BJP. Mr. Advani has denied any wrongdoing. In the aftermath of the demolition, hundreds of people died in riots that broke out between Hindus and Muslims.\n\nDays before India heads to the national polls, Cobrapost, an Indian investigative news organization, released videos of undercover interviews with several Hindu activists purportedly associated with the demolition of the three-domed structure.\n\nCobrapost in a statement on Friday said that evidence uncovered in its investigations \u201cestablishes beyond doubt that the demolition was not an act of frenzied mobs but an act of sabotage\u201d by those who laid out an \u201celaborate plan and executed it with precision of a military operation\u201d. Many Hindus believe the mosque was built on the ruins of a Hindu temple.\n\nA long-simmering political and legal dispute between Hindus and Muslims over the ownership of the Babri Masjid site is now before the Supreme Court of India. The Allahabad High Court in a 2010 ruling said the land be divided between the two religious groups\u2014two parts to Hindus and one part to Muslims. Both sides claimed they did not seek the division of the site and appealed against the ruling. Their appeals rest before the Supreme Court which hasn\u2019t begun hearing the case yet.\n\nHindu petitioners have claimed that site is the birthplace of revered Hindu god, Lord Ram, and a giant temple dedicated to him should be built there. Muslim petitioners have claimed the same site for a mosque.\n\nThe BJP, along with its sister organizations, was the face of the Ram temple movement in late 1980s and early 1990s, which allegedly led to the demolition of Babri Masjid.\n\nResponding to Cobrapost\u2019s revelations, BJP on Friday wrote to the Election Commission of India asking to halt the broadcast of the investigative tapes, calling it a \u201cdiabolic move to create a communal flare up\u201d ahead of the elections that start Monday.\n\nThe party\u2019s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, is promoting a soft image of the Hindu nationalist party in a bid to assume power. But the ghost of the party\u2019s past activities could hurt Mr. Modi\u2019s efforts to appeal to Muslim voters.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal in 2012 wrote a series of investigative stories on the dispute over the religious site in Ayodhya. The stories \u2013 told through events and characters chronicling several decades \u2014 traced how the dispute influenced social and political life in India.\n\nIndia\u2019s fragmented politics today, as our series showed, is in many ways the legacy of the temple movement in Ayodhya. No political party, including the BJP and Congress, both of whom sought to use the dispute in Ayodhya for electoral gains in the 1980s and 1990s, has been able to muster a simple majority in Parliament since Ayodhya became a political issue.\n\nRevisit our series, \u201cAyodhya: the Battle for India\u2019s Soul.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "An investigation into allegations that the demolition of Babri Masjid was premeditated has put India\u2019s national opposition party in an uncomfortable spot.", "title": "BJP: Cobrapost Revelations \u2018Diabolic\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/04/04/bjp-cobrapost-revelations-diabolic/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-VN345_iayodh_G_20121130071424.jpg"}, "site": "WSJIndia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "BJP: Cobrapost Revelations \u2018Diabolic\u2019", "description": "An investigation into allegations that the demolition of Babri Masjid was premeditated has put India\u2019s national opposition party in an uncomfortable spot.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Krishna Pokharel", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "India Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "India Real Time", "article.summary": "An investigation into allegations that the demolition of Babri Masjid was premeditated has put India\u2019s national opposition party in an uncomfortable spot.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-04-04T13:31:15-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/04/04/bjp-cobrapost-revelations-diabolic/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-IRTB-23799", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "An investigation into allegations that the demolition of Babri Masjid was premeditated has put India\u2019s national opposition party in an uncomfortable spot.", "title": "BJP: Cobrapost Revelations \u2018Diabolic\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/04/04/bjp-cobrapost-revelations-diabolic/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-VN345_iayodh_G_20121130071424.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "India Real Time", "article.id": "BL-IRTB-23799", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-04-07T03:57:40-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd064e\"", "article_summary": "The Wall Street Journal in 2012 wrote a series of investigative stories on the dispute over the religious site in Ayodhya.\nA long-simmering political and legal dispute between Hindus and Muslims over the ownership of the Babri Masjid site is now before the Supreme Court of India.\nAdvani, a member of Parliament and senior leader in the BJP.\nIn the aftermath of the demolition, hundreds of people died in riots that broke out between Hindus and Muslims.\nIndia\u2019s fragmented politics today, as our series showed, is in many ways the legacy of the temple movement in Ayodhya."}
