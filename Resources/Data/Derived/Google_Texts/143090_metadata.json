Or, technically, more greatness, since his enormous list of accomplishments just keeps growing.\n\nJames was announced Thursday as The Associated Press\u2019 2013 Male Athlete of the Year, becoming the third basketball player to capture the award that has been annually awarded since 1931. James received 31 of 96 votes cast in a poll of news organizations, beating Peyton Manning (20) and Jimmie Johnson (7).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m chasing something and it\u2019s bigger than me as a basketball player,\u201d James told the AP. \u201cI believe my calling is much higher than being a basketball player. I can inspire people. Youth is huge to me. If I can get kids to look at me as a role model, as a leader, a superhero \u2026 those things mean so much, and that\u2019s what I think I was built for. I was put here for this lovely game of basketball, but I don\u2019t think this is the biggest role that I\u2019m going to have.\u201d\n\nPast winners include Joe Louis, Jesse Owens, Muhammad Ali, Carl Lewis, Joe Montana, Tiger Woods and Michael Phelps.\n\nSerena Williams was the AP Female Athlete of the Year, announced Wednesday.\n\nJames joins Michael Jordan and Larry Bird as NBA players to win the award.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve changed much this year,\u201d James said. \u201cI\u2019ve just improved and continued to improve on being more than just as a basketball player. I\u2019ve matured as a leader, as a father, as a husband, as a friend.\u201d\n\nSo far in 2013, with a maximum of three games left to play, James has appeared in 98. The Heat have won 78 of them.\n\nNone of those was bigger than the four Miami got in the NBA Finals against San Antonio. In Game 7, James was at his best, scoring 37 points, including the jump shot with 27.9 seconds left that essentially was the clincher.\n\n\u201cHe always rises to the occasion when it matters the most,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.\n\nBusiness-wise, James is booming. Some estimate his annual income around $60 million, less than one-third of that being made on the court. His wife has opened a juice bar in Miami, and David Beckham wants James to be part of the Major League Soccer team he plans on bringing to South Florida in the next couple years.\n\nCountless people want to align with James. Few make him listen. Beckham did.\n\n\u201cYou want to be a part of it, but it has to feel real to you,\u201d James said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do something that doesn\u2019t feel much to you, that you\u2019re just doing for the money. We all have money. For me, my time is more than money at this point in my life.\u201d\n\nJames has another \u201cdecision\u201d to make in 2014. He can become a free agent again this summer, though still smarting from the circus atmosphere that followed him during his final season with the Cleveland Cavaliers four years ago, James is staying largely silent on what might happen.\n\nHe insists he has no idea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so zoned in on what my task is here this year that it\u2019s hard to think about anything else,\u201d James said. \u201cA guy the other day asked me what I\u2019m going to do for New Year\u2019s, and I haven\u2019t even thought about that.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if there\u2019s anything he doesn\u2019t like about Miami, James offered few complaints, other than the often-clogged street \u2014 Biscayne Boulevard, or U.S. 1 \u2014 that leads to the arena the Heat call home.\n\n\u201cWhat is there not to like about Miami?\u201d James said. \u201cIt is a home. My family is very happy; I\u2019m very comfortable. But U.S. 1? I wish that was a highway.\u201d\n\nBear in mind, he\u2019s not always unhappy when that street is gridlocked.\n\nThe last two years, he\u2019s been largely responsible for hundreds of thousands of people lining that road for Heat championship parades.\n\nAnd if he gets his way, they\u2019ll be back next June.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "LeBron James beats out Peyton Manning as greatest athlete of 2013", "title": "LeBron James beats out Peyton Manning as greatest athlete of 2013", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/26/lebron-james-beats-out-peyton-manning-as-greatest-athlete-of-2013/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131222__peyton-manning-broncos-close-houstonp1-2.jpg", "height": 446}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131222__peyton-manning-broncos-close-houstonp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-26T22:20:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T09:42:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc008\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m chasing something and it\u2019s bigger than me as a basketball player,\u201d James told the AP.\n\u201cWhat is there not to like about Miami?\u201d James said.\n\u201cI believe my calling is much higher than being a basketball player.\nJames received 31 of 96 votes cast in a poll of news organizations, beating Peyton Manning (20) and Jimmie Johnson (7).\nJames was announced Thursday as The Associated Press\u2019 2013 Male Athlete of the Year, becoming the third basketball player to capture the award that has been annually awarded since 1931."}
