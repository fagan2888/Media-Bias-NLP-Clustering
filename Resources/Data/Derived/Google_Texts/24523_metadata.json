That\u2019s why a presidential veto announced early Wednesday is worth commending.\n\nIn only his ninth veto in office, President Obama stopped Congress from dealing a death blow to the proposed protections for small, upstream waterways that ultimately lead to drinking water sources for an estimated 117 million Americans.\n\nThe new protections are known as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s \u201cClean Water Rule.\u201d The long-simmering debate over the measure has bordered on hysteria at times. Opponents \u2014 mainly corporate agriculture, property-rights purists and conspiracy theorists \u2014 have inaccurately portrayed the protections as something new and sinister that will leave bureaucrats standing guard over puddles.\n\nThe reality is that the rule re-establishes long-standing protections that were in place for years under the nation\u2019s Clean Water Act. That enlightened law was passed in 1972 as the public demanded action to clean up the heavily polluted Great Lakes and rivers so filled with waste that they started on fire.\n\nBut in 2001 and 2006, U.S. Supreme Court rulings raised questions about the law\u2019s jurisdiction over wetlands or streams connected with bigger waterways relied on for drinking water. The Clean Water Rule just clarifies that the law does have jurisdiction, reinstating protections in place for decades without causing the regulatory hell opponents warn of.\n\nRegrettably, Congress put political considerations ahead of public health recently, passing with bipartisan support a measure aiming to not only block the rule but also to prevent future protections. Leading the charge to kill the rule: Iowa\u2019s junior senator, Republican Joni Ernst.\n\nThe congressional action looks especially wrongheaded as Flint\u2019s misery unfolds. The community\u2019s drinking supply \u2014 water from a polluted local river that corroded lead pipes \u2014 is poisoning residents. Opponents to the Clean Water Rule have been quiet about Flint, but in an election year, we will hear the rule derided again as a bureaucratic overreach or a federal takeover. This time, Ernst and others should be asked to back up their antiregulatory rhetoric by publicly downing a nice, big glass of Flint tap water.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unfolding mess in Flint, Mich., shows the value of key protections.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Unfolding mess in Flint, Mich., shows the value of key protections.", "title": "A sensible presidential veto in the wake of a drinking water disaster", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/a-sensible-presidential-veto-in-the-wake-of-a-drinking-water-disaster/365990721/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145333528635993.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145333528635993.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Unfolding mess in Flint, Mich., shows the value of key protections.", "title": "A sensible presidential veto in the wake of a drinking water disaster", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/a-sensible-presidential-veto-in-the-wake-of-a-drinking-water-disaster/365990721/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145333528635993.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145333528635993.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "Sen.
