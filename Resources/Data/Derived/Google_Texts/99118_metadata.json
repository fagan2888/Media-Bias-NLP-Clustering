You\u2019ll also find helpful tips at the Information Center there.\n\nSB 188/HB 195 would prevent Florida\u2019s public schools from collecting and using biometric information from its students.\n\nA public school \u201cmay not collect, obtain, or retain information on the political affiliation, voting history, religious affiliation, or biometric information of a student or a parent or sibling of the student. For purposes of this subsection, the term \u2018biometric information\u2019 means information collected from the electronic measurement or evaluation of any physical or behavioral characteristics that are attributable to a single person, including fingerprint characteristics, hand characteristics, eye characteristics, vocal characteristics, and any other physical characteristics used for the purpose of electronically identifying that person with a high degree of certainty. Examples of biometric information include, but are not limited to, a fingerprint or hand scan, a retina or iris scan, a voice print, or a facial geometry scan.\u201d\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 State lawmakers are moving speedily to ban its use on schoolchildren, but the use of biometric identification isn\u2019t going away.\n\nBiometrics uses physical characteristics that can be measured \u2014 fingerprints, irises, voices \u2014 to identify a person. At its most basic, even a photo ID badge is a biometric identifier.\n\nThe example now causing a ruckus is in Pinellas County. Schools there use palm scanners to authorize withdrawals from pre-paid accounts, moving lunch lines faster and giving students more time to eat.\n\nThat ruckus, however, so far has been stirred by legislators, not parents.\n\nState Sen. Dorothy Hukill, R-Port Orange, says she caught wind of the practice and grew alarmed. She also knew about Polk County schools scanning children\u2019s eyes to track comings and goings on school buses.\n\n\u201cWhat are we doing in government in terms of taking biometric information?\u201d she said, mentioning her concern that the information could be breached and used for identity theft.\n\n\u201cI think a ban is definitely the way to go,\u201d she said, \u201cI want to protect school kids.\u201d\n\nBeyond the security fears and Big Brother-type anxiety, advocates say biometric authentication simply exists to answer the question: Are you who you say you are?\n\nAnd its applications have been growing in recent years:\n\nThe city of Leon, Mexico, installed iris scanners to check the identity of ATM customers and bus riders.\n\nIn New York City, residents of some high-end apartment buildings use thumb-print readers to gain entry.\n\nIn Florida, Walt Disney World has used fingerprint scans to verify visitors re-entering its theme parks. That led to an article on eHow, the how-to guide website, called \u201cHow to Circumvent a Disney Biometric Scan.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone with a photo ID who is uncomfortable giving Disney parks their fingerprints can present a photo ID instead,\u201d the article says.\n\nMost recently, Apple filed for a patent on a biometric system to connect all your electronic devices and share information between them securely, including contacts and photos.\n\nIts iPhone 5s already can be unlocked with a fingerprint recognition system.\n\nSeminole County used fingerprint biometrics in school lunch lines until 2011, when it ended using the system as a cost-cutting measure.\n\nFor those who oppose such technology, the favorite example has been the 2002 film, \u201cMinority Report.\u201d Tom Cruise\u2019s character strolled into a future Gap store that scanned the eyes of customers to announce individualized greetings and shopping suggestions.\n\nFor the truly conspiracy-minded, the Internet is replete with sites that compare biometrics, microchips and related technologies to the biblical \u201cmark of the beast,\u201d so that \u201cno one can buy or sell unless he has the mark,\u201d according to Revelation.\n\nBob Marotta, a Tampa-area biometric systems consultant who has worked with police departments, federal law enforcement and the U.S. Central Command, said fear of the technology stems from not understanding it.\n\nBiometrics has helped prevent child abductions, head off bank fraud and keeps our armed forces safe by confirming the good guys, he said.\n\n\u201cIn the world of terrorism, there are no uniforms,\u201d Marotta said.\n\nHe\u2019s also sure Hukill\u2019s fears won\u2019t come true.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business close to 10 years and there\u2019s no identity theft known where someone has used a fingerprint, iris scan or vein pattern from a database,\u201d Marotta said.\n\nReferring to Pinellas County and elsewhere, he added, \u201cthere\u2019s too much value in these systems for the nay-sayers to be allowed to push this forward.\u201d\n\nArt Dunham, director of food services for Pinellas County schools, said biometric scanners have been used for four years without a problem. Parents can opt out of having their kids use the scanners; hardly any do.\n\nThe scanners don\u2019t check the actual palm print, but instead see the unique squiggle of lines made by the veins inside the hand, he explained. The district-wide system cost about $155,000.\n\nThe system converts the scanned veins to a numeric value that matches each student in a database; no actual visual representations are stored.\n\nWith only 30 minutes to feed more than 1,000 students in some schools, the technology makes sure they have time to sit and eat. Each scan takes 1-2 seconds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got more students eating and fewer throwing their lunch in the trash because they ran out of time, or simply not eating at all,\u201d Dunham said.\n\nThe system also is not connected to the Internet, he said, but uses a closed system with secure servers locked in a room in the district\u2019s administration building.\n\nStill, this year\u2019s biometric ban already has cleared two Senate committees. Clearwater Republican Jack Latvala hit the brakes there, saying he wanted to instead create an \u201copt-in\u201d process for parents, rather than an outright ban.\n\nThe House version has been approved by three panels, with only one member opposing, and will next be debated on the floor.\n\nAt the most recent hearing, Rep. Carl Zimmermann, D-Palm Harbor, didn\u2019t see what the fuss was about, saying biometric scans were no more dangerous than yearbook photographs are to student privacy.\n\nZimmermann, an educator, still voted for the ban. The measure also prohibits gathering the political affiliation, voting history and religious affiliation of students and their parents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for protecting the security of our kids,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we try to make things more secure, we run this possibility of collecting data on people that maybe we shouldn\u2019t be collecting.\u201d\n\njrosica@tampatrib.com\n\n(850) 765-0807\n\nTwitter: @jlrosicaTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 09 Mar 2014 01:00:00 -0400", "Description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 State lawmakers are moving speedily to ban its use on schoolchildren, but the use of biometric identification isn\u2019t going away.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 State lawmakers are moving speedily to ban its use on schoolchildren, but the use of biometric identification isn\u2019t going away.", "title": "Biometrics may be banned in Florida schools, but flourish elsewhere", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/biometrics-may-be-banned-in-florida-schools-but-flourish-elsewhere-20140309/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140309/ARTICLE/140309226/EP/1/1/EP-140309226.jpg", "height": 426}, "updated_time": "2014-03-09T08:23:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 State lawmakers are moving speedily to ban its use on schoolchildren, but the use of biometric identification isn\u2019t going away.", "title": "Biometrics may be banned in Florida schools, but flourish elsewhere", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140309/ARTICLE/140309226/AR/0/AR-140309226.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-03-09T01:00:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-03-09T08:23:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "biometrics,schools"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff59\"", "article_summary": "She also knew about Polk County schools scanning children\u2019s eyes to track comings and goings on school buses.\nSeminole County used fingerprint biometrics in school lunch lines until 2011, when it ended using the system as a cost-cutting measure.\nIn Florida, Walt Disney World has used fingerprint scans to verify visitors re-entering its theme parks.\nSB 188/HB 195 would prevent Florida\u2019s public schools from collecting and using biometric information from its students.\nA public school \u201cmay not collect, obtain, or retain information on the political affiliation, voting history, religious affiliation, or biometric information of a student or a parent or sibling of the student."}
