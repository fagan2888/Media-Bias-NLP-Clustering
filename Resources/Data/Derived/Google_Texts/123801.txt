Basketball analyst Greg Anthony will have a charge of soliciting prostitution dropped if he does 32 hours of community service and stays out of trouble for four months.

Anthony, his attorney and a prosecutor told a judge Wednesday that they had agreed to the deal, called a deferred prosecution agreement.

Anthony will perform the community service in Florida, where he lives.

The 47-year-old former NBA player was arrested for soliciting prostitution at a D.C. hotel Jan. 16. Court documents say he had responded to an escort ad authorities placed on a classifieds website.

When he met the undercover officer at a hotel room she told him she would charge him $80 for intercourse, the document says. Asked "you want me to dress up,'' Anthony allegedly responded "oh yeah.''

Police said the arrest was part of an undercover operation in the 1500 block of Rhode Island Avenue, NW. At least 14 others were also arrested during the operation.

Anthony was suspended by CBS and Turner Sports following his arrest. A CBS spokeswoman said "Greg Anthony will not be working again for CBS this season."

He released a statement in the wake of the incident, saying, "I embarrassed many, including myself. I will work to regain the trust that I have lost, and the first step is saying that I am sorry."

In the statement, he apologized to his family and colleagues, calling his actions a "lapse of judgment."
