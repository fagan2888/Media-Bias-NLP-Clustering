In an interview with Fox News Sunday, DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz actually admitted that Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server was unprecedented.

Before conceding this point, Wasserman Schultz argued that Clinton is probably the most transparent presidential candidate ever given that she’s released 55,000 pages of emails available for anyone to look through.

“She was doing something, and using private email in the same way that previous secretaries of state have done,” she said, before host Chris Wallace pushed back saying, “You know that’s not true.”

“Other than the private server,” she acknowledged.

“Other than the private server’s a big deal,” Wallace noted, “and nobody had 30,000 work emails on their private server or private email, period. So the comparisons to Colin Powell, that’s just not true, congresswoman.”

Last week, FBI Director James Comey said the agency has no timetable for its investigation of Clinton's improper use of a private email server, noting that it could go past the Democratic National Convention.

“We aspire to do all of our investigations in two ways: well and promptly,” he said. “I get that people care about this investigation so we’re working very hard to ensure it’s done well and promptly. But as between the two, if we had to choose, we would do it well.”
