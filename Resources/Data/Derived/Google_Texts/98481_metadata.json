Neither did Blue Shield of California \u2026 or Health Net \u2026 or Kaiser Permanente \u2026 or L.A. Care \u2026 or Molina Healthcare.\n\nNot a single health plan available through Covered California\u2019s Region 15 and Region 16 \u2014 the Los Angeles County \u2014 initially offered access to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center last year. (Health Net ended up contracting with Cedars for the ACA\u2019s first enrollment period.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had restricted managed care networks for years in California,\u201d Anthony Wright of Health Access told California Healthline. \u201cThe issue of network adequacy and timely access isn\u2019t new.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the ACA makes the timely access to care issue more urgent, as insurers are faced with more intense price competition, and the new low- and moderate-income consumers in Covered California are least able to afford to go out-of-network.\u201d\n\nTwo Sides to a Narrow Network\n\nEarlier this year, Jonathan Cohn at The New Republic detailed how insurers\u2019 decision to leave out Cedars-Sinai (and generally avoid UCLA, ranked the top hospital in California by U.S. News) was driven by a focus to control costs and offer low-price plans in the insurance exchange.\n\n\u201cTo keep prices down, insurers are sending patients only to the doctors, clinics, and hospitals that have agreed to accept lower reimbursements,\u201d Cohn wrote. Cedars was unwilling to concede to Anthem and Blue Shield\u2019s price requests \u2014 a not uncommon phenomenon across the nation.\n\nIn New Hampshire \u2014 where Anthem was the lone insurer operating on the state\u2019s exchange \u2014 12 of the state\u2019s 26 hospitals were left out of exchange plans. The only hospital in the capital city of Concord said no to Anthem\u2019s request, worried that it would spark a chain reaction of giving in to lower prices.\n\nAll told, about half of the plans sold on HealthCare.gov and state health insurance exchanges in 2014 had \u201cnarrow networks,\u201d a McKinsey report found.\n\nThe limited networks sparked a political and media outcry \u2014 especially among patients who had a specific preference for hospitals like Cedars and UCLA, which are known for their top-tier health services.\n\nAnd while more than 400,000 consumers used Covered California to sign up for health plans in the Los Angeles area, Cedars said that the big enrollment number overlooks the rough experience some customers encountered in finding plans that covered their preferred providers.\n\n\u201cIn last year\u2019s initial exchange offerings, we found that the top priority for many consumers was finding a plan that enabled them to access Cedars-Sinai, even if they needed to switch insurance companies to do so,\u201d according to a statement that Cedars gave to California Healthline.\n\n\u201cWe received calls and emails from thousands of consumers asking which insurance company they should select so that they could access Cedars-Sinai.\u201d\n\nHow Year 2 Will Be Different\n\nNarrow networks aren\u2019t going away, given insurers\u2019 effort to lower spending and push providers into tiers.\n\nBut the situation in the exchanges looks a bit different for the second enrollment period. In New Hampshire, a wave of new insurers will join the exchange and offer more options.\n\nIn California, Anthem and Cedars struck a deal this spring that will allow the hospital to be offered through Anthem\u2019s plans in Covered California\u2019s next enrollment period.\n\nDarrel Ng, an Anthem spokesperson, said that the insurer\u2019s goals are to balance access, quality and affordability for its members. So why did Anthem wait to add the hospital?\n\n\u201cProvider contracts don\u2019t necessarily align with a calendar year,\u201d Anthem\u2019s Ng says.\n\n\u201cWhen we were able to come to an agreement with Cedars, we added them to the individual network as soon as possible to make them available to our members.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, why didn\u2019t some insurers add Cedars? \u201cRoad to Reform\u201d asked several plans for comment.\n\n\u201cOur significant gain in market share during the 2014 open enrollment indicates that we offered plans that consumers wanted to buy,\u201d says Blue Shield spokesperson Sean Barry. (More than 115,000 Covered California customers in the Los Angeles area picked Blue Shield.)\n\nHe also points out that while Cedars-Sinai may not have made Blue Shield\u2019s provider list, the health plan has been busy adding other hospitals and doctors to increase access to care \u2014 one of the goals of Covered California.\n\n\u201cHospitals added in Southern California include the [three] Hoag Hospitals, Pomona Hospital, [and the seven] AHMC Hospitals,\u201d Barry said. \u201cWe also recently added the Providence hospital system, bringing an additional five hospitals and more than 400 additional doctors to the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cCovered California and the ACA were designed to offer consumers a choice of different health plans with varying networks and prices. With Cedars and UCLA in other regional health plan networks, customers can choose a plan that provides access to those facilities when making their decision.\u201d\n\nConsumer advocates say the public focus on narrow networks, while worthy, shouldn\u2019t be the overarching goal.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, we support the notion of insurers and Covered California bargaining for the best possible price,\u201d says Wright of Health Access. That includes \u201cthe ability to say no, and to be more selective for providers who provide the best value,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cPrice isn\u2019t necessarily indicative of quality,\u201d Wright says. \u201cHaving strong standards on network adequacy doesn\u2019t mean that every patient gets access to every doctor \u2014 but certainly to a doctor, when and where the patient needs it.\u201d\n\nAround the nation\n\nHere\u2019s what else is making news on the road to reform.\n\nArkansas marketplace premiums are going \u2026 down? David Ramsay at the Arkansas Times digs into data (that\u2019s since been retracted by state officials) that suggested the premiums for plans sold on the state exchange will actually decline next year.\n\n\u2018Obamacare\u2019 is losing steam \u2014 as a hot-button issue: Derek Willis at the New York Times looks at how members of Congress are increasingly avoiding the term in their news releases.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Covered California's goal of expanding access to coverage didn't mean that customers had access to all providers, as health plans chose to leave one of the state's best -- and priciest -- hospitals off their provider lists.
