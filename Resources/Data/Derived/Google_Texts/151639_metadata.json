Can the 43-year-old driver end the other as well?\n\n\u201cCertainly things are going well \u2014 there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cI\u2019m as shocked as anybody else.\u201d\n\nGordon raced to his third Sprint Cup victory of the year, holding off Kevin Harvick on Sunday for his first win at Michigan International Speedway since 2001.\n\nGordon broke the track qualifying record Friday when he took the pole at 206.558 mph. He followed that up with his third Cup victory at MIS \u2014 and took over the points lead from Hendrick Motorsports teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr.\n\nAfter a series of cautions, Gordon came off the final restart well and led with 16 laps remaining. He fought off a challenge from Joey Logano and maintained a comfortable margin over Harvick, winning the 400-mile race by 1.412 seconds in his No. 24 Chevrolet.\n\n\u201cJoey, as we rolled up to some of the restarts \u2014 not that last one, but some of the other ones \u2014 as guys were starting to sort of anticipate it, he was slowing down, and when he slowed down, everybody got bottled up, and then he\u2019d take off,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cThat last one, I thought he had a good start, but I had a good one, too.\u201d\n\nHarvick was second, followed by Logano, Paul Menard and Earnhardt.\n\nGordon completed a sweep at MIS for Hendrick. Jimmie Johnson won the June race on the two-mile oval.\n\n\u201cI think all of our teams are running well, but this is a big, big win,\u201d owner Rick Hendrick said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see Jeff so happy. He\u2019s like a little kid again, so I think it\u2019s going to be really, really important for the momentum he\u2019s carrying right now into the Chase.\u201d\n\nLogano was second to Gordon in qualifying. He led 86 laps and Gordon was in front for 68.\n\n\u201cWe can win a championship. I really feel we can do that. That\u2019s the message I want to put out there,\u201d Logano said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a little bit more speed to keep up with one car today \u2014 24 car was the best, only because he was good on the long run. We weren\u2019t as good on the long run.\n\nThere were eight cautions, including a fairly early one when Danica Patrick\u2019s car spun and Justin Allgaier crashed into her. Nine cars were caught up in that incident, including Matt Kenseth\u2019s No. 20 Toyota.\n\nKenseth never really recovered, finishing 38th.\n\nBrad Keselowski rubbed against the wall with about 32 laps remaining and finished eighth, remaining winless at this track in his home state. Johnson overcame some problems of his own to finish ninth, his first top-10 showing in six races.\n\nJeff Burton was 37th after replacing Tony Stewart in the No. 14 car. Stewart skipped his second straight Cup race after he struck and killed a driver at a dirt-track race in New York last weekend.\n\nHendrick and Stewart-Haas Racing are alliance teams. Hendrick said he hasn\u2019t talked to Stewart, but he\u2019s been in touch with Eddie Jarvis, Stewart\u2019s longtime business manager.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re making the best of the situation that they\u2019re in,\u201d Hendrick said. \u201cTony\u2019s got a lot of good folks around him.\u201d\n\nGordon won for the 91st time on the Cup circuit, and this is his first three-win season since 2011. He took over the lead in the standings by three points over Earnhardt.\n\nGordon also won this season at Kansas and Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cAs a driver, especially somebody that\u2019s been getting beat up over the years about restarts, it\u2019s pretty nice to have the last two wins come down to restarts.\u201d\n\nAssuming they attempt to qualify for the final three races of the regular-season, the 12 drivers with victories this season have all wrapped up spots in the Chase for the Sprint Cup.\n\nKenseth remains the top driver without a victory in the standings, but he dropped to fifth place. If the regular season ended now, the last four drivers in the Chase would be Kenseth, Ryan Newman, Clint Bowyer and Greg Biffle.\n\nBowyer and Biffle both moved ahead of rookie Kyle Larson, whose car caught fire against the wall just before the halfway point. Larson ended up 43rd.\n\nBowyer finished sixth but sounded concerned about his situation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re behind, there\u2019s no question. We just did what we needed to do today,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, everything has to be perfect to get a decent finish and today everything was perfect. This is a tricky part of the season. Everybody is pushing hard.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gordon broke the track qualifying record Friday when he took the pole at 206.558 mph.
