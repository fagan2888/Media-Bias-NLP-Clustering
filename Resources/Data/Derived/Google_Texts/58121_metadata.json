The glow of small screens was as prevalent as orange and black attire.Dozens of fans watched the game with their phone or tablet at arms length, and in many cases, right in front of their faces. But while the contemporary baseball viewer appears to be glued to their personal devices, former MLB Advanced Media editorial producer Jay Lee says that the trend, dubbed the \u201csecond screen\u201d phenomenon, is something welcomed by Major League Baseball\u2019s media division. Lee is now a graduate student in the Stanford Journalism Program.\u201cBaseball fans are always consuming media, whether that\u2019s on TV, on the Internet, or reading newspapers,\u201d Lee said. \u201cMLB Advanced Media has a really cool opportunity to combine all mediums into one place and allow fans to have access to pictures, videos, articles, highlights and social media, all within one app.\u201dSam Lindauer, a current editorial producer at MLB Advanced Media, says there is a concerted effort to promote the application and drive users towards mobile access. \u201cA big part of what we do is just promoting the use of the app. That\u2019s really Advanced Media\u2019s bread and butter.\u201dWhile broadcast ratings for baseball have slowed, its digital presence is thriving. Mobile devices have enabled fans around the world to connect to games and communicate directly with teams and players.The results have been staggering. MLB.com has a paying subscriber base of more than 3.5 million users for its streaming service. Its digital video streaming service MLB.TV supports more than 400 mobile and connected devices, with more than 60 percent of its traffic coming from mobile devices.Its flagship mobile application, MLB At Bat, hosts a variety of features. Its in-game Gameday feature, for example, provides users with a real-time boxscore of the game, complete with pitch locations and type, relevant player statistics, and in-game summaries and video highlights. For baseball fans like Kevin Heller and Brian Tashjian, the MLB At Bat experience is something of a holy grail \u2014 filled with information and media structured in a sensible way to baseball fans.Like many other baseball fans, the two base their foundational knowledge of a given player\u2019s performance by their statistics. \u201cThat\u2019s how I had grown accustomed to getting to know players,\u201d Tashjian said.The At Bat application also allows fans to stream local radio in real time from anywhere in the world, allowing fans to listen to their hometown announcers despite being in a different time zone or even continent. For fans like Matt Lynch, who describes an \u201caffinity\u201d for listening to radio broadcasts, this capability can have a significant impact on their relationship with their hometown team.Lee said that MLB Advanced Media\u2019s early investment and development of an infrastructure for streaming video has resulted in huge payoff. In addition to the earnings from its own product pipeline, MLB Advanced Media generates revenue by providing video streaming for a number of partners like ESPN.Cory Haik, an executive producer and senior editor at The Washington Post, says that heavy investment in mobile development is critical in today\u2019s climate, despite a lack of immediate ad revenue.\u201cThe experience is very intimate \u2014 it\u2019s personal. You\u2019re holding it in your hand,\u201d she said.Haik said mobile traffic often surpassed desktop traffic for certain content at The Washington Post in 2014, including video engagement.\u201cIt\u2019s an area of explosive growth,\u201d she said.Recently, HBO announced that it will be partnering with MLB Advanced Media to launch its highly anticipated standalone streaming service after failing to develop its own proprietary system.Another critical component of the application and second-screen experience relates to social context. Ryan Hubbard, who watched the game at the Nut House with a group of friends, uses his phones to add a social component. Even when physically sitting with a group of friends, Hubbard said that he enjoys connecting with other friends throughout the country who are also watching the game.MLB Advanced Media seems to have recognized the importance of implementing social features, as it added real-time social media capability to the application\u2019s package of features.\u201cSocial media is a great way to not only connect fans with content, but also to connect fans straight to the teams,\u201d Lee said.According to Lindauer, MLB Advanced Media is dedicated to picking up on new platforms and connecting with fans. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be late to any new social media party.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "In what's been dubbed the \"second screen\" phenomenon, contemporary baseball fans appear to be glued to their mobile devices while watching games.", "title": "Major league fans reach for the second screen to view baseball's biggest games - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-14-at-5.02.54-PM.png", "updated_time": "2015-01-27T19:07:32+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/01/21/second-screen-sports/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Business + Tech", "tag": "technology", "published_time": "2015-01-21T08:40:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-27T19:07:32+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "In what's been dubbed the \"second screen\" phenomenon, contemporary baseball fans appear to be glued to their mobile devices while watching games.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-14-at-5.02.54-PM.png", "title": "Major league fans reach for the second screen to view baseball's biggest games - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce161\"", "article_summary": "But while the contemporary baseball viewer appears to be glued to their personal devices, former MLB Advanced Media editorial producer Jay Lee says that the trend, dubbed the \u201csecond screen\u201d phenomenon, is something welcomed by Major League Baseball\u2019s media division.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be late to any new social media party.\u201d\nMobile devices have enabled fans around the world to connect to games and communicate directly with teams and players.The results have been staggering.\nThat\u2019s really Advanced Media\u2019s bread and butter.\u201dWhile broadcast ratings for baseball have slowed, its digital presence is thriving.\nLee is now a graduate student in the Stanford Journalism Program.\u201cBaseball fans are always consuming media, whether that\u2019s on TV, on the Internet, or reading newspapers,\u201d Lee said."}
