Broncos cornerback Champ Bailey was out on the practice field Tuesday morning, two days before the season opener against the Baltimore Ravens, but he ended up doing nothing the entire session.

As a result, Bailey was counted a non-participant for the second straight day on the team’s official injury report as he continues to recover from a sprained foot.

In the period open to media, the All-Pro cornerback did little more than stand around while other defensive backs went through secondary drills. Bailey missed Monday’s practice, but he provided an update on the condition of his foot, which has kept him out of action for the last two weeks.

His status remains very much in question for Thursday’s game.

Broncos coach John Fox did not add details to Bailey’s situation.

“Our final injury report comes out tomorrow, and we’ll leave it at that,” Fox said.

Meanwhile, guard Chris Kuper (ankle) has been a limited participant on Monday and Tuesday.

Fox did talk about the practice week leading up to the game, calling it “excellent.”

Said Fox: “The guys have been focused and understandably so. It’s the start of the new season. We’re fortunate to be kicking off the NFL season on national television against an opponent we know very well and they know us very well.”
