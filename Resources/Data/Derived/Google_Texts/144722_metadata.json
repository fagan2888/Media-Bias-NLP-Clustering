The sharp drop is considered to be the result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to legalize same-sex marriage and to uphold key provisions in Obamacare. Unsurprisingly, then, trust among Republicans has especially cratered:\n\nIn similar fashion, Republicans' trust in the judicial branch has fallen 17 percentage points since September 2014, but trust is essentially unchanged among Democrats, meaning Republicans are mostly responsible for the overall decline in trust. Independents show a modest six-point drop. Republicans' trust in the judicial branch, now at 42%, is easily the lowest for any party group in Gallup's trend.\n\nThe ripple effects of SCOTUS\u2019s sweeping rulings were most visibly seen in Rowan County, Kentucky, where court clerk Kim Davis was forced behind bars for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses because doing so would violate her Christian faith. Presidential candidates Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz rallied to her side as she was released from prison, defending her right to religious freedom.\n\nFor SCOTUS to win the approval of Republicans once again, it\u2019s going to take another landmark decision. Gallup suggests a favorable ruling in an upcoming Affirmative Action case could be its saving grace.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans are not happy with SCOTUS..05/26/2016 20:15:23PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Republicans are not happy with SCOTUS.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Trust in the Judicial Branch Drops Eight Points from Last Year", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/09/18/poll-finds-americans-trust-the-judicial-branch-less-than-ever-n2053797", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/220/68778f54-a04d-438e-9200-0d1ae15dcb81.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Republicans are not happy with SCOTUS.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Trust in the Judicial Branch Drops Eight Points from Last Year", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/09/18/poll-finds-americans-trust-the-judicial-branch-less-than-ever-n2053797", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/220/68778f54-a04d-438e-9200-0d1ae15dcb81.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Trust in the Judicial Branch Drops Eight Points from Last Year, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Unsurprisingly, then, trust among Republicans has especially cratered:In similar fashion, Republicans' trust in the judicial branch has fallen 17 percentage points since September 2014, but trust is essentially unchanged among Democrats, meaning Republicans are mostly responsible for the overall decline in trust.\nRepublicans' trust in the judicial branch, now at 42%, is easily the lowest for any party group in Gallup's trend.\nWhile trust in the executive and legislative branches ticked slightly up this year, the judicial branch continues to lose its integrity in the eyes of American voters.\nA new Gallup poll found that Americans\u2019 trust in the law-interpreting branch of government is at a record-low of 53 percent.\nThe sharp drop is considered to be the result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to legalize same-sex marriage and to uphold key provisions in Obamacare."}
