Also on display were philosophical and ideological splits within the GOP when a resolution sought by conservative free-marketers to stop the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank was narrowly voted down.\n\nRNC Chairman Reince Priebus of Wisconsin touted what he called \u201ca permanent ground game\u201d by Republicans rather than an operation solely focused on election times. \u201cWe didn\u2019t just create a few new programs. We established a new way of thinking \u2014 a national party, permanently in communities, year-round.\u201d\n\nPriebus pointedly noted the Chicago location for the summer meeting. \u201cWhat better way to show we\u2019re serious about being present everywhere than to come to the president\u2019s hometown,\u201d he told committee members.\n\nHe also hailed \u201cfuture governors who will bring new leadership to states where Democrats have failed, like right here in Illinois. I\u2019m looking forward to a big Republican victory here, when voters send Gov. (Pat) Quinn packing and elect Bruce Rauner the next governor.\u201d\n\nPriebus repeatedly called on committee members to lead the effort to \u201cfire Harry Reid,\u201d the Senate\u2019s Democratic majority leader, by electing a Republican majority in the chamber in the mid-term elections.\n\nGOP civil war costs $135M as Senate odds improving Mixing endorsements, advertising, and a drive to surpass tea party turnout, the business community has helped put Republicans in their strongest position yet to retake the Senate.

Jim Oberweis. Instead, Priebus went next door to cite the contentious Iowa Senate contest between Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst and Democratic U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley to fill the vacancy left by retiring veteran Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.\n\nPriebus also attacked Democrats for their stances on health care, energy policy and lack of educational choice and accused the opposition of trying to \u201crewrite the First Amendment and it\u2019s up to us to stop them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Democrats have it wrong. The First Amendment is sacred. Obamacare is not,\u201d Priebus said of the president\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act. \u201cIf we work together, conservatives, Republicans, independents, local tea party activists, we can fire Reid and get this country working. That doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have disagreements, But when we do, let\u2019s work it out.\u201d\n\nOne issue of disagreement within the GOP that didn\u2019t come up during the general session was immigration. Some conservative members of Congress returning home for a month-long recess have adopted more strident tones toward making changes in the nation\u2019s immigration laws in light of a border crisis involving thousands of undocumented children from Central America.\n\nBut one controversy did surface: the Export-Import Bank, which guarantees loans made by firms that import U.S.-made goods, and a brewing fight between conservative free marketers opposed to the institution and the GOP\u2019s business establishment, which supports it. An effort by conservatives to adopt a resolution of the Republican Party opposed to a reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank before a Sept. 30 deadline failed with 63 RNC members voting for it and 67 against.\n\nMorton Blackwell, committeeman from Virginia, called the bank \u201ca glaring example of crony capitalism\u201d and said the vote on the resolution represented \u201ca moment of truth for this national committee.\u201d But Jeff Kent, committeeman for Washington state, said adopting the resolution would \u201cinflame some tensions between our core supporters\u201d and divide states and some members of Congress from the national GOP.\n\nChicago-based Boeing Co., which has major operations in Washington, is among companies that have benefitted from the Export-Import Bank\u2019s loan guarantees in jet sales to foreign airlines.\n\nLater, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan from Janesville, Wis., the unsuccessful 2012 vice presidential nominee, told the committee that Republicans need a \u201c1980s-type election\u201d of the kind that put Ronald Reagan into the White House.\n\nRyan said the GOP has that opportunity because its loss to Obama came two years ago came during a debate against \u201cbig government in theory,\u201d and now \u201cwe have big government in practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look anything like what was used to sell it. The results are so far untethered from the rhetoric that was used to sell it that there is, in my opinion, a realization in this country that, \u2018Oh, all this big government isn\u2019t cracked up to what they said it would be,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nRyan also took a couple of shots at Obama\u2019s home state.\n\n\u201cFor those of you from Illinois, thank you so much for making our state look good,\u201d he said. He also said he prefers to fly out of Milwaukee, saying Mitchell Field is \u201can airport that\u2019s much more hospitable than the one north of here\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to O\u2019Hare International Airport.\n\nDuring an RNC dinner at the Shedd Aquarium, Wisconsin Gov.
