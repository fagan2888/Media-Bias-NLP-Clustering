He was forced to choose a new candidate after O\u2019Malley withdrew from the race after Iowa's caucus. He chose to support Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cWhat did it for me was Hillary Clinton\u2019s experience. I don\u2019t think we ever had a non-incumbent presidential candidate who is better prepared to be commander in chief than Secretary Clinton,\u201d said Majerus-Collins.\n\nAlthough the experience was a selling point for him, Majerus-Collins said he would support any candidate who earns the party\u2019s nomination.\n\nBut experience does not always translate to the best judgment, according to Bernie Sanders supporter Debra Cohen of Wethersfield.\n\n\u201cI think [Sanders] is absolutely the best candidate to come down the pike in years,\u201d said Cohen.\n\nUnlike Majerus-Collins, Cohen said that if Clinton earns the Democratic nomination, she will not cast a vote for her under any circumstances.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust her. I think that her position today may be very different from her position tomorrow,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the faith that she\u2019s going to represent the things that are important to me the way Bernie Sanders would.\u201d\n\nAccording to recent polls, Sanders had the advantage in the New Hampshire primary, but remains an underdog for the Democratic nomination nationwide.\n\nFormer gubernatorial candidate for governor Joe Visconti of West Hartford is a Trump supporter who made the trip to Amherst, New Hampshire.\n\nStephen Stepanek (@realDonaldTrump NH Co Chair) & yours truly at Amherst NH polls @johndankosky @wherewelive pic.twitter.com/OTGacC7Dk1 \u2014 Joe Visconti (@JoeVisconti) February 9, 2016\n\n\u201cMoney doesn\u2019t grow on trees. We\u2019re $19 trillion going on $22 trillion in debt,\u201d Visconti said. \u201cIf you think that\u2019s okay, and you think this is just going to go away, then Trump\u2019s wrong. If you have a brain, and you\u2019re using common sense you realize, financially first-- forget about all of those other issues-- we may go down the tubes.\u201d\n\nNutmeggers were eager to support their candidate\u2019s efforts in pursuit of the oval office, even if it required them to brave inclement weather across state lines, like Visconti, Cohen, and Majerus-Collins did.\n\nThe next scheduled stop in the road to the White House is February 20 in Nevada for Democrats, and South Carolina for Republicans.\n\nConnecticut's primary is scheduled for April 26.\n\nDaniel Keith is an intern at WNPR.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Connecticut voters made the trip north to support their candidates in New Hampshire's presidential primary on Tuesday.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/connecticut-residents-travel-north-primaries-support-candidates", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201602/new_hampshire.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Connecticut voters made the trip north to support their candidates in New Hampshire's presidential primary on Tuesday.", "title": "Connecticut Residents Travel North For Primaries in Support of Candidates"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Daniel Keith", "wordCount": 677, "dc": {"title": "Connecticut Residents Travel North For Primaries in Support of Candidates"}, "nid": 53997, "datePublished": "2016-02-09", "story_id": 466177407, "keywords": "The Daily, New Hampshire, campaigns, 2016, elections", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Connecticut voters made the trip north to support their candidates in New Hampshire's presidential primary on Tuesday.\nUnlike Majerus-Collins, Cohen said that if Clinton earns the Democratic nomination, she will not cast a vote for her under any circumstances.\nBut experience does not always translate to the best judgment, according to Bernie Sanders supporter Debra Cohen of Wethersfield.\nAlthough the experience was a selling point for him, Majerus-Collins said he would support any candidate who earns the party\u2019s nomination.\n\u201cI think [Sanders] is absolutely the best candidate to come down the pike in years,\u201d said Cohen."}
