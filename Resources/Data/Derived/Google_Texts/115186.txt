CHICAGO (AP) — Last-minute enrollment events in Illinois are bringing in stragglers who are signing up for insurance ahead of an important deadline under President Barack Obama’s health care law.

Audrey Carl of Enroll America says she’s seeing a steady flow of people Saturday at Presence Saints Mary and Elizabeth Hospital in Chicago.

Today is the final day for signing up for private health insurance coverage for 2015 under the law.

A telephone help line has been getting thousands of calls. Organizers say the Get Covered Illinois help desk has been fielding nearly 5,000 calls each day this week. Hours are extended this weekend to answer questions about enrolling in a health plan.
