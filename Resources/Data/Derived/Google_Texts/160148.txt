Republican presidential candidate and Ohio Gov. John Kasich is deriding his party's 2014 pledge to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's landmark healthcare overhaul, as a "big joke" and a "stupid promise." "You've been supporting conservative candidates," Kasich said Tuesday in comments on a Wisconsin radio talk show, first reported by BuzzFeed News. "They told you in 2014 that they were going to repeal Obamacare. Do you realize, that's just--that's a big joke?"/CBS News. More here.

Question: Will the Republican Party ultimately regret its diehard opposition to Obamacare?
