According to the Columbus Dispatch, the most serious incidents of the evening were scattered reports of fires:\n\nThere were more than 40 reports of fires \u2013 most of them in Dumpsters \u2013 in the hour after the Buckeyes\u2019 victory. Most were concentrated between 12th and 17th avenues, between N. High and Summit streets. In at least three cases, couches were reported to be set afire. According to radio traffic, in at least one case, other students helped the Fire Division and used a fire extinguisher on a couch. There also were about a dozen calls on trash fires in the campus area. No fire was reported to be serious.\n\nCourtesy of the Dispatch, the video below shows law enforcement, some clad in riot gear, casually walking through the crowd spraying anyone in their path, including young women. They also opened at least three tear gas canisters. At around the the 0:33 mark, two officers can be seen shaking their pepper spray cans and unloading them directly in the faces of students standing on the sidewalk, including the unlucky individual holding the camera.\n\nThree couch fires, an indeterminate number of dumpster fires, mostly within a five block vicinity, and a torn down goalpoast. That's what it took to bring out armored vehicles and potentially deadly instruments of war.\n\n(Hat tip: Garrett Quinn)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Police indiscriminately use pepper spray and tear gas on celebrating Ohio State students.", "title": "Warrior Cops Use Pepper Spray, Tear Gas on Celebrating Ohio State Students", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/01/13/warrior-cops-use-pepper-spray-tear-gas-o", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14211619465584.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Police indiscriminately use pepper spray and tear gas on celebrating Ohio State students.", "creator": "@anthonylfisher", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14211619465584.jpg", "title": "Warrior Cops Use Pepper Spray, Tear Gas on Celebrating Ohio State Students", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "War on Drugs", "published_time": "2015-01-13T16:05:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/anthony-l-fisher"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfef4\"", "article_summary": "Ohio State and Columbus police, including a SWAT team, indiscriminately used pepper spray and tear gas on students who refused to leave the streets after celebrating the Buckeyes' latest college football championship.\nThree couch fires, an indeterminate number of dumpster fires, mostly within a five block vicinity, and a torn down goalpoast.\nAccording to radio traffic, in at least one case, other students helped the Fire Division and used a fire extinguisher on a couch.\nMost were concentrated between 12th and 17th avenues, between N.
