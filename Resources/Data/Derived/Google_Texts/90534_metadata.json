Ronald Reagan, speaking at a campaign appearance in the summer of 1980, said,\n\nIt is time that we recognized that [the American War in Vietnam] was, in truth, a noble cause\u2026 We dishonor the memory of 50 thousand young Americans who died in that cause when we give way to feelings of guilt as if we were doing something shameful.\n\nReagan\u2019s letting-down-the-troops angle was a brilliant rhetorical tactic. According to the story he and his fellow conservatives told, the only problem with the Vietnam War was that we hadn\u2019t \u201clet the soldiers win it.\u201d By the time he took office, Reagan\u2019s conscience-free take on the war had gained traction among a public eager for easy absolution and a restoration of America\u2019s \u201cstanding in the world.\u201d It would go on to serve as convenient justification for other, similarly doomed wars of adventure in the years to come.\n\nThe story of the fall of Saigon as the right tells it is not one of American hubris getting its comeuppance via popular revolution or withdrawal of broad support at home, but one of sinister betrayal by spineless bureaucrats, cowed by selfish, pampered, troop-hating radicals. America\u2019s failure was not one of dubious moral judgement on the part of its ruling class, but rather moral turpitude on the part of its young people. Wall Street Journal editorialist Dorothy Rabinowitz saw the era as one of \u201cwild excess\u2026self-glorification and narcissism\u2026\u201d by \u201can incredibly spoiled, self-indulgent generation\u2026.who were taught to think everything they say is right,\u201d a perfect articulation of the self-justifying canard at the heart of what has become our popular understanding of the war, and of the similarly upside-down, false histories now being spun about Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThroughout the Reagan/Bush years, right-wing fabulists worked tirelessly to convince the public that the peace marches and race riots of the \u201960s had done more damage to this country than the war and racism that sparked them. That idealistic, pot-smoking, occasionally idiotic and arrogant teenagers, along with a small number of genuine radicals on the left, were more harmful than the paranoid, war-mongering, racist, sexist, corrupt, Constitution-subverting presidents, politicians, generals and police who spied on, tear-gassed, beat, slandered, suppressed and murdered countless numbers of their fellow citizens, not to mention 3.4 million people in Indochina, and the 58,000 American soldiers sent to kill them and die for no reason.\n\nThe right\u2019s willfully amnesiac version of the \u201960s is such conventional wisdom now that even ostensibly \u201cliberal\u201d journalists can\u2019t seem to help resorting to its tired tropes. In interviews given a few years ago while promoting his documentary about 1968, Tom Brokaw defined the era with a hypothetical, illustrative scenario: A man works hard and plays by the rules all his life, raises himself out of the working class and by the \u201960\u2019s is raising two kids in a comfortable home. He sits down to dinner one night to be told by his teenage daughter, who\u2019s wearing, in Brokaw\u2019s words, \u201ca blouse without a brassiere,\u201d that she\u2019s on the pill, and, by his son \u201cwith hair down to his shoulders, that he shouldn\u2019t worry, because he \u201cknows how to get out of the draft.\u201d\n\nFor Brokaw and other mainstream journalists, the defining traumas of the \u201960s were inflicted by protest-marching, draft-dodging, long-haired sons, and braless daughters on the pill. (Oh, and yes, there were also some assassinations, and they were bad, too, in a generic, completely decontextualized sort of way.) The worst injury of the decade was to the delicate sensibilities of hardworking, middle-class white men.\n\nThis vision of the era has become so entrenched it\u2019s almost impossible to imagine a figure like Brokaw describing an opposite, and far more essential version of the same scene: one where, say, a young man of draft age thinks that defending a corrupt dictatorship in a civil war on the other side of the world goes against everything for which his father\u2019s generation supposedly fought. One where maybe it\u2019s the son who\u2019s offended, by the way his father treats his wife, or talks about his one black co-worker, or seems so untroubled by his job at Dow Chemical. Or maybe a scene where the draft dodger is named Cheney and he tells his dad he has \u201cother priorities\u201d than fighting communism. But, unless Norman Lear has a sudden career resurgence, that kind of restoration of sanity is not going to happen any time soon.\n\nThat\u2019s too bad, because the hard lessons of the \u201960s would come in handy in 2015, if they weren\u2019t obscured by the right\u2019s self-serving fables. It was only a few years ago that George W. Bush said about the fall of Vietnam that, \u201cThe price of America\u2019s withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms, like boat people, re-education camps and killing fields.\u201d It was an obscene and almost psychedelic distortion of reality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 1980, Reagan turned the Vietnam disaster into a faux-patriotic rallying cry.
