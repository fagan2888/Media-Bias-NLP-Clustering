The opulent Miami mansion that was once home to the late fashion designer Gianni Versace was sold Tuesday morning, for $41.5 million, to investors including the family behind Jordache jeans.

VM South Beach LLC beat a $41 million bid from Donald Trump at Tuesday’s auction, the Miami Herald reported. VM South Beach, whose members include the Nakash family of Jordache Enterprises, holds the mortgage to the 10-room, 11-bath mansion.

The Nakash family had been seen as the mansion’s likely buyer because it owns the Hotel Victor next door. After the auction, Joe Nakash told the Herald he plans to operate the mansion as a hotel along with the Victor.

The mansion was put on the auction block as part of the owner’s Chapter 11 case. As a result, the Nakash family’s winning bid is subject to the approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Miami, which has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday.

Mr. Versace purchased the mansion, which also features an expansive garden and pool lined in 24-karat-gold, in 1992. He resided there for five years, until he was gunned down on the mansion’s doorstep in 1997.
