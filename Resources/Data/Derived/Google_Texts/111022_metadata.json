Residents in Malibu and Antelope Valley are more than 20 miles from their designated centers, despite an established center in Antelope Valley.\n\nLess than two percent of the overall $255 million in funds went to expanding trauma access to underserved areas in fiscal year 2011-2012. While the San Gabriel Valley pays approximately 20 percent of the taxes collected, it receives less than 1 percent of the funds, according to Assemblyman Roger Hernandez, D-West Covina.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a monstrous inequity in the way dollars have been incorporated,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting the representation and the services they\u2019re being taxed for.\u201d\n\nHernandez said the state legislature will use the audit as a road map for future legislation focused on expanding access to trauma centers and emergency rooms.\n\n\u201cNow that the audit has been done in a nonpartisan way, we now have real facts, real figures and a very stark picture of inequity, particularly to the people of the San Gabriel Valley,\u201d he said.\n\nThe auditor\u2019s report suggests the current annual reporting system used by the county\u2019s Emergency Medical Services Agency, which oversees the funds, does not account for gaps in coverage and should be replaced by an assessment by the American College of Surgeons.\n\n\u201cCertain geographical areas within Los Angeles remain far removed from existing trauma centers, thus requiring helicopter transport for some of those areas\u2019 trauma patients,\u201d the audit states. \u201cThe absence of a nearby trauma center potentially lengthens the time before the trauma victim receives care and may therefore affect the patient\u2019s health outcome.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe board of supervisors disbanded the Measure B Oversight Committee in 2004 and have not changed the funding model since then, according to the report.\n\nRoxane Marquez, a spokesperson for Supervisor Gloria Molina, said that while the number of trauma incidents have increased, the number of deaths from those incidents has declined.\n\n\u201cThis is evidence that the system is working,\u201d she said.\n\nMeasure B stabilized the county\u2019s trauma system, which dropped from 22 centers to 12 in 2002, Marquez said. The system now includes 14 hospitals, two of which are run by the county.\n\nShe said Molina is hopeful the Affordable Care Act will make trauma centers more sustainable.\n\nAuditors determined the county has made only \u201cminimal efforts to persuade a hospital\u201d in the East San Gabriel Valley to join the trauma system.\n\nPomona Valley Hospital Medical Center left the county\u2019s trauma system for financial reasons, but stated in a 2005 report that the hospital\u2019s staff believed trauma victims received acceptable treatment, according to the audit.\n\nState auditors found that the EMS Agency has not formally reached out to the Pomona Valley Hospital since that year, but that the agency sent a few informal emails.\n\nOfficials from the hospital told the auditors they would be open to discuss adding a trauma center, according to the report.\n\nThe Citrus Valley Medical Center once operated a trauma center at its Queen of the Valley campus in West Covina, but also shut it down for financial reasons in the 1980s, according to spokeswoman Annette Macias.\n\nCitrus Valley plans to conduct a study into the potential of adding a trauma center, she said.\n\n\u201cIt does come up and we\u2019re always evaluating the needs of our community,\u201d Macias said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t officially made a study, but it is something we do see as needed in the area.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The East San Gabriel Valley, Malibu and Antelope Valley still lack adequate trauma care despite a voter-approved measure granting hundreds of millions in funding in 2002, according to a state audit.The state audit conducted for the Joint Legisl", "title": "East San Gabriel, Antelope Valleys lack adequate trauma centers, state audit says", "og": {"url": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/health/20140226/east-san-gabriel-antelope-valleys-lack-adequate-trauma-centers-state-audit-says", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.sgvtribune.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/sgvtribune_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "East San Gabriel, Antelope Valleys lack adequate trauma centers, state audit says"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sgvtribune.com", "description": "The East San Gabriel Valley, Malibu and Antelope Valley still lack adequate trauma care despite a voter-approved measure granting hundreds of millions in funding in 2002, according to a state audit.The state audit conducted for the Joint Legisl", "title": "East San Gabriel, Antelope Valleys lack adequate trauma centers, state audit says", "url": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/health/20140226/east-san-gabriel-antelope-valleys-lack-adequate-trauma-centers-state-audit-says", "image": {"src": "http://local.sgvtribune.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/sgvtribune.png?052016"}, "site": "@SGVTribune", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551759403", "iphone": "id503025528", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sangabrielvalleytribune"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Emergency care, Emergency care news, West Covina Emergency care news, CA Emergency care news, US Emergency care news, world Emergency care news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Emergency care, Emergency care news, West Covina Emergency care news, CA Emergency care news, US Emergency care news, world Emergency care news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a22\"", "article_summary": "The East San Gabriel Valley, Malibu and Antelope Valley still lack adequate trauma care despite a voter-approved measure granting hundreds of millions in funding in 2002, according to a state audit.\nOfficials from the hospital told the auditors they would be open to discuss adding a trauma center, according to the report.\nShe said Molina is hopeful the Affordable Care Act will make trauma centers more sustainable.\nAuditors determined the county has made only \u201cminimal efforts to persuade a hospital\u201d in the East San Gabriel Valley to join the trauma system.\n\u201cCertain geographical areas within Los Angeles remain far removed from existing trauma centers, thus requiring helicopter transport for some of those areas\u2019 trauma patients,\u201d the audit states."}
