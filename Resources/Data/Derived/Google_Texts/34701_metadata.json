Limited interpretive theories, like textualism, are central to the commonly held conservative view that the Constitution demands a small government. Humility\u2014or the pretense thereof\u2014thus sits at the core of the conservative legal identity.\n\nBut humility is incompatible with sweeping declarations of certainty over highly contested matters. It is impossible at this point to support the ACA subsidy challenge and maintain that pretense.\n\nThe problem for ACA\u2019s challengers is that unambiguity isn\u2019t a flexible concept. If the ACA statute were truly unambiguous\u2014if there were no reasonable way to read it other than as a law that clearly prohibits subsidizing insurance in states that don\u2019t establish their own exchanges\u2014then they would be able to present the statute to five or 10 or 50 people capable of interpreting it, and all of them, or nearly all of them, would agree.\n\nInstead, among experts\u2014including several federal judges\u2014the challengers\u2019 view is the minority view.\n\nIf a law's meaning is to be divined from its text, and the Chevron standard says you can only find for the challengers if the law's meaning is unambiguous, a conservative justice can\u2019t find for them without implicitly rebuking or insulting all those other judges\u2014including, most likely, all of the liberal justices on the Supreme Court. Otherwise, the argument becomes self-contradictory. It\u2019s by definition ambiguous unless the many judges and scholars who\u2019ve looked at this issue and rejected the challenge are daft or corrupted or engaging in some kind of conspiracy.\n\nAnd you can\u2019t suggest that without surrendering all pretense of humility\u2014the very mantle of conservative jurisprudence.\n\nIn an exceptionally clean demolition of the challengers\u2019 case, University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley hinted at this basic contradiction. \u201c[T]he aspect of their argument that troubles me the most [is] their unyielding conviction that they\u2019ve identified the only possible construction of the ACA,\u201d Bagley wrote in a brief for the Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law. \u201cNowhere do they so much as acknowledge the possibility that maybe, just maybe, they\u2019re wrong. That\u2019s because they can\u2019t admit to doubt. Because of the deference extended to agency interpretation, doubt means they lose. But their unwillingness even to acknowledge ambiguity reflects an important difference between legal advocacy and neutral interpretation.\u201d\n\nAs it happens, there is a third plausible interpretation of the ACA\u2019s subsidy provisions: That they\u2019re unambiguous in the other direction. That the words of the ACA statute, \u201cin their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme\u201d unambiguously contemplate subsidies in every state.\n\nI favor this interpretation in the same way that I interpret Magritte\u2019s \"Treachery of Images\" to unambiguously depict a pipe. You might favor a murkier interpretation. But you'll only be misled into thinking that the pipe doesn\u2019t exist at all if you focus on the text below it (\u201cthis is not a pipe\u201d) in isolation. That\u2019s more or less what the supporters of the King challenge are asking of you.\n\nThis article has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "When the Supreme Court decides whether to void Affordable Care Act subsidies in dozens of states that didn\u2019t establish their own insurance exchanges, the most important word the justices will have to grapple with won\u2019t be the word \u201cexchange\u201d or \u201cestablished\u201d or \u201cstate.\u201d It will be the word \u201cunambiguous.\u201dTo quote Justice Antonin Scalia, the question before the justices (or at least the textualists ...", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "This case is the opposite of conservatism.", "title": "The Latest Challenge to Obamacare Should Embarrass Conservative Judges", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/2471190e0e39711d7930c47f692b0001f0a23a15.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/120455/supreme-courts-king-v-burwell-obamacare-challenge-lacks-humility", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This case is the opposite of conservatism.", "title": "The Latest Challenge to Obamacare Should Embarrass Conservative Judges", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/2471190e0e39711d7930c47f692b0001f0a23a15.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/2471190e0e39711d7930c47f692b0001f0a23a15.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Latest Challenge to Obamacare Should Embarrass Conservative Judges\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/120455/supreme-courts-king-v-burwell-obamacare-challenge-lacks-humility\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-12-02T16:44:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":120455,\"author\":\"Brian Beutler\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"King v.
