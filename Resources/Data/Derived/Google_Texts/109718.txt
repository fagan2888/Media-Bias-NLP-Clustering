Has Barack Obama’s presidency had more of a lasting impact on the U.S. than Ronald Reagan’s?

That’s what Paul Krugman would contend.

The progressive economist ranked the legacies of different presidents on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday morning, placing the sitting president behind Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Lyndon Baines Johnson, but saying that Obama has had a bigger impact on “the structure of American society” than Reagan.

“Obama really has left the world a different place,” Krugman argued, pointing to Obamacare, financial regulation and environmental legislation passed on Obama’s watch.
