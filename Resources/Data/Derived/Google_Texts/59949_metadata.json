He did, however, underscore that concerns some African Americans have about their treatment at the hands of police are legitimate, and indicated he was looking ahead to working on the root cause of the conflict in the racially charged case.\n\n\u201cBurning buildings, torching cars, destroying property, putting people at risk \u2013 that\u2019s destructive and there\u2019s no excuse for it. Those are criminal acts,\u201d he said at the start of an early evening speech here focusing on immigration just as the sun set in Missouri and another night of potentially violent protests loomed.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cNothing of significance, nothing of benefit results from destructive acts,\u201d Obama said. The achievements of the civil rights movement or the passage of the Affordable Care Act \u201chappened because people vote, because people organize \u2026 that\u2019s how you actually move something forward.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Ferguson's trial)\n\nNext week, Obama said, he will convene state and local officials, faith and community leaders, and others \u201cto start identifying very specific steps that we can take to make sure that law enforcement is fair.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to policing and race, \u201cthe problem is not just a Ferguson problem, it is an American problem,\u201d he said.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder, who met with Obama earlier in the day at the White House, told reporters in Washington he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the violence that followed the decision and declared that \u201cthese acts of violence cannot, and will not, be condoned.\u201d\n\nHolder said the Justice Department would take more steps to prevent violence in the coming days, like developing strategies for \u201cisolating the criminal elements from the peaceful protesters,\u201d and encouraged peaceful demonstrators to keep trying to discourage violence.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: King: Obama should invite Wilson to White House)\n\nHe also pledged that the department would continue working to educate police departments about the best way to handle demonstrations and promised more discussions around the country to ease the concerns of African Americans and other minority communities who feel singled out by police officers.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that what we see in Ferguson is not restricted to Ferguson,\u201d Holder said. \u201cThere are other communities around the country that have those same issues that have to be dealt with.\u201d\n\nHolder added, \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about talking. We want to make sure that concrete steps are taken to address these underlying barriers to trust.\u201d\n\nWhile looking ahead, Obama and his top aides are also closely monitoring the unrest spurred by the grand jury\u2019s decision. Senior adviser Valerie Jarrett spoke with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Monday night and again Tuesday morning, getting updates on the conditions on the ground and agreeing to stay in close contact. Jarrett, in turn, has been keeping the president updated.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Paul's take on Ferguson)\n\nNixon, for his part, held a combative news conference Tuesday that focused mostly on the violence rather than the community\u2019s concerns over the grand jury decision. He said Missouri was calling up hundreds of additional National Guard troops to police Ferguson, declaring that \u201cwhat they\u2019ve gone through is unacceptable.\u201d He continued, \u201cThis community deserves to have peace.\u201d\n\nThe White House also hosted calls with the Missouri congressional delegation and with mayors from across the country. In addition, Jarrett and Holder also spoke late Monday with a group of civil rights leaders with whom \u201cwe\u2019ve been working closely with them for the past few months leading up to this point to make sure responses to this moment would be appropriate and productive,\u201d Schultz said.\n\nAs Holder prepares to announce next steps for his agency, the Justice Department is continuing its separate investigations of the August shooting and the Ferguson Police Department and redoubling federal efforts to improve often icy police-community relations.\n\n\u201cThis grand jury decision is just one step in what\u2019s going to be a continuing legal process,\u201d said National Urban League President Marc Morial, who arrived in St. Louis midday Tuesday. \u201cI think that the Justice Department has done the right thing by quickly coming down here, quickly conducting their own investigation, not simply waiting.\u201d\n\nThe president has for weeks been privately voicing concern about the potential for unrest following the grand jury\u2019s decision on whether to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown, but he\u2019s limited in what he can say and do. He can\u2019t be seen as speaking in favor of either side of the case, and the power to respond to protests that get out of hand lies with state and local authorities.\n\n\u201cWe need to recognize that this is not just an issue for Ferguson, this is an issue for America,\u201d Obama said Monday. \u201cThese are real issues. And we have to lift them up and not deny them or try to tamp them down. What we need to do is to understand them and figure out how do we make more progress. And that can be done.\u201d\n\nObama can use his bully pulpit to speak out on the issue and use the power of his office to convene conversations about criminal justice reform.\n\nBeyond that, much of the work is coming from the Justice Department which, with no indictment coming from Missouri, now takes the lead in investigating the August incident.\n\nHolder said the Justice Department\u2019s dual investigations stemming from the Brown shooting remain ongoing.\n\nThe department offered new guidance last week aimed at helping law enforcement agencies begin tackling their challenges, issuing a 10-page document that includes links to various in-person and online training programs, as well as resources to help law enforcement plan for large events and to help repair frayed community relations.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Attorney General Eric Holder met with the president to discuss next steps.", "title": "Obama criticizes violence in Ferguson", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/obama-white-house-ferguson-reaction-113172.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/25/141125_obama_ferguson_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Ferguson,Darren Wilson,Eric Holder,Missouri,Michael Brown,White House,Department Of Justice", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Attorney General Eric Holder met with the president to discuss next steps.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd61\"", "article_summary": "White House Obama criticizes violence in FergusonCHICAGO \u2014 President Barack Obama, seeking to calm roiling tensions in Ferguson, Missouri, told those behind violent protests in the St. Louis suburb Tuesday that discontent with a grand jury\u2019s decision does not justify their behavior.\n\u201cThe reality is that what we see in Ferguson is not restricted to Ferguson,\u201d Holder said.\n\u201cWe need to recognize that this is not just an issue for Ferguson, this is an issue for America,\u201d Obama said Monday.\nBeyond that, much of the work is coming from the Justice Department which, with no indictment coming from Missouri, now takes the lead in investigating the August incident.\nStory Continued Below\u201cNothing of significance, nothing of benefit results from destructive acts,\u201d Obama said."}
