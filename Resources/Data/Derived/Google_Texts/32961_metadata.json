Yet, evolving agency processes is not an easy task. One way to facilitate achieving business process improvement is to keep in mind these four guiding principles.\n\n1. Evolving Processes is a Team Sport\n\nWho would oppose more streamlined workflows, more trusted analytics and cost-savings to boot? As it turns out, many stakeholders may get in the way of progress if they are not involved, informed and incentivized to support process improvement initiatives.\n\nEffective system design and workflow improvements no longer are the sole domain of enterprise architects or IT professionals. Today, these efforts require a host of participants collaborating to understand their \u201cas-is\u201d state and what it will take to arrive at the desired \u201cto-be\u201d processes that meet current requirements of service providers and beneficiaries.\n\nBut how do agency professionals foster this team effort in a large and complex enterprise? One method to guide improvements across multistakeholder workgroups is leveraging business process analytics. By effectively analyzing business processes, agencies can better understand how their processes are conducted step by step, define alternate approaches and desired outcomes, and consider the impact of contemplated process changes across their organization and affected teams.\n\n\n\n2. Prepare the Design Team for the Unexpected\n\nAs part of an April 2015 dialogue held at the ModernGOV Summit in Washington, D.C., James Martin, BoldNote executive vice president, observed that in many cases, no one person really understands end to end what happens in complex processes involving numerous organizations, departments and constituents. This reality complicates the ability of organizations to demonstrate return on investment for new processes, as they lack a reliable baseline for the original process metrics.\n\nNitin Naik, director for strategic planning and technical direction with the IRS Enterprise Services group, added that federal agencies need to use business processes and corresponding analytics to address evolving requirements.\n\nAs an example, he cited two significant legislative updates that came into effect for the 2015 tax season that \u201cfundamentally changed\u201d the agency\u2019s tax processing. Specifically, the Affordable Care Act and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act required the IRS to redesign a number of business processes to comply with these new laws.\n\nNaik\u2019s advice for those facing the significant task of updating long-standing business processes, particularly those dependent on legacy systems and complex programming, is that all members of the design team be prepared to understand processes from beginning to end. The team also should involve those who created the original code and processes when possible, and perhaps most importantly, be prepared to negotiate how workflows will be handled in the future.\n\n3. \u201cTo-be\u201d or \u201cNot-to-be\u201d is Still the Big Question\n\nMany organizations fall into the trap of automating \u201cas-is\u201d processes, rather than taking the opportunity to rethink the \u201cto-be\u201d state and how they might consolidate or eliminate steps or entire processes.\n\nNaik observed that often the \u201cas-is\u201d state was directly tied to technology limitations that existed when the process was designed. With the pace of technology evolution and user expectations, the \u201cto-be\u201d processes by definition can and should evolve and leverage current technology maturity.\n\nTo illustrate his point, Naik noted that the application response time tolerated by the average online customer today is 5 seconds -- or less, down from 20 seconds just a few years ago. Agencies must be prepared to deliver their information and services in accordance with these evolving industry standard practices and norms for performance, security, privacy and more.\n\nAnother key factor that can influence the \u201cto-be\u201d process decision is what Martin referred to as the influence of the \u201cheavy-weight champion\u201d -- the internal senior leader who helps business process optimization teams drive improvement, create innovative approaches and ultimately, foster internal cooperation. Getting the primary stakeholders on board to design how things will work in the future is essential to realizing the inherent efficiencies that can result from streamlined processes.\n\n4. There Needs to Be a Measurable Feedback Mechanism\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much can be shaved off when you get down to what really needs to be done,\u201d Martin remarked when reflecting on recent process improvement initiatives. A number of tools exist to support automation, monitor transactions and ensure the usability of new processes. Additionally, there are a range of methods for collecting and determining end-user sentiment and feedback to support continuous process review and adjustment.\n\nAs agencies continue to balance budget constraints with increasing mission scope, continued optimization of business processes may prove a fruitful path. With a bit of planning, agencies can set a foundation for not only accommodating today\u2019s requirements, but also preparing to more easily adapt to tomorrow\u2019s demands.\n\n(Image via Tsyhun/ Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Darryn Graham", "description": "As agencies continue to balance budget constraints with increasing mission scope, continued optimization of business processes may prove a fruitful path.", "og": {"site_name": "Nextgov", "description": "As agencies continue to balance budget constraints with increasing mission scope, continued optimization of business processes may prove a fruitful path.", "title": "4 Things to Consider when Revamping Agency Processes", "url": "http://www.nextgov.com/technology-news/tech-insider/2015/05/evolving-agency-processes-4-things-consider/112399/", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2015/05/11/051115processNG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@nextgov", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2015/05/11/051115processNG/open-graph.jpg", "description": "As agencies continue to balance budget constraints with increasing mission scope, continued optimization of business processes may prove a fruitful path.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "4 Things to Consider when Revamping Agency Processes"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-11T17:04:12Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2015/05/11/051115processNG.jpg", "sailthru.title": "4 Things to Consider when Revamping Agency Processes", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2015/05/11/051115processNG/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "channel-nextgov->-news->-tech-insider,type-story,length-medium,site-nextgov", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Nextgov"}, "sailthru.description": "As agencies continue to balance budget constraints with increasing mission scope, continued optimization of business processes may prove a fruitful path."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe24f7\"", "article_summary": "One way to facilitate achieving business process improvement is to keep in mind these four guiding principles.\nEvolving Processes is a Team SportWho would oppose more streamlined workflows, more trusted analytics and cost-savings to boot?\nWith the pace of technology evolution and user expectations, the \u201cto-be\u201d processes by definition can and should evolve and leverage current technology maturity.\nAs agencies continue to balance budget constraints with increasing mission scope, continued optimization of business processes may prove a fruitful path.\nSpecifically, the Affordable Care Act and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act required the IRS to redesign a number of business processes to comply with these new laws."}
