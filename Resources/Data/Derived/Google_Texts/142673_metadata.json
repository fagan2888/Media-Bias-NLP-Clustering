The crowd went wild. Yay coal! Yay America!\n\nSantorum\u2019s literal embrace of coal will soon be matched by Jeb Bush\u2019s figurative bear hug of the coal industry, as he travels next week to a \u201cCivil War-themed golf tournament\u201d in Virginia put together by the country\u2019s most powerful coal barons. Jeb\u2019s already staked out an \u201ceh, science, whatever\u201d position on the human contribution to climate change, so there\u2019s a roughly 100-percent chance he\u2019ll emerge from his golf weekend with a renewed commitment to rejuvenating the coal industry as part of \u201cAmerica\u2019s 21st-Century Energy Revolution\u201d or whatever nonsense he comes up with.\n\nThe coal industry\u2019s future has been a key component of Republican political strategy, as candidates across the board have lashed out at the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cWar on Coal.\u201d It\u2019s a smart bit of politicking \u2013 attacks on \u201cjob-killing regulations\u201d and hippie environmentalism get the conservative base riled up, and the plight of the out-of-work coal miner plays to broader resentments working class voters feel over disappearing jobs and evaporating economic opportunities. But the implicit, and sometimes explicit, promise of the anti-\u201cWar on Coal\u201d rhetoric \u2013 that the coal industry would be thriving but for liberal political meddling \u2013 is a lie.\n\nEconomics is what\u2019s killing the coal industry. Coal is a dirty fuel that costs a lot of money to pull from the earth, at least when compared to cheaper alternatives like natural gas, which produces fewer harmful emissions when burned. In Appalachian coal country, where Rick Santorum traces his roots, decades of enthusiastic mining have depleted all the easy-to-extract coal, leaving thin seams that are more difficult (and more expensive) to mine. The industry itself has been bleeding jobs since the early 1980s as machines have supplanted human labor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ending Obama's \"War on Coal\" won't save the coal industry, despite what Rick Santorum and other Republicans say", "title": "GOP\u2019s cynical coal rhetoric: Empty promises about a dirty fuel\u2019s nonexistent future", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ending Obama's \"War on Coal\" won't save the coal industry, despite what Rick Santorum and other Republicans say", "title": "GOP\u2019s cynical coal rhetoric: Empty promises about a dirty fuel\u2019s nonexistent future", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/29/gops_cynical_coal_rhetoric_empty_promises_about_a_dirty_fuels_non_existent_future/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/rick_santorum_coal.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ending Obama's \"War on Coal\" won't save the coal industry, despite what Rick Santorum and other Republicans say", "title": "GOP\u2019s cynical coal rhetoric: Empty promises about a dirty fuel\u2019s nonexistent future", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/rick_santorum_coal.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Climate Change, Coal, Environmentalism, Global Warming, Jeb Bush, Republican Primary, Republicans, Rick Santorum, sierra club, war on coal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cLadies and gentlemen, this is a piece of coal,\u201d Santorum said at the beginning of his speech, holding up a glossy chunk of anthracite for the crowd to inspect.\nBut the implicit, and sometimes explicit, promise of the anti-\u201cWar on Coal\u201d rhetoric \u2013 that the coal industry would be thriving but for liberal political meddling \u2013 is a lie.\nEconomics is what\u2019s killing the coal industry.\nIn Appalachian coal country, where Rick Santorum traces his roots, decades of enthusiastic mining have depleted all the easy-to-extract coal, leaving thin seams that are more difficult (and more expensive) to mine.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, Climate Change, Coal, Environmentalism, Global Warming, Jeb Bush, Republican Primary, Republicans, Rick Santorum, sierra club, war on coal, Politics NewsWhen Rick Santorum announced his 2016 presidential candidacy earlier this week, he brought props with him."}
