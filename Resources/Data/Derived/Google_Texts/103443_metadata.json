The recently released House calendar shows the lower chamber in session for only 111 days with the Senate showing up for work 149 times. After an extended August recess \u2013 providing those seeking re-election with ample time to campaign \u2013 only 42 days will remain to wrap things up.\n\nAnd, of course, the race for the presidency will play a role in what gets considered and what doesn\u2019t. With both chambers under GOP control, leaders may want to delay major actions until it\u2019s determined who will be residing in the White House for four years beginning in 2017.\n\nLame duck sessions are rarely the best time to get any legislating done but two factors may force some action -- 2016 provides President Obama with a final opportunity to add to his legacy and newly-installed House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) may want to leave an immediate mark.\n\nDuring an address at the Library of Congress on Dec. 3, Ryan said his top congressional priority for 2016 \u201cis to put together a complete alternative to the left\u2019s agenda,\u201d which he termed \u201ca work in progress, no doubt.\u201d\n\nTopping Ryan\u2019s list is tax reform \u2013 a phrase that attracts widespread support on both sides of the political aisle but means different things to different people, and that\u2019s the rub.\n\nRyan said he wants a code \u201call of us can live by.\u201d Currently \u201cwe have a tax code that none of us can understand.\u201d It should be a tax code \u201cthat rewards good work instead of good connections.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only way to fix our broken tax code is to simplify, simplify, simplify,\u201d he said. \u201cClose all those loopholes and use that money to cut tax rates for everybody. Take the seven tax rates we have now and collapse them to two or three.\u201d\n\nRyan said he understands why individuals and organizations might want to retain the \u201cloopholes\u201d that work to their advantage.\n\n\u201cBut there are so many of them that now the tax code is like a to-do list --Washington\u2019s to-do list,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Washington has no business micromanaging people\u2019s lives -- pure and simple. I also know many of these loopholes will be fiercely defended. All I can say is we will not be cowed. We are not here to smooth things over. We are here to shake things up.\u201d\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, also is on board, but he expressed doubt that Obama \u201chad an epiphany and decided to join with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to do comprehensive tax reform and what are the conditions under which you can achieve that? I think you have to have a bipartisan agreement that it\u2019s going to be revenue neutral to the government,\u201d McConnell told reporters.\n\nAlso on the agenda \u2013 and it\u2019s a big maybe \u2013 is the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement with 11 Pacific Rim countries to \"promote economic growth; support the creation and retention of jobs; enhance innovation, productivity and competitiveness; raise living standards; reduce poverty in our countries; and promote transparency, good governance, and enhanced labor and environmental protections.\" The pact includes provision to reduce tariffs and create a dispute settlement mechanism.\n\nRyan wants to get to it pronto. At an event earlier this month sponsored by Politico, Ryan called the deal \u201cvery important,\u201d asserting that it has \u201ca lot of promise\u201d since it provides the U.S. with an opportunity to set the rules for global trade in a growing economic region.\n\nThe White House would certainly like to move the agreement but McConnell is decidedly more cautious, suggesting that action might have to wait until after the November election, a move that would save GOP incumbents seeking a return to Washington some cover for a potentially tough vote.\n\nObama, who has called TPP \u201cthe most progressive trade deal in history,\u201d has made passage of the pact a priority heading into the legislative session despite some opposition from both Republicans and protectionist Democrats. The administration, he said, will have to \"stitch together the same kind of bipartisan effort\" that helped his administration win a fight over fast-track trade authority.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "What to Expect When Congress Returns in 2016", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "News and Politics", "description": "And what might realistically get done by lawmakers in a presidential campaign season.", "title": "What to Expect When Congress Returns in 2016", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/2015/12/28/what-to-expect-when-congress-returns-in-2016/", "image": "http://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/user-content/50/files/2015/12/shutterstock_156615524.sized-770x415xb.jpg", "updated_time": 1464271531, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "And what might realistically get done by lawmakers in a presidential campaign season.", "title": "What to Expect When Congress Returns in 2016", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/2015/12/28/what-to-expect-when-congress-returns-in-2016/", "image": "http://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/user-content/50/files/2015/12/shutterstock_156615524.sized-770x415xb.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "What to Expect When Congress Returns in 2016", "pinterestDescription": "What to Expect When Congress Returns in 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "keywords": "congress, campaign 2016, paul ryan, tax reform, obamacare, criminal justice reform, john cornyn, mitch mcconnell", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd93dc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut there are so many of them that now the tax code is like a to-do list --Washington\u2019s to-do list,\u201d he said.\nWhatever members of Congress choose to address in 2016, they\u2019re not leaving themselves much time to do it.\nWhat to Expect When Congress Returns in 2016WASHINGTON \u2013 Lawmakers return to Washington next month after the traditional holiday respite with plenty of issues pending as they enter the second session of the 114th Congress, but time and politics might get in the way of any substantial successes.\nRyan said he wants a code \u201call of us can live by.\u201d Currently \u201cwe have a tax code that none of us can understand.\u201d It should be a tax code \u201cthat rewards good work instead of good connections.\u201d\u201cThe only way to fix our broken tax code is to simplify, simplify, simplify,\u201d he said.\nAnd, of course, the race for the presidency will play a role in what gets considered and what doesn\u2019t."}
