Jim Webb will announce Tuesday he is considering an independent bid for the White House, his campaign announced, as his long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination continues to flounder. Webb will hold a press conference at the National Press Club \u201cto discuss his candidacy, the campaign and his views of` the political parties in the current election cycle,\u201d the campaign said in a statement.\n\nWhy is Webb, a Democrat, more of a threat to peel off Republican voters than Democratic ones? It\u2019s a simple function of how the two party\u2019s coalitions align. The Democratic nominee will almost certainly be either Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden. Left-wingers won\u2019t be thrilled with that, but Clinton and Biden are more liberal than Webb is. Except as a pure protest vote, there\u2019s no incentive for a progressive to back him. On the right, however, we\u2019re staring at a primary process that\u2019s going to produce a nominee who\u2019s deeply dissatisfying to some sizable chunk of the GOP or another. If it\u2019s Trump, you\u2019ll see some conservatives peel off in disgust that he\u2019s too liberal and other because he doesn\u2019t have the right \u201ctemperament\u201d to be president. If it\u2019s Carson, some will defect for fear that he doesn\u2019t know the issues well enough and is really just a boutique culture-war candidate. If it\u2019s Jeb, some righties will stay home in droves to protest the RINO dynasty effectively buying the nomination. If it\u2019s Rubio, some tea partiers and libertarians will skip the election to make a statement about amnesty and interventionism, respectively. If it\u2019s Cruz, some centrists will conclude that they could never vote for brinksmanship, shutdowns, and grandstanding towards the right.\n\nWe\u2019re not talking about huge minorities of the GOP in any of these scenarios, but you wouldn\u2019t need huge numbers to be decisive in a close election. And Jim Webb, as I said last week, is an attractive heterodox candidate. For everything there is to dislike about him, like ObamaCare for illegals, there are things to like \u2014 war hero, former secretary of the Navy under Reagan, willing to buck the left on some cultural hot buttons like affirmative action, and supportive of a more modest foreign policy abroad while also astutely criticizing Obama for weakness. He\u2019s not an ideal candidate for any Republican, but people eager to cast a protest vote aren\u2019t looking for perfection. They\u2019re looking for one or two very appealing qualities in a third-party candidate that they can seize on and glorify as a reason to prefer that guy to the major-party nominees. Webb has lots of appealing qualities. Trump fans, in particular, might like his blue-collar vibe if Trump falls short in the primaries and they decide that no one in the rest of the Republican field is speaking to them. The only question for Webb is whether he\u2019s willing to run energetically enough, with enough money behind him, to land on voters\u2019 radar. There\u2019s no evidence that he\u2019s capable of that yet given his dismal performance in the Dem primary, but what if, say, Mike Bloomberg got on board? He\u2019s one billionaire away from being a force in the race.\n\nSpeaking of dismal performances, here\u2019s the new ad from Team Hillary. It\u2019s five minutes of trying and failing to find one single concrete major achievement from her time as Secretary of State. Among the highlights: She helped light the match for the flaming bag of sh*t that you and I know as the Iran nuclear deal, and she brokered a truce between Israel and Palestine that somehow hasn\u2019t stopped Palestinians from stabbing Jews in the head on the streets of Jerusalem today. Libya and the Russian reset, arguably her two showiest ventures at State, oddly don\u2019t figure prominently. Any theories why?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Uh oh.", "title": "Not good: Jim Webb considering independent run for president", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/10/19/not-good-jim-webb-considering-independent-run-for-president/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-19T23:21:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-20T11:59:33+00:00"}, "keywords": "Hillary Clinton, independent, Jim Webb, republican, trump,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Except as a pure protest vote, there\u2019s no incentive for a progressive to back him.\nAnd Jim Webb, as I said last week, is an attractive heterodox candidate.\nFormer Virginia Sen.
