Sadie has about 500 fires under her collar, sniffing out evidence of what could have started the blazes.\n\nSadie was originally purchased by Jerry as a gift for his daughter\u2019s 16th birthday.\n\nWhitney, Jerry\u2019s daughter, remembers Sadie as a \u201clittle bowling ball,\u201d saying she was a heavy puppy. She also said the puppy was cautious and careful.\n\n\u201cWhen we first got her, we took her to PetSmart to get her a collar, and she didn\u2019t want to walk on the leash,\u201d Whitney laughed. \u201cSo I had to carry her.\u201d\n\nWhen it came time for Whitney to go away to college, she and her dad sat down to talk about Sadie\u2019s future. Jerry would soon be retiring his first arson dog, and Sadie fit the profile to be in the program.\n\nWhitney said she wanted Sadie to have something to do while she was away, so they agreed the dog would work with Jerry, and when Sadie retired, Whitney could have her dog back.\n\nOn Saturday, Whitney and her dog were together except when Sadie was being honored. Sadie was relieved of her badge, which hung from her collar, and Jerry gave her a kiss on the snout.\n\n\u201cNo more work,\u201d Jerry told Sadie. \u201cJust \u2018Animal Planet.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe arson dog program is funded by State Farm insurance, which provides the two to three months of training for each of the dogs \u2014 which is worth $25,000 per animal.\n\nHeather Paul, the State Farm arson dog program coordinator, said they do not buy their dogs from breeders. They get them from animal rescues and shelters, and many of the dogs in the program are rescued from being euthanized.\n\nThe program goes beyond law enforcement. According to Paul, it is a love affair between dog and handler.\n\nThe dogs in the program are with their handlers all the time \u2014 they live in their handler\u2019s house, they sleep in the bed, they go on vacations with them and they are fed from their handler\u2019s hands.\n\nJerry said it is bittersweet to let Sadie go, and that it is hard to watch a dog step out of active duty.\n\n\u201cSadie is OK with it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe never really cared to ride in the truck too much. She gets a little motion sickness. But she has fought through it in all these fires, and now she just gets to be a dog.\u201d\n\nRiley, a 2-year-old black Lab, will be taking Sadie\u2019s place. He is the first male dog that Jerry has worked with, and he said Riley is a handful.\n\nThe first time the two met, Riley had Jerry flat on his back in a matter of minutes and showered him with kisses.\n\nRiley finished K-9 training in May and has already responded to about 20 fires.\n\n\u201cEvery time I think of Sadie, I am extremely proud,\u201d Jerry said. \u201cRiley has some big paws to fill.\u201d\n\nCorrie Sahling: 303-954-1223, csahling@denverpost.com or twitter.com/corriesahling", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CBI dog retires to the dog days of summer after working at 500 fires", "title": "CBI dog retires to the dog days of summer after working at 500 fires", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/02/cbi-dog-retires-to-the-dog-days-of-summer-after-working-at-500-fires/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140802__CD03ARSONK9S__PAT3346p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140802__CD03ARSONK9S__PAT3346p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-02T15:35:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:14:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd67f9\"", "article_summary": "Heather Paul, the State Farm arson dog program coordinator, said they do not buy their dogs from breeders.\nJerry would soon be retiring his first arson dog, and Sadie fit the profile to be in the program.\nSadie has about 500 fires under her collar, sniffing out evidence of what could have started the blazes.\nHe is the first male dog that Jerry has worked with, and he said Riley is a handful.\n\u201cJust \u2018Animal Planet.\u2019 \u201cThe arson dog program is funded by State Farm insurance, which provides the two to three months of training for each of the dogs \u2014 which is worth $25,000 per animal."}
