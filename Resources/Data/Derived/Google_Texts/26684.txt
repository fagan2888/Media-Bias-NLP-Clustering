CAVE CREEK, Ariz. (AP) - The owner of a metro Phoenix bar that went up in flames in a suspected arson fire is vowing to rebuild.

Buffalo Chip Saloon and Steakhouse owner Larry Wendt told Phoenix’s KPNX-TV (http://bit.ly/1LFku5k) on Friday that he hopes to reconstruct the Cave Creek bar’s main building as soon as possible.

The bar’s patio and barbecue buffet areas are intact.

The Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office says the blaze was intentionally set Thursday.

According to Wendt, investigators found someone had lit rolls of toilet paper on fire in a restroom either with matches or a cigarette.

Buffalo Chip is known as a gathering spot for Green Bay Packers fans.

Firefighters had put out a small fire in the bathroom and returned later in the day when another fire sparked in the attic.
