Wildfires are threatening thousands of homes in Northern California, and firefighters are also battling major blazes in Oregon and Washington.

NOTEWORTHY

And Jen Welter has become the first female coach in the N.F.L.

• Chilly at the office?

A study published today says that most office buildings set temperatures based on an old formula that uses the metabolic rates of men.

The study concludes that buildings should “reduce gender-discriminating bias in thermal comfort” because setting temperatures at slightly warmer levels can help combat global warming.

• Jon Stewart’s farewell.

There are only four episodes of “The Daily Show” left, and Amy Schumer (Monday), Denis Leary (Tuesday) and Louis C.K. (Wednesday) are among the final guests (11 p.m. Eastern, Comedy Central).

BACK STORY

It’s time to break out the crayons.

If you haven’t done that recently, you’re behind the times: One of the year’s fast-growing hobbies for adults is coloring.

Five of Amazon’s top best sellers are coloring books (for grown-ups). A “Game of Thrones Coloring Book” (clearly for grown-ups) is coming out this fall.

And a venerable publishing house, Little, Brown, is releasing four coloring books for adults this year, all subtitled “Color Your Way to Calm.”

“Splendid Cities” and “Secret Paris” were published this summer, while “Secret Tokyo” and “Secret New York” are coming out in October.

Many busy people say they find the pastime a relaxing break from electronic screens.

John Jr. and Edmund McLoughlin, two brothers from New York, are credited with creating the first coloring books, the “Little Folks” series, in the 1880s. It helped that crayons started selling about that time, too.

Did we mention that Sunday was National Coloring Book Day?

Good luck trying to stay between the lines in these books or on these free downloadable pages.
