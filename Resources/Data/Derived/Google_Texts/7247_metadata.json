(Photo by Underwood Archives/Getty Images) Underwood Archives/Getty Images\n\nHilo Hattie, a popular chain for Hawaii\u2019s tourists in search of souvenirs, laid out a plan to get out of bankruptcy and repay some of its debts after selling its most valuable location for $5.1 million earlier this year.\n\nIn court papers, Hilo Hattie lawyers proposed to use the sale money to repay a portion of the company\u2019s debts, including a $360,000 chunk of sale money that would flow to unsecured creditors who are owed more than $3 million.\n\nThe plan projects that the 52-worker chain, which has downsized from seven to three locations, will start seeing sales grow starting next year. By 2020, the chain expects to take in about $7.5 million from the sale of its travel trinkets, Hawaiian floral-printed shirts and other inventory, according to documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Honolulu.\n\nThe survival plan still needs approval from Bankruptcy Judge Robert Faris and from creditors, who have the power to vote against it.\n\nFounded in 1967, the chain filed for bankruptcy on Feb. 19 facing eviction and collection demands \u201cagainst which the [company] does not have a viable defense,\u201d said Chief Operating Officer Mark Storfer in court papers.\n\nThe company blamed its financial problems on sales that slowed after the global financial crisis weakened Hawaii\u2019s tourist-dependent economy. It sold about $15.6 million worth of products\u2014down from $23.6 million the year before.\n\nAfter bankruptcy, Hilo Hattie found a buyer for one of its two Honolulu locations. In recent years, the company stopped making its own products and bought from overseas suppliers to cut costs, which eroded its reputation for selling high-quality, Hawaiian-made products and hurt sales further.\n\nThe retailer had already downsized during a 2008 bankruptcy, which it filed after an aggressive, failed expansion to Guam and in mainland U.S. The new stores didn\u2019t make money, and many closed.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech at katy.stech@wsj.com.
