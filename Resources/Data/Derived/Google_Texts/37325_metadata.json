Federal Blvd., which previously held an Albertsons warehouse that has been empty for nearly a decade.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge need for healthcare services in this part of town,\u201d Denver City Councilman Paul Lopez said. \u201cFor years there hasn\u2019t been enough slots available, resources available for folks who need healthcare, prenatal care, dental and checkups.\u201d\n\nThe new clinic will be one of Denver Health\u2019s larger facilities outside the main campus at 777 Bannock St., according to Dr. Paul Melinkovich, director of community health services for Denver Health.\n\nThe clinic will have 40 exam rooms, 10 rooms for urgent care with extended hours, a pharmacy and dental clinic.\n\nMelinkovich said Denver Health is looking at other specialty services such as optometry, podiatry or physical therapy.\n\nDenver Health will break ground on the $37-million facility this fall, and it is scheduled to open early in 2016.\n\n\u201cClearly what we want to do is increase our capacity for primary care services, dental care and urgent care,\u201d Melinkovich said.\n\nSouthwest Denver, along with the northeast part of the city, has stood out as being underserved to Denver Health. While the organization has expanded in areas such as Montbello and Green Valley Ranch, this is the first venture into southwest Denver in some time.\n\nLopez said the proceeds from the sale of the closed Mariposa clinic will help support the building of this new location.\n\nThere is already a small clinic next to Knapp Elementary School in the Westwood neighborhood and the Sam Sandos Westside Family Health Center at 1100 Federal Blvd. Lopez said those sites will remain open.\n\n\u201cThose places will stay as is. We\u2019re not replacing, we\u2019re adding,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are currently seven satellite Denver Health clinics throughout the city and Melinkovich said this eighth facility will not only serve low-income people, but also everyone who needs health care. The new clinic doesn\u2019t have a name yet, but Denver Health is determining a process to name the facility.\n\nMelinkovich also noted the increase in patients with the Affordable Care Act, but that Denver Health hasn\u2019t had the facilities to support everyone.\n\n\u201cThere are a large number who have been enrolled in the exchange program, yet capacity for primary care hasn\u2019t increased,\u201d Melinkovich said.\n\nFeedback has been mostly positive from the community, according to Lopez. However, some residents have complained about traffic that the clinic will create, while some wanted to bring a new grocer to the area.\n\nLopez said a new grocer was not possible because the landowners were the grocer across the street and didn\u2019t want to bring in competition to the area.\n\nHe added: \u201cRather than it sitting vacant, it\u2019s being put to use.\u201d\n\nJoe Vaccarelli: 303-954-2396, jvaccarelli@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joe_vacc", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Health buys land in southwest Denver for new clinic", "title": "Denver Health buys land in southwest Denver for new clinic", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/02/denver-health-buys-land-in-southwest-denver-for-new-clinic/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-02T11:34:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-02T11:34:04+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2bf\"", "article_summary": "\u201cClearly what we want to do is increase our capacity for primary care services, dental care and urgent care,\u201d Melinkovich said.\nSouthwest Denver, along with the northeast part of the city, has stood out as being underserved to Denver Health.\nDenver Health will break ground on the $37-million facility this fall, and it is scheduled to open early in 2016.\nDenver Health recently purchased the land at 1339 S.
