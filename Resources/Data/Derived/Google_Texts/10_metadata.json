Shutdown would delay military pay\n\nThe armed forces and their families are once again facing the possibility of delayed paychecks.\n\nIf Congress and the White House can\u2019t reach a spending deal by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, members of the military would be expected to work during the shutdown, but would not get paid until the issues are resolved.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cYou will be paid, just not on time,\u201d said John Cooney, who served as deputy general counsel in the Reagan White House Office of Management and Budget.\n\nMilitary pay often becomes a political football as budget negotiations go down to the wire because it provides each side with accusations they can use against each other, Cooney said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the rhetoric to influence the public. Each side accuses the other of harming the military and national security.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Senate turns to CR that defunds Obamacare)\n\nThere have been some legislation efforts to take the troops out of the equation, but none has gotten off the ground.\n\nIn January, Sens. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) introduced legislation that would protect pay for the troops during a shutdown, but it didn\u2019t get beyond the committee.\n\nPolitically, there\u2019s little incentive for Congress to take the issue off the table because it\u2019s a key part of the blame game. In reality, though, the uniformed military would fare relatively well during a shutdown because they\u2019re guaranteed by law to be paid, whereas hundreds of thousands of Defense Department civilians risk more unpaid furloughs, Cooney said.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: House Democrats wrestle with shutdown options)\n\nWith government-shutdown scares becoming an almost annual ritual, the Pentagon has little new planning to do to prepare for life without any continuing spending resolution beyond Sept. 30.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019ve seen this movie before,\u201d George Little, assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, told reporters at the Pentagon. \u201cWe have plans on the shelf if required to execute a government shutdown.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, OMB asked all federal agencies to prepare for the possibility of a government shutdown. And at the Pentagon, spokesman Cmdr. Bill Urban said, \u201cThe planning is consistent with what has been done in previous instances where a potential lapse in appropriations was approaching.\u201d\n\n( WATCH: Obama: GOP 'holding the whole country hostage')\n\nFor now, he said he could not provide any more specific details. But if the guidance provided in recent shutdown drills is any indication, the Pentagon will not have the funds during the days the government is shut down to pay the military and civilian employees who are required to work.\n\nDuring the shutdown scare in the spring of 2011, service members and essential Defense Department civilians were expected to work without receiving immediate pay. Instead, they would have to be paid retroactively, the Pentagon said at the time.\n\nAll personnel whose jobs are associated with protecting life and property are required to work. And in 2011, in addition to military operations overseas in Afghanistan, Iraq, Japan and Libya, the Pentagon also exempted:\n\n\u2014 Inpatient and emergency outpatient care in defense medical treatment facilities and emergency dental care.\n\n\u2014 Dining facilities and child-care activities.\n\n\u2014 Some legal activities and contracting and logistics operations supporting exempted activities.\n\n\u2014 Some education and training activities, including Defense Department Education Activity schools, and some financial management activities.\n\nFor those DoD civilian employees who were furloughed during a shutdown it would be up to Congress to provide Defense Department the authority to pay them retroactively.\n\n( PODCAST: The Scrum: Government Shutdown vs. Obamacare Funding)\n\nIn every earlier shutdown, Cooney said, Congress has gone back and paid those furloughed.\n\nRetired members of the military have a lot less to worry about as their benefits are not funded through the annual appropriations process, but instead paid for by multi-year bills. And those checks will keep coming because Congress has already committed the money, Cooney said.\n\nWhile the Pentagon has gotten used to the shutdown threats, it has also become accustomed to Congress averting the crisis at the last minute.\n\nFor now, the Pentagon is hoping the same thing happens this time around.\n\n\u201cThere is enough time for Congress to prevent a government shutdown,\u201d Urban said, \u201cand we hope that Congress will work with the administration to pass a full fiscal year 2014 appropriations prior to Oct. 1.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "There have been efforts to take the troops out of the equation, but none has gotten off the ground.", "title": "Shutdown would delay military pay", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/government-shutdown-delay-military-pay-97150.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/02/12/130212_troops_home_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Government Shutdown (230),Pentagon (588),Military (575)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "There have been efforts to take the troops out of the equation, but none has gotten off the ground.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9370\"", "article_summary": "Shutdown would delay military payThe armed forces and their families are once again facing the possibility of delayed paychecks.\n( PODCAST: The Scrum: Government Shutdown vs. Obamacare Funding)In every earlier shutdown, Cooney said, Congress has gone back and paid those furloughed.\nMilitary pay often becomes a political football as budget negotiations go down to the wire because it provides each side with accusations they can use against each other, Cooney said.\nDuring the shutdown scare in the spring of 2011, service members and essential Defense Department civilians were expected to work without receiving immediate pay.\nFor those DoD civilian employees who were furloughed during a shutdown it would be up to Congress to provide Defense Department the authority to pay them retroactively."}
