Yeah, well maybe if he weren\u2019t facing such relentless, unprecedented opposition and obstruction, he\u2019d have been able to fix [insert issue] by now. Their argument is a bucket of hogwash and it\u2019s promulgated via a rash of acute selective memory syndrome. It must have been Chris Matthews\u2019 recent blatherings that finally pushed me over the edge, prodding me to write a fairly lengthy piece debunking Obama sycophants\u2019 most calcified and self-serving myth:\n\nThe way the story goes, Barack Obama\u2019s presidency has been marred by a toxic and unique strain of political resistance. Opposing a president from the opposite party is one thing, they say, but the manner in which Republicans have treated Obama betrays something far more sinister than garden variety politics. The rarely-unspoken subtext is that the GOP\u2019s groundbreaking vitriol and obstruction has been reserved for Obama because he\u2019s black. By abiding and advancing this claim, Obama\u2019s supporters allege that conservatives have sought to delegitimize the president from his very first day in office. Ironically, the reverse is closer to the truth; dating back to the 2008 campaign, many liberals have maliciously conflated conservative objections to Obama\u2019s policies with thinly-veiled racism. Hurling the racism charge is a particularly insidious method of disqualifying Obama\u2019s critics, which is the whole point. Concerns over wrongful IRS targeting? Racism. Strenuous disapproval of Obamacare? Racism\u2026. Clinton administration staffers removed the \u2018W\u2019 keys from many White House keyboards as Team Bush transitioned into office. Lefties regularly compared Bush to Hitler and apes. A feature-length film was produced fantasizing about depicting Bush\u2019s assassination, to critical acclaim. Senate Democrats launched unprecedented filibusters against Bush\u2019s lower-court judicial nominees, opposing one exceptionally-qualified pick in part because \u201che is Latino.\u201d (When Republicans answered in kind during the Obama years, Senate Democrats broke Senate rules and nuked the filibuster). In order to obstruct Bush from making contentious recess appointments, Democrats pioneered a practice that technically kept the Senate in session in perpetuity. (When Republicans answered in kind during the Obama years, Obama simply decreed that the Senatewas in recess, and made his appointments anyway). Harry Reid called President Bush \u201ca loser.\u201d Keith Olbermann, then a host on Matthews\u2019 network, bellowed at the top of his lungs on-air that \u201cMr. Bush\u201d should \u201cshut the hell up.\u201d While much is made of the small right-wing faction that doubts President Obama\u2019s status as a natural born citizen, far less attention has been paid to the 51 percent of self-identified Democrats who told pollsters in 2006 that they believe it was at least \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d likely that Bush administration officials suppressed advanced warnings of the 9/11 attacks in order to precipitate, and presumably profit from, war. Indeed, several Democratic members of Congress indulged those insane accusations, as did a future Obama appointee.\n\nI went on to quote a memorable Dana Milbank column from 2005, which described the faux impeachment hearings dozens of House Democrats conducted in the Capitol basement over the Iraq war. Milbank noted that an overflow crowd at DNC headquarters brimmed with activists passing out leaflets about how Israel had received advanced notice of 9/11. Yes, really. How might, say, Chris Matthews react if the RNC were to host a veritable birther convention, the whole purpose of which was to watch a live stream of Michele Bachmann\u2019s unsanctioned impeachment proceedings against Barack Obama? And how would the \u201cunprecedented!\u201d crew explain the Left\u2019s behavior throughout the Walker recall saga in Wisconsin? In the Townhall post excerpted above, I didn\u2019t even get a chance to tackle the Left\u2019s endless \u201cobstructionism\u201d carping. That part of the narrative overlooks (a) the fact that Obama had massive \u2014 and for several months, veto-proof \u2014 majorities in both houses of Congress for the first two years of his term, and (b) subsequent elections, in which the American people voted for divided government to slam the brakes on the out-of-control Obama/Reid/Pelosi express. And please stow your predictable \u201cgerrymandering!\u201d excuse, liberals. Not only is it empirically false that redistricting allowed the GOP to retain its House majority in 2012, Republicans\u2019 redistricting advantage was only made possible by the party\u2019s massive landslide victories in 2010. If you\u2019ll recall, those outcomes were a direct result of intensely unpopular Democratic overreach. Elections, as they say, have consequences. I\u2019ll leave you with this:\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Selective memories.", "title": "Sorry, Obamaphiles, opposition to this president isn\u2019t \u201cunprecedented\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/12/10/sorry-obamaphiles-opposition-to-this-president-isnt-unprecedented/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-10T22:11:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-10T22:55:34+00:00"}, "keywords": "hypocrisy, race card,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e95\"", "article_summary": "Harry Reid called President Bush \u201ca loser.\u201d Keith Olbermann, then a host on Matthews\u2019 network, bellowed at the top of his lungs on-air that \u201cMr.\nYeah, well maybe if he weren\u2019t facing such relentless, unprecedented opposition and obstruction, he\u2019d have been able to fix [insert issue] by now.\n(When Republicans answered in kind during the Obama years, Obama simply decreed that the Senatewas in recess, and made his appointments anyway).\nThe rarely-unspoken subtext is that the GOP\u2019s groundbreaking vitriol and obstruction has been reserved for Obama because he\u2019s black.\nSenate Democrats launched unprecedented filibusters against Bush\u2019s lower-court judicial nominees, opposing one exceptionally-qualified pick in part because \u201che is Latino.\u201d (When Republicans answered in kind during the Obama years, Senate Democrats broke Senate rules and nuked the filibuster)."}
