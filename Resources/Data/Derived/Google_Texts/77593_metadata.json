His technological exploits may have earned him over $80 billion, making him the world\u2019s richest man. Yet even Bill Gates is somewhat concerned about the potentially destructive power of technology.\n\nIn a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Wednesday afternoon, Microsoft\u2019s former CEO fielded an array of questions ranging from the banal (\u201cDo you have a pet?\u201d) to the cringeworthy (\u201cStar Trek or Star Wars?\u201d) to the painfully esoteric.\n\nRelated: The Truth About Robots and Your Job\n\nCertain themes popped up again and again. BitCoin and other cryptocurrencies made regular appearances, as well as jokes about Bing, Zunes and other Microsoft properties. Gates\u2019s charity work was also frequently brought up, with his latest contribution \u2014 a sewage treatment machine that turns wastewater (or \u201cPoop Water,\u201d as Gates calls it, sounding like a dad trying desperately to sound cool) into perfectly clean drinking water \u2014 an object of inevitable Reddit interest and/or disgust.\n\nAnother recurring theme was that of artificial intelligence, and, by extension, superintelligence. It was in these answers that Gates expressed a somewhat surprising opinion:\n\nI am in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence. First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.\n\nThe concerns of Elon Musk that Gates refers to are based in the work of Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom. In a tweet last August, Musk mentioned Bostrom\u2019s work, adding that if handled poorly, AI could be \u201cmore destructive than nukes.\u201d\n\nWorth reading Superintelligence by Bostrom. We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 3, 2014\n\nIn Superintelligence, Bostrom suggests that the creation of artificial intelligences with abilities comparable to those of humans will quickly give way to \u201csuperintelligences\u201d \u2014 computers with cognitive and computational abilities that far surpass those of humanity.\n\nThe issue with these superintelligences, though, is that once they\u2019re created, they\u2019ll be too hard to control. Though we may imbue superintelligences with goals that are intended for our benefit, Bostrom suggests that the nuances of these goals may be lost once translated into a language understandable to machines.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Robots Could Humanize War\n\nAn example Bostrom gives is that of a hypothetical intelligence charged with something innocuous like \u201cmaking people smile.\u201d To a human researcher, this would suggest a robot that tells jokes or stories. To a superintelligence, however, a more efficient route to accomplish its goal would be to paralyze the facial muscles into a fixed grin.\n\nPictured: The Future\n\nAs far as Gates is concerned, though, this terrifying dystopian future is a long way off. In another comment, he assures a questioner that a career in programming is still a safe choice for now.\n\nClick here to read the full AMA.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "He may be one of the world\u2019s pivotal computing pioneers, mentioned in the same exubera", "title": "Bill Gates Is Worried About the Rise of the Machines", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/28/Bill-Gates-Worried-About-Rise-Machines", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/04022013_Robots_Terminator_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/28/Bill-Gates-Worried-About-Rise-Machines", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/04022013_Robots_Terminator_slideshow.jpg", "creator": "@lumbology", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "He may be one of the world\u2019s pivotal computing pioneers, mentioned in the same exubera", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "It was in these answers that Gates expressed a somewhat surprising opinion:I am in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence.\nThe concerns of Elon Musk that Gates refers to are based in the work of Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom.\nYet even Bill Gates is somewhat concerned about the potentially destructive power of technology.\nI agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.\nPictured: The FutureAs far as Gates is concerned, though, this terrifying dystopian future is a long way off."}
