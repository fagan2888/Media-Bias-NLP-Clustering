Heidi Zuckerman Jacobson\u2019s gift is to know it before everybody else.\n\nShe has an eye for artists, plucking painters and installationists from obscure parts of the globe and presenting their first U.S. exhibits at her Aspen Art Museum, then watching them go on to fame.\n\nShe has an eye for architects, selecting not-so-famous Shigeru Ban to design the museum\u2019s new building eight years ago and declaring that he would win the Pritzker Prize for the job. She was half-right; Ban won his profession\u2019s highest honor for other projects this spring, a good bit of timing that turns the $45 million Aspen Art Museum\u2019s grand opening this weekend into an international event.\n\nAnd in a sense, she had an eye for Aspen\u2019s own potential, knowing that she could transform its tiny, community museum into a world-class gallery \u2014 if she could change the city\u2019s perception of itself.\n\n\u201cWhen I came here, people said, \u2018Don\u2019t expect anyone to give you money,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Why not?\u2019 And they said, \u2018This is people\u2019s second or third or fourth home, and they won\u2019t give here,\u2019 \u201d Zuckerman Jacobson recollected over lunch last week.\n\nShe believed she could win them over, using the gallery\u2019s walls as a weapon.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Well, actually, if what we are doing is interesting \u2014 or more interesting \u2014 than where-ever else they live \u2014 then they will give money.\u2019 And so, that was what we set out to do.\u201d\n\nZuckerman Jacobson\u2019s tenure hasn\u2019t been without tumultuous bumps. The museum project has been controversial from the start, dividing the town\u2019s old guard from its nouveau riche, sometimes painfully.\n\nBut her success can be quantified. Before she took over as CEO and chief curator in 2005, the largest donation in the museum\u2019s history was $75,000. She has since raised more than $103 million for the cause \u2014 a historic achievement for a female director at a non-collecting art museum. Twenty-seven individuals handed over $1 million or more each.\n\nHer progress also shows in the museum she built. Ban\u2019s design is sleek and cutting-edge, a giant, three-story box that is wrapped, sidewalk to ceiling, in a basket of woven wood strips. It is large and awkward for its corner in Aspen\u2019s downtown, but it is also unique and respectful to the architecture around it. Ban sheathed his building in wood to honor the timber materials traditional to mountain structures and opened the rooftop to a fresh-air park, free of charge to the public, that captures one of the best views around.\n\nThe building also respects Zuckerman Jacobson\u2019s primary concern, which is showcasing art. The galleries are large, light-filled and efficient with 14-foot ceilings, a sharp contrast to the museum\u2019s former headquarters in a converted hydroelectric plant on the edge of the commercial district.\n\nZuckerman Jacobson is famous for not compromising when it comes to what she shows. She chooses difficult, often-hard-to-get topics, and held onto that habit throughout her long fundraising period, a time when other museum directors might have leaned toward populist exhibits to win goodwill.\n\n\u201cHeidi is a powerhouse at the very heart of the contemporary art field,\u201d said Adam Lerner, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver, who himself has a national reputation for innovation.\n\n\u201cUnder her leadership, the Aspen Art Museum has consistently brought to light the next and the next and the next horizon of contemporary artists.\u201d\n\nThere was more than art going on at the Aspen Museum, though, and the curator\u2019s strategy for winning support is textbook for the way museums build their base these days. Her first step was to expand her board, winning over a few local philanthropists, then having them recruit a few philanthropic friends and turning the museum into a social club of sorts.\n\n\u201cI started to figure out who people were interested in being the room with and being at the table with and starting to engage those people in the idea of the museum and ask for their support. Then it kind of went from there,\u201d she said.\n\nBoard meetings were expanded into informal gatherings and converted into international road trips. Give at a certain level and you get to go on vacation with your wealthy pals. Zuckerman Jacobson cashed in favors from the many artists she discovered, and the trips became exclusive. Artist Vic Muniz flew to Brazil to greet the Aspen team when they traveled to his country. Ernesto Neto did the same.\n\nThen there was Art Crush, the museum\u2019s annual fundraising party. Zuckerman Jacobson, a stickler for details, turned the f\u00eate into a luxe bash, with the best food and cocktails in town. She asked her artist connections to donate works for auction \u2014 dog photographer William Wegman donates, so does Chinese superstar Ai Weiwei \u2014 and that drew the well-heeled local crowds. Twenty-two of the \u201cTop 200\u201d art collectors listed by the prestigious \u201cArt in America\u201d magazine have homes in Aspen, and they know a deal when they see one.\n\nThat brought on mega-sponsors like Sotheby\u2019s auction house and Dom P\u00e9rignon, which became the house drink. The party is now the social event of the season in Aspen. Last week\u2019s night of revelry, a clothes-conscious affair with artists and paparazzi in attendance, brought in a whopping $3 million for the museum.\n\nWith its ambitious director leading the charge, the museum has become so fashionable an association that fundraising for the new building had to be adjusted up again and again. The original goal was $30 million, then $40 million, then $50 million. So far, the giving has totaled $72 million, with $27 million going into an endowment.\n\nSomething gained, lost\n\nThe conversion of the museum into a playground for high-minded art aficionados and the part-time wealthy families who come and go hasn\u2019t sat well with all of Aspen. Locals like to point out that the museum used to be a place people went for student art exhibits or to see regional artists show off their wares; when the big fundraiser was a community party held on a ranch and people wore jeans.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from what the museum is known for now, like presenting the first important exhibitions of deeply cerebral German artists like Nicole Wermers or Friedrich Kunath or showcasing Brooklyn artist Lorna Simpson\u2019s creative commentary on race relations.\n\n\u201cIt was really very much a center of town for many years,\u201d said Mary Eshbaugh Hayes, who has covered the social scene for the Aspen Times for four decades.\n\n\u201cI have to say, the last six or seven years, it\u2019s become a very elite place for rich people.\u201d\n\nThe transformation has turned the museum into a symbol of the identity crisis Aspen has suffered for years, as the one-time mountain hamlet has evolved into a ski getaway for movie stars and a vacation destination for outsiders who build enormous homes in the hills and live in them just a few weeks of the year.\n\nLocals have fought the relocation since the idea came up, worried that the building would be out of character next to the city\u2019s Victorian homes and red-brick businesses. In 2009, voters overwhelmingly turned down a ballot measure that would have sold a parcel of public land near the old site to the museum for its relocation.\n\nIt\u2019s been ugly, to say the least, and the insults have flown, many in the direction of Zuckerman Jacobson, who lobbied hard personally for the ballot measure, showing off Ban\u2019s design and promising to deliver a gift to the community.\n\n\u201cHeidi was in absolute tears the night it was turned down, absolute tears,\u201d said Nancy Magoon, a board member who has donated more than $2 million to the museum. \u201cWe had to reconfigure and start all over again.\u201d\n\nA new beginningThe museum regrouped, identifying a lot on the corner of Spring Street and Hyman Avenue. The land was private, so no voter approval was necessary, and Zuckerman Jacobson moved forward quickly.\n\n\u201cThe harder something is, the more I like it, and that\u2019s an Aspen criterion, too,\u201d she said. \u201cHow hard can you push yourself? How many times a week can you go to yoga? How many times a day can you go up and down Ajax? That kind of competitiveness is who we are.\u201d\n\nThat drive has defined her career, during her five-year stint as a curator at The Jewish Museum in New York, then more than six years at the Art Museum at the University of California in Berkeley.\n\nAspen has come with its own set of challenges, including, she says adamantly, fundraising. People who have been successful in business need to be convinced that their donations will be used productively, and she\u2019s had to justify every penny she\u2019s asked for.\n\n\u201cPeople think it must be easy, but we\u2019ve been successful because it\u2019s been hard,\u201d she said. \u201cWho likes to do stuff that\u2019s easy anyway?\u201d\n\nAll those donations up the responsibility to do the job better, to produce the \u201cperfect museum\u201d as she believes she has done in Aspen, and to maintain a program where \u201cthe curatorial ambitions are huge.\u201d\n\nZuckerman Jacobson, who sees things before everybody else, predicts a bright future for the museum, and she knows she has to deliver the goods for years to come if all those promises she made to donors, artists and architects and to the town are to be fulfilled.\n\n\u201cAs a cultural worker, all I have is my integrity,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not an accountant or a lawyer with a trained set of skills. All I have is my integrity.\u201d\n\nRay Mark Rinaldi: 303-954-1540, rrinaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/rayrinaldi", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "How Heidi Zuckerman Jacobson turned Aspen\u2019s art scene international", "title": "How Heidi Zuckerman Jacobson turned Aspen\u2019s art scene international", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/07/how-heidi-zuckerman-jacobson-turned-aspens-art-scene-international/", "image": {"width": 436, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20140807__20140810_E1_AE10FAASPENMUSEUMp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20140807__20140810_E1_AE10FAASPENMUSEUMp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-07T17:10:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-21T21:29:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e78\"", "article_summary": "Zuckerman Jacobson, a stickler for details, turned the f\u00eate into a luxe bash, with the best food and cocktails in town.\nThe land was private, so no voter approval was necessary, and Zuckerman Jacobson moved forward quickly.\nZuckerman Jacobson is famous for not compromising when it comes to what she shows.\nShe has since raised more than $103 million for the cause \u2014 a historic achievement for a female director at a non-collecting art museum.\nShe was half-right; Ban won his profession\u2019s highest honor for other projects this spring, a good bit of timing that turns the $45 million Aspen Art Museum\u2019s grand opening this weekend into an international event."}
