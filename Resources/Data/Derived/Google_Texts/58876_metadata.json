Charter supporters last week submitted 73,000 signatures to the state elections division in a step toward securing a spot on the 2016 ballot for an initiative that would allow more charter schools.\n\nCharter school opponents say the privately run, publicly funded schools can craft policies that push out students who are more difficult to educate, skewing achievement statistics. Proponents say the innovative approaches charter schools can take lead to high-quality education.\n\n\u201cA large body of evidence suggests that urban charters generate large academic gains for lottery applicants,\u201d Setren writes. \u201cAt the same time, critics of charter schools not only note that special needs students appear underrepresented in charters, but they also question whether charters serve these students well.\u201d\n\nSetren\u2019s study followed applicants for 30 Boston charter schools, both those who were accepted via lottery and those who were not, throughout their Massachusetts public school experience. It found that, in Boston charter schools, 1.41 times as many special education students and 1.42 times as many English language learners scored \u201cadvanced\u201d or \u201cproficient\u201d on MCAS mathematics tests than their peers in district schools.\n\nOn the MCAS English exams, rates of advanced and proficient scores at charter schools were 1.37 times higher for special education students and 1.36 percent higher for English language learners.\n\nThe study found that special education students in charter schools were 44.2 percent less likely to graduate high school in four years, but that there was no statistically significant difference in five-year graduation rates for special education students between charter and district schools.\n\nSpecial education students attending charter schools are also more likely to meet the math and English proficiency requirement for high school graduation, become eligible for a state merit scholarship, take an Advanced Placement exam and score higher on the SAT. Charter school special education students were not significantly more likely to earn a passing score on the AP exams, according to the study.\n\nSetren writes that she does not have enough evidence to definitively state which school characteristics better suit special needs students, but that higher staff-to-student ratios, extra learning time and intensive tutoring are likely important factors.\n\n\u2014 Written by Katie Lannan\n\nCopyright State House News Service\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/08/m-i-t-research-finds-special-needs-students-benefit-from-charter-school-education/", "article_author_name": "State House News Service", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MIT_Dome_night1-e1453994909105.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "boston, charter schools, classroom, learning, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, public schools, special education, standardized test scores"}, "description": "Special education students and English language learners enrolled at charter schools are more likely to earn higher scores on the state's standardized tests.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MIT_Dome_night1-e1453994909105.jpg"}, "keywords": "mit,massachusetts institute of technology,boston,charter schools,special education,public schools,learning,classroom,standardized test scores", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "research finds special needs students benefit from charter school educationPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/08/m-i-t-research-finds-special-needs-students-benefit-from-charter-school-education/M.I.T.\nCharter school special education students were not significantly more likely to earn a passing score on the AP exams, according to the study.\nThe study found that special education students in charter schools were 44.2 percent less likely to graduate high school in four years, but that there was no statistically significant difference in five-year graduation rates for special education students between charter and district schools.\nThe Senate is expected to decide next month whether it will take up charter school legislation.\n\u201cCharters generate substantial gains for special needs students in math and English standardized exam scores, English proficiency, and college preparation outcomes,\u201d the study concluded."}
