Due to this overwhelming statistic, wouldn\u2019t it make sense that the best prevention for cervical cancer would be the detection of this extremely common virus? That\u2019s exactly what researchers from one study believe, and they're calling for the long-trusted Pap test to be replaced with screening for HPV.\n\nCompelling Evidence Suggests HPV Test\u2019s Superiority\n\nResearchers from the National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Cancer Institute feel that HPV screenings may offer a \u201cviable alternation\u201d to the traditional Pap screening, and have collected very strong evidence to back their case. The study included data from over one million women between ages 30 and 64 who were screened for cervical cancer at Kaiser Permanente Northern California since 2003, Reuters reported.\n\nWomen who tested negative in their Pap or HPV tests were the primary focus of the researchers, who were eager to see how many of these negative test results actually resulted in cancer up to five years after testing. \u201cWhat we wanted to see is whether primary HPV screening could be a good alternative to Pap and compare it to co-testing,\u201d lead author Julia Gage told Reuters.\n\nResults showed that 20 out of the 100,000 women who received a negative Pap test ended up developing cervical cancer within five years of their test. This number was nearly halved when compared with results from the HPV test. Only 11 of the 100,000 women who tested negative for HPV went on to develop cervical cancer. In the 100,000 women who tested negative for the HPV/Pap co-test, 14 went on to develop cancer.\n\nWhat Are Pap and HPV Tests?\n\nHPV is without doubt the most common sexually transmitted infection, infecting an estimated 79 million people worldwide, according to Reuters. The HPV test is similar to the Pap smear, requiring doctors to take a cell sample of a woman\u2019s cervix. However, unlike the Pap test, which is designed to find any abnormalities in the cervix, the HPV test specifically looks for the presence of HPV.\n\nDon\u2019t Say Goodbye To The Pap Smear Just Yet\n\nAccording to Gage, the results are not surprising when one takes into consideration the fact that HPV is the number one cause of cervical cancer. Still, regardless of the study\u2019s results, the researchers are not suggesting that the Pap smear be forever retired. It is still regarded as an important indicator of female health, and would be a useful tool in monitoring the status of women who are already known to be carriers of HPV.\n\nCervical Cancer Is Not To Be Taken Lightly\n\nIn the year 2014, about 12,000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer, and of them, one third have already died from the disease, according to information released by the National Cancer Institute. The disease is slow-growing and rarely has symptoms. Internal examinations, such as the Pap or HPV test, are the only way to diagnose the disease and their results are often the only indication that a woman is even suffering from the cancer in the first place.\n\nIn 2012 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that all women between the ages of 21 and 65 received a Pap test every three years, and those between the ages of 30 and 65 take both the HPV and Pap test once every five years, Reuters reported.\n\nSource: Gage JC.
