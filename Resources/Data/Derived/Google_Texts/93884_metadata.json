He\u2019s been the superintendent of Oakdale Schools for 35-years and tells News 9 this isn\u2019t the worst budget crisis he\u2019s seen.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s probably the second worst I would say,\u201d Lanier said.\n\nThe state had similar budget problems in the 80s and Lanier says, unfortunately, lawmakers didn\u2019t seem to learn from their mistakes.\n\nThe state is bracing for its third revenue failure in June. That will mean more cuts. The Speaker of the House of Representatives last week said he won\u2019t accept anything more than 5-percent cuts to common education.\n\nBut Lanier says that number is deceptive because, in most schools, 80-to-85 percent of the budget is for salaries. And you can\u2019t lay off teachers mid-way through the school year. So that five percent will come out of whatever\u2019s left after salaries.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking the five percent cut not out of your budget but out of that 15 to 20 percent of the budget that you actually have to pay bills with,\u201d Lanier said.\n\nHe says he would like to see more budget talks and less partisan politics at the capitol.\n\n\u201cMaybe a little bit more cooperation and a little less putting up fences would help,\u201d Lanier said. \u201cIf I would hear more \u2018We all agree\u2019 as opposed to \u2018This party, this party,\u2019 I think that would bring a little bit of reassurance.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the cuts though, Lanier says experience tells him public education will survive.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be OK,\u201d Lanier said. \u201cIt may be a step backwards. But we will\u2026we will survive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "It has been a busy time at the state capitol, but there is still very little movement on bridging the state\u2019s $1.3 billion budget deficit, and that has some school leaders concerned.", "author": "Aaron Brilbeck", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31659475/state-educators-criticize-lawmakers-over-budget-crisis", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10269694_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It has been a busy time at the state capitol, but there is still very little movement on bridging the state\u2019s $1.3 billion budget deficit, and that has some school leaders concerned.", "title": "State Educators Criticize Lawmakers Over Budget Crisis"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10269694_G.jpg", "description": "It has been a busy time at the state capitol, but there is still very little movement on bridging the state\u2019s $1.3 billion budget deficit, and that has some school leaders concerned.", "card": "summary", "title": "State Educators Criticize Lawmakers Over Budget Crisis"}, "wnreadableurl": "state-educators-criticize-lawmakers-over-budget-crisis", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/04/06", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive,Budget Failure", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS23", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive,Budget Failure"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s been the superintendent of Oakdale Schools for 35-years and tells News 9 this isn\u2019t the worst budget crisis he\u2019s seen.\nThe state had similar budget problems in the 80s and Lanier says, unfortunately, lawmakers didn\u2019t seem to learn from their mistakes.\nBut Lanier says that number is deceptive because, in most schools, 80-to-85 percent of the budget is for salaries.\nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives last week said he won\u2019t accept anything more than 5-percent cuts to common education.\n\u201cMaybe a little bit more cooperation and a little less putting up fences would help,\u201d Lanier said."}
