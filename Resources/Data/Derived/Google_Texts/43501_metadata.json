In the end, the 11-hour hearing may have hurt the select committee\u2019s credibility more than Clinton\u2019s White House bid and yielded nothing new about the deadly incident itself, as admitted by the panel\u2019s chair.\n\nRelated: An Unflappable Hillary Clinton Frustrates the Benghazi Committee\n\n\u201cWell, when you say new today, we knew some of that already, about the emails. In terms of her testimony?\u201d Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) asked reporters Thursday night after the marathon session. \u201cI don\u2019t know that she testified that much differently today than she has the previous times she\u2019s testified.\"\n\nYet the 17-month-old inquiry, which 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Democrats say has cost $4.8 million and counting, promises to go on, as Gowdy stated the select committee has a \u201ccouple dozen\u201d witnesses left to interview about the siege that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.\n\n\u201cFrom my standpoint, we keep going on until we\u2019re able to interview all the witnesses we think have access to relevant information -- importantly, access to documents,\u201d according to Gowdy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not done. We still have a lot of work to do,\u201d Rep. Martha Roby (R-AL) told reporters on Friday, describing Clinton as \u201cjust a part of the investigation,\u201d though she was unaware who the committee might call next.\n\nRelated: Clinton\u2019s Benghazi Hearing Lays Bare the Politics at Play\n\nIn February, Gowdy sent Rep. Elijah Cummings (MD), the panel\u2019s top Democrat, a letter listing 20 witnesses he wanted to interview, including a number of high-profile current and former administration officials.\n\nRep. Susan Brooks (R-IN) said the select committee would announce the dates for its interviews with former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and former CIA chief David Petraeus \u201cvery soon,\u201d but guessed those sessions would take place behind closed doors, unlike Clinton\u2019s public hearing.\n\n\u201cThose will be in classified settings because those are about issues that we can\u2019t discuss in public,\u201d she said, adding portions on the interviews could be opened.\n\nBrooks said lawmakers would \u201clove\u201d to get all of the outstanding interviews done this year, but didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of them going into 2016.\n\nRelated: So, Who Is Sidney Blumenthal and What Does He Have to Do With Benghazi?\n\nEarlier this year a GOP spokesperson for the panel signaled its final report wouldn\u2019t be done until sometime in 2016. Gowdy himself has suggested the findings might not be definitive enough for some people.\n\nAs for the panel\u2019s five Democrats, they\u2019re in the dark.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s been building up to today. [The Republicans] haven\u2019t told us. My guess is they don\u2019t even know themselves where they want to go from here,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) said Thursday night in an interview with MSNBC.\n\n\u201cThey may lose interest now that the big day has come and gone,\u201d he added.\n\nAsked if public and media attention would decrease following Clinton\u2019s testimony, Cummings replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tell me,\u201d said Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA). \u201cIf you want to sum it up, it\u2019s what chairman Gowdy said at the end of it: what did you learn new today? Nothing.\u201d\n\nRelated: House Republicans Give Clinton Another Gift on Benghazi\n\nCummings and other panel Democrats met with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) behind closed doors for about an hour on Friday, possibly to determine if they should boycott all future proceedings.\n\nSuch a decision would have been another sign Democrats believe they have the political upper-hand when it comes to the Republican-led select committee. The panel\u2019s existence has come under intense scrutiny, following remarks by GOP lawmakers and a Republican ex-staffer that it was formed to damage Clinton\u2019s poll numbers.\n\nInstead, Democrats issued a statement again calling on outgoing House Speaker John Boehner to dissolve the select committee, a non-starter with the Ohio Republican.\n\n\u201cIf the Speaker rejects our request, Democrats will continue to participate at this point in order to make sure the facts are known and the conspiracy theories are debunked,\u201d they said.\n\nIn the meantime, according to Roby, Republicans plan to go over the transcript of Clinton\u2019s testimony \u201cwith a fine-toothed comb.\u201d\n\nFor Cummings, who acted Clinton\u2019s biggest defender during Thursday\u2019s hearing, talk of future steps can wait a little while longer. \u201cI\u2019m thoroughly exhausted from Benghazi. Thoroughly. And I want to spend some time with my wife,\u201d he told reporters on Friday.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Even though lawmakers serving on the House Select Committee on Benghazi have now interviewed their star witness in Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, the investigation is slated to continue, probably well into the 2016 presidential calendar.", "title": "With Clinton in the Rearview, What Now for the Benghazi Committee?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/25/Clinton-Rearview-What-Now-Benghazi-Committee", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/clinton-benghazi_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/25/Clinton-Rearview-What-Now-Benghazi-Committee", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/clinton-benghazi_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Even though lawmakers serving on the House Select Committee on Benghazi have now interviewed their star witness in Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, the investigation is slated to continue, probably well into the 2016 presidential calendar.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Even though lawmakers serving on the House Select Committee on Benghazi have now interviewed their star witness in Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, the investigation is slated to continue, probably well into the 2016 presidential calendar.\nRelated: An Unflappable Hillary Clinton Frustrates the Benghazi Committee\u201cWell, when you say new today, we knew some of that already, about the emails.\nSuch a decision would have been another sign Democrats believe they have the political upper-hand when it comes to the Republican-led select committee.\nInstead, Democrats issued a statement again calling on outgoing House Speaker John Boehner to dissolve the select committee, a non-starter with the Ohio Republican.\ndelivered a steely performance before the panel tasked with examining the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya."}
