Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) speaks during a campaign event on Monday in San Diego. (Sandy Huffaker/Associated Press)\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) is bracing for a big Donald Trump win in New York, which will inflate Trump\u2019s ego and delegate total. The time spent in New York has not been wasted, however. Cruz has been using national media that he hopes will help him up and down the East Coast with primaries over the next 11 days.\n\nIn a single week, he has appeared at MSNBC\u2019s town hall hosted by Chuck Todd in Buffalo and has done at least two New York-based shows, CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show. (You cannot say NBC and affiliated cable networks have not given him access.) He might have been more visible this week on national TV than Trump. (They each also did a town hall with their respective families.) It was interesting to see Cruz\u2019s maturation from anti-mainstream-media combatant to adept mainstream-media navigator.\n\nIn all three settings, which were much more intimate than a debate stage, he was conversational and at times witty. Appearing with and talking about his family is an unalloyed positive for his campaign. And, especially on \u201cSquawk Box\u201d it was interesting to see a glimpse of a knowledge base larger than he demonstrates in big campaign rallies with simplistic, crowd-pleasing statements. He can opine with confidence on Fed policy, asset bubbles and the regulatory state.\n\nCruz\u2019s campaign remains, like those of all candidates, a work in progress. Not surprising for a Senate rebel and for a candidate not in control of the White House, he wants to undo many things \u2014 \u201camnesty\u201d executive orders, the Iran deal, Obamacare and federal regulations. That is music to the ears of Republicans, including those who have figured out Trump is no conservative. With a strong libertarian streak, Cruz may think pruning or ripping President Obama\u2019s accomplishments is sufficient. It is not.\n\nAside from a negative agenda (lots of words like \u201crepeal,\u201d \u201cend,\u201d \u201cabolish\u201d), the most positive action item is Cruz\u2019s rather complicated tax proposal (part flat tax, part value-added tax, which he does not want to call a VAT). It leaves him vulnerable to the argument that if he gets to the general election, he is going to \u201ctake away\u201d stuff from voters. It also is telling people rattled by the recession, pinched by stagnant wages and burdened with rising health-care and college tuition costs that he is not going to do all that much for them. While he talks a lot about working people, he is short on offering things working people would like.\n\nThis is certainly fixable, although the temptation is to simply play the delegate collection game and demonstrate how unfit Trump is. What Cruz may not realize is that advancing some positive proposals will blunt the appeal of Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is running as a pragmatic problem-solver, someone who attends to people\u2019s needs. Cruz does not need to become a big spender or a squishy moderate to make this pivot. He just needs to say what comes after he does away with the Obama-era debris.\n\nFor starters, Cruz needs a concrete, more specific health-care plan that replaces Obamacare and addresses the affordability side of the equation. He will need to explain how the average person who may have been helped by Obamacare or who has health care from his employer is going to be better off with a Cruz health-care reform package. He would be smart to recommend how he is going to reform Medicaid, which is rife with fraud and offers poorer Americans a second-class health-care system. (For example, many better doctors and specialists do not accept Medicaid patients.) He should steal a page from Jeb Bush\u2019s policy manual and come out with a full-blown Department of Veterans Affairs reform plan.\n\nCruz rarely talks about education, except in the case of Common Core, which he promises to abolish although recent legislation essentially bans the federal government from imposing it or using it as a requirement for federal funding. If he wants to trim back or eliminate the Education Department, he would be smart to sketch out a school-choice plan, one that allows students to go to any school.\n\nIf Cruz thinks the current college tuition aid program is a mess, merely subsidizing overpriced schools, he should tell us whether, for example, he would favor adopting Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s plan to make aid available for two-year junior college and technical certification.\n\nOn national security, Cruz vows to get rid of the Iran deal as well as defeat the Islamic State and then go home. But how exactly does this work?\n\nOn Iran, he would do well to explain how he will coordinate with allies to reimpose the most effective sanctions. If Iran is able to perpetually grab better terms (e.g. access to U.S. dollars), why can\u2019t we do the same? Cruz will also need a realistic, robust plan for rebuilding alliances to check Iran\u2019s aggression in the region. Is he really content to leave Iran ally and war criminal Bashar al-Assad in power in Syria? (If he does, he should explain how he is going to get Sunni fighters to defeat the Islamic State if their \u201creward\u201d is more oppression by the Alawite leader.)\n\nAlthough he is no longer dogmatically insisting that we can defeat the Islamic State from the air or merely by arming the Kurds, he should explain how he intends to defeat the Islamic State now that it has spread throughout the region and to North Africa. And if we immediately go home after a military victory, what is to prevent, just as Obama\u2019s 2011 pullout from Iraq did and the Libya experience showed, failed states once again becoming a magnet for Islamist terrorists?\n\nIf Cruz does not like the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal and knows Trump\u2019s tariff plans are dangerous, he should sketch out how he plans to open up foreign markets, protect U.S. intellectual property overseas and prevent China, for example, from monopolizing foreign markets.\n\nTo be fair, Cruz is busy trying to survive a primary and has been expert at the nuts and bolts of political organization. But the process of rallying the party requires an agenda for the party to rally to. It is not his personality that will win over GOP skeptics, but rather, a workable, positive conservative agenda. He seems passionate about the Constitution, but he is not running for the federal court. He needs, along with his improved tone and more conciliatory outlook, a presidential-size agenda.
