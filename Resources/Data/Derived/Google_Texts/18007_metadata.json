Now pay up.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott boasts that \u201cTexas rightfully led the nation in cutting taxes.\u201d Too bad local governments and schools didn\u2019t get the memo.\n\nAcross the Lone Star State, property taxes are climbing at a record-breaking pace. With the Jan. 31 payment deadline approaching, Bexar County and the city of San Antonio offer five reasons why:\n\nNUMBERS RACKET: Market experts agree that the real-estate market is soft. But the Bexar County Appraiser is positively bullish, pushing assessed values up 10.7 percent \u2013 far surpassing the average 4.4 percent increase of the previous year.\n\nThe double-digit hike \u2014 totally disconnected from the market \u2014 allows San Antonio to brag that it isn\u2019t raising the tax rate. No need. Arbitrarily higher valuations enable the city, county and schools to collect millions more tax dollars from over-assessed taxpayers. Think homeowners can flip their houses for a 10.7 percent gain in one year? In a tanking oil economy? In one of the poorest big cities in Texas? Think again.\n\nThe state\u2019s newly expanded homestead exemption is another joke. Unlike substantial residential tax discounts in Florida (which also has no state income tax), the Texas program affords about as much protection as a leaky canvas tent.\n\nIN A BUBBLE: Floating along in their inflated real-estate bubble, local governments spend accordingly. San Antonio magnanimously raised its own minimum wage to $13 an hour (up from $11.47) and added 172 positions to push the city\u2019s payroll to 11,922 employees. Meantime, San Antonio remains unable to fully staff its police force, which enjoys the second-highest compensation package in the state.\n\nAre taxpayers getting what they pay for? A call to the city about a property-tax question elicited this response: \u201cI don\u2019t know nothing about that.\u201d\n\nBIGGER, NOT BETTER: City planners figure annexation is a moneymaker. City politicians are always eager to grow their sphere of influence. If aggressive expansion were such a good deal, San Antonio and its residents would be rich. They\u2019re not.\n\nExtending the city\u2019s tax base means taking on additional long-term liabilities \u2014 more roads, sewers and infrastructure requiring evermore taxes to repair and maintain. Captured property owners (who have no say in the annexation decision) get hit with higher taxes to service $17 billion in municipal debt.\n\nAmid the sprawling cities, downtowns hollow out. City Halls respond by ginning up more \u201caffordable housing\u201d subsidies for the inner core \u2013 another losing proposition that favors crony developers and pushes higher taxes onto everyone else.\n\nPROPOSED: Dump property tax for sales tax\n\nHOBBY HORSES: Undaunted by steep logistical hurdles and pie-in-the-sky costs, San Antonio and Austin continue to throw money at the sputtering Lone Star Rail venture. A vision of urban planners and liberal elites everywhere, the commuter railroad got $449,500 in \u201cstaffing and consulting services,\u201d courtesy of San Antonio taxpayers who have never been asked their opinion about the project.\n\nIn the spirit of the upcoming Martin Luther King Day holiday, San Antonio\u2019s council earmarked $200,000 for festivities on the Eastside. City Hall dispensed $100,000 to two organizers bickering over turf. Can\u2019t we all just get along and save some money?\n\nDEMOCRAT MACHINES: It\u2019s not only San Antonio\u2019s party. Five other large Texas cities \u2013 Houston, Dallas, Corpus Christi, El Paso and Fort Worth \u2013 levy even higher property tax rates. The common denominator: All six are run by Democrats. Likewise, urban school districts \u2013 which consume roughly half of local tax collections \u2014 are tools of teacher unions, chief funders of the Democratic Party.\n\nCities and schools complain that the GOP-controlled state Legislature has them on a starvation diet. To which former U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, retorts: \u201cOur cities are turning Texas into California.\u201d\n\nWith heavier tax bills to prove it, beleaguered Texans may ultimately opt for a California import: a Proposition 13-style property-tax rebellion\n\nKenric Ward reports for the Texas Bureau of Watchdog.org.
