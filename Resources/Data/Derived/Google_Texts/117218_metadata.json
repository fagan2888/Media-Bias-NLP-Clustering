A wide array of factors expected to influence the growth of breast pumps market in the US include implementation of Affordable Care Act (ACA) for breastfeeding supplies providing favorable reimbursement options, high proportion of working women and growing awareness about breast pumps. Moreover, government is also organizing various initiatives to increase the awareness level of citizens about the benefits of breast milk, which is expected to have a positive impact on the country's breast pumps market over the next five years.\n\nIn 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most babies in the US initiated their feed with breastfeeding, but within first week, half of them were given formula. Moreover, by nine months, only 31% of the babies received feed through breast milk, as reported by the CDC. Due to alarming rates of low breastfeeding in the country and benefits of breast milk over formula milk, Affordable Care Act, which provides the freedom to women to purchase breast pumps at less price or free of cost, was implemented. However, the breast pumps market in the US is facing various challenges such as declining fertility rate, side effects associated with breast pumps and easy availability of substitutes.\n\nUnited States breast pumps market has been segmented into two broader categories, namely, manual breast pumps and electric breast pumps. Out of these categories, electric breast pumps dominated the overall breast pumps market in the US. The segment is anticipated to continue its dominance through 2021 on account of better efficiency to pump more amount of milk in less duration of time, improving economic stability of consumers to purchase expensive electric breast pumps, and availability of the option to pump milk from both the breasts at the same time through double electric breast pumps. In terms of end use, personal-use breast pumps were chosen by maximum consumers in the US in 2015, owing to availability of battery-operated breast pumps at affordable prices for personal use, which provides the freedom of portability and infection-free pumping.\n\n\"According to the CDC, low rates of breastfeeding in the US adds to USD2.2 billion a year to direct medical costs, as formula feeding and discontinuation of breastfeeding increases risk of asthma, obesity, infection, and diabetes in children. As a result, the US Government initiated a campaign named as 'Healthy People 2020', to improve health of all Americans. The campaign's maternal, infant and child objectives focus on improving maternal care and breastfeeding. Backed by all these factors, United States breast pumps market is expected to continue exhibiting promising growth over the next five years.\" said Mr. Karan Chechi, Research Director with Pharmaion Consultants, a research based global management consulting firm focused on pharma and healthcare industry.\n\n\"United States Breast Pumps Market Opportunities, 2011 - 2021\" has analyzed the potential of breast pumps market in the United States and provides statistics and information on market sizes, shares and trends.
