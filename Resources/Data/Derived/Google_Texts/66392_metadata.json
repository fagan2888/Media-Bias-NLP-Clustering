That Reaganite message is fitting because he worked for the Gipper during Reagan\u2019s first term in the White House.\n\nThe Kudlow Creed, as he called it during his 11-year tenure hosting his TV show at CNBC, is: Free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity.\n\nIf any state could use a dose of free market capitalism, it\u2019s Connecticut, which has been run into the ground by three decades of tax-and-spend progressivism. The liberals in Hartford raised taxes two years ago \u2014 the biggest hike in state history \u2014 and the budget is still drenched in red ink.\n\nThis is a deep-blue Democratic state, but polls show Nutmeg voters care most about jobs and taxes. Who better to be an apostle for lower taxes and more jobs than Kudlow?\n\nThe entrenched Democrat is Richard Blumenthal, but what a dreadful voting record he has. Blumenthal has voted straight left on nearly every issue of the day \u2014 aye on ObamaCare, aye on the near-trillion Obama stimulus, aye on investment tax hikes, and so on.\n\nHe also supported the Iran deal, which may be what shoves Kudlow into the race. \u201cI\u2019m an economist, first,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this Iran deal is one of the greatest threats in modern times to America\u2019s security. Anyone who supported it doesn\u2019t belong in Congress.\u201d We second the motion.\n\nVoters may well be drawn to Kudlow\u2019s personal struggles as he recovered from an addiction to drugs. He talks openly and heartwarmingly about his journey away from a destructive habit that left him in a pit of despair to a new life and renewed faith in God. He now leads AA meetings and helps others battle with their addictions. America loves the story of redemption.\n\nIt would be hard to think of anyone more suited for public service than Kudlow. He is the nation\u2019s leading voice for lower taxes, sound money, less regulation and faster growth with a rising tide that lifts all boats.\n\nHe\u2019s writing a book now about John F. Kennedy and the tax cuts that launched the prosperity of the 1960s. \u201cKennedy was the precursor to Reagan,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Democrats have abandoned JFK\u2019s growth message.\u201d He\u2019s right, but then so have many austerity-minded Republicans.\n\nIf Kudlow were to win in Connecticut, the party would have an unfailing voice for prosperity policies in Washington \u2014 a voice that\u2019s been missing since the death of Jack Kemp.
