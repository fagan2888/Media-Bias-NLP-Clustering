The Act would protect consumers from the increased costs in accessing and using the Internet by permanently extending the moratorium on Internet access taxes, and would prevent multiple and discriminatory taxation of Internet sales.\n\nThe legislation already boasts deep bipartisan support with 138 Republican and 76 Democrat co-sponsors. That\u2019s 214 members of the House supporting it, and rumors of more to join soon would bring the total to more than 50 percent. The Senate version of the bill has 50 co-sponsors. So, there is already enough support for a permanent moratorium that doesn\u2019t add extraneous elements that could cause the moratorium to fail.\n\nThe legislation also enjoys broad support of thought leaders and citizens, as was made clear in an April letter to Congress. But time to pass the measure is of the essence since the moratorium will expire on November 1 of this year. If allowed to expire, states would begin to collect taxes on Internet access, or apply other discriminatory taxes that may already be in place but which have been held at bay during the moratorium.\n\nScott Mackey, former chief economist for the National Conference of State Legislatures and currently a consultant to the wireless industry, has estimated that an average household\u2019s taxes would increase by $50 to $75 a year if states decide to apply their sales or telecommunications taxes to Internet access. While that doesn\u2019t seem like much, keep in mind that that\u2019s about what a low-income family spends in a year on subsidized school lunches. Those who qualify for such programs are exactly those who will be most negatively affected by a lapsed moratorium.\n\nBusinesses also lose money when Congress doesn\u2019t send a clear message. If Congress dallies\u2014and history has proven that Congress rarely acts in time\u2014telecommunications providers would need to prepare to collect the new taxes. That effort would be a waste of time and resources if Congress were to ride to the rescue at the last minute\u2014a result of the cavalier attitude by government. Less economic growth and fewer jobs are the result.\n\nHopefully, the next step on the right path will be taken today with the House Judiciary Committee deciding that the moratorium must continue and refraining from introducing other issues designed to intentionally impede its ultimate passage in the House.\n\nHopefully, the next step on the right path will be taken today with the House Judiciary Committee deciding that the moratorium must continue and refraining from introducing other issues which will end its progress in the House.\n\n[Originally published by the Institute for Policy Innovation]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/06/time-to-move-a-clean-permanent-internet-tax-moratorium/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/0000000000.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Time to Move a Clean, Permanent Internet Tax Moratorium"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "This morning the House Judiciary Committee will undertake the markup of the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act.\nThe Act would protect consumers from the increased costs in accessing and using the Internet by permanently extending the moratorium on Internet access taxes, and would prevent multiple and discriminatory taxation of Internet sales.\nSo, there is already enough support for a permanent moratorium that doesn\u2019t add extraneous elements that could cause the moratorium to fail.\nBusinesses also lose money when Congress doesn\u2019t send a clear message.\nIf allowed to expire, states would begin to collect taxes on Internet access, or apply other discriminatory taxes that may already be in place but which have been held at bay during the moratorium."}
