She says she owes her life to the expanded coverage.Shipra Shukla swings herself upright onto the trapeze at the Circus Center in San Francisco. It's a move known as the \"pike to seat.\"Back in 2014, Shukla feared she had suffered a trapeze-related injury.\"I was just sitting around one day. Felt one shoulder, felt the other and I'm like one shoulder feels a little different,\" she said.She went to see the doctor, expecting to be diagnosed with a shoulder strain. After weeks of testing, her doctor told her she had cancer.\"It was hard for me to believe because I just felt like I feel, so healthy, how could this be possible?\" Shulka recalled.If it had been a year earlier, Shukla said she wouldn't have seen a doctor because she couldn't afford it.That changed when she was enrolled in Medi-Cal, under expanded coverage of the Affordable Care Act.She said that doctor's visit saved her life.Her doctor at UCSF agrees. \"She had no symptoms and was already at a stage 3. If she had waited until the time she had symptoms, she could have been as far along as a stage 4,\" Dr. Jo Marie Munnich said.Preliminary numbers released by the IRS found that last tax season, 7.5 million taxpayers paid a penalty because they did not have health insurance.The total penalty paid was $1.5 billion.\"I think that they also don't understand just exactly how much coverage each of those premiums gets them,\" Munnich said.The minimum penalty paid this past tax season was $325 for adults and $162.50 for children under 18. That increases to $695 and $347.50 this tax year.\"When I went in to see the oncologist, I asked him what would happen if I did nothing. They said you would probably die,\" Shulka said.Today, Shukla's cancer is in remission after completing her treatment 13 months ago.She said she owes it all to having a good health plan.\"I was able to go to the best doctors and get really like top notch coverage, I felt,\" she said.Shukla is currently employed and now has health coverage through her employer-sponsored plan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Millions of Americans pay a penalty because they don&#39;t have health insurance.
