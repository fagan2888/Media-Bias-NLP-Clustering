District 3 is made up of most of Las Vegas\u2019 southern and western suburbs, including Summerlin, Henderson and Boulder City. It stretches south to Nevada\u2019s border with California and Arizona. Voter registration is almost evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, making it one of the last remaining swing districts represented by the 435-member U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nVoters in suburban Las Vegas may not realize it, but they make up one of most competitive congressional districts in the country. And this fall, they will decide if they want to keep their Republican representative in Congress or elect someone else.\n\nRep. Joe Heck, vying for his third term, faces Democrat Erin Bilbray and three third-party candidates in Nevada\u2019s 3rd Congressional District. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the race.\n\nWhy is the district so competitive?\n\nVoter registration is just about even among Democrats and Republicans. State officials redrew the district in 2011, and even before then, it bounced between Republican and Democratic representation in Congress.\n\nThe district is a notable exception to the national trend, where congressional districts are becoming less and less competitive every time states redraw their Congressional district boundaries.\n\nSince coming to office in 2011, Heck has had to run a fierce campaign every two years as Democrats try their best to unseat him.\n\nWhat\u2019s been the biggest news of the race?\n\nHeck has had to defend his positions on immigration, and Bilbray has had trouble with her campaign.\n\nEven though Heck has called for immigration reform and drafted a bill to provide a path to citizenship for some young immigrants, Democrats are trying to tie him to House Republican leaders who won\u2019t bring up reform bills for a vote.\n\nAs for Bilbray, she started her campaign in July 2013 with endorsements from Nevada and Washington political leaders, and Vice President Joe Biden came to Las Vegas to support her. But her campaign sputtered, and party leaders now consider her a long shot to beat Heck. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who runs Nevada\u2019s Democratic machine, said in August: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been a great campaign.\u201d National nonpartisan political analysts changed the district\u2019s rating from competitive to leaning Republican.\n\nBilbray\u2019s team says she is focused on local support and not concerned with Washington pundits.\n\nWho else is running?\n\nThe third-party candidates are Independent David Goossen of Boulder City, Libertarian Randy Kimmick of Henderson and Steven St. John of Henderson running under \u201cother.\u201d None has collected the support or money needed to seriously challenge Heck.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Erin Bilbray is challenging Rep.
