About another 45,240 people enrolled through their job.\n\nTalk of OMNIA has dominated the health care industry since Horizon announced the discount line of plans in September, and much of that has been criticism leveled by hospital excluded by the preferred \"tier 1\" network, which offers consumers the greatest amount of savings.\n\nEighteen hospitals are suing Horizon for breach of contract and defamation for implying their facilities are second-rate.\n\nWhy Horizon has sued these 2 hospitals\n\nMany of these Tier 2 facilities are independent, relatively small and serve a large number of Medicaid or uninsured patients, and say the loss of commercially insured people will force them to merge or close.\n\nThe enrollment figures come close to the 256,000 members Horizon executives predicted, and are a good indication the company is meeting a need for quality care that costs less, said Robert A. Marino, Horizon's chairman and CEO.\n\n\"Affordability has been a barrier for some uninsured individuals and too often lower-priced policies required consumers to trade cost for quality,\" Marino said. \"OMNIA premiums, on average, cost 15 percent less than our non-tiered plans and unlike high-deductible policies, don't require members to incur large out-of-pocket expenses before the insurer pays claims.\"\n\n\"OMNIA is focused on keeping people healthy, not just treating them when they become sick,\" Marino's statement said.\n\nSteven M. Goldman, attorney for 17 Tier 2 hospitals suing OMNIA and a former Banking and Insurance commissioner, said the people who signed up were not given the full story on OMNIA.\n\n\"Since Horizon hasn't disclosed any information about the criteria it used in selecting its OMNIA providers, the only information consumers had available in making their decision was price,\" Goldman said in a statement. \"This is particularly true of the Affordable Care Act enrollees.\"\n\n\"Many of these people may not even have access to a Tier 1 provider in their community or be aware that their trusted hospital has been designated Tier 2, while their long-time doctor has been designated Tier 1, or vice versa,\" Goldman added. \"Horizon has created this confusion in the marketplace by refusing to provide answers of any kind about the plan's selection criteria.\"\n\nOMNIA members can be found in all of New Jersey's 21 counties, with the greatest concentration in the most populated counties: Bergen (24,248), Middlesex (19,377) and Essex (14,813), according to Horizon.\n\nHealth policy experts said the figures show a promising future for OMNIA.\n\nThe impact on tier 2 hospitals is unlikely to be felt right away, said Joel Cantor, director of the Rutgers Center for State Health Policy.\n\nWhile Horizon appears to have met their enrollment target, at this level I doubt there will be very substantial impacts on tier two hospitals,\" Cantor said. \"Their data also show that enrollment is spread over all NJ counties, which will mitigate the impact on any single hospital.\"\n\n\"That said, these results are just for the first enrollment period. In the future, enrollment - and impacts on hospitals - could grow,\" Cantor added.\n\nHorizon highlighted the racial and ethnic makeup of the 41,258 previously uninsured OMNIA policy holders, noting 15 percent are Latino, and 13 percent are black and 13 percent are Asian. Public sign-up events were held with organizations such as the Hispanic Statewide Chamber of Commerce, Horizon added.\n\nMore than three-quarters of OMNIA enrollees selected a mid-price \"silver\" or higher metallic level plan, based on the Affordable Care Act's four tiers of coverage corresponding to size of deductible and premiums. OMNIA's silver plans feature no deductible, no coinsurance, and co-pays of $50 or less when using a Tier 1 provider, according to Horizon.\n\nLinda Schwimmer, president and CEO for the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute, said OMNIA's cost savings would be enhanced if enrollees met the income requirements that qualify them for federal subsidies to help pay their premiums.\n\n\"That means that even if they go to a Tier 2 provider, they are receiving significant federal support to pay for it. I think that is why both the OMNIA plan and the silver level were so popular,\" Schwimmer said.\n\nA 35-year-old man who buys a silver OMNIA plan on the health exchange pays $360.27 a month, 15 percent less than the Horizon Advantage plan which would cost him $424.94, Horizon spokesman Tom Vincz said. A couple, both 35 years old with two children under 21 would pay $1,094.98 under OMNIA, 15 percent less than the Advantage premium of $1,291.51.\n\n\"Overall, despite the valid concerns about transparency, consumer confusion, and updating the network adequacy rules, I think it is fantastic that so many previously uninsured people were able to afford a comprehensive insurance plan,\" she added.\n\nUpdate: This story has changed to reflect a slightly higher number of individuals who bought OMNIA policies, according to updated Horizon figures. The story also includes a breakdown of how many of the individual policy holders bought OMNIA on the health exchange versus how many purchased directly from Horizon.\n\nSusan K.
