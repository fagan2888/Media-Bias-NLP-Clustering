Not well, as critics arose across the partisan spectrum. \u201cIt takes an army to defeat an army,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein said yesterday in regard to the threat ISIS now poses to the region \u2014 and the US:\n\nSenate Intelligence Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein warned Friday of the risk that the insurgent group ISIL could be preparing fighters to attack American and European targets. \u201cIt has become clear that ISIL is recruiting fighters in Western countries, training them to fight its battles in the Middle East and possibly returning them to European and American cities to attack us in our backyard,\u201d the California Democrat said in a statement backing military action authorized by President Barack Obama. \u201cWe simply cannot allow this to happen.\u201d Feinstein called for a broader military campaign against ISIL, not just the targeted missions authorized by the president. \u201cIt takes an army to defeat an army, and I believe that we either confront ISIL now or we will be forced to deal with an even stronger enemy in the future. Inaction is no longer an option. I support actions by the administration to coordinate efforts with Iraq and other allies to use our military strength and targeting expertise to the fullest extent possible,\u201d Feinstein said.\n\nThat\u2019s a sharp rebuke to Obama, who has tried to walk a tightrope between his claims of victory in Iraq and the acute need to stop the genocide of Yazidis. Obama spoke earlier today before flying off to his vacation on Marine One reinforcing his remarks on Thursday, promising nothing new. \u201cOnce again, America is proud to work\u201d with our allies, Obama insisted, but announced no new efforts on their part other than diplomatic expressions of support. The only call Obama made was for Iraqis to unite, claiming again that \u201conly Iraqis\u201d can secure Iraq. Feinstein very obviously does not want to sit idly by while waiting for Iraqis to wipe out ISIS (or ISIL) in order to remove the threat to American national security.\n\nNeither does Sen. Marco Rubio, her colleague across the aisle:\n\nBut America\u2019s security interests extend well beyond the fate of Iraq\u2019s religious minorities. Because ISIS, with thousands of foreign fighters, many of them from the West, will not rest once it has taken Erbil or Baghdad. Its expansionist ideology will lead it to attack U.S. allies in the region and eventually Europe and the United States. We have seen time and again in recent decades that terrorist groups, once established, use safe havens to launch attacks on the United States and our interests. We ignore this history at our own peril. Instead of confronting this challenge head on, President Obama has until now avoided taking decisive action. He has let the civil war in Syria simmer for years, creating the space for this jihadist threat to grow and letting instability spread to Syria\u2019s neighbors. Even after ISIS captured Iraq\u2019s second largest city, Mosul, in June, the President was hesitant in his response, sending several hundred military advisors but not confronting ISIS directly even as it made military gains. Now, we are rightfully providing food and water to people who face slaughter from extremists who have pledged to kill them. \u2026 ISIS\u2019s continued rise is not just a problem for Iraq or its neighbors. If we do not continue to take decisive action against ISIS now, it will be not just Iraqis or Syrians who continue to suffer, it will likely be Americans, as a result of a terrorist attack on the U.S. homeland or on our personnel overseas. America was faced with the same choice President Clinton faced in the 1990s during the emergence of al Qaeda: take action now, or we will be forced to take action in the future. It is time to begin reversing this unprecedented tide of jihadist victories. America\u2019s security and the safety of the American people are at stake.\n\nFor that matter, so does the Washington Post editorial board. Their editorial scolds Obama for clinging to his \u201cminimalist and unrealistic\u201d policies and start taking the threat seriously:\n\nU.S. officials say that Mr. Obama has refrained from a broader campaign because he believes the Islamic State is \u201can Iraqi responsibility,\u201d as Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel put it. The administration is pushing Iraq\u2019s political factions, sharply divided along sectarian lines, to join in forming a new government; once such a government is formed, Mr. Obama said, \u201cthe United States will work with it and other countries in the region to provide increased support.\u201d The White House is hopeful that a new prime minister could be nominated this weekend. Even if that occurs, it will probably take Iraqis many more weeks to agree on a common political program, if they are able to do so at all. Kurds and Sunnis are demanding a major decentralization of power, and one of the \u201cother countries\u201d that the United States must balance is Iran, which seeks to perpetuate Shiite dominance in Baghdad. Meanwhile, as senior Kurdish leaders told the administration in a visit to Washington last month, Iraqi army and Kurdish forces probably cannot defeat the Islamic State on their own. It\u2019s past time for Mr. Obama to set aside a policy that is both minimalist and unrealistic. The United States should offer sustained military support to friendly forces that fight the Islamic State, beginning with the Kurds and including moderate Syrian rebels and Iraqi Sunni tribesmen. It should seek to erode the Islamic State\u2019s military power as much as possible with airstrikes. It should not press for a new Iraqi government unless Shiite leaders and their Iranian sponsors agree to a fundamental restructuring of power. And it should forge a political and diplomatic strategy that encompasses both Iraq and Syria and their interrelated conflicts. The primary aim should not be to minimize U.S. involvement \u2014 as Mr. Obama would have it \u2014 but to defeat the forces that are destroying the region.\n\nObama spent a lot of time talking about the \u201cweaknesses\u201d of the Iraqi government, but kept insisting that if only Baghdad would reach out to the Sunnis and Kurds, the problems would be solved. The Shi\u2019ites, though, have been facing this existential threat for months and still aren\u2019t cooperating, because they don\u2019t want to give up power and think Iran will bail them out.\n\nObama also suggested that Iraq\u2019s Sunni neighbors would \u201cjoin the fight\u201d against ISIS, but \u2026 why would they do that? The Saudis in particular have been attempting to push Bashar Assad out of Syria, which led to the vacuum that allowed ISIS to metastasize. Does Obama really think that the Saudis will join a military campaign against ISIS that will benefit Assad, Maliki, and Iran in the short run? Does he think the Jordanians will go to war against ISIS in western Iraq? Why would either of these nations do so when the US insists it will sit it out? The only neighboring nation that would launch military strikes against ISIS might be Israel, which this administration has spent the last several weeks attempting to hamstring while Hamas lobs missiles at civilian population centers.\n\nNo one will march into western Iraq to fight ISIS without the US leading the way \u2026 which means no one will be fighting ISIS other than the collapsing Iraqi forces for the foreseeable future, and the Kurds who are bravely attempting to protect their homeland from the barbarian horde that threatens to overrun them.\n\nIn today\u2019s final question, Obama got challenged on whether he should have left troops in Iraq after all. Obama proceeded to offer a cynical and disingenuous exercise in buck-passing, claiming that it was all Iraq\u2019s fault that American troops were not left in the country. Let\u2019s recall that Obama bragged about bringing all the troops home in the 2012 election, and that it was well known that the US had a clear opening for a follow-on force. Instead, Obama and Joe Biden blew off the negotiations, refusing to even come to the phone in an attempt to salvage them. He got the short-term boost to his approval ratings that he sought at the time, and now when his approval levels are cratering, Obama claims he was helpless to do anything in the face of Iraqi intransigence. Not only will few buy that explanation, those who do will have to explain how being impotent with Maliki makes Obama a foreign-policy genius.\n\nObama today: \"As if this was my decision.\" Obama in Oct 2011: pic.twitter.com/fnTQSKxt7N A promise he kept, and he's running from it? #OwnIt \u2014 Ron Fournier (@ron_fournier) August 9, 2014\n\nWell, it\u2019s never his fault, right?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Marco Rubio agrees \u2014 and so does the WaPo editorial board.", "title": "Feinstein: We\u2019re going to need more than a few airstrikes on ISIS", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/08/09/feinstein-were-going-to-need-more-than-a-few-airstrikes-on-isis/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Barack Obama, Dianne Feinstein, genocide, ISIS, Marco Rubio, WaPo,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-09T15:31:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-09T17:02:06+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c57\"", "article_summary": "Its expansionist ideology will lead it to attack U.S. allies in the region and eventually Europe and the United States.\nIt should seek to erode the Islamic State\u2019s military power as much as possible with airstrikes.\nInstead of confronting this challenge head on, President Obama has until now avoided taking decisive action.\nWe have seen time and again in recent decades that terrorist groups, once established, use safe havens to launch attacks on the United States and our interests.\nObama also suggested that Iraq\u2019s Sunni neighbors would \u201cjoin the fight\u201d against ISIS, but \u2026 why would they do that?"}
