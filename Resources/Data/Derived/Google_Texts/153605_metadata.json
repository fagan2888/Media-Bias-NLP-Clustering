The clip, created by independent filmmaker Rejina Sincic, shows a boy sneaking into his mother\u2019s room (while she sits reads demurely in the living room) only to steal the handgun that is hidden in one of her dresser drawers.\n\nThe boy then tosses the gun into his backpack and flops back on his bed as though heavily burdened. And, considering he just put a handgun into his backpack without making sure that there was no bullet in the chamber that the safety was on, he should be feeling pretty worried right now.\n\nThe next day after class, he walks up to his teacher and drops the weapon onto her desk:\n\n\u201cCan you take this away? I don\u2019t feel safe with a gun in my house.\u201d\n\nJust watch:\n\nThis ad just has so much wrong with it, I don\u2019t even know where to begin:\n\nFirst of all, why would the boy be scared of his mother\u2019s handgun? He should know that the weapon has the potential to save his and his mother\u2019s life.\n\nSecondly, if a child is afraid of guns, the last thing he or she should be doing is bringing one to school. Apparently this thought never occurred to the San Francisco-based screenwriter.\n\nThirdly, why would the boy turn on his mother and bring the gun into a public authority figure rather than speaking to her about it? And what is a teacher supposed to do? Confiscate the weapon that the mother (perhaps a single mother as the father is never shown) owns by her Second Amendment right?\n\nClearly, someone did not think this one through.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new three minute ad called Stop Gun Violence is sending a very mixed message to childrennamely, if youre scared of guns bring them to school..05/26/2016 0:41:58AM EST.", "author": "Sarah Jean Seman", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "A new three minute ad called Stop Gun Violence is sending a very mixed message to childrennamely, if youre scared of guns bring them to school.", "title": "Sarah Jean Seman - \"Stop Gun Violence\" Sends Mixed Messages to Children", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/sarahjeanseman/2014/12/22/stop-gun-violence-ad-twists-n1934794", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/12/22/28.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "A new three minute ad called Stop Gun Violence is sending a very mixed message to childrennamely, if youre scared of guns bring them to school.", "title": "Sarah Jean Seman - \"Stop Gun Violence\" Sends Mixed Messages to Children", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/sarahjeanseman/2014/12/22/stop-gun-violence-ad-twists-n1934794", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/12/22/28.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "\"Stop Gun Violence\" Sends Mixed Messages to Children, Sarah Jean Seman, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7173\"", "article_summary": "A new three minute ad called \u201cStop Gun Violence\u201d is sending a very mixed message to children\u2014namely, if you\u2019re scared of guns bring them to school.\nThe boy then tosses the gun into his backpack and flops back on his bed as though heavily burdened.\nConfiscate the weapon that the mother (perhaps a single mother as the father is never shown) owns by her Second Amendment right?\nThirdly, why would the boy turn on his mother and bring the gun into a public authority figure rather than speaking to her about it?\nThe next day after class, he walks up to his teacher and drops the weapon onto her desk:\u201cCan you take this away?"}
