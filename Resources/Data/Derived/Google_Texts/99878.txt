Sen. Mike Lee has called on Americans to join him in the effort to abolish the federal Common Core education standards in a fundraising email for the conservative group FreedomWorks."As a U.S. Senator, I’ve seen the federal government make a mess of everything it touches," the Utah Republican wrote in the email sent out Monday morning."And if they're allowed to stay, Common Core standards will be the ObamaCare of education," he wrote. "Common Core is the DC takeover of our school system. It will dumb down standards and cheapen the education our children receive."All kids in America "deserve the best education in the world. The only way we can make that happen is to repeal Common Core across America," Lee wrote."When it comes to education, the future of our country is on the line," the senator said in the email. "The next generation of Americans doesn’t need to be force-fed big government propaganda in the classroom."They should be learning real American history, and why our sacred heritage makes this the greatest nation in the world," he wrote. "Common Core does away with that. That’s why it must be stopped."Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration on Wednesday, alleging that it is using grant money and regulations to manipulate states into adopting the federal education standards."Common Core is the latest effort by big government disciples to strip away state rights and put Washington, D.C., in control of everything," Jindal said in a statement.
