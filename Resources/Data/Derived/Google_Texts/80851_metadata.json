According to the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, the members first met in hiding to worship before building a brick church in 1856 along Nassau Street. In 1956, the church moved into the current location along Scotland Street.\n\nThe bell fell silent in the church because of structural issues in the 1950s.\n\nThrough the years, the church has seen prominent visitors such as the late the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks.\n\nColonial Williamsburg President Mitchell Reiss, U.S. Rep. Robert C. \u201cBobby\u201d Scott, D-Newport News, U.S. Ambassador Suzan Johnson Cook and the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. each took turns pulling on a rope in the church's foyer, tolling the bell for the crowd outside to hear.\n\n(By Heather Bridges)\n\nThe church has invited members of the public to come and ring the historic bell throughout February.\n\nCall for unity, equality\n\nAt the service Monday, politics were high on display, as Jackson urged congregants to continue the fight for equality and said a key part would be working to expand the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sometimes referred to as \u201cObamacare.\u201d He also called for greater efforts to reduce income inequality.\n\n\u201cThe reason we cannot catch up is because the disparity is so great,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cEffort and excellence means a lot. Inheritance and access means more. It's caused structural disadvantage.\u201d\n\nStill, Jackson lauded progress made by the civil rights generation, saying it had paved the road for the New South.\n\n\u201cYou'll know the truth, and it will set you free,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cYou've learned to live apart, now let's learn to live together.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's the question: How do we move from a racial battleground to an economic come-around, to a moral higher ground?\u201d Jackson later told reporters gathered after the ceremony.\n\nThe Rev. Reginald Davis, the church's pastor, called for national unity in the face of racial division.\n\nThe security posted outside of the congregation, with metal detectors for those wishing to enter, was a stark reminder of some of both the recent and historical violence targeting black churches, including the massacre at \u201cMother\u201d Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., last year where nine parishioners were slain by a gunman.\n\n\u201cIt's going to take all of us to make our nation a more perfect union,\u201d Davis said.\n\n\u201cBells were not only used to alert the people but to drive out evil spirits that were working to divide and destroy the people. So we come to ring the bell.\n\n\u201cWe come to ring the bell and drive out the spirits of division. Drive out the spirits of hatred. Drive out the spirit of evil. Drive out the spirit of injustice. Drive out the spirit of fear and those practices that are causing us to forget that we are one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\u201d\n\nThe congregation rose to its feet to applaud.\n\nMoving ceremony\n\nAmong those to ring the bell Monday were direct descendants of Thomas Jefferson \u2014 Prinny Anderson, David Works, Jeff Westerinen, Diana Redman and Shannon LaNier, as well as LaNier's daughters, Madison, 4, and McKenzie, 2.\n\nAfter the ceremony, First Baptist Church member Minnie Robinson paused on the front steps of the church.\n\n\u201cIt's beyond words,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can't believe it.\u201d\n\nAfter the bell's nearly 50-year silence, \u201cto ring it now, to hear it, was just a joy,\u201d Robinson said.\n\n\u201cThis is really something that will mean something to us for the rest of our lives,\u201d said Frank Brown IV, standing outside the church with Gregory Packer Jr. Both are seniors at the College of William and Mary.\n\n\u201cEmbracing this moment about our fellow ancestors and what they had to go through in order to pave the way for us is remarkable,\u201d said Brown, a member of William and Mary's African American Male Coalition.\n\n\u201cThe moment itself is historical,\u201d Brown said. \u201cJust ringing the bell proves that you're a part of history and that you will carry on this legacy.\u201d\n\nOutside the church, Leo and Jene Davis talked about how moved they were by the ceremony.\n\n\u201cThis was truly a blessing. It was all God,\u201d Leo Davis said. \u201cI'm still trembling from it.\u201d\n\nThe couple hadn't planned on coming to the church celebration Monday, but when they drove by and saw the crowd, they stopped. The two snagged the last two available seats inside the sanctuary.\n\n\u201cWe were moved by this. I'm so glad we came,\u201d Leo Davis added\n\nStaff writers Michele Canty and Steve Vaughan contributed to this report.
