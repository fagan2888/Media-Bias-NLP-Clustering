Among American Catholics, the pope is remarkably popular \u2014 87 percent have a favorable opinion of him \u2014 and he\u2019s the U.S. church\u2019s best chance of overcoming a bad case of spiritual anemia.\n\nBut excitement alone cannot heal one of the deepest rifts in Catholic life, not only among American Catholics but worldwide. It has to do with sexuality, although not the priest abuse scandals that have quite properly received attention in recent years. Nothing has divided the church more than its prohibition against contraception, even among married couples.\n\nApproximately 80 percent of U.S. Catholics, including the thoroughly devout, disagree with that stance (support for changing the ruling is nearly as high around the world). And the vast majority ignore the teaching altogether \u2014 one study suggests that 68 percent of sexually active American Catholic women have used birth control, sterilization or IUDs.\n\nPerhaps the fact that so many Catholics shrug off the condemnation tempts church leaders to imagine the question is moot. Aren\u2019t there bigger things to think about?\n\nIndeed, while Pope Francis has again and again called for a more responsive church, he has shown little interest in revisiting its teaching on contraception. Although he has derided the notion that being Catholic means reproducing \u201clike rabbits,\u201d he has praised Humanae Vitae, the 1968 encyclical that reaffirmed the church\u2019s birth-control prohibition. At last October\u2019s Extraordinary Synod on the Family, bishops grabbed headlines by debating controversial topics such as admitting remarried Catholics to Communion and acknowledging the upsides of same-sex relationships. But the discussion of contraception was perfunctory. The bishops simply called on the church to do a better job of propagating \u201cthe message of the encyclical Humanae Vitae.\u201d In other words, the widespread rejection of the birth-control ban is simply a messaging problem.\n\nThat\u2019s not true. The church\u2019s unwillingness to grapple with a deep and highly visible gap between official teaching and actual practice undermines Catholic vigor and unity at every level. It encourages Catholics to disregard all manner of other teachings, including those on marriage and abortion. If the church wants to restore its moral authority, it must address this gnawing question.\n\nThe church\u2019s sexual norms were woven out of the Old Testament, apostolic injunctions and classical doctrines such as Stoicism, which held passion suspect and condemned sexual acts not directed toward procreation as \u201cagainst nature.\u201d\n\nBut unlike, say, adultery or fornication or defining the conditions of a valid marriage, contraception was a relatively marginal issue until the 20th century, when reliable methods replaced a brew of folk remedies. Before that, birth control was associated with prostitution or illicit sex and decried by virtually all Christian denominations . When Anglican churches broke that pattern in 1930, followed by many Protestant denominations, Pope Pius XI reacted with a stern encyclical reasserting the condemnation. Opposition to birth control soon became a kind of identifying mark of Catholicism.\n\nBy mid-century, though, resolve had begun to weaken. The Second Vatican Council had transformed Catholicism, and theologians were stressing the emotional, bonding aspects of marital sex along with the procreative. The emergence of the birth-control pill in 1960 led some theologians to argue that whatever general principles of sexual morality one might draw from human \u201cnature,\u201d they did not extend to specific judgments about particular methods and uses of birth control. The faithful seemed to agree \u2014 by 1965, 61 percent of U.S. Catholics thought the church would eventually allow contraception.\n\nThat was also the thinking of the high-powered Pontifical Commission for the Study of Population, Family and Births, established by Pope John XXIII in 1963 and renewed in 1964 by his successor Pope Paul VI. By late June 1966, an overwhelming majority of the commission \u2014 made up mostly of cardinals and bishops, along with theologians, scientists and lay people \u2014 concluded that the church should no longer condemn contraception as \u201cintrinsically evil.\u201d The commission\u2019s recommendation was eventually leaked to the press.\n\nThe pope stayed silent, though, for two years. Meanwhile, as scholar Robert McClory wrote, \u201cmarried couples, unwilling to put their marital lives on hold, made practical decisions on the morality of contraception, more and more often with the approval of priests and bishops.\u201d\n\nFinally, in July 1968, Pope Paul VI rejected his commission\u2019s recommendation. The world\u2019s bishops fell in line but with noticeable hemming and hawing. A public protest, signed by more than 600 prominent Catholic scholars, argued that spouses could responsibly decide \u201caccording to their conscience\u201d to use artificial birth control.\n\nIronically, a handful of conservative prelates and theologians had warned Pope Paul VI that accepting the commission\u2019s recommendation would severely damage papal authority \u2014 which is exactly what happened when he rejected it.\n\nSociologists, theologians, pastors and bishops have dated a sapping of Catholic confidence in other church teachings about sexuality, and indeed in church authority in general, to the 1968 encyclical. Some researchers have linked frustration over the measure with declines in church attendance, financial contributions and parental support for sons to enter the priesthood. The prominent Catholic theologian Bernard Haring went so far as to write that \u201cno papal teaching document has ever caused such an earthquake in the Church as the encyclical \u2018Humanae Vitae.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMany Catholics now disregard the church\u2019s teachings on premarital sex, same-sex unions and divorce. According to a recent Pew poll, 70 percent of American Catholics believe it\u2019s acceptable for same-sex couples to live together, and 86 percent say premarital cohabitation among heterosexual couples is fine. Fewer than half say homosexual behavior or remarriage without annulment is a sin.\n\nMeanwhile, an outspoken conservative minority insists on making opposition to contraception a litmus test for separating \u201cfaithful Catholics\u201d from \u201cdissenters,\u201d and the past two popes seemed to count it far more than many other qualifications in naming new bishops. In short, the contraception issue has injected paralyzing doses of tension, suspicion, dissemblance and dysfunction throughout Catholic life.\n\nSo an American hierarchy that had long campaigned for the \u201cright to health care\u201d gets bogged down in political opposition to the Affordable Care Act, for fear that Catholic institutions would be forced to provide their employees with contraception coverage. Outstanding Catholic efforts to serve AIDS victims in Africa are discredited by a doctrinaire anti-condom stance in Rome. Advocacy for impoverished families in the Philippines and elsewhere is contradicted by political lobbying against workable birth-control programs.\n\nIn October, the church will have a chance to tackle this issue at a follow-up synod, with a somewhat different cast of bishops. Though their final report is not binding, Pope Francis has indicated that he\u2019ll take their advice very seriously.\n\nThis time, they should take the opportunity to treat what has been ailing the church since 1968. First, the synod should stop handling Catholics\u2019 massive rejection of the birth-control ban as merely a problem requiring more effective church teaching, rather than something requiring more church learning.\n\nSecond, they must stop couching the issue of whether married couples should use contraception in vague, elevated code language like \u201copenness to life\u201d or loving \u201cfully\u201d or returning to the \u201cmessage\u201d of Humanae Vitae. Instead, the synod should acknowledge that the decades of division turn entirely on a handful of sentences in that encyclical. These do not deal with anti-life values or selfish patterns of behavior. Rather, they make a very specific judgment about the nature of sexual intercourse: Anything done to prevent conception in any instance whatsoever of intercourse by married couples \u2014 regardless of the circumstances, the spouses\u2019 intentions or the seriousness of their reasons \u2014 is \u201cintrinsically wrong.\u201d Is the moral reasoning leading to that unconditional judgment valid?\n\nThe issue, in other words, is not Humanae Vitae\u2019s other insights about married love, the sexual revolution or the potential misuses of humanity\u2019s newfound power over reproduction. Nor is it the efficacy or benefits of \u201cnatural family planning\u201d (in which sexual intercourse is limited to times of infertility). Nor is the issue the threat of overpopulation or underpopulation, or imposing Western neocolonial values on other cultures. These may be legitimate concerns, but they do not underpin or necessarily lead to Pope Paul VI\u2019s fateful ruling.\n\nObviously, in a three-week session crowded with other topics, the synod cannot resolve a problem festering since 1968. But besides outlining the conflict in clear terms \u2014 and perhaps acknowledging the sincerity and moral seriousness of those on both sides \u2014 the synod could propose a renewed examination of church teaching on marriage and sexuality, perhaps to mark the 50th anniversary of Humanae Vitae in 2018.\n\nThat might involve a rereading of the encyclical in view of its historical context: the disruption of the pill and the sexual revolution combined with anxiety about doctrinal authority in the wake of the Second Vatican Council.\n\nAfter all, the council itself, by calling for freedom of religion and support for human rights, officially reversed teachings expressed in encyclicals by 19th-century popes traumatized by the French Revolution \u2014 teachings that, in ways similar to the treatment of contraception today, many Catholic thinkers and leaders, both clerical and lay, had long been questioning in principle and ignoring in practice.\n\nBut what about Pope Francis, to whom the coming synod will submit its recommendations? One can picture him criticizing contraception as a symptom of the wealthy West\u2019s impulse to control nature through technology. One can also imagine that he might prefer to see the condemnation of contraception maintained in principle while bent to the needs of the poor or the burdened in practice. He has not shown himself to be overly worried about consistency.\n\nIt is hard to see, however, how preaching an absolute rule while excusing lots of exceptions could resolve the church\u2019s credibility gap or heal its internal division. Too many Catholics would likely find that solution not only inconsistent but offensive.\n\nIn fact, Pope Francis\u2019s most relevant comment about how the upcoming synod should handle this question didn\u2019t mention contraception at all. It was the mandate he gave to the bishops at the opening of last year\u2019s synod. \u201cSpeaking honestly,\u201d he insisted, was the their basic responsibility. They should speak their minds \u201cwithout polite deference, without hesitation.\u201d\n\nIf the church is to speak honestly about a range of pressing sexual issues, the first step will be for its leaders to speak honestly about contraception.\n\npsteinfels@fordham.edu\n\nRead more from Outlook and follow our updates on Facebook and Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A more honest position on contraception would help it reestablish its moral authority.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A more honest position on contraception would help it reestablish its moral authority.", "title": "Why the Catholic Church should talk about contraception", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-catholic-church-should-talk-about-condoms/2015/09/11/94e45458-5313-11e5-933e-7d06c647a395_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/09/11/Outlook/Images/LEVY_WASHPO_WINGS_rectangle.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-catholic-church-should-talk-about-condoms/2015/09/11/94e45458-5313-11e5-933e-7d06c647a395_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "94e45458-5313-11e5-933e-7d06c647a395"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd97a7\"", "article_summary": "Peter Steinfels is the author of \u201cA People Adrift: The Crisis of the Roman Catholic Church in America\u201d and a former religion correspondent for the New York Times.\nThe faithful seemed to agree \u2014 by 1965, 61 percent of U.S. Catholics thought the church would eventually allow contraception.\nIndeed, while Pope Francis has again and again called for a more responsive church, he has shown little interest in revisiting its teaching on contraception.\nSociologists, theologians, pastors and bishops have dated a sapping of Catholic confidence in other church teachings about sexuality, and indeed in church authority in general, to the 1968 encyclical.\nFirst, the synod should stop handling Catholics\u2019 massive rejection of the birth-control ban as merely a problem requiring more effective church teaching, rather than something requiring more church learning."}
