On Thursday\u2019s episode of the political satire show, Stewart showed clip after clip of members of the Fourth Estate musing that if \u201ceven Jon Stewart\u201d is making jokes about Obamacare, the White House is in crisis.\n\n\u201cI guess it is very significant that even Jon Stewart \u2014 even Jon Stewart \u2014 has turned against this,\u201d Stewart said. \u201d I can\u2019t recall even Jon Stewart ever doing that before.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Jon Stewart on CNN: Wolf Blitzer Asked Michele Bachmann to \u2018Dumb it Down\u2019 (Video)\n\nHowever, Stewart noted that commentators used earlier instances of his joke-making about President Obama as evidence that popular support for the Democratic leader was eroding as far back as the early days of his administration.\n\n\u201cLook making fun of something, that\u2019s nothing new for us, so don\u2019t act like us making jokes about a certain program or president is evidence that that politician or issue has reached some kind of tipping point for action,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cAlthough that apparently is exactly the case that they are making.\u201d\n\nCue ootage of Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) arguing to Fox News host Greta Van Susteren that Stewart\u2019s jokes about HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius were evidence it was time for to resign. His remarks gave credence to the media\u2019s belief that when Stewart lampoons something, it\u2019s all over.\n\n\u201cIf that causes things to end why was the network you were on still on the air,\u201d Stewart said, noting that Fox News has been a frequent target of his wit.\n\nFeeling in a nostalgic mood, he drifted back down memory lane and landed upon a certain Bush administration official who managed to survive countless riffs.\n\n\u201cTwo glorious days of Dick Cheney shot an old man in the face jokes,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cDid he leave? No We did a running segment called you don\u2019t know Dick. Did he leave? No. What did it accomplish? Dick.\u201d\n\nWatch the video:", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/jonstewart-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Brent Lang", "description": "\"The Daily Show\" host says his influence has been exaggerated", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "\"The Daily Show\" host says his influence has been exaggerated", "title": "Jon Stewart to Media: Just Because I Make Fun of Obamacare, Doesn't Mean It Will End (Video)", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 614, "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/jonstewart.jpg", "height": 412}, "updated_time": "2014-07-10T20:26:09+00:00", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/jon-stewart-media-just-make-fun-obamacare-doesnt-mean-will-end-video/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "&#8220;The Daily Show&#8221; host says his influence has been exaggerated", "creator": "@brentalang", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/jon-stewart-media-just-make-fun-obamacare-doesnt-mean-will-end-video/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/jonstewart-340x300.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/jonstewart-340x300.jpg"}, "title": "Jon Stewart to Media: Just Because I Make Fun of Obamacare, Doesn\u2019t Mean It Will End (Video)", "site": "@thewrap", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-01T14:07:00+00:00", "sailthru.title": "Jon Stewart to Media: Just Because I Make Fun of Obamacare, Doesn\u2019t Mean It Will End (Video)", "wp-parsely_version": "1.6", "fb": {"app_id": 228236404181023}, "google-site-verification": "-PpFSIrGHybVDxbndrL6MCngw3j6BXdy0xDVBVVOacI", "sailthru.tags": "jon stewart", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "section": "Dailies", "tag": "Jon Stewart", "published_time": "2013-11-01T07:07:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-10T20:26:09+00:00"}, "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Jon Stewart to Media: Just Because I Make Fun of Obamacare, Doesn\u2019t Mean It Will End (Video)\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/jon-stewart-media-just-make-fun-obamacare-doesnt-mean-will-end-video\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/11\\/jonstewart-150x150.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"175429\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-01T14:07:00Z\",\"section\":\"Dailies\",\"author\":\"Brent Lang\",\"tags\":[\"jon stewart\"]}", "sailthru.category": "media,videos,tv,dailies", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/jonstewart.jpg", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb0ab\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI guess it is very significant that even Jon Stewart \u2014 even Jon Stewart \u2014 has turned against this,\u201d Stewart said.\n\u201cTwo glorious days of Dick Cheney shot an old man in the face jokes,\u201d Stewart said.\nOn Thursday\u2019s episode of the political satire show, Stewart showed clip after clip of members of the Fourth Estate musing that if \u201ceven Jon Stewart\u201d is making jokes about Obamacare, the White House is in crisis.\n\u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host says his influence has been exaggeratedJon Stewart may lean to the left politically, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from skewering President Obama and the bumpy roll-out of the Affordable Care Act.\narguing to Fox News host Greta Van Susteren that Stewart\u2019s jokes about HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius were evidence it was time for to resign."}
