Therefore, what better standard by which to judge Republican presidential candidates than by who is the most committed to actually defeating the opposition?\n\nAnd who might that candidate be in 2016? Well, according to the man from whom much of today\u2019s conservative multimedia empire originates, that candidate is Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for the Republican candidate who is the most steadfastly opposed to liberalism, whose agenda is oriented towards stopping it, thwarting it, and defeating it \u2013 it\u2019s Ted Cruz,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh recently said on his popular radio program.\n\nLet the record show that as usual, Rush is right.\n\nIn fact, I challenge anybody reading this to make an objective case there is a more principled candidate in the race than Mr. Cruz \u2014 because you can\u2019t. I also work for an organization called Conservative Review, which gives regularly scheduled proctology exams to the records of politicians by charting how they vote on a full spectrum of conservative issues via our \u201cliberty scorecard.\u201d Mr. Cruz currently has our second-highest score at 96 percent, which is second only to Mike Lee.\n\nExcept Mr. Cruz does not just settle for voting the right way when it\u2019s all said and done, but he fights back on our behalf against the corruption infesting Washington as well as the \u201closership\u201d of the Republican Party.\n\nFor example, while campaign rivals like Carly Fiorina and Mike Huckabee were urging Republicans to cave and fund Obamacare two years ago, Mr. Cruz fought to try and stop it from ever seeing the light of day. While Marco Rubio was becoming the poster-child for the \u201cgang of eight\u201d amnesty scam, Mr. Cruz helped to lead the fight to kill it. While Rand Paul and others were endorsing the very GOP corporatist shills in contested primaries that are betraying us now, Mr. Cruz tried to defeat them.\n\nTo this day, he remains the only GOP presidential candidate to speak out against the heinous race-baiting the party used to stop Chris McDaniel from beating moderate incumbent Thad Cochran in a U.S. Senate primary last year. This is why Mr. McDaniel is now coordinating Mr. Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign in his home state of Mississippi.\n\nHere is the bottom line: If someone doesn\u2019t have a proven history of fighting the corruption in Washington before getting elected, that probably means they\u2019re unlikely to do it after they reach the White House.\n\nMr. Cruz\u2019s willingness to fight is why activists see him as one of our own. He\u2019s the only candidate ever to win the Values Voters Summit straw poll of social conservatives three years in a row. He also won the Freedom Works straw poll of limited government conservatives earlier this year by almost 30 points over his next-closest competitor. He was the only candidate endorsed by Gun Owners of America as well.\n\nMr. Cruz also doesn\u2019t pander to lobbyists. Like when he came to my home state of Iowa and openly opposed the government-mandated Renewable Fuel Standard. He hasn\u2019t given up on the institution of marriage, and is one of just four candidates to sign the National Organization for Marriage pledge.\n\nNor does Mr. Cruz bow to the canard of judicial fiat. While others who had previously spent their entire political careers doing so were suddenly giving speeches quoting the Founding Fathers, Mr. Cruz was filing legislation in Congress to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over marriage. He also urged states that were not a party to the Obergefell opinion to ignore it. Furthermore, Mr. Cruz has vowed as president to nullify any federal government intrusions upon religious liberty as a result of Obergefell.\n\nAs a former litigator himself, Mr. Cruz won numerous landmark federal/Supreme Court cases on some of today\u2019s most important constitutional issues, such as national sovereignty, the Second Amendment and religious liberty. No other candidate can say that.\n\nIn fact, no other candidate has the proven record of fighting liberalism \u2013 from both Democrats and Republicans \u2013 Mr. Cruz has. No one running in this field can top this resume (or anyone running in the last several cycles for that matter).\n\nHe is the most principled candidate in the race, just as Mr. Limbaugh said.\n\nWe have a whole field right now made up mostly of campaign conservatives. They are people who promise to take us to the moon and back, and who take uber-principled positions the likes of which they\u2019ve scoffed at before. For example, if a candidate didn\u2019t support the fight to stop the most pro-abortion legislation in American history in the form of Obamacare, should we now trust that they\u2019ll have the courage of conviction to take on the whole abortion industry just because they say they will on the campaign trail?\n\nConservatives should be asking themselves this question: Based on their proven records, which of these candidates is the most likely to follow through on what they\u2019re saying once elected?\n\nThat\u2019s why I am supporting Mr. Cruz. He\u2019s done everything we\u2019ve ever asked a Republican to do, and he\u2019s also built one of the best organized and best funded campaigns in the race. Unlike previous conservatives who ran for president in recent cycles, Mr. Cruz has the resources to truly run a national campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the rest of the conservative movement to give Mr. Cruz the recognition and support he has earned. We need not lament a lack of principle or resources. Mr. Cruz has met both thresholds.\n\nIt is time for our movement to decide if it is still capable of moving ideas and advancing policy, or if we are just an industry that sells a lot of books and tickets to a lot of conferences. The future of the country is at stake. This is no time for flirting with insiders pretending to be outsiders, or with nice guy candidates we all know have no chance because they haven\u2019t laid the groundwork it takes to compete. This is the moment to finally put the full weight of our movement behind a worthy champion.\n\nSomeone who has proven they will fight for us. That someone is Ted Cruz.\n\nUnimportant people like me see it. Very important people like Rush Limbaugh see it. Now it\u2019s time for the conservative movement to see it, too.\n\nSteve Deace is a nationally syndicated talk show host and also the author of the new book \u201cRules for Patriots: How Conservatives Can Win Again.\u201d You can \u201clike\u201d him on Facebook or follow him on Twitter @SteveDeaceShow.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It seems to me the only principled reason to be a Republican would be to stop, thwart and defeat Leftist ideas you're opposed to.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "It seems to me the only principled reason to be a Republican would be to stop, thwart and defeat Leftist ideas you\u2019re opposed to.", "title": "STEVE DEACE: Rush Limbaugh is right: Ted Cruz is most-principled candidate", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/5/steve-deace-rush-limbaugh-right-ted-cruz-most-prin/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/26/4fda056a24ac072b830f6a706700299d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/26/4fda056a24ac072b830f6a706700299d.jpg", "description": "It seems to me the only principled reason to be a Republican would be to stop, thwart and defeat Leftist ideas you're opposed to.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "STEVE DEACE: Rush Limbaugh is right: Ted Cruz is most-principled candi"}, "Author": "Steve  Deace", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Ted Cruz"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a57\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s time for the rest of the conservative movement to give Mr. Cruz the recognition and support he has earned.\nFurthermore, Mr. Cruz has vowed as president to nullify any federal government intrusions upon religious liberty as a result of Obergefell.\nIn fact, no other candidate has the proven record of fighting liberalism \u2013 from both Democrats and Republicans \u2013 Mr. Cruz has.\nWhile Rand Paul and others were endorsing the very GOP corporatist shills in contested primaries that are betraying us now, Mr. Cruz tried to defeat them.\nIn fact, I challenge anybody reading this to make an objective case there is a more principled candidate in the race than Mr. Cruz \u2014 because you can\u2019t."}
