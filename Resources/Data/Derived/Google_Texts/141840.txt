America’s dependence on prescription drugs is very much playing into the hands of the big pharmaceutical companies, as data once again suggests an incredible surge in prescription drug spending for 2014. Spending was once again up 13% year on year, which has been attributed largely to accelerating prescription drug prices and the Affordable Care Act covering millions more Americans for their essential dispensing needs.

In total, an incredible $2374 billion was spent on prescription drugs in 2014, representing the biggest year-on-year spike since 2001. The IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics released the figures on Tuesday, which after taking into account inflation and the growing US population gave a final prescription drug sale growth rate of 10% year-on-year.

Millions of Americans were added to Medicaid’s ranks in 2014, which led to a ginormous spike in the number of generic and inexpensive drugs being dispensed with the bill being footed by the governmental insurance plan. In total, 2014’s prescription tally came out at an all-time record-high of 4.3 billion.

Along with record numbers of prescriptions being dispensed, the spike in spending was also triggered by in some cases extortionate hikes in prescription drug prices, which for many American’s saw annual treatment expenses rise thousands of dollars. However, there may be some relief in sight for those who found themselves out of pocket in 2014 as experts do not believe that the same will be the case this year, or at any time in the near future.

“2014 was a remarkable year,” the AP quoted executive director of the IMS Institute Murray Aitken as saying

“We’re probably not going to see it again.”
