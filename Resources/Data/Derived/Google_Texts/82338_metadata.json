Though he admitted, \u201cOnce in a while, literally in well over a year now, at Thanksgiving, I had one bite of turkey.\u201d\n\nWATCH:\n\nThe Washington Post identified Clinton as a vegan as recently as Aug. 22, 2013.\n\nClinton will give a pro-ObamaCare speech in Arkansas on Sept. 4.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Charles C.
