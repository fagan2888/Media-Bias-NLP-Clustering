But in Illinois, despite students receiving similar scores, education officials said only about one-third were deemed proficient.\n\nThe discrepancy played out in Massachusetts as well, where about half of the students who took identical tests to those in Ohio were measured proficient.\n\nThe inconsistency was not because students were performing at vastly different levels among states, the Times reported, but was rather the result of states using different labels to define the same scores.\n\nIn California and North Carolina, for instance, state officials combined students who either passed or nearly passed the tests into the same category. In Florida, the Times continued, officials pushed for \u201cless stringent\u201d passing rates.\n\nInitially, 46 states adopted the standards, but lawmakers in more than a dozen states have since moved to drop out of Common Core, while Indiana, Oklahoma, and South Carolina have repealed it fully.\n\nThe Times noted that fewer than half of the states that originally implemented the assessments are still using the same tests developed under Common Core, \u201cmaking it difficult to equate results from different states.\u201d\n\nLindsey Burke, a fellow in education policy at The Heritage Foundation, said that not only are states evaluating outcomes differently, but many are now deviating from Common Core standards to follow their own assessments.\n\n\u201cProponents have long touted the \u2018common\u2019 in Common Core\u2014that every child would be held to the same standard. But it appears the common is being lost as the real world implementation moves forward in some states,\u201d Burke said.\n\nThis result, she continued, is the \u201cfolly\u201d of believing that a single standard could be effective for all states and students.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, states should exit the Common Core boondoggle and work to improve their own standards and assessments.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The New York Times found that Common Core has not lived up to its primary purpose.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The New York Times found that Common Core has not lived up to its primary purpose.", "title": "Common Core Has Not Created Consistent Testing Standards", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151007_CommonCore_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-09T20:49:01+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Oo7TKI"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The New York Times found that Common Core has not lived up to its primary purpose.", "title": "Common Core Has Not Created Consistent Testing Standards", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151007_CommonCore_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12", "published_time": "2015-10-09T19:48:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-09T20:49:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "common core, education, new york times, standardized testing"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe4ef0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNow more than ever, states should exit the Common Core boondoggle and work to improve their own standards and assessments.\u201d\nState officials in Ohio, for example, announced last month that two-thirds of students were proficient in reading and math, according to tests taken under Common Core standards.\n\u201cProponents have long touted the \u2018common\u2019 in Common Core\u2014that every child would be held to the same standard.\nInitially, 46 states adopted the standards, but lawmakers in more than a dozen states have since moved to drop out of Common Core, while Indiana, Oklahoma, and South Carolina have repealed it fully.\nBut in Illinois, despite students receiving similar scores, education officials said only about one-third were deemed proficient."}
