It was chaos -- chaos!!! -- when a federal appeals court ruled against a key provision in the Affordable Care Act earlier this week.

At least, that's how the media put it, leading "Daily Show" host Jon Stewart to whip out a severed head and begin screaming: "There is no law! Everyone for themselves! It's the end of the world! You blew it up! Obamacare is made of people!"

But then a second court ruled in favor of that same provision.

So how can we fix it? As usual, Stewart has some ideas... including one that involves a Scrabble set.
