On the heels of Supreme Court decisions legalizing same-sex marriage and Obamacare subsidies, a new Gallup poll finds that Republicans' approval of the high court has plummeted to a record low.GOP approval stands at just 18 percent — a 17-point drop from September, and a 33-point decline since last summer — while Democrats' approval of the high court has skyrocketed to 76 percent. In September, the poll measured Democrats' approval at 47 percent.Republican ratings represent the lowest in Gallup polling history, while the Democrats' rating is the highest ever reported by the organization.Overall, Americans were divided, with 49 percent approving and 46 percent disapproving.The telephone survey was conducted July 8-12, just after the June announcements on the divisive gay marriage and Obamacare decisions."As a result of the partisan changes in opinions of the Supreme Court, Americans' views of it are polarized along party lines more than ever has been the case in Gallup's 15-year trend," according to Gallup.In that 15-year trend, Supreme Court job approval ratings among all Americans have fluctuated significantly — between 42 percent and 62 percent — though there has been more movement among Republicans (18 percent to 80 percent) than Democrats (38 percent to 76 percent).Gallup explains that partisans often re-evaluate their feelings about the court after controversial rulings. A June CNN/ORC poll found that 63 percent of Americans agreed with the court's decisions to uphold Obamacare subsidies, and 59 percent agreed that same-sex marriage should be legal in all 50 states, a constitutional right across the country.
