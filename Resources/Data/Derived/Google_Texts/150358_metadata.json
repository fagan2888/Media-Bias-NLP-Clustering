Patient data were collected from January 2013 through December 2014. Factors associated with ACA enrollment and viral suppression were identified using multivariable binary logistic regression.\n\nThe researchers found that 47.1% of eligible ADAP patients enrolled in an ACA plan. Enrollment was lower among those who were male, black, aged 25 years to 44 years, or diagnosed with AIDS as opposed to HIV. Enrollment rates ranged from 14% to 70% at individual clinics, and patients who were eligible for federal tax credits or whose previous ADAP enrollment would expire were prioritized by the health care system, and therefore were more likely to initiate ACA enrollment.\n\nViral suppression was achieved by 85.5% of those enrolled in an ACA plan, as opposed to 78.7% suppression among the unenrolled. Regression analysis found this difference to be significant, and that ACA enrollment was significantly associated with an increased chance of viral suppression among this population (OR = 1.45). Greater rates of viral suppression also were identified among patients with previously undetected viral loads.\n\nAccording to McManus, these encouraging outcomes are an example of cost-effective HIV care in the wake of recent policy changes.\n\n\u201cThe government, and therefore taxpayers, are some of the biggest payers for HIV medicine and HIV care in the U.S.,\u201d McManus said. \u201cAny time that we can use those dollars to achieve good HIV outcomes, that\u2019s good for everybody. Every time someone who has HIV becomes virologically suppressed, we\u2019re reducing the possibility that they\u2019re going to transmit to more people.\u201d\n\nCarlos del Rio\n\n\n\n\u201cI think many of us have really wondered what the impact of ACA was going to be in the care of patients with HIV,\u201d Carlos del Rio, MD, professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine and chair-elect of the HIV Medicine Association, said during the press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s really telling us what happened in a state that \u2026 did not expand Medicaid, but was able to use their ADAP dollars in a very different way to provide access to patients.\u201d \u2013 by Dave Muoio\n\nReference:\n\nMcManus K, et al.
