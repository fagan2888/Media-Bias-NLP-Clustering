However, as with all dreams, the time is coming to wake up. Along with several other social services, Sweden\u2019s iconic \u201cfree\u201d healthcare system\u2019s days are numbered.\n\nSweden\u2019s insurance trade industry organization, Svensk F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring reports:\n\nThe number of private health care insurance policies has increased in recent years. In 2011 about 440,000 people had private health care insurance. Most of these people have their policy paid by their employer.\n\nAdditionally, The Local recently reported that nearly \u201cOne in ten Swedes now has private health insurance,\u201d with rising policy demand extending to half a million Swedes and growing throughout the 9.5 million living in the country.\n\nFrom The Local:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quicker to get a colleague back to work if you have an operation in two weeks\u2019 time rather than having to wait for a year,\u201d privately insured Anna Norlander told Sveriges Radio on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible that I, as a young person, don\u2019t feel I can trust the health care system to take care of me.\u201d\n\nThe Local also reminds us that the Achilles heel of all socialist systems plagues the Swedish medical system, stating:\n\n\u201cVisitors are sometimes surprised to learn about year-long waiting times for cancer patients.\u201d\n\nThis is an unfortunate reality in an industry where suppliers cannot predict market prices for a service and therefore must ration, causing poor service and over-inflated demand. The only logical conclusion that one could derive from this situation is that demand for supplemental private insurance skyrockets because of the inadequate government healthcare system.\n\nIn the 1970s, Sweden began to replace its market economy with a socialist planned one. When that proved unaffordable in the 90s, Sweden then began to re-privatize industries and let economic laws of laissez faire capitalism begin to take root once more. Now, Sweden\u2019s public spending has decreased nearly 20% in the last 20 years and its taxes are lower than France, Belgium, and Denmark.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Sweden still doesn\u2019t have a long way to go in restoring its social atmosphere. Sweden is still in many ways a cultural-Marxist hellscape and its restriction on owning firearms or other tools for self defense has earned it the title of \u201crape capital of the west.\u201d\n\nIn any case, it was only a matter of time before the lies of left-wing politicians and the usual failures of socialist economic policies caused people to embrace the free market and entrepreneurship, hopefully this time for good.\n\nFollow Chris on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "There is some positive news for lovers of freedom: Sweden's socialist healthcare system is so poor, people are leaving it in droves for private healthcare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "There is some positive news for lovers of freedom: Sweden's socialist healthcare system is so poor, people are leaving it in droves for private healthcare.", "title": "Sweden Is Upgrading to Private Healthcare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ola_ericson-the_swedish_flag-359.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-23T08:59:53+00:00", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/sweden-is-evolving-to-private-healthcare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There is some positive news for lovers of freedom: Sweden's socialist healthcare system is so poor, people are leaving it in droves for private healthcare.", "creator": "@ChrisJohncox", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ola_ericson-the_swedish_flag-359.jpg", "title": "Sweden Is Upgrading to Private Healthcare", "site": "@thelibrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "published_time": "2016-02-23T08:58:55+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/cjohncox", "section": "Economics of Liberty", "modified_time": "2016-02-23T08:59:53+00:00", "tag": "Universal Healthcare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe04e3\"", "article_summary": "Sweden\u2019s insurance trade industry organization, Svensk F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring reports:The number of private health care insurance policies has increased in recent years.\nIn 2011 about 440,000 people had private health care insurance.\nAlong with several other social services, Sweden\u2019s iconic \u201cfree\u201d healthcare system\u2019s days are numbered.\nThe only logical conclusion that one could derive from this situation is that demand for supplemental private insurance skyrockets because of the inadequate government healthcare system.\nSweden Is Upgrading to Private HealthcareSweden\u2019s Trademark Universal Healthcare On Its Deathbedby CHRIS JOHNCOXWhen leftists fantasize about Northern Europe, the first thing they think of is the region\u2019s enormous public spending and its overly generous welfare state."}
