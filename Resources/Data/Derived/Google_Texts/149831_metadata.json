Although the park is explicitly religious, it enjoyed a deluge of support from the state of Kentucky when it was announced in 2010, with Governor Steve Beshear (D) holding a press conference to endorse the park as a job magnet and the Kentucky Tourism, Arts and Heritage Cabinet initially pledging $43 million in tax breaks for the project\u2019s $173 million construction plan. That amount was eventually reconfigured to $18 million for the project\u2019s \u201cfirst phase\u201d, and government officials maintained that the park should be treated the same as any other large project in the state \u2014 so long as AiG promised not to pick and choose who they hire based on religion.\n\nOver the past few months, however, AiG and Ark Encounter \u2014 which are connected to the Creation Museum, also in Kentucky \u2014 have reversed course from their initial pledge to comply with the state\u2019s existing nondiscrimination policies. Ark Encounter\u2019s job applications, which were reportedly posted on AiG\u2019s website, stipulate that employees must agree with the group\u2019s fundamentalist religious beliefs, and Ken Ham, famous creationist and head of AiG, has openly stated in fundraising emails that he intends to continue to discriminate based on religion when hiring for the park.\n\nBut Ham\u2019s defiance couldn\u2019t silence the rising tide of criticism surrounding the project, and the group\u2019s willful disregard for existing tax law eventually caught up with them. The Freedom From Religion Foundation asked the IRS to investigate AiG\u2019s tax-exempt status in November, and tourism Secretary Robert Stewart sent two letters to AiG in August and September demanding they pledge to comply with state law regarding hiring policies. Ark Encounter\u2019s attorney finally rejected Sewart\u2019s request on Monday, prompting the Secretary to respond on Wednesday with a letter saying that as long as the group discriminates based on religion, it is ineligible for $18 million in tax breaks.\n\n\u201cAs you know, since the filing of the original incentive application in 2010, we have strongly supported this project, believing it to be a tourism attraction based on biblical themes that would create significant jobs for the community,\u201d Stewart wrote. \u201cHowever, based on various postings on the Answers in Genesis (AIG) and Ark Encounter websites, reports from Ark Encounter investor meetings and our correspondence, it is readily apparent that the project has evolved from a tourism attraction to an extension of AIG\u2019s ministry that will no longer permit the Commonwealth to grant the project tourism development incentives.\u201d\n\n\u201cState tourism tax incentives cannot be used to fund religious indoctrination or otherwise be used to advance religion \u2026 The use of state incentives in this way violates the separation of church and state provisions of the Constitution and is therefore impermissible,\u201d he added.\n\nAiG tried to head off the government\u2019s decision earlier this week with a new PR campaign, announcing on Tuesday a plan to plaster 16 billboards across Kentucky and New York City with a message that reads, \u201cTo all of our intolerant liberal friends \u2014 thank God you can\u2019t sink this ship.\u201d\n\nCREDIT: Image courtesy answersingenesis.org\n\nThe effort wasn\u2019t enough to convince state officials, however, as longtime supporter of the project Governor Beshear explained in a letter sent to Insider Louisville.\n\n\u201cWe expect any entity that accepts state incentives not to discriminate on any basis in hiring,\u201d Beshear wrote. \u201cWhile the leaders of Ark Encounter had previously agreed not to discriminate in hiring based on religion, they now refuse to make that commitment and it has become apparent that they do intend to use religious beliefs as a litmus test for hiring decisions. For that reason, we cannot proceed with the tourism incentive application for the Ark Encounter project.\u201d\n\nAiG\u2019s attorneys maintain that the group has the right, as a faith-based institution, to discriminate based on religion. They have threatened to sue the state in federal court over the loss of the tax incentives, saying that the state\u2019s conditions impose an unfair burden on their First Amendment right to freely express their religion without a compelling government interest \u2014 even though the state has not placed any restrictions on their activity, it\u2019s just refused to give AiG special subsidies so long as they engage in discrimination.\n\nAiG\u2019s case is unlikely to succeed if the courts apply existing legal precedents, but the loss of tax breaks doesn\u2019t necessarily sink the hopes of Ark Encounter\u2019s supporters. AiG\u2019s fundraising apparatus is vast, and the group has made it clear that they plan to weather the storm of criticism and press on with the project \u2014 with or without government assistance.\n\n\u201cThis does not mean the project will not be built \u2014 on the contrary, Ark Encounter has said publicly that the project will be built regardless of availability of state incentives,\u201d Beshear wrote. \u201cI have no doubt that the Ark Encounter will be a successful attraction, drawing visitors and creating jobs, much like the Creation Museum.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"State tourism tax incentives cannot be used to fund religious indoctrination or otherwise be used to advance religion,\" tourism Secretary Robert Stewart said.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"State tourism tax incentives cannot be used to fund religious indoctrination or otherwise be used to advance religion,\" tourism Secretary Robert Stewart said.", "title": "Noah\u2019s Ark Loses $18 Million In Tax Breaks", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/12/11/3602361/ark-park-endures-flood-of-criticism-loses-tax-breaks/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP805002042692.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"State tourism tax incentives cannot be used to fund religious indoctrination or otherwise be used to advance religion,\" tourism Secretary Robert Stewart said.", "creator": "@jackmjenkins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP805002042692-321x214.jpg", "title": "Noah\u2019s Ark Loses $18 Million In Tax Breaks", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP805002042692.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP805002042692.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-11T11:46:20+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jackiswriting"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6bb5\"", "article_summary": "Justice Noah\u2019s Ark Loses $18 Million In Tax Breaks CREDIT: AP Ken Ham, President of Answers in Genesis, picture here with a dinosaur.\n\u201cI have no doubt that the Ark Encounter will be a successful attraction, drawing visitors and creating jobs, much like the Creation Museum.\u201d\nArk Encounter\u2019s attorney finally rejected Sewart\u2019s request on Monday, prompting the Secretary to respond on Wednesday with a letter saying that as long as the group discriminates based on religion, it is ineligible for $18 million in tax breaks.\nAiG\u2019s case is unlikely to succeed if the courts apply existing legal precedents, but the loss of tax breaks doesn\u2019t necessarily sink the hopes of Ark Encounter\u2019s supporters.\nOver the past few months, however, AiG and Ark Encounter \u2014 which are connected to the Creation Museum, also in Kentucky \u2014 have reversed course from their initial pledge to comply with the state\u2019s existing nondiscrimination policies."}
