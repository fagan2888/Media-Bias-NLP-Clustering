If you\u2019ve been to the zoo, you\u2019ve probably met him. He takes tickets, works at concerts, and helps people board the zoo train.\n\n\u201cIf I was to have my pick I\u2019d always be down at the train station as the station master,\u201d he says.\n\nThe zoo is is publicly funded and managed by the regional government agency Metro. Olmsted has been a part of the zoo longer than some of the animals visitors go to see\u2014 the California condors, black howler monkeys, and piranhas.\n\nHe is effectively a permanent temp. He works about three quarters of the year, but his hours change every week, and every year, Metro, the regional government agency that runs the zoo, lets him go and then hires him again.\n\n\u201cIt does seem strange to be called a temporary worker when you\u2019re there year, after year, after year. And working there nearly year-round,\u201d he says.\n\nOlmstead is not alone; the zoo employs several hundred temporary workers, and many have returned to work there year after year. The future of the zoo\u2019s temps is a major sticking point in mediation talks this week between Metro and the Laborers International Union of North America, the union that represents many of the zoo\u2019s regular and temporary workers.\n\nBecause the Zoo classifies Olmsted as a temporary employee, in the 15 years that he\u2019s worked there, he\u2019s never had a day of paid vacation or paid sick leave. That was particularly difficult in 2008, when he was being treated for Hodgkins lymphoma.\n\n\u201cIt was brutal. I would have my chemo on one day, and then have three days off, just to help bounce back from it. And then I\u2019d work,\u201d he says.\n\nOlmsted says his bosses were kind, and helped him schedule his shifts so he had time to recover. And he was lucky. The zoo doesn\u2019t provide him with health insurance because he\u2019s a temp, although in some years he\u2019s received a stipend to help defray healthcare costs, but he has been insured through his wife\u2019s health plan.\n\nBut Olmsted says it\u2019s depressing to work somewhere for so long, and not get regular benefits.\n\nOne-point-six million people visit the Zoo each year, according to its website. Metro Spokesman Jim Middaugh says the agency needs temps to deal with the seasonal nature of the work at the zoo, which sees big crowds in the summer and empties out on grey days in the fall.\n\nIn the past, Middaugh says, the jobs attracted college students and other people who weren\u2019t looking for something permanent.\n\n\u201cThese positions before were really aimed at a different kind of worker. Because of the weakness of the economy, people are coming to rely on these positions for sole sources of income,\u201d Middaugh said.\n\n\u201cMetro is heavily relying on what they call temporary workers right now,\u201d according to Erika Askin, with the Laborers International Union of North America Local 483.\n\nAskin is representing many of the zoo\u2019s workers in a contract negotiation with Metro. She\u2019s concerned that over the years, the zoo has relied more and more on temp workers.\n\nShe says the zoo employs about 300 temps. That includes most of the people in the admissions department, but also animal keepers, maintenance workers, and gardeners.\n\nIn some cases, she says, temps really are working on short-term assignments.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not the majority of workers who Metro is calling temporary. More than half are coming back year to year, looking at this as a potential career.\u201d\n\nZoo personnel records show that last year, about a quarter of the zoo\u2019s temp workers had start dates from 2009 or earlier. More than twenty had, like Olmsted, worked at the zoo in some capacity for more than a decade.\n\nMiddaugh says temporary workers do receive fewer benefits than regular status employees, and acknowledges that there are legitimate questions about who has been called a temp in the past.\n\n\u201cMetro recognizes that our obligations as an employer and our community\u2019s values are changing, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re at the table trying to reach agreement on the appropriate level of benefits,\u201d Middaugh says.\n\nAnd Askin, the union rep, says the two sides are close to a deal on several issues, including some sick leave for temps, and a better definition of temporary work.\n\nBut one issue in particular is contentious. Metro\u2019s old contract specified that temp worker assignments were not supposed to last more than 1040 hours in a year.\n\nBut according to staffing records, last year more than 30 temps, including admissions worker Robert Olmsted, actually worked longer hours without earning regular benefits. Olmsted, for example, clocked about 1500 hours in 2012 and again in 2013.\n\nHere\u2019s how employees say it worked. In some cases, a temp like Olmsted was given multiple job titles, and told that some of the hours they worked didn\u2019t count toward the 1040 limit on temp work.\n\nFor example, when employees worked in the aviary, handing out nectar to visitors to feed lorikeets, their job classification changed. Their work here did not count toward the 1040 cap.\n\nAskin says the union is investigating the problem and may file a complaint with the state Labor Relations Board.\n\n\u201cMetro is skirting the contract. This is not a legitimate practice in our eyes,\u201d Askin says.\n\nMetro Spokesman Jim Middaugh confirmed that in some cases, the zoo gave temp workers multiple job titles.\n\n\u201cCertainly some temporary employees have worked more than 1040 hours, and we discovered that, and we discovered that and have been working with the union to try to make sure we adhere to the existing contract,\u201d Middaugh says.\n\nMiddaugh says Metro has improved the way it tracks employees\u2019 hours, to comply with both its union contract and with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMiddaugh says the zoo plans to offer some employees regular jobs with benefits, but he won\u2019t say how many.\n\nAnd Middaugh is clear that the zoo isn\u2019t planning to do that for all the temps who were misclassified last year. Others will see their hours cut to comply with the 1040 limit.\n\nOlmsted doesn\u2019t know what will happen to him. If he remains a temp under the newly-enforced rules, that would mean losing almost 400 hours of work.\n\n\u201cFour hundred hours lost is a lot of lost pay. I will have to go find another job, there\u2019s no way around that,\u201d Olmsted says.\n\nOlmsted loves the zoo, and doesn\u2019t plan on leaving even if his hours are cut, but he\u2019s already started looking for a second job at a grocery store.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Amelia Templeton", "og": {"url": "http://www.opb.org/news/article/metro-pushing-the-limits-with-temporary-workers-at-oregon-zoo/", "image": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,g_north_west,h_300,q_90,w_400/081314_RobertOlmsted_vzrhkg.jpg", "description": "When you visit the Oregon Zoo, many of the people you interact with, from the woman who takes your ticket to the man who sprinkles the sugar on your elephant ear, are temporary workers.", "title": "Metro Pushing The Limits With 'Temporary' Workers At Oregon Zoo"}, "twitter": {"description": "<p>When you visit the Oregon Zoo, many of the people you interact with, from the woman who takes your ticket to the man who sprinkles the sugar on your elephant ear, are temporary workers.</p>", "title": "Metro Pushing The Limits With 'Temporary' Workers At Oregon Zoo", "image": {"src": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,g_north_west,h_348,q_90,w_620/081314_RobertOlmsted_vzrhkg.jpg"}, "creator": "@OPB", "site": "@OPB", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "org_id": "OPB", "fb": {"pages": 17790154938}, "google-site-verification": "KMaJ_LFRGDv_xknYuKImf3uF3H8gkUuIblN-HIVIjAM", "sniply-options": "block", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Olmstead is not alone; the zoo employs several hundred temporary workers, and many have returned to work there year after year.\nMetro Spokesman Jim Middaugh confirmed that in some cases, the zoo gave temp workers multiple job titles.\n\u201cMetro is heavily relying on what they call temporary workers right now,\u201d according to Erika Askin, with the Laborers International Union of North America Local 483.\nShe\u2019s concerned that over the years, the zoo has relied more and more on temp workers.\nWhen you visit the Oregon Zoo, many of the people you interact with, from the woman who takes your ticket to the man who sprinkles the sugar on your elephant ear, are temporary workers."}
