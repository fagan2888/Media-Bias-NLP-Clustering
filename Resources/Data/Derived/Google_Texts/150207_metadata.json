He was left out by former coach Raymond Domenech for the 2010 World Cup.\n\nAt 26 years old, the Real Madrid striker should be approaching his peak, yet still needs to be more ruthless.\n\nHis ratio of 19 goals in 65 international matches is average, and he went 15 matches without a France goal before losing his place to Olivier Giroud.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to last 10 years,\u201d Benzema said dismissively last October, referring to his ongoing drought. But France coach Didier Deschamps responded by dropping him for three straight games and Benzema certainly seems more focused now. After all, he\u2019s also played under Carlo Ancelotti and his predecessor Jose Mourinho at Madrid, and both have urged him to work harder.\n\nThings may have come too easily for Benzema, who on Saturday helped Real Madrid win the Champions League.\n\nHe was thrust into the spotlight after breaking into the Lyon team as a 17-year-old and scored over 30 goals three years later. He won the European Championship at Under-17 level with France in 2004, and was one of the so-called \u201cGeneration 87\u201d - a group of promising youths born in 1987 that included Hatem Ben Arfa, Samir Nasri and Jeremy Menez.\n\nThe presumption was that they would follow in the footsteps of Zinedine Zidane\u2019s golden generation. Ben Arfa, Menez and Nasri have drifted away from the national team and only Benzema is going to Brazil.\n\nBenzema has close control, dribbling, passing, a deft touch and a powerful shot, is strong, fairly quick and decent in the air. Yet there are doubts whether he\u2019s hungry enough to be an out-and-out scorer, since he has never scored a hat trick for France or in 159 league games for Madrid - strange given the creative players he plays alongside.\n\nFrance needs him to score more regularly because Ribery is a winger and Giroud is not a great finisher.\n\nBenzema scored 14 goals in 17 games during his best club spell this season, between January and March, even outshining Cristiano Ronaldo with two goals in the 4-3 defeat to bitter rival Barcelona. However, those were his last league goals for the club and he has managed to score only one since - the winner in the first-leg victory against Bayern Munich in their Champions League semifinal.\n\nHowever, he played a crucial part in the 4-0 second-leg win with his outstanding link-up play, and his ability to drop deep and release teammates with pinpoint first-time passes helps Madrid\u2019s laser-fast counterattacks.\n\nThis was evident when he set up Angel Di Maria for the opening goal in the 2-1 Copa Del Ray final win against Barcelona. The problem for France is that if Benzema turns provider, then who will score given that France plays with only one center forward? He wants to be constantly involved in play and sometimes drifts about. At Euro 2012, that unbalanced the team, leaving it with no focal point in attack.\n\nHowever, the defenses he faced at Euro 2012 - England, Ukraine, Sweden and Spain - were tighter than the ones he\u2019ll encounter next month.\n\nThe Swiss are usually tough to break down, but Benzema must plunder goals against Honduras and Ecuador.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is Karim Benzema's chance to finally shine on the world stage for France - and it's about time.", "Author": "JEROME PUGMIRE", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "This is Karim Benzema\u2019s chance to finally shine on the world stage for France - and it\u2019s about time.", "title": "France\u2019s Benzema must finally shine on big stage", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/26/frances-benzema-must-finally-shine-on-big-stage/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/26/b5bef4014bf81e14550f6a706700022a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/26/b5bef4014bf81e14550f6a706700022a.jpg", "title": "France\u2019s Benzema must finally shine on big stage", "description": "This is Karim Benzema's chance to finally shine on the world stage for France - and it's about time.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Karim Benzema, France, Madrid, Franck Rib\u00e9ry"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00da\"", "article_summary": "PARIS (AP) - This is Karim Benzema\u2019s chance to finally shine on the world stage for France - and it\u2019s about time.\nThings may have come too easily for Benzema, who on Saturday helped Real Madrid win the Champions League.\nWith winger Franck Ribery\u2019s form fading somewhat in recent weeks, Benzema could become France\u2019s best attacking player at the World Cup.\nThe Swiss are usually tough to break down, but Benzema must plunder goals against Honduras and Ecuador.\nBen Arfa, Menez and Nasri have drifted away from the national team and only Benzema is going to Brazil."}
