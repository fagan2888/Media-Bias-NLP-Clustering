Why would Justice Scalia, who often opposes civil rights claims, find this case to be \u201ceasy?\u201d The answer points to an emerging trend in the Roberts Court, one that might have larger implications.\n\nIn 2008, Samantha Elauf, 17 years old and living in Tulsa, Oklahoma, applied for a sales job at an Abercrombie and Fitch store that specialized in selling children\u2019s clothes. She aced her interview but didn\u2019t get the job. Abercrombie has what\u2019s called a \u201clook policy\u201d which bans hats for all sales employees of the company. With the help of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Samantha Elauf sued the company and on Monday won, with an 8-1 ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court. In the case of EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Justice Scalia wrote the opinion for the majority, with Justice Clarence Thomas concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nThis case hinged on whether Abercrombie was required to provide Elauf accommodation for her headscarf, a religious practice, even though she didn\u2019t request such accommodation.\n\nThe 1964 Civil Rights Act \u201cprohibits a prospective employer from refusing to hire an applicant because of the applicant\u2019s religious practice when the practice could be accommodated without undue hardship.\u201d Title VII of the Act prohibits employers from refusing to hire an applicant \u201cbecause of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d Another provision specifies the word \u201creligion\u201d to include \u201call aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to\u201d a \u201creligious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d Given that, the Civil Rights Act requires that employers accommodate workers\u2019 religious beliefs in the workplace, by prohibiting them from firing, or not hiring, a person due to their religious beliefs. Abercrombie and Fitch argued that it couldn\u2019t have known to accommodate her religious beliefs, because Samantha Elauf never requested any such accommodation.\n\nEight of the nine justices did not find Abercrombie\u2019s argument compelling, and reversed an earlier appeals ruling in the retailer\u2019s favor. They found that what matters is not whether she requested any religious accommodation, but whether the manager at Abercrombie assumed that Elauf was Muslim and would regularly wear her headscarf while working at their store.\n\nIn this case, the headscarf was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in their decision not to hire. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority that\u201d[A]n employer who acts with the motive of avoiding accommodation may violate [the law] even if he has no more than an unsubstantiated suspicion that accommodation would be needed.\u201d Scalia asserted in the opinion that \u201cmotive and knowledge are separate concepts.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scalia penned a majority opinion this week in favor of a Muslim woman claiming discrimination.
