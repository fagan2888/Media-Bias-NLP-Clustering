The worst judge has to be one whose last name is Scalia, Thomas or Alito\u2014the three jurisprudential horsemen of the right-wing apocalypse unfolding term by term at the Supreme Court.\n\nTo others, the search for the worst may extend beyond the nation\u2019s highest tribunal to the lower rungs of the national judiciary.\n\nPerhaps the worst is Judge Priscilla Owen of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, who specialized in representing oil and gas industry interests as an attorney in Houston and was appointed to the federal bench by George W. Bush in 2001. Owen authored the recent 5th Circuit opinion overturning a lower court ban on a provision of the new omnibus Texas abortion law that requires doctors performing the procedure to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.\n\nOr perhaps the search should range even more widely and focus on federal District Court trial judges, such as Loretta A. Preska, the New York-based jurist who recently sentenced Anonymous-affiliated activist Jeremy Hammond to a 10-year prison term, possibly the harshest penalty ever imposed for the offense of computer hacking.\n\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide\n\nAll of the above would be excellent choices. My nominee, however, is Judge Diane S. Sykes, who sits on the 7th Circuit, which covers the states of Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin, and is headquartered in Chicago.\n\nIn a 154-page split 2-1 decision handed down Nov. 8, Sykes authored the majority opinion in which she invoked the doctrine of corporate personhood\u2014which she characterized as being \u201creinvigorated\u201d by the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision on campaign finance law\u2014to invalidate the contraception mandate of Obamacare. How she managed to do so was nothing short of an exercise in judicial fantasy rivaling the most unhinged of Antonin Scalia\u2019s rants against gay marriage, albeit without his flare for vitriol.\n\nThe Obamacare case came before Sykes as a consolidated appeal involving separate complaints filed against Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius by an Illinois construction company with 90 full-time employees and an Indiana manufacturer of safety and lighting systems operating both in this country and abroad with 464 full-time U.S. employees. The Catholic owners of both closely held businesses argued that Obamacare\u2019s mandate requiring inclusion of contraception benefits in their employee health care plans violated both the individual owners\u2019 and the companies\u2019 constitutional and statutory rights to the free exercise of religion.\n\nDespite the fact that both businesses engaged in for-profit activity, Sykes concluded, citing Citizens United, that the term \u201cperson\u201d includes corporations and as such, the businesses were \u201cpersons\u201d whose religious rights not to practice or promote birth control were protected under the Constitution and an obscure piece of legislation\u2014the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, a Clinton-era statute designed to protect religious liberty. Never mind that nothing about Obamacare forces anyone to practice birth control. Still, under Sykes\u2019 ruling, if the employees of either company wanted contraception services, they had better look elsewhere.\n\nIn a pointed dissent, Judge Ilana Rovner wrote that Sykes\u2019 opinion represented \u201can unprecedented and unwarranted re-conception of \u2026 what the free exercise of religion entails,\u201d transferring \u201ca highly personal right to a secular corporation\u201d via \u201ca man-made legal fiction.\u201d\n\nIf the Obamacare ruling had been Judge Sykes\u2019 first foray through the right-wing judicial looking glass she would hardly have made the final cut in the contest for the nation\u2019s worst judge. But the Obamacare case is only one of many.\n\nA Bush appointee to the 7th Circuit, the 56-year-old Sykes is the former spouse of Milwaukee right-wing radio personality Charlie Sykes and a prominent member of the Federalist Society. As a state judge in Milwaukee County, she presided over a 1993 case in which two protesters with long rap sheets were found guilty of blocking access to a reproductive health facility. Compelled by law to impose brief jail terms, Sykes went out of her way during sentencing to praise the defendants for having \u201cthe courage of [their] convictions and for the ultimate [anti-abortion] goals\u201d they sought to further.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "bill blum, bush, campaign, democrats, diane skyes, gop, health, health care, judiciary, justice, law, nuclear option, religion, senate, supreme court", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "Now that Senate Democrats have deployed the so-called nuclear option, the question arises: From a progressive perspective, who is the worst sitting federal judge in America today?\n - 2013/11/25", "title": "Meet the Worst Judge in America: Bill Blum", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/meet_the_worst_judge_in_america_20131125", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/worst-judge-in-america-nominee300.jpg", "height": 169}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Now that Senate Democrats have deployed the so-called nuclear option, the question arises: From a progressive perspective, who is the worst sitting federal judge in America today?", "title": "Meet the Worst Judge in America | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/meet_the_worst_judge_in_america_20131125/", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/worst-judge-in-america-nominee300.jpg", "height": 169}, "creator": "@truthdig", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, Meet the Worst Judge in America, bill blum, bush, campaign, democrats, diane skyes, gop, health, health care, judiciary, justice, law, nuclear option, religion, senate, supreme court", "article": {"tag": "bill blum, bush, campaign, democrats, diane skyes, gop, health, health care, judiciary, justice, law, nuclear option, religion, senate, supreme court", "published_time": "2013-11-25T14:24:29-08:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-05T13:42:30-08:00"}, "description": "Now that Senate Democrats have deployed the so-called nuclear option, the question arises: From a progressive perspective, who is the worst sitting federal judge in America today?\n - 2013/11/25"}, "article_summary": "The worst judge has to be one whose last name is Scalia, Thomas or Alito\u2014the three jurisprudential horsemen of the right-wing apocalypse unfolding term by term at the Supreme Court.\nPerhaps the worst is Judge Priscilla Owen of the 5th U.S.\nTo others, the search for the worst may extend beyond the nation\u2019s highest tribunal to the lower rungs of the national judiciary.\nBy Bill BlumNow that Senate Democrats have deployed the so-called nuclear option and many of the president\u2019s judicial nominations finally will move forward, the question arises: From a progressive perspective, who is the worst sitting federal judge in America today?\nOwen authored the recent 5th Circuit opinion overturning a lower court ban on a provision of the new omnibus Texas abortion law that requires doctors performing the procedure to have admitting privileges at a local hospital."}
