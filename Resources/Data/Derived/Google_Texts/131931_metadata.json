One of the most sublime among them is surely \u201cAn American in Paris,\u201d inspired by the multiple Oscar-winning 1950 musical by George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin and brilliantly choreographed by Gene Kelly.\n\nThe exuberant new musical is helmed with panache by top director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon. Gloriously inventive and balletic, it has an intriguing new book by Tony-nominee and Pulitzer Prize finalist Craig Lucas. Following a debut in Paris last year, an elegant production opened Sunday night on Broadway at the Palace Theatre.\n\nThe Gershwin brothers\u2019 music has been adapted, arranged and supervised by Rob Fisher. Beautifully orchestrated by Christopher Austin, it\u2019s performed by a large, bright orchestra led by Todd Ellison.\n\nThe mix of popular songs and symphonic music, infused with ragtime, blues and Broadway rhythms, includes favorites like \u201cI Got Rhythm,\u201d \u201dS\u2019Wonderful,\u201d \u201dI\u2019ll Build a Stairway to Paradise,\u201d and \u201cThey Can\u2019t Take That Away From Me.\u201d Some scenes are burnished with familiar orchestral numbers like \u201cSecond Rhapsody\u201d and \u201cAn American In Paris.\u201d\n\nLucas\u2019 completely reworked book adds historical context in which the French Resistance plays a role. A series of romantic entanglements unfold in 1945 Paris, just after the World War II liberation from the Nazis by American troops. The romantic hero, American soldier and artist Jerry Mulligan, is given a powerhouse personality and masterfully danced and sung in a star turn by Robert Fairchild, a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet.\n\nJerry and his new buddy, composer/pianist Adam Hochberg, (portrayed with humor and heart by Brandon Uranowitz), decide to remain in Paris for the rich artistic and cultural atmosphere they hope will return. Hochberg humorously narrates the story, in which the two friends unknowingly fall for the same woman, a mysteriously melancholy ballerina named Lise, given waifish charm by Leanne Cope. Cope, a first artist at the Royal Ballet, also displays a sweet singing voice, especially on her poignant solo, \u201cThe Man I Love.\u201d\n\nTo further the romantic complications, Lise is the intended fiancee of the buddies\u2019 wealthy friend Henri (charmingly performed by Max von Essen.) The strong supporting cast includes Jill Paice as American art patron Milo Davenport who falls for Jerry, and a comically repressed performance by Veanne Cox as Henri\u2019s mother, still clinging to wartime secrecy and fears. Some clumsy French-accented English is noticeable but doesn\u2019t detract from the show\u2019s charm.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Review: Graceful \u2018An American in Paris\u2019 has pizazz and heart", "title": "Review: Graceful \u2018An American in Paris\u2019 has pizazz and heart", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Review: Graceful \u2018An American in Paris\u2019 has pizazz and heart", "title": "Review: Graceful \u2018An American in Paris\u2019 has pizazz and heart", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/13/review_graceful_an_american_in_paris_has_pizazz_and_heart/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/theater-review-an-american-in-paris.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Review: Graceful \u2018An American in Paris\u2019 has pizazz and heart", "title": "Review: Graceful \u2018An American in Paris\u2019 has pizazz and heart", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/theater-review-an-american-in-paris.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jennifer Farrar", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A series of romantic entanglements unfold in 1945 Paris, just after the World War II liberation from the Nazis by American troops.\nOne of the most sublime among them is surely \u201cAn American in Paris,\u201d inspired by the multiple Oscar-winning 1950 musical by George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin and brilliantly choreographed by Gene Kelly.\nFollowing a debut in Paris last year, an elegant production opened Sunday night on Broadway at the Palace Theatre.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 This season on Broadway features multiple musicals that are based on iconic films.\nThe Gershwin brothers\u2019 music has been adapted, arranged and supervised by Rob Fisher."}
