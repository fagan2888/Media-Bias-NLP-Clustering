The largest share of this debt\u2014$13 trillion\u2014comes out to $41,000 for every individual living in the U.S. today.\n\nThis debt is called the public debt, which means that the government has sold this debt in credit markets to investors in the U.S. and abroad, including China, Japan and European nation countries.
