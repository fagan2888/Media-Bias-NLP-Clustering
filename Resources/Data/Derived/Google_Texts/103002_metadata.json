Most increases are in the single digits, but some plans rose by as much as 26.7 percent, according to the department\u2019s website.\n\nThe biggest impact to consumers will likely come from increases by Highmark Inc., which owns the lion\u2019s share of the marketplace and gained an even larger membership last year by underselling its rivals, said Rebecca Zastowny, a health and life insurance agent at Strickler Insurance in Lebanon. The company hiked rates in 2016 to recover from its 2015 losses.\n\nFor example, one Highmark individual plan was approved for a 20.1 percent increase after losing about $137 million last year, according to insurance department records.\n\n\u201cA lot of (new) members needed more services than we thought,\u201d said Highmark spokesman Leilyn Perri. \u201cWe asked for rate increases so the health care premiums matched what the actual (need) is.\u201d\n\nHighmark also reduced its range of plans for 2016. Strickler Insurance has been contacted by more than 100 people who received letters informing them that their plan was cancelled, Zastowny said.\n\nIn order to afford premiums this year, many people will have to choose a plan with a more restricted network or less desirable levels of coverage, she said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be willing to sacrifice something,\u201d she said.\n\nZastowny recommended individuals struggling to afford health insurance check to see if they qualify for a premium assistance tax credit.\n\nRates are also increasing for small and middle-market businesses, although those increases are less sporadic than they were last year when insurers were first adjusting plans to meet Affordable Care Act requirements, said Patrick Freer Jr., vice president of Strickler Insurance. Most plans have increased by 5 to 15 percent this year.\n\nCompanies in the 50 to 100 employee range also have an \u201cobscene\u201d amount of work to complete to prove they are complying with the law, Freer said.\n\n\"Premiums may be becoming more consistent, but the paperwork is a nightmare,\u201d he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://ldne.ws/1jbMwyA", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Most individual and small group health care plans in Pennsylvania are increasing in cost for 2016.", "og": {"site_name": "Lebanon Daily News", "description": "Most individual and small group health care plans in Pennsylvania are increasing in cost for 2016.", "title": "PA rates rise for individuals, small groups", "url": "http://www.ldnews.com/story/news/health/2015/11/20/pa-rates-rise-individuals-small-groups/75706540/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/ldnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Most individual and small group health care plans in Pennsylvania are increasing in cost for 2016.", "title": "PA rates rise for individuals, small groups", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cfda183cdf9bac494d65ffa5498b116f79748217/c=10-0-1342-1332&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/17/PAGroup/Lebanon/635833742229414774-LDN-MKD-111715-strickler-1.jpg", "creator": "@ldnews", "site": "@ldnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1033666834", "fb": {"app_id": 610255079116433}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/DanielWalmerJournalist/?fref=ts"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Strickler, Strickler Insurance, health insurance premiums, small group insurance, individual insurance, Highmark"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1bfc\"", "article_summary": "Of 38 individual and small group health Pennsylvania health care plans that existed last year and comply with AFA reforms, 30 were approved for a 2016 price hike by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.\nZastowny recommended individuals struggling to afford health insurance check to see if they qualify for a premium assistance tax credit.\n(Photo: Michael K.
