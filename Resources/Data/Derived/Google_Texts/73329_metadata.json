Bobby Jindal, a Republican who has promised his signature. The bill is modelled after similar legislation either proposed or passed in Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Alabama, where abortion rights activists say conservatives will force the closure of all but a dozen or so clinics. The proposed law would relegate abortion access in Louisiana to two clinics that are both located in Shreveport, which is about a five-hour drive from New Orleans.\n\nMost affected by the proposed law would be poor women from rural areas, says Rep. Herbert B. Dixon, a Democrat from Alexandria. \u201cThe problem I have with the bill is access, especially in the rural areas I represent.\u201d\n\nSupporters of TRAP laws say the regulation would protect women from possible harm by requiring providers to secure pre-existing relationships with area hospitals. However, abortion rights supporters such as the The Guttmacher Institute say such laws do \u201clittle, if anything\u201d to \u201cadd to long-standing patient safeguards.\u201d Effectively, the law gives hospitals \u201cveto power\u201d over abortion providers who wish to operate in a given area of the state.\n\nThough American abortion politics often follow the party line, Democratic Rep. Katrina R. Jackson told The New York Times that she and others had joined a largely bipartisan majority to pass the bill. \u201cI respect and disagree that the Supreme Court has ruled abortion constitutional,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I also respect that elected officials in Louisiana must protect the health and safety of our constituents.\u201d\n\nOther supporters such as A. Eric Johnston, a lawyer from Birmingham, downplayed the inconvenience presented to women seeking reproductive health services in the state. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse? Driving 300 miles to get an abortion from a clinic that meets a better standard of care, or going to a substandard one?\u201d he told The Times.\n\nYet the proposed law would also go further, imposing a 24-hour waiting period on women seeking either a medical or surgical abortion, according to The Times-Picayune.\n\n\"While it's been widely reported that the new measures could shutter three clinics in Baton Rouge, Metairie, and New Orleans, the clinic in Bossier City must still work to comply,\u201d the newspaper said this week.\n\nIn practical terms, women in Louisiana seeking an abortion would be compelled to make two separate trips to Shreveport, imposing a hardship on the poorest of rural residents.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "abortion access, trap laws, abortion regulations and the south, louisiana abortion, texas abortion, south and abortion", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In a new Southern strategy, Louisiana lawmakers passed a bill on Wednesday modeled after similar legislation in Texas that would require abortion providers to secure admitting privileges at a hospital within a 30-mile radius.", "title": "Abortion Rights Nearly Gone To Women In Southern States", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/abortion-rights-quickly-escaping-southern-women-centers-grow-few-and-far-between-284376", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/24/louisiana-lawmakers-pass-abortion-restriction-bill.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a new Southern strategy, Louisiana lawmakers passed a bill on Wednesday modeled after similar legislation in Texas that would require abortion providers to secure admitting privileges at a hospital within a 30-mile radius.", "title": "Abortion Rights Nearly Gone To Women In Southern States", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/abortion-rights-quickly-escaping-southern-women-centers-grow-few-and-far-between-284376", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/24/louisiana-lawmakers-pass-abortion-restriction-bill.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/24/louisiana-lawmakers-pass-abortion-restriction-bill.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-05-24T13:34:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-24T13:34:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In a new Southern strategy, Louisiana lawmakers passed a bill on Wednesday modeled after similar legislation in Texas that would require abortion providers to secure admitting privileges at a hospital within a 30-mile radius."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd51\"", "article_summary": "Most affected by the proposed law would be poor women from rural areas, says Rep.
