After Obama announced his temporary fix to the Affordable Care Act, the health insurance companies were up in arms about how this would destabilize the market and cause people's premiums to rise. Um, when was the last time the health insurance biz cared so much about raising premiums? Methinks there are other motives at work. This week's cartoon is a little reminder of health insurers' favorite refrain.

Remember during the health insurance Wild West before health care reform, when premiums were skyrocketing, not to mention loads of people getting dropped from their plans? Remember leading up to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, when premiums rose? That suddenly seems like so long ago. Remember the insurance companies complaining about rising premiums before? Me neither.

Since I am a self-employed cartoonist, I've been living in the health insurance wilderness for quite a while. My family's plan was canceled, like all those other people you've heard about lately. (Although surprisingly, nationwide only 5% of people buy insurance on the open market like me.) It turns out the plan I can buy on the exchange is way more expensive than my canceled plan, but it offers better coverage. Since I'm not holding my breath that my insurance provider will "un-cancel" me, let alone offer my previous plan at the same price, off to California Covered I go! Once I'm there, thanks to generous subsidies, my premium will be lower than before. Ah, America!
