A homicide victim’s family is suing a metro mental health facility and the city of Omaha for damages.

Man who strangled ex-girlfriend, dumped her body in... An Omaha man convicted of strangling his ex-girlfriend and leaving her body in a freshly dug grave has been sentenced. More

A judge sentenced Mikael Loyd to three decades in prison for killing Melissa Rodriguez and dumping her body at a cemetery near 42nd and L streets.

Rodriguez’s family said in a 22-page complaint that Lasting Hope Recover Center did not properly supervise Loyd, evaluate him or communicate with police.

Police had a warrant for Loyd’s arrest at the time.

The complaint, which asks for damages at trial, says Loyd left Lasting Hope on his own on Aug. 14, 2013, without being questioned, stopped or “without Lasting Hope even noticing he was gone.”

The complaint alleges Loyd came back to Lasting Hope after he killed Rodriguez and asked the facility and its employees to launder his clothes.

Omaha police and CHI Health, which runs Lasting Hope, declined to comment due to the pending litigation.
