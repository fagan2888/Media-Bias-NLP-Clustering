While the debate over religion\u2019s place in public continues, two laws in Missouri and Texas have given legal cover to celebrating Christmas in public places.\n\nThe bipartisan Missouri law enacted this year over a governor\u2019s veto protects public celebrations of Christmas by prohibiting state and local entities from banning or restricting \u201cthe practice, mention, celebration or discussion of any federal holiday\u201d on public property.\n\n\u201cFor people in the state, their rights are now protected in the public square,\u201d said the law\u2019s author, state Rep. Rick Brattin, R-Harrisonville. He told the Register that he has received an \u201coverwhelming response\u201d of thanks throughout the state for the law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been inundated by schools and a bunch of faculty signing one big thank-you letter for protecting their rights and ability to celebrate [Christmas] freely,\u201d Brattin said. \u201cI\u2019ve had only a handful of negative feedback from schools, mainly in big, urban school districts.\u201d\n\nMultiple national polls show approximately 90% of Americans celebrate Christmas. Rasmussen polls from 2011 showed 67% of Americans consider Christmas to be the country\u2019s most important holiday, 81% of Americans who celebrate Christmas observe it as a religious holiday, and 79% of Americans believe Christmas and other religious holidays should be celebrated in public schools as well.\n\nIn Texas, Gov. Rick Perry signed into law the state\u2019s own \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d bill, H.B. 308, which allows public-school students and staff to display religious scenes and symbols on school property (such as Nativity scenes, Christmas trees and menorahs) and exchange religious greetings (such as \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d or \u201cHappy Hanukkah\u201d) without fear of a lawsuit or punitive action.\n\nThe law has already had an effect: The Frisco Independent School District reversed a policy that banned references to Christmas or other religious holidays, as well as \u201cred/green or Christmas trees\u201d at an upcoming \u201cWinter Party,\u201d after state Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Little Elm, sent a letter to the school district, explaining that this interference in religious expression was now illegal in Texas.\n\n\u2018Christmas Wars\u2019\n\nBrattin said the laws like the one he authored in Missouri were necessary, because of legal threats from groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom From Religion Foundation.\n\n\u201cThese groups bully our schools around by threatening lawsuits and tying them up in courts. [Schools] don\u2019t want to spend the money to litigate, so they just take the easy way out and ban the practice of these holidays,\u201d he said. \u201cThis way, the state is now going to jump into the ring if they want to file suit.\u201d\n\nHowever, Rob Boston, communications director for Americans United, said that laws like the ones in Texas and Missouri \u201cend up being more about political posturing rather than achieving anything.\u201d He said that while some school districts have fear of litigation from groups like Americans United, the ACLU and others as \u201ca motivating factor,\u201d many others were seeking to be sensitive to the changing religious landscape in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going through a period of cultural changes, and when that happens, there will be periods of uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some parts of the country, especially in urban areas, there is a great bit of religious diversity, and it isn\u2019t safe to assume that everybody celebrates Christmas.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cChristmas Wars,\u201d as some have termed the debate over Christmas in the public square, have seen a number of notable cases this year.\n\nDefending Christmas\n\n\u201cIn 2013, we\u2019ve seen some good and some bad, and some really unfortunate attempts from atheist groups trying to silence people from celebrating Christmas and Hanukkah,\u201d said Lori Windham, senior legal counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. \u201cWe\u2019ve also seen some groups speaking out, and we\u2019re glad they\u2019re taking a stand as well.\u201d\n\nIn Rhode Island, Gov. Lincoln Chafee reversed a policy of calling the Christmas tree set up in the State Capitol a \u201choliday tree.\u201d\n\nTwo school districts in Wisconsin and New Jersey both backed off of policies that would have curtailed the use of religious music in winter public-school concerts.\n\nOne case involved a public charter school administrator in South Carolina, who hoaxed an ACLU legal complaint to ban Christmas songs at a Dec. 19 concert. The ACLU of South Carolina denied any role to local media and stated some school administrators were trying to use the ACLU as cover for their own unilateral actions banning Christmas celebrations.\n\nWindham told the Register that some atheist groups are \u201cgoing after school districts for even voluntary programs.\u201d She said two public schools shut down their voluntary association with Operation Christmas Child after getting threats from the American Humanist Association. Still, Windham said that parents and students at one school in Colorado did not back down.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018If we cannot help poor children inside the school, then we will help poor children outside the school.\u2019 So that is what they did,\u201d she said. \u201cThey sat outside the school and wrapped Christmas gifts so poor children around the world could receive those gifts.\u201d\n\nFreedom From Religion?\n\nBoston said that public schools in general have a different set of rules to play by, as opposed to other public entities, thanks to Supreme Court precedents. He suggested the Education Department guidelines set up in 2003 on prayer in public schools, which discuss impermissible governmental religious speech versus private religious expression, provide generally agreed upon principles that school administrators should consult before making policy related to Christmas. He added that consulting law firms on opposing sides of the issue could also be helpful.\n\nHe also noted that Americans United is not concerned with public displays of religion on public property when the displays are funded by private groups \u201con their own time and own dime.\u201d But they do object when governments are the sponsors of religious displays, because it is tantamount to \u201cthe state taking a side on theology.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the right conditions, even Christians want freedom from religion. I guarantee you, if a public school began to impose Islamic doctrines on children, a lot of Christians would say they want to be free from that and want their children to be free from that.\u201d\n\nAndrew Walther, vice president for media, research and development for the Knights of Columbus, stated that celebrating the birth of Christ \u201cis not an inherently sectarian idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod loved us, so we love other people. There\u2019s nothing inherently offensive about that message,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said efforts to prohibit public entities from encouraging religion in the public square \u201cmisunderstand the broad context\u201d of the American religious-liberty tradition. They also run the risk of doing what Alexander Solzhenitsyn called an \u201camputation of national memory\u201d by rooting out American religious origins and identity for a secular one.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental understanding in the United States that we have our rights not from the state, which could then take them away, but from something prior to the state \u2014 and that is God,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe fact that your rights come from God protects everyone, whether or not you believe in God.\u201d\n\nPeter Jesserer Smith is a Register staff writer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "State laws give relief to schools and parents.  \n\tJEFFERSON CITY, Mo. \u2014 People of faith seeking to\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "State laws give relief to schools and parents.", "title": "New Chapter in Battle for Christmas in the Public Square", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/new-chapter-in-battle-for-christmas-in-the-public-square/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/capitol_christmas_tree1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/new-chapter-in-battle-for-christmas-in-the-public-square/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/capitol_christmas_tree1.jpg", "description": "State laws give relief to schools and parents.", "card": "summary", "title": "New Chapter in Battle for Christmas in the Public Square"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register,", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8186\"", "article_summary": "Boston said that public schools in general have a different set of rules to play by, as opposed to other public entities, thanks to Supreme Court precedents.\nWhile the debate over religion\u2019s place in public continues, two laws in Missouri and Texas have given legal cover to celebrating Christmas in public places.\n\u2014 People of faith seeking to keep celebrations of Christmas and other religious holidays in the public square have some reason for good cheer this year.\nHe said efforts to prohibit public entities from encouraging religion in the public square \u201cmisunderstand the broad context\u201d of the American religious-liberty tradition.\n\u201cFor people in the state, their rights are now protected in the public square,\u201d said the law\u2019s author, state Rep.
