News of Robin Williams’ death broke during the taping of Conan O’Brien’s show Monday night. O’Brien informed his audience at the end of the show to an audible gasp, after which he, Andy Richter, and guest Will Arnett remembered the late comedian. O’Brien either didn’t know or didn’t mention that Williams’ death was the result of an apparent suicide.
