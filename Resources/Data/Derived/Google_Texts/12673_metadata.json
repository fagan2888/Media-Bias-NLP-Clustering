According to research published in the journal Education, ninth graders have the lowest grade point average, the most missed classes, the majority of failing grades, and more misbehavior referrals than any other high-school grade level. Ninth grade has increasingly become a \u201cbottleneck\u201d for students: A joint report from Princeton University and the Brookings Institution found \u201cin 1970, there were 3 percent fewer tenth graders than ninth graders; by 2000, that share had risen to 11 percent.\u201d \u201cMore and more of us are realizing that it\u2019s the make or break year for many 14- and 15-year-olds,\u201d says Jon Zaff, director of the Center for Promise at Tufts University. \u201cIt\u2019s a time when the cognitive, emotional, and physical are all coming together. The schools are likely new environments, and the students have more autonomy and more homework.\u201d\n\nNot only are youths entering the intimidating institution that is high school, they are experiencing the usual adolescent angst and depending on poor decision-making skills. \u201cStudents entering high school\u2014just at the time brains are in flux\u2014still have the propensity to be impulsive and are prone to making mistakes,\u201d says Washington D.C. psychoanalyst Dr. Linda Stern. \u201cThey are therefore experimental and trying to separate and might try substances that interfere with the normal developmental process. Put all that together with raging hormones, the normal academic pressures, and meeting a whole new group to be judged by.\u201d Related Story Do American Schools Need to Change? Depends What You Compare Them To When kids fall behind and have to repeat a grade, they can wind up in a vicious cycle of peer judgment and low self-esteem. \u201cWe are ending up with something now called the ninth-grade bulge,\u201d explains Zaff, \u201cwhich means a glut of students who have to repeat the grade. So they are stigmatized socially as well as academically, which can also lead to their finding it easier to just give up.\u201d While she doesn't deny that the ninth grade is a pivotal moment in a student\u2019s education , Diane Ravitch, author of Reign of Error, has her suspicions about the motivations behind schools\u2019 growing interest in ninth-grade performance. \"Many schools allow students to advance ready or not, and when they reach the ninth the stakes are higher. The high-stakes testing starts in the tenth grade so kids are being held back not for their own sake but to protect their school\u2019s statistics. If the focus were really on the students, people would be thinking creatively about how to help them instead of thinking if them as data points.\" *** Educators are honing in on three indicators\u2014attendance, behavior, and course performance\u2014that are believed to be the most accurate measurements of a student\u2019s likelihood to either quit school or move on. A lengthy, detailed guide from the National High School Center states that \u201cmore students fail ninth grade than any other grade in high school, and a disproportionate number of students who are held back in ninth grade subsequently drop out.\u201d The guide describes telltale signs that can be detected as early as the first semester of the first year in high school: The biggest risk factor for failing ninth, for example, is the number of absences during the first 30 days. Missing more than 10 percent is cause for concern. In addition, first-year high-school students are classified as \u2018on track\u2019 if they earn at least five full year course credits, and have received no more than one F per semester. So to be \u2018off track\u2019?
