The battalion is based in San Miguel Ixtapan in the remote southwestern part of the state, about an hour\u2019s drive north of where the killings happened.\n\nThe area is said to be controlled by La Familia cartel, though it is also land where rival drug gangs have been fighting for territory.\n\nThe battalion was in the news last December when members shot four employees of the town of Arcelia in nearby Guerrero state, including the director and deputy director of municipal transportation, as they drove on a rural road returning from a shooting range. Arcelia is also the hometown of several of those killed in the June shootout. The army said the employees, who were carrying rifles and dressed in hunting camouflage, were mistaken for criminals. A sergeant, a corporal and two soldiers were arrested.\n\nThe 102nd was also in the spotlight in February 2012. Citing legal documents, the newspaper Reforma reported that throughout 2010 and into early 2011, soldiers in the battalion took money to inform La Familia of their operations. Six people, including two officers, were charged.\n\nThe latest incident was initially reported as a firefight on June 30 in which 22 suspected criminals were killed and one soldier was wounded. The official version came into question when The Associated Press visited the scene days later and found no signs of a prolonged battle.\n\nLast week, a woman who says she witnessed the events told the AP that only one person died in an initial gunbattle and that the rest were shot after surrendering. The witness said the dead included her 15-year-old daughter, Erika Gomez Gonzalez, who had been wounded in the leg and was lying on the ground when she was killed.\n\nThe newspaper La Jornada published photos Friday showing bloody bodies, purportedly in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, with investigators and military personnel still at the scene.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Army unit in Mexico killings has past controversy", "author": "Peter Orsi and Katherine Corcoran", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Army unit in Mexico killings has past controversy", "title": "Army unit in Mexico killings has past controversy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/27/army_unit_in_mexico_killings_has_past_controversy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/mexico-army-slayings.jpeg8-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Army unit in Mexico killings has past controversy", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/mexico-army-slayings.jpeg8-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Army unit in Mexico killings has past controversy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Army unit in Mexico killings has past controversy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddaeb\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 An army officer and seven soldiers who face disciplinary action for their participation in the killing of 22 people in rural southern Mexico belong to an army battalion with a history of incidents.\nThe army said the employees, who were carrying rifles and dressed in hunting camouflage, were mistaken for criminals.\nThe battalion is based in San Miguel Ixtapan in the remote southwestern part of the state, about an hour\u2019s drive north of where the killings happened.\nThe area is said to be controlled by La Familia cartel, though it is also land where rival drug gangs have been fighting for territory.\nThe latest incident was initially reported as a firefight on June 30 in which 22 suspected criminals were killed and one soldier was wounded."}
