Begich is poison for Murkowski if she is considering re-election in 2016. He knows that. She might as well have scabies as repeatedly be compared to him. Murkowski unabashedly -- and pointedly, even by Washington standards -- makes no bones that she wants Begich to buzz off, that they are not BFFs, not even short-term chums. Her camp says he takes credit for things he has not done, that he follows her lead only for his own political benefit. Murkowski does not just want him to back off, she wants him defeated in November. It has turned personal.
