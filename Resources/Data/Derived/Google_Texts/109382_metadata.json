Missing that meant they would not be covered at Y-NNH as part of the in-patient network.\n\nThat decision on Y-NHH came after patients had already enrolled, when talks between the hospital and United Healthcare over Medicaid Advantage payments had failed to reach an agreement.\n\nTo his surprise, Wolfson this month found his name and five of his colleagues listed in the 2015 directory of practicioners published by United Healthcare for persons looking to join in the open enrollment period which extends until Dec. 7 next month.\n\nNeither Wolfson, nor Drs. Eric Grubman, Nathan Kruger, Christopher Loscalzo, Stephen Possick and Daniel Price, are in the network as part of the Yale Medical Group, essentially faculty members at Y-NNH, but they continue to be listed in the 830-page directory.\n\nWolfson said another physician retired a year ago and is also incorrectly listed.\n\nThe Connecticut Medical Society expects to notify its members to check on the accurary of the listings for insurance coverage as bad information can hurt their patients as they enroll in plans in the next few weeks.\n\nWolfson said all the addresses and phone numbers for the six doctors incorrectly listed are also wrong.\n\n\u201cOne is listed for his former address more than three years ago in Waterbury. One is listed for an office in Hamden that we closed more than a year ago. They would have done better downloading the current phone book. ... it does not serve patients well,\u201d Wolfson said.\n\nUnited Healthcare trimmed its Medicare Advantage networks in at least 10 states with notification going out in October 2013 and effective Feb. 1, 2014. The physicians were told it had nothing to do with quality.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act made cuts to Medicare Advantage plans of about $156 billion to bring its costs in line with traditional Medicare.\n\nIntervention on behalf of the Connecticut patients by the state\u2019s congressional delegation last year failed to change the situation with Yale-New Haven Hospital, the termination of the physicians and confusing information to patients, Wolfson said\n\nYale-New Haven Hospital continues to be not be included in the Medicare Advantage plans offered by United Healthcare.\n\nMatthew C. Katz, CEO of the Connecticut State Medical Society, said \u201cthere is no excuse for having incorrect information about the group, wrong sites of care and the fact that they are in the network when they are not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt raises a lot of questions about the transparency of their networks and the veracity of updating and maintaining their networks. If this is not an issue of bait and switch, it is defintely an issue of lack of monitoring and just basic principles of updating a directory that patients rely on every day,\u201d Katz said.\n\nThe medical society director said bad information is also a problem on a daily basis for physicians who need to refer patients to other specialists.\n\nThe Medicare Advantage plans continue to be offered through AARP.\n\nKatz said Wolfson\u2019s group is one of the largest cardiac care practices in Greater New Haven. Given that cardiac issues are one of the biggest areas of care for seniors, incorrect information on providers for plans tied to AARP is worrisome.\n\nHe said the provider networks are also not readily available on multiple websites that sell United Healthcare Medicare Advantage.\n\nMaria Gordon Shydlo, public relations director for United Healthcare, said they were looking into the issue.\n\n\u201cWe do remain committed to working with health care providers, hospitals and other facilities to improve the accuracy of care provider directories and to help ensure individuals have the most up-to-date information possible,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nIn a voice mail, Gordon Shydlo said two of the physicians in question appeared to also be part of a group that was covered by a Medicaid Advantage plan and they were going to check further on that.\n\n\u201cWe are looking into the broader issue of how the doctors are showing themselves online so that we can just make sure we have all the up-to-date information,\u201d she said.\n\nPossick is listed on one website as belonging to the Northeast Medical Group, which is covered by Medicaid Advantage.\n\nWolfson said Possick did stress tests and echocardiograms for one of the NEMG groups in the past, but not now.\n\nThe doctors in question all appear to take United Healthcare insurance, among others, that is offered in the commercial network outside of Medicare Advantage.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, New Haven news, CT news, US news, world news.", "title": "United Healthcare\u2019s incorrect doctor listings causing confusion for Greater New Haven patients", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20141122/NEWS/141129817", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.nhregister.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/nhregister.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "United Healthcare\u2019s incorrect doctor listings causing confusion for Greater New Haven patients"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "NEW HAVEN >> Almost one year ago, the 1,200 practitioners in the Yale Medical Group, were kicked out of United Healthcare\u2019s Medicare Advantage network, which was later followed by elimination of Yale-New Haven Hospital as an option for th", "title": "United Healthcare\u2019s incorrect doctor listings causing confusion for Greater New Haven patients", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20141122/NEWS/141129817", "image": {"src": "http://local.nhregister.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/nhregister.png?052016"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "News, New Haven news, CT news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "NEW HAVEN >> Almost one year ago, the 1,200 practitioners in the Yale Medical Group, were kicked out of United Healthcare\u2019s Medicare Advantage network, which was later followed by elimination of Yale-New Haven Hospital as an option for th"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe10e4\"", "article_summary": "He said the provider networks are also not readily available on multiple websites that sell United Healthcare Medicare Advantage.\nMaria Gordon Shydlo, public relations director for United Healthcare, said they were looking into the issue.\nThe doctors in question all appear to take United Healthcare insurance, among others, that is offered in the commercial network outside of Medicare Advantage.\nUnited Healthcare trimmed its Medicare Advantage networks in at least 10 states with notification going out in October 2013 and effective Feb. 1, 2014.\nPossick is listed on one website as belonging to the Northeast Medical Group, which is covered by Medicaid Advantage."}
