With their shared kinship and clever skits, it\u2019s no wonder why the comedic pair takes charge of the stage, bringing on the hilarity every year.\n\nAs the 49th Annual CMA Awards approach, we can all breathe a sigh of relief knowing that the dynamic duo will, once again, grace the stage. Their comedic energies feed our TV screens with quirky little ditties, \u201cCountry Music\u2019s Biggest Night\u201d, and now, it\u2019s time to reflect on some noteworthy moments by Brad and Carrie.\n\nHere are eight memorable Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood CMA Awards moments.\n\n8. Paying Tribute to Hank Jr. While Mocking the NFL, 2011\n\n2011 marked the end of Hank Williams Jr.\u2018s long tenure with ESPN and \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d after he went public with commentary regarding Hitler and President Obama.\n\nPaisley and Underwood took this moment to recognize some of Williams Jr.\u2019s most iconic song\u2019s including, \u201cAll My Rowdy Friends\u201d and \u201cFamily Tradition\u201d, but it was the southern rocker\u2019s unexpected appearance that made for an unforgettable night.\n\n7. Uncontrollably Dancing to PSY\u2019s \u2018Gangnam Style\u2019, 2012\n\nLet\u2019s face it, when the song first came out, none of us knew what the words to \u201cGangnam Style\u201d even meant. We can all agree, however, that the dance was really addictive, and we just couldn\u2019t get that catchy beat out of our heads. Even Paisley and Underwood had difficulty avoiding the K-pop style number.\n\nAs the saying goes, If you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em, and in this skit you can see how Paisley throws on the sunglasses to let the inevitable happen, while Underwood tries to fight it. Seriously though, has there been a more epic, countrified version of this dance since?\n\n6. Tim McGraw and Faith Hill Barbie Dolls, 2011\n\nFor older women who have outgrown their childhood toys, Paisley and Underwood took the nostalgia up a notch when they gifted each other Barbies, but not just any Barbies: Faith Hill and Tim McGraw Barbie dolls.\n\nOkay, so it\u2019s not that big of a shocker that the McGraw power couple comes in doll-form. After all, they\u2019re pretty much perfect humans, but the fact that the co-hosts began to play with the figurines in front of a live audience is priceless.\n\n5. Feeling Hot Instead of \u201cBlue\u201d, 2009\n\nRemember when Swine Flu, otherwise known as the H1N1 virus, first appeared in the U.S.? Well, we\u2019re not entirely sure if Underwood had it during the 2009 CMA Awards, or even sure whether or not the \u201cSmoke Break\u201d singer was even sick, but when Paisley checked Underwood\u2019s forehead and told her she was \u2018hot\u2019, it seemed to be that there was only one cure to make that \u2018hotness\u2019 go away.\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t more cowbell. It was singing a song about the illness along to the melody of LeAnn Rimes\u2018 \u201cBlue.\u201d\n\n4. When Miss Piggy Tried to Nab Carrie\u2019s Co-Host Gig, 2011\n\nAnyone who is anyone knows Miss Piggy is quite the diva. The Muppet star took to the 2011 CMA Awards in a vulgar attempt to steal Underwood\u2019s co-hosting spot by locking the American Idol winner in her dressing room.\n\nUnfortunately for Miss Piggy, her blond locks and glittery dress didn\u2019t match up to Underwood\u2019s natural beauty and kind heart. Sorry, Miss Piggy.\n\n3. Ramblin\u2019 About Lady Gaga, Not Lady Antebellum, 2010\n\nLuckily for Paisley, he can always count on Underwood to bail him out of just about any silly mistake he ends up making at the CMA Awards, especially when he\u2019s paying tribute to an artist such as Lady Antebellum through song.\n\nIn 2010, the \u201cCrushin\u2019 It\u201d singer jokingly confused Lady A with Lady Gaga by playing short snippets of \u201cPaparazzi\u201d and \u201cAlejandro\u201d. Sure, both artists have the word Lady attached to their name, but c\u2019mon Brad, you could\u2019ve googled that one.\n\n2. The Obamacare Technology Blunder, 2013\n\nIn 2013, Paisley and Underwood mocked America\u2019s Government Health Care system. Paisley jokingly used the term \u2018twerking\u2019 in order to describe his back problems. In an effort to help Paisley get signed up for healthcare through the Obamacare enrollment website, Underwood whips out her trusty laptop and begins to punch in a few keys only to realize that signing up takes forever.\n\nThis leads to, of course, the two breaking into song \u2014 their version of George Strait\u2018s Amarillo By Morning\u201d. Needless to say, the skit was a hit with the audience.\n\n1. Postpartum Taylor Swift Disorder (PPTSD), 2014\n\nLast year, Paisley and Underwood poked fun at Taylor Swift when they acknowledged that the country star, who recently went pop, gave up her seat at the CMA Awards. This led to the co-hosts saying that we\u2019ve all been hit by Postpartum Taylor Swift Disorder.\n\nMaking light of the conversation, Paisley joked with Underwood by saying that he knew first-hand that President Obama did not care about the issue.\n\nThe 49th Annual CMA Awards will air live from Nashville\u2019s Bridgestone Arena on Nov. 4 (8-11 PM/ET) on ABC.\n\nNext: Watch Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood Hilariously \u2018Prep\u2019 for the 49th CMA Awards", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.post_normal": "http://cdn0.wideopencountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CMACarrieBrad.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Melinda Lorge", "sailthru.post_large_tablet": "http://cdn0.wideopencountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CMACarrieBrad.jpg", "sailthru.post_normal_tablet": "http://cdn0.wideopencountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CMACarrieBrad.jpg", "twitter": {"description": "These hilarious Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood moments at the CMA Awards will have you wondering why they don't already have their own comedy show.", "title": "8 Memorable Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood CMA Awards Moments", "image": "http://cdn0.wideopencountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CMACarrieBrad.jpg", "creator": "@wideopencountry", "site": "@wideopencountry", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.post_large_mobile": "http://cdn0.wideopencountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CMACarrieBrad.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "entertainment,tag-brad-paisley,tag-carrie-underwood,tag-cma-awards,section-entertainment,wideopencountry", "news_keywords": "carrie underwood, brad paisley, cma awards", "sailthru.author_url": "http://www.wideopencountry.com/author/melinda-lorge/", "sailthru.top_category": "Entertainment", "sailthru.small_image": "http://cdn0.wideopencountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CMACarrieBrad.jpg", "sailthru.title": "8 Memorable Brad and Carrie CMA Awards Moments", "sailthru.post_large": "http://cdn0.wideopencountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CMACarrieBrad.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn0.wideopencountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CMACarrieBrad-385x207.jpg", "description": "These hilarious Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood moments at the CMA Awards will have you wondering why they don't already have their own comedy show.", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-11-04T08:30:59-05:00", "sailthru.large_image": "http://cdn0.wideopencountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CMACarrieBrad.jpg", "fb": {"pages": 869926553032594, "app_id": 928962943802310}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WOCountry", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "CMA Awards", "published_time": "2015-11-04T08:30:59-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-04T08:09:19-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "pubexchange": {"image": "https://i0.wp.com/cdn0.wideopencountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CMACarrieBrad-300x198.jpg?w=300", "title": "8 Memorable Brad and Carrie CMA Awards Moments"}, "og": {"site_name": "Wide Open Country", "description": "These hilarious Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood moments at the CMA Awards will have you wondering why they don't already have their own comedy show.", "title": "8 Memorable Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood CMA Awards Moments", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 798, "identifier": "http://cdn0.wideopencountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CMACarrieBrad.jpg", "height": 526}, "updated_time": "2015-11-04T08:09:19-05:00", "url": "http://www.wideopencountry.com/8-memorable-brad-paisley-carrie-underwood-cma-awards-moments/", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.top_category_url": "http://www.wideopencountry.com/category/entertainment/", "sailthru.post_normal_mobile": "http://cdn0.wideopencountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CMACarrieBrad.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Here are eight memorable Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood CMA Awards moments.\nEver since the CMA Awards co-hosting duties went to Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood in 2008, their monologues just keep getting stronger.\nNext: Watch Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood Hilariously \u2018Prep\u2019 for the 49th CMA Awards\nThe 49th Annual CMA Awards will air live from Nashville\u2019s Bridgestone Arena on Nov. 4 (8-11 PM/ET) on ABC.\nAs the 49th Annual CMA Awards approach, we can all breathe a sigh of relief knowing that the dynamic duo will, once again, grace the stage."}
