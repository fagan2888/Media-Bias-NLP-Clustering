If you otherwise qualify for the credit based on household income, but purchased your health insurance directly from an insurance provider, you are out of luck \u2013 you are not eligible for the credit.\n\nWhen applying for coverage through the Obamacare Marketplace, you estimated your household income for the year to see if you qualified for a credit. If you did, you had the option of receiving an \u201cadvance payment\u201d of the credit to apply against your monthly premiums, reducing your monthly \u201cout of pocket.\u201d\n\nIf you received advance payment of the credit during the year, when you file your 2014 tax return, you must reconcile the advance payments based on your estimated household income to the credit amount to which you are entitled based on your actual 2014 household income.\n\nYou calculate the Premium Tax Credit on new IRS Form 8962. If the advance payments received are more than the actual credit you are entitled to, you must pay back the excess on Line 46 of the 2014 Form 1040 or Line 29 of Form 1040A. If the credit determined on Form 8962 is more than the advance payments received during the year, you can claim the additional amount on Line 69 of Form 1040 or Line 45 of Form 1040A. The additional credit amount is refundable.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "A major change to the 2014 Form 1040 resulting from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) \u2013 aka Obamacare \u2013 is the new refundable Premium Tax Credit.", "author": "Robert Flach", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "A major change to the 2014 Form 1040 resulting from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) \u2013 aka Obamacare \u2013 is the new refundable Premium Tax Credit.", "title": "How Does Obamacare Affect My Tax Return?
