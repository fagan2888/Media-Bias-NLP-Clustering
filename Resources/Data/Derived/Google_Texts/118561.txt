No matter what happens Sunday night, Michael Keaton was a winner this weekend.

The Pittsburgh native was named best male lead at the 30th Film Independent Spirit Awards where “Birdman,” the movie in which he stars, took best feature. In a sign of what could come at the Oscars, Richard Linklater was named best director for “Boyhood.” The honors were handed out at a ceremony held under a tent at Santa Monica Beach.

Julianne Moore won best female lead for “Still Alice” while Patricia Arquette from “Boyhood” and J.K. Simmons, “Whiplash,” continued to sweep in the supporting categories. Those three are considered locks for the Oscars while Mr. Keaton is in a nail-biter with Eddie Redmayne from “The Theory of Everything,” who was not competing for the Indie Spirit Award.

“Foxcatcher,” shot largely in Western Pennsylvania, received the Special Distinction Award for its “uniqueness of vision, honesty of direction and screenwriting, superb acting and overall filmmaking achievement.” It was given to director/producer Bennett Miller, producers Anthony Bregman, Megan Ellison, Jon Kilik, and writers E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman, along with actors Steve Carell, Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum.
