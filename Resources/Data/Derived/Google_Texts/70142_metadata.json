Marco Rubio, R-Fla., for instance, wants a robust anti-Russian response, including U.S. and other members of NATO extending economic and military assistance to Ukraine's transitional government. Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark, who hopes to defeat Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, went even further than Rubio. He accused Obama of \"trembling inaction\" and likened Putin's move to Adolf Hitler's annexation of Austria or Anschluss and called for maximum economic pressure to be applied on Russia.\n\nBy contrast, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky, true to his libertarian, non-interventionist roots, warned U.S. policymakers even before Russia's involvement in Ukraine against upsetting the Russian bear. A statement he issued Friday reminded Russia of the negative economic consequences it would incur. Indeed, it read like something that could've been written by an officer on the State Department's Russia desk in its use of careful and non-threatening diplomatic language.\n\nWhile the usually well-defined partisan split isn't there this time, there is still partisanship to be found. In the same vein as Cotton's Anschluss comment, conservatives have likened Obama to President Jimmy Carter during the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, for instance. Sen. John McCain has called Obama \"naive\" about Putin.\n\nThat would be the same McCain, however, who joined a bipartisan group of Senate Foreign Relations Committee members that issued a letter of support for the Obama administration's efforts to raise economic pressure against Russia. The letter was clearly intended to strengthen the president's hand at a critical moment in his dealings with Putin.\n\nIn an interesting way, the international crises that have erupted on Obama's watch \u2014 Syria, Libya, Egypt among them \u2014 have tended to cause a diversion, if only temporarily from the unified messaging of both parties.\n\nPolitics may not stop at the waters edge (if it ever did), but it does get more complicated.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "Politics may not stop at the waters edge (if it ever did).
