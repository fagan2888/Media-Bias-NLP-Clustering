However, Truex is only one point behind Kevin Harvick, Jeff Gordon and Brad Keselowski, who are tied for fifth.\n\n\u201cNot a good day,\u201d Truex said on his radio while pulling off the track as Joey Logano drove to victory circle.\n\nLater, Truex added: \u201cThis Chase format is tough, real tough. It will be a battle next week in Talladega.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s race in Talladega, Ala., will conclude the contender round, and four drivers will be cut.\n\nLogano has won the last two races and is the only driver to have clinched a berth in the elite eight. But he won a controversial way Sunday, spinning out leader Matt Kenseth with four laps to go.\n\nLogano, who drove into the back of Kenseth\u2019s car, breezed to the green-white-checkered finish, and Kenseth, who led a race-high 153 laps, ended 14th and fell to 12th in the playoff standings.\n\n\u201cWe just both went for the same real estate and made contact,\u201d Logano said.\n\nKenseth saw it differently: \u201cI was plenty clear, and he just decided to take us out.\u201d\n\nKenseth\u2019s crash benefited Truex, because the caution came out and Truex was the lucky dog \u2014 the first car a lap down who made up his lap. Truex started 14th on the green-white-checkered restart, but it was double-wide with lapped cars and he couldn\u2019t make up any ground.\n\nTruex started seventh and ran as high as second. But a troubling \u201cchatter\u201d \u2014 race-car vibration \u2014 zapped his confidence in turn entries and exits, particularly Turn 4.\n\nHe also was hindered by a drive-through penalty shortly after running 10th on Lap 200 of the scheduled 267-lapper. At the conclusion of his green-flag pit stop with 53 laps to go, the left rear tire got away from the tire changer and rolled outside the team\u2019s pit stall.\n\nTruex had to drive through pit lane at the 45 mph speed limit while the rest of the field was green. He fell to 20th and a lap down.\n\n\u201cWe were in good shape before the penalty,\u201d Truex said. \u201cWe fought hard on the car all day and got much better right when we got the penalty. We were fast at the end, but not enough time to get back up there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Martin Truex Jr. 15th at Kansas, must do well at Talladega to stay in Chase", "title": "Martin Truex Jr. 15th at Kansas, must do well at Talladega to stay in Chase", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/18/martin-truex-jr-15th-at-kansas-must-do-well-at-talladega-to-stay-in-chase/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151018__BN20151019_Z00_BNSP19CARNASCARp1.jpg", "height": 420}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151018__BN20151019_Z00_BNSP19CARNASCARp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-18T18:22:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T10:25:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe were in good shape before the penalty,\u201d Truex said.\nKANSAS CITY, Kan. \u2014 A rolling tire and a perplexing vibration prevented driver Martin Truex Jr. and Denver-based Furniture Row Racing from a top-10 result Sunday in the Hollywood Casino 400 at Kansas Speedway.\nHowever, Truex is only one point behind Kevin Harvick, Jeff Gordon and Brad Keselowski, who are tied for fifth.\n\u201cNot a good day,\u201d Truex said on his radio while pulling off the track as Joey Logano drove to victory circle.\nTruex had to drive through pit lane at the 45 mph speed limit while the rest of the field was green."}
