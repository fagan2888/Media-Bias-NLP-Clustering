They might even recommend investments with worse returns simply because they get paid to recommend those products,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is, most people don\u2019t even realize that is happening.\u201d\n\nA proposed rule by the Labor Department would dramatically alter 40-year-old regulations. Eliminating conflicts of interest by those giving retirement advice could prevent investors from losing as much as $17 billion a year that now goes to advisers and their firms in the form of \u201cbackdoor payments\u201d and \u201chidden fees,\u201d the White House said in a report released today.\n\nAARP and other consumer advocacy groups, which for years have championed stronger investor protections, applauded the move.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s world it\u2019s hard enough to save for retirement and achieve your financial goals. We don\u2019t need to make it more difficult by allowing some in the financial industry to take advantage of hardworking Americans,\u201d said AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins. \u201cAll advice should be in the best interest of the consumer. Bad advice is just wrong \u2014 period.\n\n\u201cPeople deserve investment advice based on what\u2019s truly best for them and their financial future. And AARP supports having investment professionals put consumers\u2019 interests first \u2014 ahead of their own personal gain,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\n>> AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins: Saving Our Retirement\n\nThe Labor Department is expected to submit the draft rule to the Office of Management and Budget today. The proposal later will be available to the public for comment.\n\nThe rules governing investment advice in retirement plans were established back in 1975 and haven\u2019t changed much since. The retirement landscape, though, has dramatically shifted. Forty years ago, many workers were covered by a traditional pension that made the investing decisions for them. Now, the majority of retirement savings \u2014 more than $11 trillion \u2014 are held in IRAs and 401(k)s, where the investing burden often rests on the shoulders of the worker.\n\nWhile the investment industry and consumer advocates agree that workers can benefit from financial education and advice, they part ways on how it\u2019s delivered.\n\nCurrently, registered investment advisers must act in the best interest of their clients \u2014 a standard called \u201cfiduciary duty.\u201d However, some brokers and other financial professionals advising on IRAs and workplace retirement plans need only make sure the investment is \u201csuitable\u201d based on, say, investors\u2019 ages or how much risk they can handle.\n\nAnd a suitable investment isn\u2019t necessarily the best one for you \u2014 or the least expensive. For example, a broker choosing between two mutual funds to recommend to you might select the one that pays him or her a higher commission or generates more annual fees for the firm.\n\nThe typical saver could lose more than a quarter of his or her retirement savings over 35 years from conflicted advice, the president said.\n\nAccording to a fact sheet released by the White House, the Labor Department\u2019s proposal would require brokers and other professionals to act in workers\u2019 and retirees\u2019 best interest \u2014 although they could still earn sales commissions. Also, advisers won\u2019t have to adhere to a fiduciary standard if they are only offering general financial education to workers and retirees with IRAs and workplace retirement accounts.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the Labor Department has tackled this issue. A similar proposal was made in 2010. After feedback from the industry and investor advocates, the agency withdrew its proposal to work on it some more.\n\nA lot is at stake. Both investor advocates and representatives from the industry have been making their case in the court of public opinion lately.\n\nAARP along with several other groups representing consumers and workers formed a coalition and companion website in January to urge the Labor Department to raise the standard for advice on retirement accounts. AARP has also created this action page where you can lend your voice to the debate.\n\nMeanwhile, the investment industry warned that holding it to the higher standard could actually hurt workers and retirees.\n\n\u201cThe new regulation could limit investor choice, cause inconsistencies as different regulators would apply different standards to the same retirement accounts, prohibit access to investor guidance, and raise the costs of saving for retirement,\u201d Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., president and CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, said in a statement.\n\nThe debate is far from over. Meanwhile, investors seeking professional advice with 401(k)s and IRAs need to know how their advisers are being compensated and if they have any conflicts of interest. And the best way to find out now is to ask.\n\nPhoto: Pete Marovich\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama called on\u00a0the Department of Labor today\u00a0to draw up\u00a0a rule to protect people who save\u00a0in IRAs, 401(k)s and other workplace retirement plans from hidden fees and expenses that may drain billions from their accounts.
