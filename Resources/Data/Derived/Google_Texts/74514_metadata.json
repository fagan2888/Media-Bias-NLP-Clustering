It\u2019s bigger than even I think people totally comprehend. I think the president knows there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s more important to the continued success, to any possible success he\u2019s going to have over course of the next three years \u2014 his last three years in office, and to his long term legacy. He did a lot of big things in 2009, 2010 \u2014 re-regulated Wall Street, passed the stimulus, saved the auto industry \u2014 but this was the thing that Democrats have been trying to do, unsuccessfully, for 40 years.\u201d\n\nMark Halperin on why the \u201cbig reveals\u201d in their books don\u2019t come out earlier\n\n\u201cBoth the interviews we do before election day and the ones after \u2014 and most of them are after \u2014 are done on an embargoed basis for the book. People know the book is going to come out about a year after election day, and so it does allow people to speak freely. It\u2019d be better if they were all on-the-record interviews we could use right away, but the fact is we wouldn\u2019t get the kind of information we get, the kind of inside stories that people like to read about \u2014 the dialogue, the terms of the relationship, the unvarnished reactions that people have to some of those very visible situations \u2014 if we asked people to speak in real time, knowing that it could impact the outcome of the election or be revealed in the immediate aftermath of election day.\u201d\n\nJohn Heilemann on what new media might play into the 2016 campaign\n\n\u201cMark and I have been doing this both for a couple decades each, and every successive election cycle, you\u2019ve seen something that has changed the game in terms of technology in media \u2014 so from cable television to the internet itself to blogging and then to Facebook and to Twitter. Usually though you kind of get at a hint of what that next thing will be. There was Twitter in 2008, it just wasn\u2019t very big. And so by the time it hit in 2012, you sort of could see that one coming. It\u2019s not clear what that would be in 2016, although I think probably if there was something, it would have something to do with photography. In terms of mobile communications, that\u2019s sort of where a lot of the energy is, although I don\u2019t know exactly how that would change the game in the way that Twitter did in this past cycle.\u201d\n\nBook Excerpt: \u2018Double Down\u2019\n\nBy Mark Halperin and John Heilemann\n\nBARACK OBAMA WAS BACK in Chicago and back on the campaign trail, two realms from which he had been absent for a while but which always felt like home. It was April 14, 2011, and Obama had returned to the Windy City to launch his reelection effort with a trio of fund-raisers. Ten days earlier, his people had filed the papers making his candidacy official and opened up the campaign headquarters there. Five hundred and seventy-two days later, the voters would render their judgment. To Obama, Election Day seemed eons away\u2014and just around the corner.\n\nWorking his way from two small events for high-dollar donors at fancy restaurants to a crowd of two thousand at Navy Pier, the incumbent served up the old Obama fire. He invoked the memory of the last election night in Grant Park, \u201cthe excitement in the streets, the sense of hope, the sense of possibility.\u201d He touted his achievements as \u201cthe change we still believe in.\u201d He ended the evening with a \u201cYes, we can!\u201d\n\nBut again and again, Obama cited the burdens of his station. Although he\u2019d always known that as president his plate would be full, the fullness was staggering\u2014from the economic crisis to the swine flu pandemic, the BP oil spill, and the hijacking of an American cargo ship by Somali pirates. (\u201cWho thought we were going to have to deal with pirates?\u201d) He acknowledged the frustrations of many Democrats at the fitfulness of the progress he\u2019d brought about, the compromises with Republicans. He apologized for the fact that his head wasn\u2019t fully in the reelection game. \u201cOver the next three months, six months, nine months, I\u2019m going to be a little preoccupied,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019ve got this day job that I\u2019ve got to handle.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s preoccupations at that moment were many and varied, trivial and profound. In public, he was battling with the GOP over the budget and preparing for a face-off over the federal debt ceiling. In secret, he was deliberating over an overseas special-ops raid aimed at a shadowy target who possibly, maybe, hopefully was Osama bin Laden. But the most persistent distraction Obama was facing was personified by Donald Trump, the real estate billionaire and reality show ringmaster who was flirting with making a presidential run under the banner of birtherism\u2014the crackpot conspiracy theory claiming that Obama was born in Kenya and thus was constitutionally ineligible to preside as commander in chief.\n\nObama had contended with birtherism since the previous campaign, when rumors surfaced that there was no record of his birth in Hawaii. The fringe theorists had grown distractingly shrill and increasingly insistent; after he won the nomination in June 2008, his team deemed it necessary to post his short-form birth certificate on the Web. The charge was lunacy, Obama thought. Simply mental. But it wouldn\u2019t go away. A recent New York Times poll had found that 45 percent of Republicans and 25 percent of voters overall believed he was foreign born. And with Trump serving as a human bullhorn, the faux controversy had escaped the confines of Fox News and conservative talk radio, reverberating in the mainstream media. Just that morning, before Obama departed for Chicago, ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos had asked him about it in an interview, specifically citing Trump\u2014twice.\n\nAs Obama made his fund-raising rounds that night, he avoided mentioning Trump, yet the issue remained much on his mind. What confounded him about the problem, beyond its absurdity, was that there was no ready solution. Although Trump was braying for his original long-form birth certificate, officials in Obama\u2019s home state were legally prohibited from releasing it on their own, and the president had no earthly idea where his family\u2019s copy was. All he could do was joke about the topic, as he did at his final event of the night: \u201cI grew up here in Chicago,\u201d Obama told the crowd at Navy Pier, then added awkwardly, \u201cI wasn\u2019t born here\u2014just want to be clear. I was born in Hawaii.\u201d\n\nObama was looking forward to spending the night at his house in Kenwood, on the city\u2019s South Side\u2014the redbrick Georgian Revival pile that he and Michelle and their daughters left behind when they took up residence in the White House. He arrived fairly late, after 10:00 p.m., but then stayed up even later, intrigued by some old boxes that had belonged to his late mother, Ann Dunham.\n\nDunham had died seven years earlier, but Obama hadn\u2019t sorted through all her things. Now, alone in his old house for just the third night since he\u2019d become president, he started rummaging through the boxes, digging, digging, until suddenly he found it: a small, four-paneled paper booklet the world had never seen before. On the front was an ink drawing of Kapi\u2018olani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital, in Honolulu. On the back was a picture of a Hawaiian queen. On one inside page were his name, his mother\u2019s name, and his date of birth; on the other were his infant footprints.\n\nThe next morning, Marty Nesbitt came over to have breakfast with Obama. The CEO of an airport parking-lot company, Nesbitt was part of a tiny circle of Chicago friends on whom the president relied to keep him anchored in a reality outside the Washington funhouse. The two men had bonded playing pickup basketball two decades earlier; their relationship was still firmly rooted in sports, talking smack, and all around regular-guyness. After chatting for a while at the kitchen table, Obama went upstairs and came back down, wearing a cat-who-ate-a-whole-flock-of-canaries grin, waving the booklet in the air, and then placing it in front of Nesbitt.\n\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s some funny shit,\u201d Nesbitt said, and burst out laughing.\n\nClambering into his heavily armored SUV, Obama headed back north to the InterContinental hotel, where he had an interview scheduled with the Associated Press. He pulled aside his senior adviser David Plouffe and press secretary Jay Carney, and eagerly showed them his discovery.\n\nPlouffe studied the thing, befuddled and wary: Is that the birth certificate? he thought.\n\nCarney was bewildered, too, but excited: This is the birth certificate? Awesome.\n\nObama didn\u2019t know what to think, but he flew back to Washington hoping that maybe, just maybe, he now had a stake to drive through the heart of birtherism, killing it once and for all\u2014and slaying Trump in the bargain. Striding into a meeting with his senior advisers in the Oval Office the next Monday morning, he reached into his suit pocket and whipped out the booklet, infinitely pleased with himself.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Obama announced, \u201clook what I found when I was out there!\u201d\n\nExcerpted from the book DOUBLE DOWN: Game Change 2012, by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann.
