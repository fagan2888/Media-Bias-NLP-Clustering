As we examine our tremendous progress, it is easy to believe we have \"made it.\" But have we really made it? Let's look at the facts. Women's History Month focuses on where we have been, but I find myself more focused on our future. As we examine our tremendous progress, it is easy to believe we have \"made it.\" But have we really made it? Let's look at the facts.\n\nWe can gauge most of our progress in terms of the recognition of our rights. For example, Iowa's Constitution, in its original 1857 text, stated, \"All menare, by nature, free and equal, and have certain inalienable rights -- among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.\" In 1998, the words \"and women\" were added.\n\nWe have won the right to vote. We've fought for the right to own property in our own name. After countless women have served in combat zones, we've finally won the right to hold official combat positions in the U.S. military. The Family and Medical Leave Act, Pregnancy Discrimination Act, Equal Pay Act, Title IX of the Education Amendments and the Affordable Care Act were enacted to protect women from discrimination in employment, education, housing, health care and so on.\n\nBut is our work done if women and children make up the majority of those in poverty? Is our work done if pregnant women are forced to take unpaid leave, creating unstable financial environments for their families? Is our work done if some of our sisters do not have equal access to opportunities that all should? Women have the right to vote, but we rarely have the opportunity to vote for other women. Women have the right to own property, but many are still bullied by neighbors, family and friends to give those rights up.\n\nIs our work done if women are able to escape their abusers, but then find themselves with no place to go to start over? If there are groups of women making 58 cents to what a white man makes for the same work?\n\nThere is one simple answer -- no.\n\nWe've come a long way, but we have a long way to go.\n\nWomen's History Month in March is a time to celebrate the gains we have made. Equally important is our ability to use our past successes as a catalyst for change. It is a time for all leaders -- not just female leaders -- to take steps to create equity for all.\n\nWhat is the great news about our future? Women and girls are breaking new ground every day. The big question is, where will we place our shovels next?\n\nKristen Corey is the program planner for the Iowa Department of Human Rights' Office on the Status of Women.
