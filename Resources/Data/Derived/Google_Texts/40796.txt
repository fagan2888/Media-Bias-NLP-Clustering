(HOT AIR) As Allahpundit accurately noted, we might soon come to regret enabling the world’s most powerful narcissist by handing him a selfie stick. Those who are concerned that Obama’s antics – mugging into a smudgy mirror, failing to successfully dunk a cookie into a glass of milk, and pantomiming free throw shots for no particular reason, all in the hopes of increasing the number of young Obamacare enrollees (with BuzzFeed’s complicity) – might diminish the office of the presidency have little to fear.

Allahpundit also observed that Obama sat down with comedian Zach Galifianakis at roughly the same time last year, also to increase the number of young and healthy Obamacare enrollees whose premiums will subsidize care for the unwell.

He has an established track record of engaging in puerile escapades so as to appeal to young people, whom he presumably believes to be fools. If the presidency’s stature was reduced by Obama’s larking about as part of his “new media strategy,” then that was diminution occurred long ago.
