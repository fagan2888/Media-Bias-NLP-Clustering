I know firsthand the importance of nurses not only to patients, but to their families. During the 15 years I cared for my parents, nurses made a huge difference in our lives. There\u2019s no doubt, caregiving takes a team, and so often nurses were a part of my family\u2019s team.\n\nI also know that for many of you, they\u2019re a part of your team, too. When we asked to hear about your experiences with nurses recently on our @AARPadvocates Facebook page, your response was overwhelming, and positive. The comments came pouring in:\n\nCharlie: \u201cThis country wouldn\u2019t be the same without our caring nurses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis country wouldn\u2019t be the same without our caring nurses.\u201d Winston: \u201cNurses are the basic bedrock of my healthcare.\u201d\n\n\u201cNurses are the basic bedrock of my healthcare.\u201d Cecilia: \u201cNurses are Special People they can never be replaced.\u201d\n\n\u201cNurses are Special People they can never be replaced.\u201d Genevieve: \u201cI have said it before and I will say it again.

My admiration for nurses knows no bounds. Thank you all.\u201d Robert: \u201cAwesome and made a tremendous difference in the care of all family members!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGive nurses full authority to heal\n\nBecause nurses are so important to all of us, AARP is fighting to break down the barriers that prevent nurse practitioners from using all their training and skills to care for patients. Already in 20 states, nurse practitioners can provide complete primary care services, including routine health care such as diagnosing and treating patients, managing chronic conditions, ordering lab tests, prescribing medications and performing annual exams.\n\nNurse practitioners have this authority because they have completed advanced education at the master\u2019s or doctoral level, focused on areas like primary and elder care.\n\nBreaking down these barriers could:\n\nEase a predicted shortage of primary care providers\n\nImprove patient choice\n\nExpand options for patients to receive primary care in the setting of their choice \u2014 in medical offices, at home, in community health centers and more. For family caregivers, this is especially important since their loved ones \u2014 like my mom and pop \u2014 often would be better served by receiving health care at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking down the barriers state by state\n\nWe\u2019re fighting in states across the country to make it easier to give nurses full authority to heal.\n\nThe good news: Progress is being made. Already this year, Nebraska, New Jersey and Washington have passed laws that will give nurse practitioners more authority. Additionally, bills in Colorado and Maryland have passed the state legislature and are just awaiting the governor\u2019s signature.\n\nStates to watch\n\nCalifornia: Senate Bill 323 would improve and modernize California\u2019s health care rules so that nurse practitioners could use all their skills and training to care for patients, especially older people who need to receive care at home to continue living independently \u2014 and stay out of costly nursing homes. The bill recently passed the state Senate and now moves to the Assembly for consideration. Right now, California is the only West Coast state that has not updated its health care rules when it comes to nurse practitioners.\n\nSimilar bills are being considered in other states, including: Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.\n\nSee where your state stands:\n\nFollow me on Twitter @RoamTheDomes for more news on this important issue.
