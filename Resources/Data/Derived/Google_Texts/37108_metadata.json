You can directly attribute this reduction to the change in external environment resulting from the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (or ACA), or \u201cObamacare,\u201d on March 23, 2010.\n\nSocial factors affecting hospital margins\n\nU.S. national spending on healthcare is the highest in the world\u2014both in dollar terms and also as a percentage of GDP.
