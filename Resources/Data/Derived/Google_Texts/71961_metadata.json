He had refused to provide air support to Iraqi government forces until the Iraqis got rid of their divisive sectarian prime minister.\n\nThey did. He responded.\n\nWith the support of U.S. airstrikes, Iraqi and Kurdish forces have retaken the Mosul dam. Previous strikes had relieved the siege of Mount Sinjar and helped the Kurds retake two strategic towns that had opened the road to a possible Islamic State assault on Irbil, the capital of Kurdistan.\n\nIn following through, Obama demonstrated three things: the effectiveness of even limited U.S. power, the vulnerability of the Islamic State and, crucially, his own seriousness, however tentative.\n\nThe last of these is the most important. Obama had said that there is no American military solution to the conflict. This may be true, but there is a local military solution. And that solution requires U.S. air support.\n\nIt can work. The Islamic State is overstretched. It\u2019s a thin force of perhaps 15,000 trying to control a territory four times the size of Israel. Its supply lines are not just extended but exposed and highly vulnerable to air power.\n\nStopping the Islamic State\u2019s momentum creates a major shift in psychology. Guerrilla armies thrive on a sense of inevitability. The Islamic State has grown in size, demoralized its enemies and attracted recruits from all over the world because it seemed unstoppable, a real caliphate in the making.\n\nPeople follow the strong horse over the weak horse, taught Osama bin Laden. These jihadis came out of nowhere and shocked the world by capturing Mosul, Tikrit and the approaches to Kurdistan, heretofore assumed to be impregnable.\n\nNow that\u2019s begun to be reversed.\n\nObama was slow to bring American power to bear. And slower still to arm the Kurds. But he was right to wait until Baghdad had gotten rid of Nouri al-Maliki, lest the U.S. serve as a Shiite air force. We don\u2019t know how successful Haider al-Abadi will be in forming a more national government. But Obama has for now wisely taken advantage of the Abadi opening.\n\nThe problem is that the new policy has outgrown the rationale. Our reason for returning to Iraq, explained Obama, is twofold: preventing genocide and protecting U.S. personnel.\n\nAccording to Obama\u2019s own assertions, however, the recent Kurdish/Iraqi advances have averted the threat of genocide. As for the threat to U.S. personnel at the consulate in Irbil, it too is reduced.\n\nIt was a flimsy rationale to begin with. To protect Americans in an outpost, you don\u2019t need an air war. A simple evacuation would do.\n\nBesides, what does the recapture of the Mosul dam, the most significant gain thus far, have to do with either rationale? There are no Christians or Yazidis sheltering there. Nor any American diplomats. So Obama tried this: If the dam is breached, the wall of water could swamp our embassy in Baghdad.\n\nQuite a reach. An air war to prevent flooding at an embassy 200 miles downstream? Well yes, but why not say the real reason? Everyone knows it: The dam is a priceless strategic asset, possession of which alters the balance of power in this war.\n\nAnd why not state the real objective of the U.S. air campaign? Stopping, containing, degrading the Islamic State.\n\nFor now, Obama can get away with stretching the existing rationale, but not if he is to conduct a sustained campaign. For this you must make the larger case that we simply cannot abide a growing jihadist state in the heart of the Middle East, fueled by oil, advanced weaponry and a deranged fanaticism.\n\nThese are the worst people on earth. They openly, proudly crucify enemies, enslave women and murder men en masse. These are not the usual bad guys out for land, plunder or power. These are primitive cultists who celebrate slaughter, glory in bloodlust and slit the throats of innocents as a kind of sacrament.\n\nWe have now seen what air cover for Kurdish/Iraqi boots on the ground can achieve. But for a serious rollback campaign, Obama will need public support. He has to explain the stakes and the larger strategy. His weak and passive rhetorical reaction to the beheading of American journalist James Foley was a discouragingly missed opportunity.\n\n\u201cPeople like this ultimately fail,\u201d Obama said of Foley\u2019s murderers. Perhaps. But \u201cultimately\u201d can be a long way \u2014 and thousands of dead \u2014 away. The role of a great power, as Churchill and Roosevelt understood, is to bring that day closer.\n\nCharles Krauthammer\u2019s email address is letters@charleskrauthammer.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1p3lk6p", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Islamic State openly, proudly crucifies enemies, enslaves women and murders men en masse.", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "Islamic State openly, proudly crucifies enemies, enslaves women and murders men en masse.", "title": "Stopping Islamic State, \u2018the worst people on earth\u2019", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/columnists/2014/08/23/stopping-islamic-state-worst-people-earth/14506407/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Islamic State openly, proudly crucifies enemies, enslaves women and murders men en masse.", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eebd3d0c297a73b2761b5bbdfaddddfb657ea630/c=288-0-1440-1152&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/GreenBay/2014/08/23/ap223880414044.jpg", "title": "Stopping Islamic State, \u2018the worst people on earth\u2019", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd835c\"", "article_summary": "Stopping, containing, degrading the Islamic State.\nThe Islamic State has grown in size, demoralized its enemies and attracted recruits from all over the world because it seemed unstoppable, a real caliphate in the making.\nThe Islamic State is overstretched.\nHe had refused to provide air support to Iraqi government forces until the Iraqis got rid of their divisive sectarian prime minister.\nIn following through, Obama demonstrated three things: the effectiveness of even limited U.S. power, the vulnerability of the Islamic State and, crucially, his own seriousness, however tentative."}
