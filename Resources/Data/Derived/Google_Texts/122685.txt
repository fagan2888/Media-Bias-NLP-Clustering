Seattle Mayor Ed Murray is helping the city live up to its reputation by pardoning a tofu turkey, or Tofurky, ahead of Thanksgiving.

“I, Mayor Murray, pardon Braeburn the Tofurky,” the mayor said Friday in the atrium of Seattle City Hall, according to a press release.

Braeburn the Tofurky “will live out its natural life” at the Rainier Valley Food Bank, the beneficiary of the food drive between Seattle City Council and the Mayor’s Office, the release said.

“Only in Seattle,” tweeted the Washington Secretary of State office.

“The mayor has a sense of humor,” spokesman Jason Kelly told The Seattle Times. “He wanted to do something that would attract attention.”

“He was also poking fun at himself as a public official,” he added. “Seattle has a reputation around the country for being a little bit ‘granola.’ “

The mayor’s and city council’s offices have until Dec. 12 to collect non-perishable donations. The winning team will have doughnuts delivered to them by the losing team, the press release said.

Braeburn, and its bean-curd understudy “Honeycrisp,” were reportedly named after popular Washington State apples.
