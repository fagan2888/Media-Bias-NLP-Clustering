Dean Heller, R-Nv., says the \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d contained in the Affordable Care Act is not only ugly and extremely unpopular but won\u2019t generate anywhere near the money it\u2019s supposed to.\n\nThat tax hits the so-called rich employee benefit plans with a 40 percent tax on all premium and other costs over a certain threshold.\n\nUnless it\u2019s repealed, he said he foresees public employees in Nevada losing health care, \u201cand they\u2019ll all get sent over to Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cA 40 percent excise tax is huge,\u201d Heller said. \u201cSeniors are going to get hit hard. Unions are going to get hit hard. Public employees are going to get hit hard.\u201d\n\nHe said there isn\u2019t a property on the Las Vegas Strip or business he knows of who supports the tax.\n\nThat\u2019s why Heller and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-NM, are pushing a bill that would repeal the excise tax altogether.\n\nThe tax was inserted into the ACA to help pay its costs \u2014 theoretically generating more than $80 billion a year.\n\nHeller said that isn\u2019t true: \u201cIt will maybe deliver $20 billion if nobody revises their plan. Where will that other $60 billion come from?\u201d\n\nHe added of course every \u201cCadillac\u201d plan would revise its costs and benefits downward to avoid the tax.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how the business world works,\u201d he said.\n\nHeller said public plans would be in the same boat.\n\nAmong the programs trying to deal with the tax is the Nevada Public Employee Benefits Program. Executive Officer Damon Haycock says the excise tax would hit the Nevada plan for nearly $1 million the first year (2018). He said the damage would more than double every year after that until 2022 when the projected damage would be $16.2 million.\n\nThe ACA imposes the excise tax on every dollar a plan costs over the threshold of $850 a month for an individual \u2014 both employer and employee costs as well as such things as contributions to Health Savings Accounts.\n\nHaycock said while Nevada doesn\u2019t hit that cost this year, it would by the time the law takes effect in 2018.\n\n\u201cThis is a law that\u2019s years old and doesn\u2019t go into effect until after Obama gets out of office,\u201d Heller said. \u201cHow bad is this when the president\u2019s all for it and calls it his signature law but it doesn\u2019t go into effect until after he gets out of office?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
