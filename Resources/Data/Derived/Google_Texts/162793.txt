Progress continues to be made on restoring the West River Electric power grid affected by the blizzard last week in Western South Dakota. 450 members are still without power and 800 poles are still broken.

Significant progress has been made in the last 36 hours thanks to cooperative weather.

West River has 50 staff members along with 44 linemen from other cooperative in South Dakota, Nebraska and Minnesota and 47 contractors from South Dakota and Minnesota working together to restore the rest of the services.

Pole replacement is being focused on the Enning, Wasta, and Elm Springs area as crews move through the area to the northeast.

If you know of a downed power line that hasnâ€™t been worked on yet, you are encouraged to call 393-1500 or 279-2135.
