The nearby Big Thompson River filled Davidson's offices with 18 inches of water and left behind 1-2 inches of mud. ( Craig Young )\n\nThere was nobody worshipping Sunday morning at Gateway Baptist Church.\n\nInstead, a few volunteers hosed down chairs and carpeting that were coated in mud. The church is located Taft Avenue, just three blocks south of First Street and was in the path of the destructive Colorado flood.\n\nThe parking lot of the church was completely submerged after the flooding began on Thursday. After the water receded, there remained at least 5 inches of mud, making it difficult for a crew to begin the initial cleaning process.\n\nLisa and Salvador Sanchez of Little Bear Cleaning, who volunteered their time and equipment to help remove some of the mud, said they arrived around 1 p.m. Saturday to find people from Baker Snow Removal offering to plow the parking lot.\n\nGage Gooden, 12, gathers hymnals ruined by mud from the Front Range Flood at Gateway Baptist in Loveland on Sunday, Sept. 15, 2013. ( James Garcia )\n\nLisa and her husband Salvador worked until midnight, vacuuming the carpets, trying to salvage as much of it as they could. They returned Sunday morning to continue working with the help of Chris Marolf, who lives in the neighborhood behind the church.\n\n\"There must have been 2 feet of water in here. You can see the mud line on the walls,\" Lisa said.\n\nMembers of the church started a fundraiser with a goal of $100,000 to repair the damage from the flood. Anything within 2 feet of the ground was soaked and brown.\n\nSome carpet had to be removed and the padding discarded. Electrical outlets under the stage were covered in wet mud. And a cart was filled with ruined hymnals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We've got something like 400 hymnals in this church. We saved about 10 or something,\" said Gage Gooden, 12, who was helping his parents clean the church.\n\nCleanup Begins\n\nWhen the Big Thompson was rising behind his Southeast Eighth Street business early Thursday afternoon, Scott Moore said if it was God's will that Master Craft Dental Lab would flood, he could deal with it.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, as he used a tractor to scrape several inches of glutinous mud from the parking lot, Moore still was philosophical.\n\nThe Big Thompson River pushed boats, shipping containers and a camper out of a storage yard behind Big T Auto Brokers at 850 S. Lincoln Ave. in south Loveland. Several of the 20-foot-long containers and two more boats were shoved farther downstream. When this picture was taken Sunday afternoon, the water had receded from its peak. ( Craig Young )\n\n\"God's got a lesson; I've just got to learn what it is,\" he said. \"It might be how much we've come together.\"\n\nMoore returned to his lab Friday and found equipment floating in more than a foot of water.\n\n\"It had floated all my chairs around. It was a pretty good current inside,\" he said.\n\nLater Friday, after the water had subsided, he and a crew started squeegeeing 3 inches of mud out of his 6,300-square-foot facility.\n\n\"I've had 15 of my friends who have been here for two days,\" he said Sunday afternoon.\n\nMoore told of how his employees, friends, family members and even business neighbors had labored to muck out the lab.\n\nHe also already had Elder Construction and All Phase Restoration ripping out ruined drywall and drying the building so his 24 employees could get back to work as soon as possible making dentures, crowns and bridges.\n\nTime is of the essence, Moore said. \"I can't have the mold growing. It's crucial. My goal is to start production tomorrow.\n\n\"I have to get people their teeth,\" he said.\n\n'I Couldn't Believe It'\n\nOn Sunday, Moore stopped in to help Dan Davidson, a neighbor in the office park, who was pushing mud out of his offices.\n\nDavidson owns Enterprise Technologies Inc., which repairs and sells industrial machines and parts worldwide.\n\nHis business had a waterline 18 inches high inside.\n\n\"I came in Friday morning, and I couldn't believe it,\" he said. \"I quite frankly thought I was going to dodge a bullet, but it wasn't to be.\"\n\nDavidson said he was able to put two refurbished machines up on elevated pallets Thursday, keeping them just above the water level. But a $35,000 machine on the floor nearby was ruined.\n\n\"Just in equipment and parts, I lost over $100,000,\" he said, not counting the cost of cleanup and building repairs and the rental of an office elsewhere so he can keep his business operating.\n\nDavidson said his four employees all would be pitching in Monday morning.\n\n\"I'm going to send everybody a text tonight and say, 'Tomorrow, everyone's a janitor,'\" he said.\n\nCraig Young can be reached at 635-3634 or cyoung@reporter-herald.com.
