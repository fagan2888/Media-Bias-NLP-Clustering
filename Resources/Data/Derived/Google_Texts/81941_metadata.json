The businesses are Stanley of New Orleans LLC, Scott Boswell Enterprises LLC, The Paint Factory LLC and The New World Labor Force LLC.\n\nTogether, the businesses manage and operate Stanley and, until recently, Stella! and employ about 120 people. Court papers show that the companies aim to continue operating during the Chapter 11 restructuring.\n\nStella!, Mr. Boswell\u2019s longstanding flagship restaurant, closed its doors Wednesday in what the chef and wife Tanya Boswell hailed as \u201cthe toughest decision\u201d of their lives. They said the move would allow them to renew their focus on brother restaurant Stanley \u201cin the best interest of the long-term sustainability of our company.\u201d\n\nA casual restaurant that serves breakfast all day, Stanley\u2019s menu includes items like bananas foster French toast, chicken and alligator sausage gumbo, Louisiana crawfish and gulf shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e, and homemade ice cream.\n\nIn court papers, the companies\u2019 bankruptcy attorney said despite the formal restaurant\u2019s critical acclaim and \u201cculinary success,\u201d Stella! has struggled financially.\n\n\u201cAlthough Stanley has generally been a source of positive revenues, management and economic factors made Stella! unprofitable in recent years,\u201d court papers say.\n\nThe companies\u2019 bankruptcy attorney and a representative of Mr. Boswell\u2019s companies couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Stanley was the first French Quarter restaurant to re-open after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in August 2005. And Stella! gained notoriety several years ago when a GQ writer recounted a memorable encounter there with actor Nicolas Cage, which seems fitting given the restaurants\u2019 dramatic namesake.\n\nSeparately in New Orleans restaurant bankruptcy news, the Times-Picayune reported that noted restaurateur Ralph Brennan is hoping to acquire the right to use the name \u201cBrennan\u2019s\u201d in his bid to reopen the famed French Quarter restaurant. The restaurant closed a year ago and entered bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nWrite to Jacqueline Palank at jacqueline.palank@wsj.com.
