His latest book is: \u201c The Power of RELENTLESS! \u201d Dubbed by the media as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist,\u201d Wayne is a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, international business speaker, serial entrepreneur and conservative media personality \u2013 appearing on over 5,000 interviews in the past five years. Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nMy how the mighty have fallen. I was going to report on all the lies in Obama\u2019s State of the Union last night. But it appears he\u2019s more than a pathetic liar, he\u2019s actually a thief too. Obama started out his career at the Brandenburg Gate in Germany with thousands watching. Now he plagiarizes George W. Bush\u2019s speeches? That\u2019s a pretty long fall.\n\nLarge swaths of this speech appear to have been lifted directly from Bush\u2019s 2007 State of the Union. So say Bush\u2019s speechwriter- and he should know his own words.\n\nNow from plagiarism, we move to the original lies of Obama. The question is does he believe this stuff? Obama actually reported the U.S. economy is in \u201crecovery.\u201d Bernie Madoff has nothing on this guy. In Obama\u2019s economy the food stamp rolls are growing 75 times faster than the job rolls!\n\nObama said there are 8 million new jobs. Maybe he\u2019s counting people who have stopped looking for work forever, as \u201cgetting a job?\u201d I have news for you Mr. President: They didn\u2019t get a job. They went on disability, food stamps or welfare\u2026probably all three. There are almost 100 million working-age Americans not working. That\u2019s almost exactly how many Americans are on entitlements. Coincidence?\n\nObama said the unemployment is the lowest in 5 years. Another whopper. The fact is the amount of working age Americans without a job has increased by almost 10 million in Obama\u2019s first five years as President. That means each and every year of Obama\u2019s Presidency, 2 million more Americans just disappear from the workforce. That\u2019s a neat trick. I\u2019m sure David Copperfield is impressed.\n\nObama says every business owner should give a big raise to our employees. With what? The economy is in freefall. Business is dramatically down for every business owner I know. We can\u2019t make payroll. We can no longer afford health insurance. Inflation is running rampant- our gas bills have doubled, electricity is at all-time highs. Because of you Mr. President our health insurance bills have doubled or tripled. And he wants us to give our employees a raise? We\u2019re lucky if we can keep the doors open.\n\nObama introduced some pizza parlor owner that gave his employees a raise. I don\u2019t know where you found him\u2026perhaps he\u2019s an actor you rented for the day. But I know a pizza parlor owner too. His four sons work for him. He paid $800 per month for health insurance for his family until Obamacare came along. His new bill? $2,400 per month. He\u2019s dropping all his insurance. I guess he didn\u2019t make the cut to be introduced at the State of the Union?\n\nOf course your Obamacare law helped a few people that you introduced in the audience. It wasn\u2019t easy finding them, was it? But for each person your healthcare law has helped, thousands have been hurt or ruined. They\u2019ve lost their policies, doctors, life-saving drugs, or had their cost raised to unaffordable levels, or had their deductibles raised dramatically. It wouldn\u2019t have been hard to find one of those victims. Senator Tom Coburn was sitting in the audience. He has cancer. He just lost his doctor because of Obamacare.\n\nYou said you \u201csaved\u201d the auto industry. Another whopper. You stole tens of billions of taxpayer money to save auto union pensions. It was pure theft. Anyone could \u201csave\u201d any industry by stealing billions from taxpayers and handing the money to your biggest campaign donors.\n\nObama said he is ordering Treasury to create some new savings bond IRA for working class people. Great. Where will they get the money? Will they cash in their food stamps for the savings? Even if working class Americans did have any extra money, this is just a new scheme to steal their retirement money. Now instead of throwing your Social Security money away to a program going broke, working people can give the government even more retirement money to steal. Obama will \u201cborrow\u201d it to pay more food stamps and welfare bills, and leave you with another worthless IOU.\n\nObama said that the NSA is not violating the privacy of ordinary Americans. Of course not, the NSA is only violating the rights of Republicans and leading critics of the President. The rest of you can go about your business.\n\nObama says we support Ukrainian citizens\u2019 fight for free speech. Unfortunately he doesn\u2019t support Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s right to free speech here in America. He\u2019s the conservative filmmaker who created the documentary \u201c2016: Obama\u2019s America.\u201d He was just indicted.\n\nIn Obama\u2019s America, critics are either persecuted, intimidated, or indicted.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest lie of all was Obama crooning about solar power. Spain is the green energy capital of Europe. Their whole economy is based on green energy. The result is over 27 percent unemployment, over 56 percent youth unemployment. I can\u2019t wait to replicate the Spanish economy!\n\nFinally Obama ended with a sweet tribute to an injured war vet. Obama loves and honors our vets\u2026while he purges the military of any officer that disagrees with him\u2026and cuts pensions for military vets, so he can spend more on food stamps, disability, welfare, and of course to give a billion dollars to foreign companies to build and fix the defective Obamacare web site.\n\nBut the highlight of the night was Obama getting a standing ovation from Democrats for promising to violate the Constitution; ignore checks and balances; and bypass the people, Congress, and the law of the land to pass radical and extreme parts of his agenda by Executive orders. Save that video of Democrats cheering wildly for Obama to break the law- it will make for one heck of a GOP television advertising campaign this Fall. I\u2019d be sure to show them cheering in slow motion.\n\nThis folks is the state of our union\u2026and the state of delusion and deception in Obama\u2019s America. Disgusting. Embarassing. Misleading. Criminal. And even a little plagiarism thrown in for good measure.\n\nI guess outside of the nonstop lies and fraud, Obama just didn\u2019t have any original material.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
