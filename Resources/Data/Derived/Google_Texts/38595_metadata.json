Colorado Ethics Watch in Wednesday\u2019s complaint asked the Denver Elections Division to determine if New violated finance rules for four large campaign signs he\u2019s had up in and near downtown, at parking lots owned by a supporter, since at least early February. They\u2019re blown-up versions of his yard signs.\n\nNone of them had a required printed disclosure saying \u201cPaid for by Wayne New for City Council.\u201d And New\u2019s recent finance reports don\u2019t list the full expenditures or in-kind contributions related to the creation of the signs, Ethics Watch says.\n\nNew says his campaign reimbursed supporter Buzz Geller, who co-owns Paradise Cleaners as well as the parking lots, for $417.57 in costs for the creation of the signs. He said his campaign erred in not putting the campaign disclosure on the signs themselves.\n\nHe said his mailers, door hangers and ads also have omitted the disclosure that his campaign paid for them, also by mistake.\n\n\u201cMy whole team overlooked it, which now is pretty obvious that it should have been done. It is being corrected,\u201d New wrote in an e-mail to The Denver Post.\n\nBut Ethics Watch\u2019s complaint also questions whether New should list the use of the parking lots for the signs as an in-kind contribution by Geller\u2019s Paradise Land Company, which owns the lots. New says the boards on which the signs are affixed aren\u2019t normally used for advertising, so there would be no market value.\n\nHowever, Luis Toro, Ethics Watch\u2019s director, says there may be value in using the private land regardless. The signs are much larger than an average yard sign, and similar-sized signs on Geller\u2019s parking lots have been used to promote them for redevelopment.\n\n\u201cWe think this is a real, substantive violation,\u201d Toro said.\n\nSo far, New is the only Denver municipal candidate to have been called out by Ethics Watch. New has donated to the presidential campaigns of Republicans Mitt Romney and John McCain and to the Republican National Committee. Ethics Watch has tended to challenge activities by Republicans more often than Democrats, but Toro says it was not aware of New\u2019s political leanings and didn\u2019t research them before filing the complaint.\n\nNew has come under attack in the liberal-leaning District 10 for his Republican support. He was asked by an opponent during a forum this week about his donations to the Republican candidates and about the 2016 presidential race, and New said those shouldn\u2019t matter because Denver\u2019s elections are non-partisan.\n\nPeg Perl, senior counsel for Colorado Ethics Watch, said in the group\u2019s news release Wednesday that New\u2019s transgressions were important to call out.\n\n\u201cTimely and accurate reporting of in-kind contributions and expenditures is vital to ensure Denver voters have information about the candidates running for City Council,\u201d Perl said. \u201cDenver voters also have the right to know who is paying for public communications advocating for candidates with the proper disclaimers on those advertisements.\u201d\n\nIn the May 5 election, New is running against Chris Chiari, Anna Jones, Travis Leiker and Chris Cornell Wedor for an open council seat. New is a former president of the Cherry Creek North Neighborhood Association. He\u2019s been in the race the longest of any current candidate and raised the most money through February, but others were closing the gap.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Anna Jones,Chris Chiari,Chris Cornell Wedor,Colorado Ethics Watch,Peg Perl,Travis Leiker,Wayne New", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Wayne New, who's running for City Council to represent central Denver\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds District 10, says his campaign \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdoverlooked\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd a couple campaign finance rules.", "title": "Denver council candidate admits campaign finance slip-ups", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/03/26/central-denver-council-candidate-admits-campaign-finance-slip-ups/118431/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/03/wayne-new-e1427409249925.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Wayne New, who's running for City Council to represent central Denver\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds District 10, says his campaign \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdoverlooked\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd a couple campaign finance rules.", "title": "Central Denver council candidate admits campaign finance slip-ups", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/03/26/central-denver-council-candidate-admits-campaign-finance-slip-ups/118431/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/03/wayne-new-e1427409249925.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Wayne New, who's running for City Council to represent central Denver\u2019s District 10, says his campaign \u201coverlooked\u201d a couple campaign finance rules."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad92\"", "article_summary": "Wayne New, one of five candidates running for City Council to represent central Denver\u2019s District 10, says his campaign \u201coverlooked\u201d a couple campaign finance rules by not printing disclosures on campaign signs or fully listing the spending on his finance reports.\nSo far, New is the only Denver municipal candidate to have been called out by Ethics Watch.\nUPDATED (5:50 p.m. March 26): Added more detail about the circumstances of the potential violations and additional comment from Colorado Ethics Watch.\nPeg Perl, senior counsel for Colorado Ethics Watch, said in the group\u2019s news release Wednesday that New\u2019s transgressions were important to call out.\nHe said his campaign erred in not putting the campaign disclosure on the signs themselves."}
