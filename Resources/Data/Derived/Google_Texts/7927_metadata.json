As a competitor, I love to play basketball \u2014 that\u2019s all I\u2019ve been doing. Injuries have never had me out this long, but it\u2019s part of the game.\u201d\n\nThe reigning MVP spoke to the media Tuesday morning for the first time since the injury. He had surgery on Oct. 16 and will be re-evaluated in about five weeks, or late November. He rolled into the media session on a scooter with the lower half of his right leg in a cast.\n\nDurant said he\u2019s never had surgery, so he doesn\u2019t know how he will respond to it. He says he won\u2019t rush his return.\n\n\u201cBlessed that it happened early in the season so I can get past it, and hopefully, by December, I\u2019ll be ready to play,\u201d he said.\n\nDurant, who has played more minutes than anyone since entering the league in 2007, is finding other ways to contribute to the team.\n\n\u201cJust help out as much as possible, lead from where I am, which is the sideline,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like a coach, feel like (Alabama football coach) Nick Saban, rolling around on my scooter from court to court giving advice and trying to help out as much as I can. It\u2019s a different position for me, but I\u2019m looking forward to growing mentally watching the game and learning from my teammates, trying to help them as much as I can.\u201d\n\nHe said the situation presents an opportunity for his teammates to grow, and he feels that the team will be better off in the long run as a result.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to give guys opportunities to play, build confidence, build their chemistry as a team,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m looking at the positive side of it. It\u2019s a win-win, basically, because I\u2019m learning a lot while I\u2019m out about the game, and my teammates are getting a lot of opportunities because it\u2019s a lot of minutes out there to play and help contribute to the team.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Durant said he's never had surgery, so he doesn't know how he will respond to it.
