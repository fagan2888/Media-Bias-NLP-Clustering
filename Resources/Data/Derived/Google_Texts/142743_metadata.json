Mike Coffman of Aurora said Saturday he supports women\u2019s healthcare, but not abortion practices that \u201cfly in the face of human decency,\u201d and that\u2019s why he joined other House Republicans to vote for a budget bill Friday that defunds Planned Parenthood for one year.\n\nThe same legislation, HR 3762, also is aimed at providing stopgap funding to keep federal agencies operating in the fiscal year that begins next Thursday. And in the latest vote aimed at unraveling Obamacare, the Restoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act would end the requirement for all Americans to obtain health insurance, as well as for employers to provide it.\n\n\u201cI strongly support funding traditional women\u2019s health services, like broad access to birth control and contraception especially to poor and underserved communities, through community health centers and other medical partnerships that act and operate in good faith every day,\u201d Coffman said in a statement to The Denver Post on\n\nSaturday.\n\n\u201cMany longtime supporters of Planned Parenthood are not only shocked by what\u2019s been revealed, but also by Planned Parenthood\u2019s arrogant response. Until they clean up their act, we should fund critical women\u2019s services through the many other community health partners that operate across my district, the state and all across this country in a way that doesn\u2019t fly in the face of human decency.\u201d\n\nThough the budget bill needs only a simple majority of 51 votes in the Senate, where there are 54 Republicans, it has a tough to road ahead. Some conservatives \u2014 including presidential candidates Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio \u2014 want an all-out repeal of Obamacare, while a handful of moderates oppose defunding Planned Parenthood. Colorado Rep. Ken Buck of\n\nRegardless, the bill would face a certain veto if it made it to the president\u2019s desk.\n\nCoffman\u2019s Democratic opponent in next year\u2019s race in Congressional District 6, state Sen. Morgan Carroll of Aurora, was quick to criticize him for the latest Planned Parenthood vote, an issue Democrats appear eager to use against him in the campaign.\n\n\u201cIt is appalling to see people playing political games with women\u2019s lives, bodies and personal freedoms,\u201d Carroll said in a statement Friday evening.\n\nCoffman\u2019s campaign said the bill he supported Friday helps to \u201censure that women who receive non-abortion services from Planned Parenthood can continue to receive those health care services elsewhere. The measure increases by $235 million (to $3.8 billion) the amounts provided under existing law to community health centers for both FY 2016 and FY 2017.\u201d\n\nCoffman cited undercover videos released earlier last summer by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress that allegedly showed Planned Parenthood executives \u2014 including Dr. Savita Gindeas, Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains\u2019 vice president and medical director \u2014 suggesting an illegal sale of of fetal tissue for medical research.\n\nPlanned Parenthood vehemently denied the allegations and said the videos were edited to be misleading. Nonetheless, the videos set off a backlash from anti-abortion Republicans in Washington, including Coffman, as well as in a handful of state legislatures.\n\nAt the same time, Coffman has touted his support for pregnant women in the workplace, co-sponsoring the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.\n\nAfter he voted for the Defund Planned Parenthood Act in September, he said the videos, however, \u201cshock the conscience.\u201d\n\n\u201cImposing a one-year moratorium on Planned Parenthood funding will give Congress and the American people time to investigate and evaluate the serious allegations made,\u201d he said then. \u201cI am pleased to see that Colorado\u2019s federally qualified health clinics will receive funding to ensure women\u2019s access to health care.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have criticized Coffman\u2019s votes to take funding from Planned Parenthood after he used the organization\u2019s logo and past support for him in a campaign ad last year.\n\nProgressNow Colorado, the state\u2019s largest liberal advocacy group, called on him to apologize.\n\n\u201cJust a year ago, Mike Coffman was so desperate to run away his right-wing image that he misleadingly used Planned Parenthood\u2019s logo in a campaign ad,\u201d said executive director Amy Runyon Harms said on Sept. 18. \u201cToday, Coffman proved that his claims that he stands with women and their families were nothing more than a smokescreen to protect his political career.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Mike Coffman,Morgan Carroll,Obamacare,Planned Parenthood,Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "U.S. Rep.
