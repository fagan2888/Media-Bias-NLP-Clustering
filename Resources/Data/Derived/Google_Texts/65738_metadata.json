He\u2019s always been this way to some extent, but now I notice he averages nine to 10 hours a night on weekdays and sometimes as many as 12 hours on weekends. He\u2019s very defensive about it, but I\u2019m trying to convince him that there might be something wrong.\n\nA: Yes, there might be something wrong, but trying to convince him of that fact does no good. More fruitful would be to persuade him just to get checked out, even if it\u2019s framed as a way to rule out some extremely minuscule, less-likely-than-Miley-Cyrus-becoming-a-diplomat-to-Syria chance that there\u2019s something wrong.\n\nHe might be scared himself that there\u2019s an issue, or he may know for sure there is. But, realistically, he needs at the very least a basic physical with blood work and a chat with his doctor (who\u2019s well-versed in psychological ailments as well as physical ones \u2014 a girl can dream!). A sleep specialist could help, too.\n\nThe culprit could be thyroid issues, breathing problems or depression \u2014 or he could just need a lot of sleep. It\u2019s time for you to get some clarity.\n\n. She has other charms, like being funny and up for adventure, so I\u2019ve tolerated this for many years. But now I\u2019m dealing with a major health problem that will be defining my life for a while. I need to be focused on myself and need my friends and family to be willing to listen sometimes. I want to convey this to her, but I also understand that she is who she is and I\u2019m sort of changing the rules mid-game.\n\nA: Good friendships meant to last can handle a rule change \u2014 especially when the reason is a crisis or a major life transition. You deserve some extra support.\n\nTest the waters with a nice note or a quiet conversation that begins with: \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019m overwhelmed right now, and my health problems will be defining my life for a while. I\u2019ll probably be a bit more self-focused, and I feel like I could use some extra support. I hope this doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t want to hang out as much, but I did want to let you know that things might feel different.\u201d\n\nAnd hope that her response isn\u2019t, \u201cSure!
