Pan\u2019s bill extended the sunset date of the CCS program to the start of 2016.\n\nAt a hearing Monday of the Assembly subcommittee on Health and Human Services, DHCS Director Toby Douglas said his department is starting a stakeholder process to examine the possibility of reinventing or replacing the $1.9 billion-per-year program when it sunsets.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we\u2019re committed with the CCS program, to make sure it continues to provide high-quality services to a very vulnerable population,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cLike we\u2019ve looked at with many other populations, we\u2019re committed to providing organized care, care that is patient-centered, that better aligns the payment incentives. We want to embark on a stakeholder process to discuss approaches for what is the best system of care for CCS.\u201d\n\nDouglas emphasized that state officials had not yet made up their minds.\n\n\u201cThere have been no decisions at this point,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cWe will be working with stakeholders over the coming months to look at what it means. Do we end the carve-out? Do we look at other approaches?\u201d\n\nEileen Crumb, a parent of a CCS beneficiary, said she was wary of making changes to a system that\u2019s working.\n\n\u201cYes, every system needs improvement, but if we\u2019re going to replace CCS, we need to replace it with something that is specific to the needs of these children,\u201d Crumb said. \u201cBecause \u2026 if they get the wrong kind of care, it becomes more expensive. The right care at the right time is what CCS is about. Their needs are complex. They need to have people with the expertise to help them.\u201d\n\nIf improvement of care is the goal, the department should run some pilot programs to test care delivery, said Tim Shannon, a legislative advocate for the Children\u2019s Specialty Care Coalition.\n\n\u201cOver the years [the carve-out] has been renewed six times, and we\u2019ve had lots of discussion with the department along the way about the extensions,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cIn the last go-round with Assembly member Pan\u2019s bill, it was enacted with the notion that there would be pilot projects, to test care for those in the CCS system.\u201d\n\nThose pilot projects have not materialized, Shannon said.\n\n\u201cWhile we share the department\u2019s interest in organized systems of care, we have a cautionary note,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to rush into this.\u201d\n\nAnne Kuhns, president and CEO of the California Children\u2019s Hospital Association, echoed that sentiment.\n\n\u201cThe primary priority \u2026 is to first do no harm,\u201d Kuhns said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be driven by an artificial deadline. \u2026 Any decision, any change needs to be made based on data, not just on a theory that putting children in a different system of care means that they\u2019re being put in a better system of care.\u201d\n\nDouglas said he was open to other ideas.\n\n\u201cWe definitely believe as a department that organized care \u2014 care that is patient centered \u2014 can bring together disparate systems,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cThere are better ways to provide high-quality care and we need to work with our stakeholders to look at CCS, and what does that mean for CCS.\u201d\n\nThe chair of the subcommittee, Assembly member Shirley Weber (D-San Diego), said she wants the subcommittee to revisit this subject in a future hearing.\n\nWeber suggested \u201ca discussion of why we haven\u2019t done the pilot projects. I think it would be important to have the data, the information \u2026 and [to know] what pilot projects we plan to put in place before 2016.\u201d\n\nShe said that would help people trust the continuity of care would continue at a high level.\n\n\u201cThese are children with some very critical needs,\u201d Weber said. \u201cThey\u2019re not easily transitioned. \u2026 The consequences are much more grave.\u201d\n\nThe CCS program provides diagnostic and treatment services to children under age 21 with a wide range of medical problems including cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, cerebral palsy, heart disease and cancer. Kids who have suffered traumatic injuries are also treated in the program.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>State officials announced this week the beginning of a stakeholder process to potentially end the carve-out funding for California Children's Services, a 22-year-old program for children with severe and rare illnesses. </p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "State officials announced this week the beginning of a stakeholder process to potentially end the carve-out funding for California Children\u2019s Services, a 22-year-old program for children with\u2026", "title": "State Broaches Idea of Eliminating California Children\u2019s Services Carve-Out", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/state-broaches-the-idea-of-eliminating-california-childrens-services-carveout/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-02-26T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-26T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cLike we\u2019ve looked at with many other populations, we\u2019re committed to providing organized care, care that is patient-centered, that better aligns the payment incentives.\n\u201cWe definitely believe as a department that organized care \u2014 care that is patient centered \u2014 can bring together disparate systems,\u201d Douglas said.\nA state health official this week said the Department of Health Care Services is starting a stakeholder process to look at alternatives to the California Children\u2019s Services program for children with severe and rare illnesses.\nPan\u2019s bill extended the sunset date of the CCS program to the start of 2016.\n\u201cAt this point, we\u2019re committed with the CCS program, to make sure it continues to provide high-quality services to a very vulnerable population,\u201d Douglas said."}
