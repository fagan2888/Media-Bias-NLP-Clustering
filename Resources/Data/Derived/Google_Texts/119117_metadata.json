He looked up at me and said, \u2018Joey, I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so ashamed.\u2019\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s father had come back from the bank and couldn\u2019t get the money to personally send his son to college.\n\nThe vice president spoke to a crowd of hundreds of people at a hangar near Syracuse Hancock International Airport to rally support for U.S. Rep. Dan Maffei (D-Syracuse). Maffei is locked in a tight race with Republican challenger John Katko for the upcoming election on Nov. 4.\n\nWith the rally\u2019s theme of strengthening the middle class, Biden said it\u2019s essential that middle class Americans can afford to send this generation of students to college.\n\nHe opened his speech by reminiscing about his \u201calmost home\u201d of Syracuse. Biden graduated from the College of Law in 1968 and met his first wife at SU. The vice president added that he has some fond memories at Hancock Airport.\n\nHis speech also touched upon the importance of building up the middle class and making sure all Americans have access to good jobs, have Medicaid and have a high minimum wage.\n\n\u201cThe middle class has been the social fabric that\u2019s held this country together,\u201d Biden said.\n\nSending a child to college isn\u2019t just about the student, Biden said, but it\u2019s also about the parent.\n\n\u201cHow many people in this room are parents,\u201d Biden asked the crowd and a vast majority of the hands shot up. \u201cThe hardest thing as a parent, that students will learn, is looking them in the eyes and telling your son or daughter that they have an opportunity and there\u2019s nothing you can do to help them. It\u2019s the most helpless feeling for a mom or dad.\u201d\n\nAnd as of now, millions of mothers and fathers who have \u201cdignity and pride\u201d aren\u2019t able to send their children to college, because they simply can\u2019t afford it, Biden said.\n\nFour million more kids are in college today because of Pell Grants, Biden said. And it\u2019s now more important than ever to invest in early childhood education, as studies show that early education will enable students to become more successful in life.\n\nBiden criticized the Republican Party for claiming the country can\u2019t afford it. But yet Republicans continue to make sure $1.7 trillion goes to taxpayers who are already making millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t figure out how to get their child to school,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThese guys (Republicans) don\u2019t get it. They propose to cut what Dan and I fought for.\u201d\n\nBut before Biden ended his 30-minute speech, and took selfies with supporters as Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cWe Take Care of Our Own\u201d played in the background, he asked the crowd to have one goal come Election Day.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t just vote and make sure (Maffei) wins,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMake sure this man wins with a significant margin.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "/wp-content/themes/ostrom/images/do-icon.png", "description": "Biden spoke at a hangar near Syracuse Hancock International Airport to rally support for U.S. Rep.
