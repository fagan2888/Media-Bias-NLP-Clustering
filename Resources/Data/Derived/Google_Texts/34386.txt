GoFundMe Started for Tim Bluhm’s Medical Expenses

Tim Bluhm of The Mother Hips recently suffered an injury last September in a speed flying accident where he snapped his left ankle in half after landing feet first in a pile of cut down trees traveling at 35 MPH. Bluhm also suffered a hip injury.

Photographer Jay Blakesberg has started a GoFundMe to help with Bluhm’s medical expenses, which Blakesberg says are at $50,000 and rising. Bluhm has also suffered multiple bone infections that keep him on a heavy dose of antibiotics.

Following Bluhm’s injury, The Mother Hips cancelled their remaining tour and Blum returned to the stage in November at Terrapin Crossroads for an acoustic show with Scott Law.
