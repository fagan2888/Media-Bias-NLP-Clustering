Known as induced hypothermia, the practice involves lowering a person\u2019s body temperature, and researchers found it actually hindered long-term recovery from a TBI while also increasing a patient\u2019s risk of disability or death thereafter.\n\nTBIs occur more frequently than we may know, which makes employing safe and effective treatments all the more crucial. According to the study, two million people each year are diagnosed with a TBI, usually the result of a fall or car accident; 50,000 die as a result, while 80,000 suffer from a disability.\n\nBefore the research, cooling down a person\u2019s body to help them recover from a TBI was a common practice in intensive care units throughout parts of Europe and North America. Therapeutic hypothermia typically involves cooling a patient\u2019s core body temperature to between 89.6 degrees and 93.2 degrees. It\u2019s most commonly used in patients who cannot regain consciousness after cardiac arrest, despite their circulation restarting. To cool the patient\u2019s body, they are given ice cold intravenous drips within the 10 days following their accident, along with cold water blankets or cooling pads, which are applied to the body for at least 48 hours.\n\nThese procedures, however, were completed despite little clinical research on the long-term effects of the treatment. The current international study, led by the University of Edinburgh, peers into the unexamined effects on a patient\u2019s long-term recovery. Tracking nearly 400 cases of traumatic brain injuries and spanning 18 countries, the researchers might have debunked the belief that therapeutic hypothermia is a safe method to remove swelling in the brain.\n\nOut of the 400 people being treated for TBI, about half was given induced hypothermia, while the other half was treated with another standard procedure. Overall, the researchers found that patients who had received induced hypothermia experienced a reduction of built up pressure in their skull following the injury. However, six months down the line, patients\u2019 recovery seemed to be much worse when compared to patients who received standard care. Because of these results, the doctors were forced to end the trial early in order to avoid harming their patients.\n\nThe researchers plan to present their findings on Oct. 7 at the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine Annual Congress in Berlin. They will also discuss their trials at the Neurocritical Care Society annual meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona on Oct. 9.\n\nSource: Andrews P, et al.
