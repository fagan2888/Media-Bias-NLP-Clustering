An MRI would determine the extent of ligament damage, if any.\n\nTrevathan, the Broncos\u2019 starting weakside linebacker, was walking without a limp in the postgame locker room so there is hope his injury is not as serious as it appeared when he was carted off the MetLife Stadium field early in Denver\u2019s 31-17 victory Sunday against the New York Jets.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 leading tackler by a wide margin a year ago, Trevathan missed this season\u2019s first three games after suffering a fractured left leg just below the kneecap during a training camp practice in August.\n\nTwo plays into his second game back Sunday, Trevathan was pancaked on a double-team block as the Jets\u2019 Eric Decker gained 15 yards on a screen. Trevathan had to be helped off the field, then was driven by cart to the locker room.\n\nHe didn\u2019t return.\n\n\u201cI think it will be good, but we won\u2019t know until (Monday) when I get the MRI,\u201d Trevathan said.\n\nBrandon Marshall, who started the first three games in Trevathan\u2019s absence, again filled in at weakside linebacker. Rookie Corey Nelson played briefly in the first half.\n\nThe Broncos were thin at linebacker with Lerentee McCray a healthy scratch, then rookie Lamin Barrow was ejected late in the third quarter for throwing a punch.\n\nStrongside linebacker Von Miller also left late in the first half after he came up staggering from a tackle he made on Jets\u2019 running back Chris Ivory. He was evaluated for a concussion on the sideline, but was cleared to return in the second half.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Danny Trevathan to have MRI on injured left knee", "title": "Danny Trevathan to have MRI on injured left knee", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/12/danny-trevathan-to-have-mri-on-injured-left-knee/", "image": {"width": 435, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141012__SP13FBNBRONCOS_1JL4752xp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141012__SP13FBNBRONCOS_1JL4752xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-12T11:30:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:00:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf144\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think it will be good, but we won\u2019t know until (Monday) when I get the MRI,\u201d Trevathan said.\nBrandon Marshall, who started the first three games in Trevathan\u2019s absence, again filled in at weakside linebacker.\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 While X-rays taken here Sunday were negative, the Broncos must wait until a more revealing magnetic resonance imaging exam is done Monday before determining the extent of Danny Trevathan\u2019s left knee injury.\nThere is concern Trevathan might have suffered ligament damage, although there wasn\u2019t much looseness in the knee.\nTrevathan had to be helped off the field, then was driven by cart to the locker room."}
