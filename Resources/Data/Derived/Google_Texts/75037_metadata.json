He remained as several of his rivals walked pass him to the podium.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich wasn\u2019t called until Chris Christie mentioned his name, eventually asking, \u201cCan I introduce Kasich?\u201d\n\nDonald Trump returned to center stage after boycotting the last debate in Iowa. The billionaire businessman was sandwiched in between his two biggest rivals, Iowa caucus winner Ted Cruz, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who finished a close third behind Trump.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson were also on the New Hampshire debate stage as they attempted to give their candidacies a boost ahead of the Feb. 9 primary.\n\nWhat to do with the Affordable Care Act\n\nDuring the debate, it came out that Trump, Cruz and Carson all agree on at least one thing: They detest the Affordable Care Act. All three, however were taking different approaches to explain just what they want in its place.\n\nTrump promised \u201cto replace Obamacare with something so much better.\u201d He says that would include healthcare savings accounts for individuals and allowing insurance companies to sell policies across state lines.\n\nTrump implicitly accused his rivals of not backing some kind of safety net care for the poorest Americans.\n\nCruz did not get into the details of a replacement at all, using the discussion to blast \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d\n\nCarson said he wants to give Americans subsidies for medical savings accounts using money now spent on existing health care.\n\nBush and Trump argue over eminent domain\n\nTrump and Bush got in a terse back-and-forth exchange over their positions on eminent domain, the process by which the government takes private property for public use.\n\nWhen Bush tried to interject, Trump drew boos when he dismissed him saying, \u201cLet me talk, quiet.\u201d Trump quipped the catcalls were coming from \u201cdonors and special interests,\u201d the only people who could get tickets to the high profile debate.\n\nTrump defended the use of eminent domain, saying it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d to build roads, schools, bridges and hospitals.\n\nBush forcefully challenged Trump, asking why he tried to use eminent domain to purchase the home of an elderly woman who lived near one of his Atlantic City casinos. Bush says, \u201cThat isn\u2019t public purpose. That was downright wrong.\u201d\n\nCandidates at odds when it comes to immigration reform and deportation\n\nMarco Rubio is defending his role in immigration reform as a member of the Gang of Eight in the Senate.\n\nRubio said the American people cannot trust Congress until the border is secured and that those here illegally would not be put on a pathway to citizenship.\n\nChris Christie struck back at Rubio\u2019s answer, saying \u201cit\u2019s abundantly clear that he didn\u2019t fight for the legislation.\u201d\n\nThe 2013 Gang of Eight bill passed the Senate, but did not pass the House.\n\nKasich says he \u201ccouldn\u2019t even imagine\u201d ripping families apart by deporting immigrants living in the country illegally and says doing so doesn\u2019t match American values.\n\nKasich says he\u2019d make passing comprehensive immigration reform a priority within the first 100 days of his presidency. An attempt to pass a comprehensive bill in 2013 could not make it through Congress.\n\nKasich is at odds with several of his rivals, including Ted Cruz, on the issue of deportation. Cruz says its possible to deport people living here illegally. The only thing missing, he says, is \u201cpolitical will.\u201d\n\nHow to best handle North Korea\n\nChristie is trying to out-tough his GOP rivals when it comes to dealing with North Korea when addressing how to handle a crisis involving hostages or the rogue nation\u2019s nuclear proliferation activities.\n\nBush is saying the U.S. should reinstate \u201ccrippling sanctions\u201d and establish those sanctions \u201cright now.\u201d But Christie says the U.S. has to boost its profile on the global stage, but he fell short from saying he supports military action against North Korea.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan for dealing with North Korea runs through China. He said that the key to dealing with North Korea is enlisting the help of China. Trump says China should be responsible for addressing problems with North Korea because \u201cthey can do it quickly and surgically.\u201d\n\nThe debate began just minutes after news broke that North Korea had fired a rocket that was a covert test of technology for a missile that could strike the U.S. mainland.\n\nTrump said he believes China has \u201ctremendous control\u201d over North Korea based on conversations he\u2019s had with bankers and others he\u2019s dealt with.\n\nRubio also said he believes the United States could leverage its relationship with China to keep North Korea in check.\n\nCruz avoided saying how he would respond as president to a long-range rocket launch by North Korea.\n\nSouth Korea said earlier Saturday that North Korea did just that, under the guise that it was launching a satellite.\n\nCruz deflected questions during the GOP presidential debate over whether he\u2019d shoot down any such missile or launch a pre-emptive strike on North Korea\u2019s nuclear infrastructure.\n\nHe said he could not \u201cspeculate\u201d since he has not seen \u201cthe intelligence briefings\u201d that President Barack Obama gets. ABC moderator Martha Raddatz noted that Cruz has talked in detail about how he would approach Middle East tensions despite not having access to the same intelligence available to the president.\n\nCruz used the question to criticize the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran.\n\n\u201cThe most pro-life person\u201d on the debate stage and who the \u201cextremists\u201d are\n\nBush wants Republican presidential primary voters to think of him as \u201cthe most pro-life person\u201d on the GOP debate stage.\n\nRubio and Christie tried to turn the issue against the Democratic Party both saying that Democrats are \u201cextremists\u201d on the issue, not Republicans.\n\nThere were some slight distinctions among Republicans on what exceptions candidates would prefer in any abortion ban.\n\nAll three candidates who spoke on the matter said they would allow an abortion needed to save the life of a pregnant woman. Bush and Christie said they\u2019d both allow women to terminate pregnancies that result from rape or incest.\n\nHow to combat the Zika virus\n\nChristie said he\u2019d quarantine Americans returning from Brazil after the summer Olympics and otherwise to keep the country safe from the spread of the Zika virus.\n\nCarson said quarantining people \u201cwilly nilly\u201d is not an effective means of stopping the spread of the virus. He says organizations like the Center for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health can play a role in drafting a \u201crapid response\u201d to the spread of Zika.\n\nChristie took heat during the Ebola crisis for quarantining a nurse who returned from West Africa in New Jersey.\n\nConcerns over police control\n\nTrump said police in America are \u201cabsolutely mistreated and misunderstood,\u201d and need to be treated with more respect.\n\nBut Kasich said in Saturday\u2019s Republican presidential debate that community leaders with concerns over police conduct need to be involved to ensure \u201cmore win-wins in America.\u201d\n\nTrump said there will be abuses of police power and other problems, and when that happens, people sue. In addition, he said police are \u201creally fantastic,\u201d \u201dabsolutely amazing people\u201d and have done \u201can unbelievable job of keeping law and order.\u201d\n\nKasich says he also loves the police, but the president also has to be responsive to the concerns of people in communities concerned about abuses of power.\n\nTaking on Hillary Clinton\n\nRepublican presidential candidates were saying they aren\u2019t afraid to take on Hillary Clinton if she\u2019s the Democratic nominee in the general election.\n\nTrump says he would \u201cgalvanize\u201d the electorate against Clinton. He promises he would \u201cwin by a lot,\u201d though he offers few details about just what his argument against her would be.\n\nRubio said he believes the political dynamics nationally already favor the eventual GOP nominee. He said Republicans will be unified after the primary. The November election, he said, will be \u201ca referendum on our identity as a nation and as a people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican candidates faced\u00a0off in the season's eighth presidential debate, this time in New Hampshire.
