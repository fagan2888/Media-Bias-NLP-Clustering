It\u2019s about a new breed of high-end \u201csmart rifles\u201d that use digital aiming technology that makes it nearly impossible to miss a target. Even novice hunters can walk out in the woods, scope out their targets and pop them off as accurately as in any video game. I did basically that during a test at an outdoor shooting range this week, and though I\u2019m no expert distance shooter, I hit a target the size of a cantaloupe \u2014 twice \u2014 on my first two tries at a distance of three football fields.\n\nThe system is so foolproof that whether anyone could consider this \u201chunting\u201d is a question that I\u2019ll delve into later, but first, let me note that these rifles come with their own iPad minis with WiFi links to watch in real time what the shooter is seeing \u2014 so you can upload your shots to YouTube. As I said, opinions on this topic will diverge markedly, I presume.\n\nBut for shooting enthusiasts, this smart rifle tackles the hardest parts of long-distance targeting. No matter how steady the shooter, anyone will wobble somewhat when looking through a scope at something half a mile away, and shooters must compensate for distance, elevation and wind so a bullet traveling that far will actually hit the target.\n\nAustin-based TrackingPoint founder John McHale ran into that problem several years ago on safari in Africa when he missed a gazelle. Being a tech entrepreneur, he saw an opportunity. If fighter pilots could \u201clock\u201d onto targets, why not hunters?\n\nThe result looks like this:\n\nA shooter looks through a scope a bit smaller than a loaf of bread that\u2019s mounted atop the rifle and sees a video screen. Pushing a red button on the rifle \u201cTags\u201d the target. Then, an onboard computer uses a laser range finder, gyroscope and accelerometer to perfectly track a target. A set of blue crosshairs then appears on the screen, and the shooter holds down the gun trigger. If the target moves \u2014 like a deer walking forward \u2014 the system tracks it in real time. When the shooter slightly moves around to make blue and red crosshairs overlap, the gun electronically fires.\n\nThe gun won\u2019t even go off until precisely aimed to hit. If this sounds like a video game, guys who grew up playing Grand Theft Auto and Halo apparently are the fastest to learn the new system.\n\nHow much more accurate is this? TrackingPoint officials point to a U.S. Army study that found moderately well-trained snipers will hit a target 1,000 yards out only one time in 10, while shooters using a TrackingPoint rifle will hit five times in 10.\n\nLast week, TrackingPoint officials came through town on a sales tour to let prospective hunting customers and law enforcement officials try them out.\n\n\u201cWow, that was cool,\u201d said Ron Floto of Tampa after hitting a target dead-on at 300 yards. \u201cThe hardest part wasn\u2019t the shooting, it was acquiring the target.\u201d His friend, Gilmore Dominguez, hit the same target on his first try and blurted out something I\u2019ll paraphrase as \u201cHoly cow.\u201d\n\nThat accuracy comes at a price. TrackingPoint sells a system made to shoot 850 yards for $22,500, while a system built to shoot 1,200 yards costs $27,500. About $6,000 of that cost is the modified rifle itself. Still, TrackingPoint has sold several hundred systems, and there\u2019s a six-month waiting list.\n\nBut is this kind of shooting even \u201chunting\u201d if you can\u2019t even miss? What skill is a hunter even testing? Why not just send out some kind of aerial drone to pick off deer and watch remotely on your HDTV sitting on the couch?\n\n\u201cThere has been some resistance from a small segment of the hunting community,\u201d said TrackingPoint CEO Jason Schauble. \u201cThere always is resistance to new technology from people who spent their whole life getting good at something. You see this with bow-and-arrow hunters who say using a gun is \u2018cheating.\u2019\u201d He offers a few other points: Older hunters using his scope system can remain in the game if their physical abilities lapse, and more accurate shooting means more clean kills rather than debilitating wounds, and it\u2019s been a century since old-time hunters bolted telescopes on rifles.\n\nAlso, some of the company\u2019s first customers are Western ranchers who face risks from predators like coyotes. Point taken. Leaving aside the issue of \u201ctradition\u201d in American hunting, is \u201chunting\u201d ever \u201cfair\u201d when a deer can\u2019t shoot back? If you lived in a rural area and a wild boar was chasing your kids around, would you want to miss that shot?\n\nBesides, as they say, technology always marches onward. \u201cEvery person under 30 wants to upload video of everything they do on Facebook,\u201d Schauble said, and a smart scope lets them do that.\n\nAlong those lines, I\u2019ve spotted the SpyPoint video cameras in hunting stores that you can bolt on your bow to record shots, so we\u2019re already seeing the advent of the \u201csmart bow and arrow.\u201d\n\nStill, I suspect TrackingPoint will face a long list of questions in the future. People will ask, can the rifles be hacked? Can TrackingPoint remotely disable them if one is stolen, like I can with my iPhone? Would they consider running their own background checks to make sure they\u2019re not selling one to a Lee Harvey Oswald wanna-be?\n\nAll this debate matters very little to law enforcement and military officials who are scouting the system for their snipers. \u201cVery impressive,\u201d Greg Pauley, a captain in the Temple Terrace Police Department, said after he tried one at the range just before I did. He\u2019s considering one for the SWAT team. He sees a big benefit to retaining a video of just what a sniper was seeing through the scope when he pulled the trigger. Was the bad guy really pointing a gun at the hostage when he shot, or wasn\u2019t he? Let\u2019s go to the instant replay.\n\nThe U.S. military is a big potential customer, and the Army already bought six rifles for testing. I\u2019d be shocked if the Navy SEALs don\u2019t already have a few to try. One TrackingPoint board member is retired Adm. Eric Olson, who led U.S. Special Operations Command at MacDill Air Force Base here in Tampa.\n\nUntil larger U.S. government contracts come through, TrackingPoint is targeting (har, har) the hunting community. Ron Floto said he\u2019s really, really interested, but he would find the purchase hard to justify with his wife. Then he added, \u201cMy birthday is coming up.\u201d This would be one heck of a way to blow out the candles \u2014 at 1,000 yards.\n\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s other retail, restaurant and trend news around town:\n\nv v\n\nThe Oxford Exchange restaurant is about to open a walk-up caf\u00e9 where fans can grab their sandwiches, salads and handmade juices. The posh downtown restaurant/coffee and tea shop/bookstore has already become the hot place in Tampa to see and be seen, and owners recently bought a nearly-next-door former bodega at Grand Central and South Hyde Park avenues. Now, that space is transformed into an extra kitchen for the indoor restaurant, and there\u2019s a counter for walk-in customers to grab breakfasts and gourmet bag lunches. Some things are still in flux, but hours should be 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursday through Saturday and 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday through Wednesday. For more info, see Oxford Exchange.com.\n\nv v\n\nThe deal by Winn-Dixie to acquire Sweetbay may not be officially closed yet, but at least some of the big Sweetbay signs will soon switch over to Winn-Dixie. Contractors working for Jacksonville-based Winn-Dixie have filed for building permits with the city of Tampa to change signs at the Sweetbay location at 2525 N. Dale Mabry Highway. Look for the rest to switch over in the next few months.\n\nv v\n\nEvery week seems to bring an announcement from Netflix, Amazon, Hulu or others about spending major bucks to produce their own original content. If you remember way, way back, HBO took that route to grow from just a movie rerun channel into a gold-standard network that produced \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d This week, Amazon Studios (yes, the online shopping company) green-lighted two hourlong pilots of \u201cBosch,\u201d based on Tampa\u2019s own Michael Connelly\u2019s bestselling Harry Bosch book series, with the writer of \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cTreme\u201d taking the lead on scripts. Bosch will be played by Titus Welliver, whom I know from his role as an FBI agent in \u201cThe Town.\u201d Chris Carter of \u201cX-Files\u201d fame will have a new show called \u201cThe After.\u201d Thus continues the torrid arms race between Netflix (\u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d) and Amazon, which already has scores of shows and the rights to \u201cDowntonAbbey.\u201d So, I say, Roku, Boxie, Apple TV, it\u2019s your move. The game\u2019s afoot.\n\nv v\n\nWho\u2019s the biggest private solar power producer in Florida? Well, it ain\u2019t who you might think. The Swedish retailer Ikea has been covering the roofs of its stores with gigantic solar panels and this week turned on one in its Sunrise store \u2014 it will produce 1.5 million kilowatts annually. Add that to solar panels in Orlando, Tampa and other sites, and Ikea is producing enough power to eliminate the equivalent of 644 cars. That\u2019s enough to bake a whole lot of their cinnamon rolls. rmullins@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7919\n\nTwitter: @DailyDeadline", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 03 Nov 2013 01:00:00 -0400", "Description": "More than a few times lately, I\u2019ve written articles about guns and gun culture, but as this is Florida, it\u2019s a big topic for a consumer trend reporter like me.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "More than a few times lately, I\u2019ve written articles about guns and gun culture, but as this is Florida, it\u2019s a big topic for a consumer trend reporter like me.", "title": "Mullins: TrackingPoint introduces a rifle with nearly foolproof accuracy", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/business/mullins-trackingpoint-introduces-a-rifle-with-nearly-foolproof-accuracy-20131103/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131103/ARTICLE/131109759/EP/1/3/EP-131109759.jpg", "height": 1125}, "updated_time": "2013-11-03T16:36:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "More than a few times lately, I\u2019ve written articles about guns and gun culture, but as this is Florida, it\u2019s a big topic for a consumer trend reporter like me.", "title": "Mullins: TrackingPoint introduces a rifle with nearly foolproof accuracy", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131103/ARTICLE/131109759/AR/0/AR-131109759.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-11-03T01:00:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-11-03T16:36:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc2d\"", "article_summary": "Last week, TrackingPoint officials came through town on a sales tour to let prospective hunting customers and law enforcement officials try them out.\nLeaving aside the issue of \u201ctradition\u201d in American hunting, is \u201chunting\u201d ever \u201cfair\u201d when a deer can\u2019t shoot back?\nTrackingPoint sells a system made to shoot 850 yards for $22,500, while a system built to shoot 1,200 yards costs $27,500.\nAustin-based TrackingPoint founder John McHale ran into that problem several years ago on safari in Africa when he missed a gazelle.\n\u201cThere has been some resistance from a small segment of the hunting community,\u201d said TrackingPoint CEO Jason Schauble."}
