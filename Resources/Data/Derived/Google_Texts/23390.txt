EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Jason Hatcher will not play for the Washington Redskins on Sunday in their game against the New York Giants because of lingering soreness in his right knee.

Hatcher, who did not practice at all during the week, was listed as questionable on the Redskins‘ injury report. Sunday’s game will be the first Hatcher has missed this season and only the second he’s sat out in the past three years.

Wide receiver DeSean Jackson, also considered questionable entering the game, is active and will make his return after sitting out the Redskins‘ game against St. Louis.

Jackson bruised his right shin in the Redskins‘ loss at Indianapolis on Nov. 30 and was able to partake in at least a portion of practice each day during the week.

Coach Jay Gruden said Friday that Jackson’s availability was still “50/50.”

“I feel pretty good about his chances, really,” Gruden said. “A little bit better — obviously better — than I did last week, for sure.”

The Redskins ruled out inside linebacker Keenan Robinson, strong safety Brandon Meriweather and running back Roy Helu because of injury on Friday. Also inactive for the Redskins on Sunday will be third quarterback Kirk Cousins, left guard Josh LeRibeus and wide receiver Leonard Hankerson.

Running back Chris Thompson, signed off the practice squad on Thursday, is active and should appear in his first game of the season.

Inactive for the Giants will be cornerback Jayron Hosley, weakside linebacker James Davidson, running back Chris Ogbonnaya and leftguard Eric Herman. They ruled out injured right tackle James Brewer and weakside linebacker Jacquian Williams on Friday.
