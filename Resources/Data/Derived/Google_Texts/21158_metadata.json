But those firms still have a significant amount of their business tied to commission-based activities\u2013and the market\u2019s gyrations beginning in late August showed they remain susceptible to a broad market selloff, writes WSJ.com\u2019s Wealth Adviser. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, two of the biggest U.S. brokerages, said the market\u2019s sinking performance in the third quarter caused many of their clients to trade less, lowering the revenue they collected through commission-based relationships. \u201cWhen market activity is lower, we tend to see less activity in the transactional side of [the wealth] business,\u201d Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio told analysts in a conference call last week. Similarly, Morgan Stanley finance chief Jonathan Pruzan told analysts Monday morning that wealth-management transactional revenue was \u201cimpacted by subdued levels of retail investor activity driven by ongoing uncertainty and global volatility.\u201d Both firms continue to have more dollars in commission-based accounts than in fee-based accounts.\n\nMANAGING THE MONEY:\n\nGold now aligned with the Fed\u2019s moves. Traders and analysts say gold\u2019s role as a safe-haven investment in times of turmoil has waned recently. Instead, the precious metal\u2019s price will more likely fluctuate on shifting expectations about when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, according to The Wall Street Journal. Gold rose 5.3% this month after a sour September jobs report encouraged investors to bet there will be no rate hike this year. Higher rates, when they do happen, are expected to undermine future demand for gold. \u201cGold is trading as a proxy for expectations of U.S. interest rates,\u201d said Kevin Norrish, who heads commodities research at Barclays. \u201cPeople have looked at gold and expected it to act as a safe haven and it hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPimco stabilizes a year after Bill Gross\u2019s exit. Pacific Investment Management Co. appears to have stemmed its outflows after reporting that its assets under management stood at $1.47 trillion as of September, down slightly from $1.52 trillion as of June 30. It was the smallest percentage drop since co-founder Bill Gross departed a year earlier, writes Bloomberg.\n\nTHE BUSINESS:\n\nRCS Capital explores sale of Cetera. RCS Capital Corp. is exploring a sale of its main brokerage business Cetera Financial Group, writes Bloomberg, citing people with knowledge of the matter. RCS is seeking at least $700 million for Cetera, which it acquired last year from a private-equity firm for $1.2 billion, and it has retained Lazard as its adviser. An RCS spokesman confirmed the possible sale, saying the board of directors \u201cis exploring options to raise significant capital to rationalize the RCS capital structure.\u201d RCS \u2018s move comes about a year since American Realty Capital Properties Inc.\u2013a firm that has ties to RCS through their shared founder, real estate developer Nicholas Schorsch\u2013disclosed that it had intentionally concealed accounting errors.\n\nDynasty rounds out executive leadership. Dynasty Financial Partners expanded its leadership team as more firms continue to sign on to use its independent platform and services, according to Financial Planning. Dynasty co-founder Jason Pinkham was named director of relationship management and transition services, making him responsible for helping teams that join Dynasty in New York, Chicago and San Francisco. It has also hired Cantor Fitzgerald Wealth Management co-Chief Executive Stan Gregor to assist with growth on the East Coast.\n\nTHE PRACTICE:\n\nAn \u2018aha\u2019 chart: using nostalgia to teach clients about inflation. Whenever a client is nervous about investing in stocks and only wants to hold cash or bonds, California-based adviser Ara Oghoorian turns to a series of booklets called \u201cRemember When\u2026A Nostalgic Look Back in Time\u201d to teach them about inflation\u2019s effects on their savings. He has a book for each decade from 1950 to 2000, and has the clients flip through the book for a year close to when they were born to see how much cheaper things were when they were young. \u201cThe booklet is excellent at showing how pervasive inflation is on purchasing power over time,\u201d Mr. Oghoorian tells Wealth Adviser at WSJ.com. \u201cI tell [them] that if you want to make sure your money lasts during retirement, it has to grow faster than inflation.\u201d (\u2018An Aha Chart\u2019 is a newly launched occasional feature in which an adviser discusses the use of a chart or other visual presentation to teach clients certain aspects of finance or investing.)\n\nFollow Wealth Adviser at WSJ.com on Twitter: @dowjonesadviser\n\nThe Wealth Adviser briefing covers topics of special interest to wealth managers, financial planners and other advisers.
