The non-profit group the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar confirmed that all 20 of those had died, according to the BBC.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned of the possibility of an outbreak on the island of Madagascar back in October. After a coup in 2009, conditions and living standards worsened in villages and towns on the island, due to political crisis, according to the Pasteur Institute. Health experts were particularly worried about sanitation in prisons. \u201cIf the plague gets into prisons, there could be a sort of atomic explosion of plague within the town,\u201d the Pasteur Institute\u2019s Christophe Rogier told the BBC. \u201cThe prison walls will never prevent the plague from getting out and invading the rest of the town.\u201d This is due to the fact that a giant rat population lives in the main prison in the capital city of Madagascar, among 3,000 inmates. The plague is carried through rats and infected fleas.\n\nThe bubonic plague, known as the Black Death in the Middle Ages, killed some 25 million people in Europe in the 1300s \u2014 about one-third of its population. The disease is spread to humans through rat or flea bites, though it\u2019s not contracted from human to human; it is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The World Health Organization simply refers to the disease as \u201cPlague,\u201d though it notes that humans can develop the bubonic form when their lymph nodes swell, leading to \u201cbuboes.\u201d\n\nThe outbreak on Madagascar is one of the worst in recent years, though last year a total of 60 people died from the plague on the island. The bacterium was introduced to the island in 1898, and since then outbreaks occurred every so often \u2013 except for a hiatus starting in the 1920s and lasting until another outbreak in the early 1990s.\n\nEarlier this year in August, a 15-year-old died of bubonic plague in Kyrgyzstan, becoming the first case in Kyrgyzstan in 30 years. In the past two decades, other countries have also experienced outbreaks, including India, Indonesia,, and Algeria. Though the plague was deadly in the 1300s, when caught early today it can be treated effectively with antibiotics. Health officials will be investigating the prison area and other cities in Madagascar to prevent further cases.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "plague, bubonic plague, madagascar, rats", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "20 people have contracted the bubonic plague on the island of Madagascar.", "title": "Bubonic Plague Outbreak In Madagascar", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bubonic-plague-outbreak-madagascar-twenty-people-dead-disease-spread-rats-264827", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/11/rat.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "20 people have contracted the bubonic plague on the island of Madagascar.", "title": "Bubonic Plague Outbreak In Madagascar", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bubonic-plague-outbreak-madagascar-twenty-people-dead-disease-spread-rats-264827", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/11/rat.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/11/rat.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-12-11T17:39:13-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-11T17:39:12-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "20 people have contracted the bubonic plague on the island of Madagascar."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf240\"", "article_summary": "Earlier this year in August, a 15-year-old died of bubonic plague in Kyrgyzstan, becoming the first case in Kyrgyzstan in 30 years.\nThe disease is spread to humans through rat or flea bites, though it\u2019s not contracted from human to human; it is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis.\nThe non-profit group the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar confirmed that all 20 of those had died, according to the BBC.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned of the possibility of an outbreak on the island of Madagascar back in October.\nThe bubonic plague, known as the Black Death in the Middle Ages, killed some 25 million people in Europe in the 1300s \u2014 about one-third of its population."}
