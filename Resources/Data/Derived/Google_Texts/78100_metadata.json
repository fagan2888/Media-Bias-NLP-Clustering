Around 50 local residents gathered together on Saturday, Nov. 29, at the VFW Elwood Perkins Post 8336 home in Overton to honor all local Vietnam veterans during the 50th anniversary of the official commencement of that war.\n\nIn attendance at the event was VFW Commander-in-Chief John Stroud who presented each veteran with a certificate of appreciation for their service.\n\nIt was a time of remembrance, a time of appreciation and a time to close the circle. Fifty years ago in 1964 the U.S. presence in Vietnam was increased. This was a cold-war-era \u201cProxy\u201d war being fought in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. According to the record books it was fought from November 1, 1955 to April 30, 1975 at the fall of Saigon. Over 58,000 U.S. service members died in that conflict.\n\nAt home in the States, anti-war movement had begun which was instigated by the counterculture of the 1960s. The men and women, who had fought so bravely and represented the United States with so much dedication, had never been welcomed home.\n\nInstead they were often marginalized and mistreated by the public.\n\nAt Saturday\u2019s event, the members of the local VFW post took the opportunity to say \u201cThank you, for a job well done!\u201d The crowd that attended came to hear the stories and to join together to show appreciation. Members of the VFW Ladies Auxiliary, Linda Brommer (President), Anita Lang (Chaplain) and Kathy Hollinger (Secretary) were also present to offer their support.\n\nDan Beckdahl, the Post Commander, worked with the current National Chief of Staff and Adjutant Quartermaster of Post 8336, Bruce Hollinger, in presenting this occasion.\n\nBeckdahl is the recipient of the 2013 \u2013 2014 Nevada Veteran of the Year award due to his dedication in establishing the post\u2019s recently acquired home and the work he does helping veterans in the Moapa Valley community. His current goal is to assist Dalton Tom, the Chairman of the So. Paiute Veteran\u2019s Association in his efforts to recognize and develop membership in this area and become more involved in the Moapa Valley Post with the thought of eventually, in the near future, establishing their own Post.\n\nOver thirty local Vietnam Veterans were honored on this day, receiving Certificates of Appreciation. They were invited to share their stories of service in Vietnam. Included in that group were Purple Heart recipients: Bill Cook, Lee Hawker and Ron Jirak.\n\nIn an interview with the PROGRESS, VFW Commander-in-Chief John Stroud stated that his current position was the \u201cgreatest job in the world! Allowing him to reach out and touch and help America\u2019s heroes, military service members, veterans and families.\u201d He felt it was a good fit as he ended his career as a 1st Sergeant, a position which is involved in the training and welfare of the military men and women and their families.\n\nStroud began his career in 1976 when he enlisted in the Air Force upon his graduation from Colonial High School in Orlando, Florida. He served his Country for 21 years, retiring in 1997.\n\nIn the Air Force, he began with the F-4 Squadron, then transitioned to the F-16 in the early 1980s, and on to the F-117 \u2013 the Stealth Fighter classified program.\n\nStroud spent 1992-93 in Korea with the 51st Fighter Wing at Osan Air Base. In his off-duty hours he attended Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and graduated in 1990 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Professional Aeronautics.\n\nIn his early years he was a Flight Operations Superintendent. He spent 1995-97 at Nellis Air Base out of Las Vegas and retired as a 1st Sergeant, with the Security Police Group.\n\nHe then became active in the VFW, transitioned through the various positions and was elected as the VFW Commander-in-Chief in 2014.\n\nOne of his first privileges in that position was to lay the Wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and at the Vietnam Memorial this past Veteran\u2019s Day.\n\nStroud took a moment to talk about the current issues currently facing the national VFW organization. Asked what the thoughts were of the VFW organization on the resigning of Secretary of Defense Hagel, Stroud commented that the organization is grateful for his service. Stroud pointed out that Hagel had served in Vietnam, was awarded the Purple Heart, served in the Senate. \u201cWe were sorry to see him go,\u201d Stroud said.\n\nStroud said that the VFW is satisfied with the new Director of the VA, Bob McDonald. \u201cHe is one of us!\u201d Stroud said. \u201cHe is a West Point graduate, was in the Army and then headed Proctor and Gamble. He didn\u2019t ask for the job but was asked to take the job as the Director. He is a courageous man.\u201d\n\nIn reference to recent problems with VA Benefits, Stroud pointed out that legislation has been submitted for extra funding to remedy those problems and to give authority to take care of it through appropriate personal actions. Problems with VA benefits are being handled by a Patient Affairs Advocate, Stroud said. He added that military personnel may call 1-800-VFW-1899 to receive help and advice. This is an answering service number. But all complaints will be recorded and receive a response.\n\nStroud said that the VFW has been active in protecting the military\u2019s Tricare benefits? Resolutions to Congress are submitted annually in an attempt to protect the benefits earned, Stroud explained. In addition, objections are voiced whenever a move is made to take away those benefits. Currently the benefits meet the criteria of the Affordable Care Act, Stroud said.\n\nStroud also said that the VFW is taking steps to protect the student benefits of military members? Currently the Post 911 G.I. Bill protects these benefits. There is also the \u201cHelp A Hero\u201d Scholarship Program available, he said.\n\nWhat are the issues that will be brought before Congress this coming year? Stroud said that they have asked for the Congressional Charter to be changed from: \u2018men, soldiers, widows\u2019 to \u2018veterans, soldiers and surviving spouses\u2019 to more actively reflect the current demographics of the service. This was passed by Congress and they expect it to be signed into law.\n\nStroud said that the VFW is calling on Congress to do the job they were elected to do and pass a budget \u2013 eliminating sequestration. If sequestration were to continue, only 20% of the Nation\u2019s budget would be allocated for defense \u2013 50% of sequestration cuts come from the Department of Defense budget. \u201cPilots would not be flying, ships wouldn\u2019t sail and soldiers would not be trained,\u201d Stroud said. \u201cWith the current threat of ISIS this would be devastating.\u201d\n\nStroud added that he was happy to take part in Saturday\u2019s 50th Anniversary Commemorative Partnership program to assist, honor and thank the veterans. This is the first of several events planned, he said.", "article_metadata": {"robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9ae\"", "article_summary": "Over thirty local Vietnam Veterans were honored on this day, receiving Certificates of Appreciation.\nAround 50 local residents gathered together on Saturday, Nov. 29, at the VFW Elwood Perkins Post 8336 home in Overton to honor all local Vietnam veterans during the 50th anniversary of the official commencement of that war.\nDan Beckdahl, the Post Commander, worked with the current National Chief of Staff and Adjutant Quartermaster of Post 8336, Bruce Hollinger, in presenting this occasion.\nOver 58,000 U.S. service members died in that conflict.\nHe then became active in the VFW, transitioned through the various positions and was elected as the VFW Commander-in-Chief in 2014."}
