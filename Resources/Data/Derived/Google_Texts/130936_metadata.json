I tried to present myself as a credible alternative for those that were looking for one.\u201d\n\nupdate 9:55pm: In a phone interview, Hall vowed to spend the next six months trying to repeal Obamacare, and meeting with constituents back home as if he had another 2-1/2 years left on the job.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t conceded anything; I lost. That ought to be good enough for him,\u201d Hall joked. \u201cAnd let me tell you something, it\u2019s better to win than it is to lose.\u201d\n\nWas age a factor? Sure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been 45 and I did better. I\u2019ve been 65 and I did better. I\u2019m 90 now and I didn\u2019t do better,\u201d Hall said. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m not hurt about it. I\u2019m not really terribly surprised about it, and I\u2019m not happy about it. I\u2019m going to keep on doing my job and coming home and visiting people that I love.\u201d\n\nupdate 9:36pm: Ratcliffe\u2019s lead has widened to 2,272 votes out of 41,450. All but 7 percent of precincts have been counted. And he has issued a statement:\n\n\u201cI entered this race because I want a better path for America than the one that we\u2019re on right now. Tonight, the voters of this district confirmed what I\u2019ve been hearing on the campaign trail for the last six months. I thank Congressman Hall for serving us admirably, and wish him the best moving forward. I look forward to representing the 4th District of Texas in U.S. House of Representatives and fighting for the conservative values which I\u2019ve defended throughout my career.\u201d\n\nupdate 9:10pm: AP is projecting victory for Ratcliffe. With 85 percent of precincts counted, the challenger is ahead by 1,616 votes out of nearly 38,000 \u2014 just over 4 percentage points.\n\nupdate 8:55pm: Ratcliffe\u2019s lead is growing. With half the precincts reporting he is ahead 52.5 to 47.5. He\u2019s up by 1,400 votes out of 28,000.\n\nupdate at 8:30pm: Ratcliffe\u2019s lead is down to 700, with a quarter of precincts reporting.\n\nupdate at 8:10pm: Still very close. Ratcliffe leads by 900 votes out of about 22,000, with fewer than 15 percent of precincts reporting and counted.\n\nupdate at 7:35pm: Ratcliffe leads 52-48, with less than 7 percent of precincts reporting. Fewer than 800 votes separate him from Hall.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 So far, it\u2019s a nail biter.\n\nRep. Ralph Hall \u2014 at 91, the oldest person ever to serve in the U.S. House \u2014 trails challenger John Ratcliffe by fewer than 400 votes, out of more than 12,000 in early returns. But there are lots more ballots to be counted.\n\nHall is watching returns in Rockwall. He\u2019s hoping for an 18th two-year term and has vowed that this would be his last.\n\nAhead of the runoff, Hall described himself as \u201chealthy as a radish\u201d and said he was working \u201cday and night to make it go my way\u2026. It\u2019s all I got,\u201d he said. \u201cI like what I\u2019m doing and I want to keep on doing it.\u201d\n\nRatcliffe, 48 and a former U.S. attorney, is watching from his home in Heath, where he spent eight years as mayor.\n\nLast week, he described this as his biggest challenge: \u201cGetting people to break the habit of just looking for the name Hall and voting out of habit.\u201d\n\nHall is one of just two World War II veterans remaining in Congress. (The other, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., elected in 1955, is three years younger than Hall and he isn\u2019t seeking reelection.\n\nNo Democrat is seeking the District 4 seat, so victory is assured in November for tonight\u2019s runoff winner. The district covers 18 counties, from Rockwall to Texarkana.\n\nIf Hall loses, he would be the first House member defeated this year for reelection. Casualty list here.\n\nRatcliffe topped Hall by 100 votes out of 3,300 in their home county, Rockwall.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wNS91LXMtcmVwLXJhbHBoLWhhbGwtOTEtYmF0dGxlcy1qb2huLXJhdGNsaWZmZS1mb3ItZmluYWwtdGVybS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Todd J.
