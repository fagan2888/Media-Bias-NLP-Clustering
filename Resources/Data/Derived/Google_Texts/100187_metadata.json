Cruz told the crowd at Morningside College that in order to have a bright future, the country has to look to the principles of the past.\n\nHe talked about restoring free enterprise, tax reform, and regulatory reform. To reform taxes, Cruz proposes abolishing the IRS and replacing it with a \"flat tax.\"\n\nTo reform the regulatory system, Cruz would target the president's signature piece of legislation, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe \"Real Clear Politics\" average of the last four Iowa polls in the race for president has Cruz polling with 4.3-percent. That\u2019s well behind eight other candidates who haven't even declared.\n\nSince announcing his candidacy, Cruz has seen a recent surge in support but admits he's facing an uphill battle to win the Republican nomination.\n\n\"In any race that's going to be as crowded as this one, the polls are going to be fickle. And so, there are going to be times when people are up and times when people are down. And so I don't think we should put too much stock, even though we're doing quite well in the polls right now, we shouldn't put too much stock into it,\u201d says Cruz.\n\nCruz will make stops in Cedar Falls and Cedar Rapids during the day Thursday and is holding a Town Hall meeting in Des Moines at 7:15 p.m. It\u2019s being held at the airport Holiday Inn on Fleur Drive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DES MOINES, Iowa -- The first person to declare they are running for president will be in the metro Thursday night.
