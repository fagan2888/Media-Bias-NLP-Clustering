Tom Cole, who oversees the Appropriations health subcommittee, said Tuesday of the short-lived Ebola threat.\n\n\u201c[Those agencies] need to be as robustly funded in terms of what they think is necessary as you\u2019d fund the American military,\u201d the Oklahoma Republican said.\n\nFunding at the NIH, which has been a bipartisan priority despite the added complication of budget caps, would grow by $1.1 billion under the bill. That\u2019s $100 million above Obama\u2019s request.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s funding would increase by $140 million, equal to Obama\u2019s request.\n\nRepublicans from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich have called for more funding for the agencies in recent months \u2014 a rare area where conservatives are willing to spend more on health programs.\n\nAt the peak of the Ebola political crisis last October, Democrats tried to blame the GOP-backed sequester, which introduced automatic spending cuts to both the CDC and the NIH.\n\nRepublicans fought back that it was the White House that first introduced the idea of the sequester, which enforced mandatory spending cuts across the government.\n\nFunding for the CDC, in particular, became a political football as the disease spread to two nurses in Dallas, fueling widespread panic. Only two people became infected with the disease while on U.S. soil, compared to 26,000 who contracted it in West Africa. Ten people have been treated in the U.S.\n\nStill, the funding bill for HHS is many steps away from becoming law, if it does at all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a conservative bill, and we\u2019ll be hearing plenty of wailing and gnashing of teeth over some of that, but overall, there are some legitimate functions of government in my view, and certainly CDC and NIH fit that category,\u201d Cole said.\n\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s going to be areas of disagreement,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Ebola crisis last year has both parties prioritizing disease control.", "description": "The Ebola crisis last year has both parties prioritizing disease control.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Ebola crisis last year has both parties prioritizing disease control.", "title": "CDC, NIH win big in healthcare spending bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/245180-cdc-nih-are-winners-in-healthcare-spending-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/cdc.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/245180-cdc-nih-are-winners-in-healthcare-spending-bill", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-16T17:23-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-16T17:23:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/245180-cdc-nih-are-winners-in-healthcare-spending-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Ebola crisis last year has both parties prioritizing disease control.", "card": "summary", "title": "CDC, NIH win big in healthcare spending bill"}, "dcterms.title": "CDC, NIH win big in healthcare spending bill"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a4a\"", "article_summary": "Still, the funding bill for HHS is many steps away from becoming law, if it does at all.\nAt the peak of the Ebola political crisis last October, Democrats tried to blame the GOP-backed sequester, which introduced automatic spending cuts to both the CDC and the NIH.\nFunding at the NIH, which has been a bipartisan priority despite the added complication of budget caps, would grow by $1.1 billion under the bill.\nFunding for the CDC, in particular, became a political football as the disease spread to two nurses in Dallas, fueling widespread panic.\nBut GOP lawmakers are offering a funding boost in two key areas \u2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) \u2014 in the wake of last fall\u2019s Ebola crisis."}
