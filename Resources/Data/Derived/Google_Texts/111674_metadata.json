Although he got 270 electoral votes and therefore gets to be president, he didn\u2019t get everything. The Madisonian scheme is for the government to be hard to move. It\u2019s supposed to be. People look at Washington and say, \u2018Oh gosh this is so difficult.\u2019 It\u2019s supposed to be difficult.\u201d\n\nInskeep said that although that is the Madisionian scheme, detractors of the current Republican efforts to defund Obamacare by using the purse strings as leverage are short-circuiting a system that has seemed to approve of Obamacare based on the last presidential election. But Will disagreed, noting the argument that Obamacare is the \u201claw of the land\u201d neglects to realize a lot of other bad laws were once laws of the land.\n\n\u201cHow does this short-circuit the system?\u201d he replied. \u201cI mean, I hear Democrats say \u2018the Affordable Care Act is the law\u2019 as though we\u2019re supposed to genuflect at that sunburst of insight and move on. Well, the Fugitive Slave Act was the law. \u2018Separate but Equal\u2019 was the law. A lot of things were the law and then we changed them. And this is part of the bruising, untidy, utterly democratic technique for changing laws.\u201d\n\nHe added that using measures as the Republicans are doing is not unprecedented, as two prominent congressional Democrats had tried in the early 1970s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been tried \u2014 something like that,\u201d Will replied. \u201cIn 1973, as I\u2019m sure you know, the debt ceiling came up and [Democrats] Ted Kennedy, Walter Mondale attached a campaign finance scheme to the debt ceiling. It didn\u2019t work. This is not novel.\u201d\n\nWill did admit that the strategy as it is currently being implemented by congressional Republicans won\u2019t give the political win in this battle. But he explained that Speaker of the House John Boehner was forced to go this route by a very active constituency. He also pointed out that the Congress flexed its muscle in a similar way in 1970 when former President Richard Nixon ordered the invasion of Cambodia, but was stripped of funding by the passage of the Cooper-Church Amendment.\n\n\u201cThis is why Madison, my hero, emphasized where you put the power of the purse,\u201d he added.\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "Columnist says president is sometime indignant about the so-called Madisonian scheme", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "On NPR\u2019s \u201cMorning Edition\u201d on Wednesday, Washington Post columnist and Fox News contributor George Will attacked President Barack Obama for what seems to be his view of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s", "title": "George Will: Obama cut classes the day they taught \u2018separation of powers\u2019 at Harvard Law", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/09/george-will-obama-cut-classes-the-day-they-taught-separation-of-powers-at-harvard-law/", "image": {"width": 750, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Will109-e1381349080737.jpg", "height": 322}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Columnist says president is sometimes indignant about the so-called Madisonian scheme", "creator": "@jeff_poor", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/09/george-will-obama-cut-classes-the-day-they-taught-separation-of-powers-at-harvard-law/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Will109-e1381349080737.jpg"}, "title": "George Will: Obama cut classes the day they taught \u2018separation of powers\u2019 at Harvard Law Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-09 16:46:52", "sailthru.title": "George Will: Obama cut classes the day they taught 'separation of powers' at Harvard Law", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "barack obama,george will,government shutdown", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,george-will,jeff-poor", "sailthru.description": "On NPR\u2019s \u201cMorning Edition\u201d on Wednesday, Washington Post columnist and Fox News contributor George Will attacked President Barack Obama for what seems to be his view of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Will109-e1381349080737.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe011f\"", "article_summary": "The Madisonian scheme is for the government to be hard to move.\n\u201cI sometimes think that when he was at Harvard Law School, Mr. Obama cut class the day they got to the separation of powers because he seems to consider it not just an inconvenience but an indignity.\nAlthough he got 270 electoral votes and therefore gets to be president, he didn\u2019t get everything.\n\u201cThis is why Madison, my hero, emphasized where you put the power of the purse,\u201d he added.\nBut he explained that Speaker of the House John Boehner was forced to go this route by a very active constituency."}
