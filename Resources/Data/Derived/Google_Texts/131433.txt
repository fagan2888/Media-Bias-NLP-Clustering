Inspired by the Obamas’ efforts to curb obesity in the U.S., a Mississippi based pastor is taking the fried chicken out of his church picnic baskets.

Oak Hill Missionary Baptist Church pastor, Michael Minor, not only banned fried chicken from church functions, he also took sugary drinks off the menu to combat his congregation’s obesity issues. He told WMC-TV, “People are healthier, (they have) more energy. Their weight is down and once you get the weight down you want it to stay down.”

Pastor Minor did not stop at banning unhealthy foods from his church dinners, he also visited the White House to help first lady, Michelle Obama, promote her “Let’s Move” campaign. According to Buzzfeed, his church was also one of two organizations in the state of Mississippi to receive a federal grant to help register uninsured residents for the Affordable Care Act.

Minor was inspired to begin his crusade for better health and eating habits after taking a look at the health of his congregation. “It was so bad, I was having a funeral every weekend,” he said.
