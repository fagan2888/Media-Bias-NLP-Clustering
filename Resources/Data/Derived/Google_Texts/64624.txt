Fresh from his second place finish in Nevada, pro-life Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio is setting his sights on Donald Trump and looking to overtake him as the leader of the presidential race. Rubio yesterday went after Trump on the issue of Obamacare.

Rubio, who voted against Obamacare while int he Senate and supported a bill Obama eventually vetoed that would repeal Obamacare outright, said Trump “thinks parts of Obamacare are pretty good” and said Trump has not provided details on what he would do as president.
