At 5-foot-2, she weighed 190 pounds. And her doctor at the Open Door Family Medical Center in Port Chester, N.Y., had bad news: her blood sugar was too high. Her A1c test showed that her hemoglobin level was 5.9, making her pre-diabetic.\n\nWe know how to prevent diabetes. But the U.S, medical system, with its twisted priorities, doesn\u2019t cover prevention.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdI heard that, and I went to pieces,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd she said. In 2002, her father had died of diabetes-related kidney failure. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdHe was diabetic for a long time,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd she said. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdHe had high blood pressure and was nearly blind. He suffered a lot \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd and we suffered with him.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd He was 52 when he died \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd 15 years older than Barrios is now.\n\nUnlike her father, however, Barrios could get effective help. The YMCA in nearby Rye is one of 128 YMCAs across the country running the Diabetes Prevention Program. The Y coordinates patient groups at various sites, including at Open Door. Barrios\u2019 doctor sent her to Rolando Alvarez, a patient advocate at Open Door, who was starting a new group at the clinic for people who were pre-diabetic. It was a big commitment, Alvarez said \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd she would have to attend a weekly meeting for four months, and a monthly meeting for the rest of the year.\n\n\n\nBarrios joined a Spanish-language group with four other women. They met around a conference table at Open Door. Alvarez used the Program\u2019s formal curriculum: What are healthy foods? How can I be active? What can I do besides eat to alleviate stress? How can I eat healthy food when I eat out ? How do I deal with setbacks? Participants were given a calorie and fat counter book, and had to record everything they ate.\n\nA lot of it was conversation, though \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd the women helping each other. The most useful thing she learned, Barrios said, was how to say \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdno\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd in a way that was courteous but firm. Some of the women took Zumba or yoga classes together. Barrios started walking and biking, and learned to build more exercise into her job as a housekeeper. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdI used to wait to collect all the towels and bring them upstairs together. Now I bring them upstairs one by one \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd I go up and down those stairs with energy.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\nBarrios crash dieted while she waited for the class to start, and lost 22 pounds. By three months into the class, she had lost 23 more, and her blood sugar returned to normal levels. She has now gained back some weight, but it\u2019s not because her diet is slipping \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd she\u2019s five months pregnant.\n\nAs anyone who has ever dieted knows, Barrios\u2019 journey is remarkable. Changing a lifestyle is very, very hard. But the journey of the Diabetes Prevention Program itself is just as remarkable. In 2002, the New England Journal of Medicine published results of a randomized controlled trial comparing two interventions designed to keep people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes from developing the disease. Participants who took the drug metformin had a 31 percent lower incidence of developing diabetes than people who took a placebo. But far more effective was a lifestyle-change program: participants met individually with nutritionists, exercise physiologists or behavioral psychologists weekly for six months, plus monthly classes afterwards.\n\nThis group had a 58 percent lower incidence rate \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd so effective that the study was stopped early, and all participants offered classes.\n\nThese were great results. But dozens, maybe hundreds, of papers on successful programs are published every year. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdI\u2019m around this type of research a lot: wow! this works! \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd and then it never goes anywhere,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd said Ronald Ackermann, director of the Center for Community Health at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. This one looked particularly unpromising. Hiring professionals for a year\u2019s worth of training is expensive. And it\u2019s preventive medicine that the U.S. medical system, with its twisted priorities, doesn\u2019t cover. And one-on-one programs can\u2019t reach a lot of people. There are 86 million prediabetics among Americans over 20. Of Americans over 65, only 23 percent are not prediabetic or diabetic. The problem is big \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd but this intervention seemed destined to be small.\n\nYet 11 years after the study was published, the Diabetes Prevention Program helped Oralia Barrios to climb out of the danger zone. More than 20,000 people have done the program, and it has the potential to reach enough people to make a significant difference in America\u2019s diabetes epidemic.\n\nSo how did the Diabetes Prevention Program grow? Here are the steps.\n\nDiscover what people should do. Type 2 diabetes, the kind that\u2019s epidemic, can be prevented most of the time by eating right and exercising. This was not a mystery; lack of knowledge wasn\u2019t the obstacle.\n\nGet people to do it. The obstacle was getting people to actually make these changes \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd and the news in the study was that people can be helped to make them. Research published this year of those participants in the original showed that while there was falloff, there was falloff in every group \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd but the program group was still better off. In other words, the gains persisted.\n\nThe next big breakthrough came with the addition of the YMCA. Ackermann, then at Indiana University\u2019s School of Medicine, had worked with the Y in Seattle on a previous research project. In 2003, he and Dr. David Marrero began a study with two YMCA sites in Indianapolis. The control group got normal testing and counseling. At the other Y, the staff was trained in the Diabetes Prevention Program curriculum \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd adapted for use in group classes. After six months, the program participants had lost 6 percent of their body weight, while the control group members lost only 2 percent, and the differences lasted.\n\nThis study was proof-of-concept of several steps necessary for scale-up.\n\nGet people to do it cheaply. Hiring health professionals to counsel patients individually was expensive \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd a patient\u2019s first year cost $1400. But the Y does it for $275 to $325. They hired good facilitators \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd who made a lot less money than nutritionists or psychologists \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd and then trained them in the Diabetes Prevention Program curriculum. Numerous studies have since shown that outcomes are the same.\n\nGroup classes that use the huge national network of YMCA have proven to be effective in fending off the disease.\n\nGet lots of people to do it cheaply. The more significant savings came from switching to group classes \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd a way to treat many times the people for the same cost. We\u2019ve long known that groups are effective at helping people lose weight \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd at every kind of behavior change, really. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThe group model combines all these ingredients we know are essential and does it in a way that you get the support and assistance you need,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd said Michele Heisler, a professor of internal medicine and health behavior and health education, at the University of Michigan\u2019s School of Public Health.\n\nSystematically get lots of people to do it cheaply. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThe discussion was: how do we create a national program?\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd said Ackermann. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdIt wasn\u2019t that we thought it\u2019s not a good idea to do this in a church basement. GM and Ford wanted to do worksite groups. But we wanted a national approach.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\nThe YMCA had the national structure to spread the program and train facilitators. It focuses on health, knows how to reach low-income people and has thousands of branches. Eighty percent of Americans live within five miles of a Y, and Y\u2019s are in or near many neighborhoods that suffer the most from diabetes. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdIf the Y couldn\u2019t do it \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd well, we couldn\u2019t think of another national organization,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd said Ackermann.\n\nToday, YMCAs in 41 states run program group classes. Half meet at Ys, and the other half meet in places such as libraries, church basements and health centers.\n\nParticipants\u2019 average weight loss at the end of the year-long program is 6.1 percent of their body weight. But averages can mislead \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd a few successes like Barrios can distort them. Alvarez\u2019s first class was cancelled because not enough people enrolled. And in the second class he ran, only two of the seven participants met the goal of losing 7 percent of their weight and exercising 150 minutes per week.\n\nThe day I visited Alvarez\u2019s group, which was in its maintenance phase, talking about strategies for dealing with setbacks, only Juana Dami\ufffd\ufffdn was there. (I spoke to Barrios later by phone.) \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThey get through the weekly classes fine,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Alvarez said. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdBut with maintenance, they\u2019d like to come but it\u2019s more difficult. Since its once a month, they might forget. And work will always come first.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\nDami\ufffd\ufffdn is his most consistent participant. She, like Barrios, lost a lot by crash dieting before the class began. She hasn\u2019t lost much more, though \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd one big reason is the stress of caring for her mother, who is paralyzed from a diabetes-related stroke. But the class has helped her maintain a loss that otherwise might have evaporated.\n\nRelated More From Fixes Read previous contributions to this series.\n\nGet someone to pay for it. A work in progress. The Y charges $429 for the program (there are scholarships) \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd but it should be free. Diabetes is an expensive disease. A 2010 report from UnitedHealth Group says that its average cost to cover a person with no chronic disease is $4,400 per year. For a diabetic with no symptoms, $11,700. With complications: $20,700.\n\nAnother study calculates the cost savings over 10 years if Medicare covered participation in the diabetes program and three to five percent of senior participated: $1.3 billion. Such coverage would also result in a million fewer diabetes cases over 10 years.\n\nThe American health system doesn\u2019t much care. Obamacare has brought piecemeal progress (see here and here) towards expanding and getting coverage for the program, but in general neither Medicaid, Medicare nor most private insurers cover prevention \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd although this is starting to change with Obamacare\u2019s Accountable Care Organizations.\n\nIn 2009, the Centers for Disease Control convened a meeting with diabetes experts, YMCA officials and representatives of various insurance companies to discuss what it would take to get coverage. The Y offered a deal: pay for performance. It proposed that insurers only pay when participants attend classes and lose weight. United Healthcare became the first to accept; now 28 different insurers cover the program. Sen. Al Franken has introduced a bill that would have Medicare cover the program as well.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThere is a change in the conversation nationally,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd said Jonathan Lever, vice president for health strategy and innovation at the YMCA of the USA. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdFor ACOs, this is attractive. Prevention is a topic. But it\u2019s not happening in a systematic way. We\u2019re knocking at the door. But the jury\u2019s still out on whether systems will align to make it possible.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\nJoin Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes.
