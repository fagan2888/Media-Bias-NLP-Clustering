The University Building was constructed in 1910 and ready for occupancy on Jan. 1, 1911. The \u201cpencil\u201d was originally a rather nondescript smokestack that vented the three coal-fired boilers that heated the 12-story structure.\n\n\u201cIt had kind of been this gray presence forever,\u201d says David Kaufman, the property manager and co-owner of the building with Naiman Partners-910 Associates. \u201cIn conjunction with the renovation of the building\u2019s ground floor, we thought we\u2019d create a new presence there.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd so they did. A design firm and contractors transformed the gray smokestack into a dead ringer for a classic No. 2 pencil \u2014 familiar to any schoolkid who ever took a test \u2014 right down to an eraser, coat of yellow paint, and the \u201cUniversity Bldg.\u201d written in lettering that resembles classic pencil-brand logos such as Dixon and Venus.\n\nThe smokestack sort of hides in plain sight. It\u2019s not visible from the 16th Street Mall, but you can spot it as you walk up 15th Street from Larimer Square \u2014 if you\u2019re looking up.
