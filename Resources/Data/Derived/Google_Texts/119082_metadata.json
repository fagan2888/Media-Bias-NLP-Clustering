Long before Cuba Gooding Jr. played the neurosurgeon on film, before the \u201cpolitical outsider\u201d wave swept the soft-spoken doctor from the far wing of the GOP debates to a center podium, it was Havely\u2019s characterization that indoctrinated thousands of students in the tale of Carson\u2019s rise from poverty to international medical celebrity.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut this year, Havely, 56, is seeing a new side of the man he helped turn into a local folk hero.\n\nHe has watched Carson, the presidential candidate, seize the attention of the electorate on the strength of his controversial statements\u2014equating Obamacare with slavery, asserting that Jews in World War II could have avoided death camps if more of them had been armed, suggesting that gay marriage leads to bestiality. Havely, a registered Republican, now finds himself trying to reconcile the motivational message of the script with the candidate\u2019s more politically charged discourse.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden you find out all this stuff you don\u2019t know,\u201d he says with a bemused look. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it. I think he\u2019s growing and evolving like everybody. I don\u2019t think he would even have thought about getting into politics back when I was doing him in the 90s.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pretty \u2026 whew,\u201d he says, trailing off.\n\nBut allegations that Carson fabricated significant features of his autobiography\u2014the stabbing of a childhood friend in a \u201cpathological\u201d rage and the candidate's claim that he was admitted to West Point on a full scholarship\u2014have not swayed Havely\u2019s faith in Carson. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt anything he says,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat is shocking to Havely is that the play is not being staged this year\u2014the first time, he says, since its debut in 1994.\n\nHavely suspects that the directors and crew at Toby\u2019s Youth Theatre in Columbia, Maryland, where the play was born, wanted to avoid any association with Carson\u2019s politics. The theater\u2019s spokesperson rejects that notion, saying that the book on which the play is based is falling out of favor with teachers. \u201cNo political agenda on our part,\u201d Janine Sunday of Toby's told Politico in an email. \u201cJust trying to make connections between theatre and the core lessons the students are learning.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect time to do the show,\u201d Havely says. \u201cMy jaw is on the ground.\u201d\n\n***\n\nHavely had never heard of Carson before he won the role.\n\nIn 1993, Havely, a tenor for the National Opera, was performing in a play at Toby\u2019s about Jackie Robinson, but the show closed after local school officials complained there was too much racially insensitive language. The theater went looking for substitute play that would meet the Howard County school system\u2019s list of characteristics it wanted to nurture in its students. The group initially thought of Ben Franklin before discovering another Ben\u2019s story.\n\nFor Carole Graham Lehan, the playwright who's now an arts instructor at Glenelg Country School in Ellicott City, Maryland, Carson was the ideal subject for children\u2019s theater, a vessel for kids to \u201cimagine the inner life\u201d at an early age.\n\nIn a February 2008 performance of \"Ben Carson, M.D.\" at Doris M. Johnson High School in Baltimore, Prince Havely portrays local icon Ben Carson. | Baltimore Examiner and Washington Examiner | Barbara Haddock Taylor\n\nAnd Havely, she thought, fresh from his aborted performance as the color barrier-defying baseball player, was the perfect actor to take on the role.\n\nHavely went to school on Carson: He softened his imposing 6-foot-2 framed and toned down his muscular voice to match the slighter Carson\u2019s gentle movements and whispery voice. \u201cI went and interviewed him, I followed him, I watched his patterns. I watched him do lectures in Baltimore. I\u2019ve got all these videos of him. I studied him,\u201d Havely says.\n\nThe play\u2019s plot hewed closely to the 1990 memoir Gifted Hands\u2014Carson\u2019s poor childhood in Detroit, his bigamist father, his mother's insistence that he and his brother write book reports even though her third-grade education prevented her from being able to read them. And it made dramatic use of the moment Carson says defined his life\u2014when he claims he stabbed a friend and then prayed in a bathroom for three hours for God to take away his \u201cpathological\u201d anger.\n\n\u201cThis young boy with the knife would have ended up in jail or reform school!\u201d the narrator says as Havely, in a surgeon\u2019s smock, turns around to face the audience. \u201cThat man with the knife led a team of 70 on a groundbreaking operation!\u201d\n\nThat story gained new scrutiny Thursday when CNN interviewed childhood friends of Carson\u2019s from Detroit who said they didn\u2019t remember ever hearing of such an attack. Carson later admitted that he made up the name of the boy he says he stabbed, but Havely stands by the overall veracity of Carson's account.\n\nI\u2019m super nervous,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBen comes up and he just starts crying. He said that it was so accurate, it was like he was reliving it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the whole show is about! He never hid any of that,\u201d Havely said Friday. \u201cThe whole point of us doing the show was us showing this.\u201d\n\nCarson and his family did more than simply green-light the production. Carson donated family photographs for a video that was projected behind the stage. \u201cAnything we needed, he would give us,\u201d Havely says. Sometimes that included gentle directions on how to play certain scenes.\n\nHavely remembers the first time he played Ben Carson in front of Ben Carson, a kind of thrill he had never approached.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super nervous,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBen comes up and he just starts crying. He said that it was so accurate, it was like he was reliving it.\u201d\n\nHavely\u2019s performance schedule was tireless. During the school year it was common for him to perform the show for several thousand students from 50 or more schools in a matter of a few days. Often the schools would make a trip to Toby\u2019s Theatre in Columbia, but Havely and the cast would also take the minimalist production on the road. The show went from a local novelty to a sprawling exposition of Ben Carson literature, including his self-help book Think Big.\n\nAs Carson told Politico in an email, \u201cThe play was supposed to go for one season and went on for more than 20.\u201d\n\nHavely (second from right) poses with Candy Carson (Ben Carson's wife), Toby Orenstein of Toby's Dinner Theatre, and Ben Carson, Jr. | Courtesy of Prince Havely\n\nOver the years, the Carson family remained devoted to the production. Sonya Carson, Ben\u2019s mother, came to a performance of the play every other week, according to Havely. She was a constant critic of her son\u2019s character and her own, letting Havely and the play\u2019s directors know when the fictional \"Mama\" got a little too sharp-tongued. In a 1997 feature about Sonya Carson in Parade Magazine, she asked the author to accompany her to the play, where she basked in the \u201cmoist eyes\u201d of the students around her.\n\nHavely says that area teachers would arrange for children who had been operated on by Carson to attend the play. Havely would feature them in the post-show Q&A session. He believes the idea of kids seeing Carson\u2019s patients in their classrooms and social circles served to accentuate the force of the Ben Carson lore.\n\nThe real Carson saw the play at least once every year starting in 1994. The surgeon, Havely says, didn\u2019t just come to watch. Once, while bringing a group from the Carson Scholars Fund to a performance, Carson stood up in the front row to play himself in the play about himself. \u201cIt was cute, because I got ready to end the play, and I go, \u2018I have an answer for that: it\u2019s think big!\u2019 He\u2019s in the front row and he goes, \u2018Let me take that from here.\u2019 And he comes up, and everybody applauded. It was the coolest thing,\u201d Havely says. On several occasions, Carson brought Havely to dinners and Scholars Fund events to appear in character for a selection of the most memorable scenes.\n\nAlthough he was invited several times to the Carson home, Havely declined: Two Ben Carsons at one dinner table would be complicated.\n\n\u201cI was just in awe of him. I didn\u2019t go because I felt like I would have overstepped my bounds. He has an aura. You meet him, and it\u2019s different than what you think.\u201d Havely grabs my hand to imitate Carson\u2019s handshake\u2014so light it\u2019s almost impossible to feel.\n\n***\n\nOne of the early audience members was David Fraser, now in law school at the University of Baltimore. Fraser grew up in predominantly African-American Randallstown, went to Baltimore County public schools and studied political science at Johns Hopkins. He was in third grade at Hebbville Elementary in 1995 when he first read Gifted Hands and went to the play.
