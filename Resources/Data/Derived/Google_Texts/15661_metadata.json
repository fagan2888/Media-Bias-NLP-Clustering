Mike Lee Thursday in a talk at Hillsdale College\u2019s Kirby Center.\n\n\u201cWe will have this debate. The only question is whether we start a conversation or we let the fundamentalists pick a fight,\u201d said Lee, R-Utah. \u201cThe American people need and deserve to have this debate.\u201d\n\nLee encouraged Americans to urge their representatives in Congress and elsewhere to address the issue because the legislative branch\u2014at the federal, state and local levels\u2014is the place to have these debates. Religious liberty would be lost, he said, if its protection were left to the executive and judicial branches.\n\nEven more importantly, Lee said citizens need to live by their convictions.\n\n\u201cWe must be more than citizens\u2014we must be witnesses,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just to our own understanding of religious truth, but to the universal truth that man is not free unless his conscience is free.\u201d\n\nLee cited Aaron and Melissa Klein, who recently were fined $135,000 for refusing to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding, and Julea Ward, a marriage counselor who referred same-sex couples to other counselors and was kicked out of her graduate degree program as a result.\n\nLee said these incidents abridged Americans\u2019 right to a free conscious and to act according to their beliefs. He said as same-sex marriage gains support, these questions will take center stage.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, the debate will be less and less about marriage, and more about freedom of conscience,\u201d Lee said. \u201cYou can\u2019t really harm one without harming another. You can\u2019t protect one without protecting another.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, religious liberty does not benefit just those who subscribe to a particular theology, but rather, American society as a whole, he said.\n\n\u201cIn practice, religious liberty in America has meant that the government\u2019s job is not to tell people what to believe or how to discharge their religious duties, but to protect the space for all people of all faiths\u2014and of no faith at all\u2014to seek religious truth and to order their lives accordingly,\u201d Lee said.\n\nThis is what sets America apart from other countries, Lee said. Religious liberty was one of the primary tenets upon which it was founded.\n\n\u201cNo matter who you are or where you come from, regardless of your race or wealth, your political affiliation or sexual orientation, to be free in America is to know you won\u2019t be forced to compromise your conscience as a price of your citizenship,\u201d Lee said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If Americans are to preserve religious liberty in the country, they must tackle the topic proactively, says Sen.
