On one occasion police sprayed fire extinguishers at the crowds to keep them back.\n\nThe Greek state eventually charted a passenger ship to house and process migrants in an attempt to ease conditions onshore, where many are living in tents, some in shelters made from cardboard boxes.\n\nNearly 340,000 such migrants were seen so far this year arriving in the EU, mainly in Italy, Greece and Hungary. That was a 175 percent rise on the same period last year and much more than the 280,000 registered arrivals in all of 2014.\n\nOther EU data shows 625,920 people claimed asylum in the bloc last year. Frontex officials were not immediately available to comment on how far the increase in numbers being detected may be a result of increased monitoring of the frontiers.\n\nIn Germany alone, which recorded 203,000 claims last year, officials said on Tuesday they expect to register some 750,000 refugees this year.\n\n\"Syrians and Afghans accounted for a lion\u2019s share of the record number of migrants entering the EU illegally,\" Frontex said in a statement. \"Most of them, fleeing instability in their home countries, initially entered Greece from Turkey.\"\n\nFrontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri said: \"This is an emergency situation for Europe that requires all EU member states to step in to support the national authorities who are taking on a massive number of migrants at its borders.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Isla Binnie in Rome, Gergely Szakacs in Budapest, Michele Kambas in Athens and Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; writing by Philippa Fletcher; editing by Robin Pomeroy)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - More than three times as many migrants were tracked entering the", "title": "Europe struggles to respond as migrants numbers rise threefold", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/08/18/Europe-struggles-respond-migrants-numbers-rise-threefold", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-greece_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/08/18/Europe-struggles-respond-migrants-numbers-rise-threefold", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-greece_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - More than three times as many migrants were tracked entering the", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Greek officials said they needed better coordination within the European Union.\nNearly 340,000 such migrants were seen so far this year arriving in the EU, mainly in Italy, Greece and Hungary.\n\"Syrians and Afghans accounted for a lion\u2019s share of the record number of migrants entering the EU illegally,\" Frontex said in a statement.\nThe dead migrants were discovered last weekend, packed into a fishing boat also carrying 312 others trying to cross the Mediterranean to Italy from North Africa.\nThere were chaotic scenes on the island of Kos last week, where local police locked migrants in an outdoors athletics stadium to process them."}
