Ilya Shapiro argues at The Federalist that some of the blame for the rise of Donald Trump belongs to Chief Justice Roberts’ 2012 opinion in the Obamacare case, NFIB v. Sebelius. To a lot of readers, this probably sounds far-fetched. But I think Shapiro’s argument inadvertently reveals something important about Trump’s rise. In a weird way, there may be a causal connection between the Chief Justice’s opinion and Trump’s popularity. It’s just not the connection Shapiro has in mind.
