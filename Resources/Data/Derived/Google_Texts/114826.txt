This fall, voters in the Estes Valley and in other parts of Larimer County will see Larimer County Issue 1A on their ballot. Issue 1A is a renewal of the existing 1/4-cent open space sales tax. It is not a tax increase, and importantly, groceries and prescription drugs are not taxed. Issue 1A will continue the legacy of open space protection that began nearly 20 years ago when the citizens of Larimer County overwhelmingly voted for the Help Preserve Open Spaces initiative. Earlier this month, the board of directors of Estes Valley Land Trust (EVLT) passed a resolution which endorses this ballot measure and encourages voters to vote "yes" to support the protection of open space though Larimer County Issue 1A.

There are many examples in the Estes Valley of how the Larimer County and Estes Park open space funds have been used, especially in partnership with other entities such as Great Outdoors Colorado (GOCO) and EVLT, to protect important open lands and to add and expand trails. Most of those resulting projects are available for use by Colorado residents and visitors. Four examples that come to mind are:

•Hermit Park Open Space. One of the largest projects, this is a 1,362-acre open space that offers hiking, camping, and other recreational opportunities. If not for the Help Preserve Open Spaces funds, this area would have been sold by Agilent Technologies for likely development.

•Lily Lake. One of the last privately owned parcels in that area, it was protected from future development thanks to a collaboration among a number of entities that included Larimer County Open Lands.

•Knoll-Willows. Once slated to be an outlet mall, this knoll was saved as an important wildlife habitat and historic viewshed through a partnership with the Town of Estes Park, Estes Valley Land Trust, and Larimer County Open Lands.

•The Lake Estes Trail. This much-loved trail was improved and expanded, in part with funds from the Larimer County Open Lands Program and the Town of Estes Park.

Larimer County Issue 1A renews the 1/4-cent sales tax that made these and many other projects possible. It continues the work of protecting vital open spaces and natural areas and providing recreational opportunities, without an increase in taxes. Revenues will continue to be split between Larimer County and the cities and towns of Larimer County. Fifty percent of the revenues go to the Larimer County Open Lands program, and 50 percent will be divided among the towns and cities. Estes Park will receive funds based on its share of sales tax generation.

If Issue 1A is passed by voters, thus renewing the open space tax, it will help ensure that the Estes Valley community and the rest of Larimer County can continue to:

•Protect important open spaces, natural areas, and wildlife habitat.

•Protect and restore lands along rivers, lakes, and streams.

•Provide trails and other opportunities for walking, hiking, biking, wildlife viewing, bird watching, horseback riding, and fishing.

•Keep open spaces and natural areas well-managed.
