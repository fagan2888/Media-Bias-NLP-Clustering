Yet with revelations that firms with business before Clinton\u2019s State Department donated to her foundation and paid her husband, Clinton\u2019s campaign and rank-and-file Democratic activists are suddenly championing the Citizens United theory.\n\nIn campaign statements and talking points \u2014 and in activists\u2019 tweets and Facebook comments \u2014 the party seems to be collectively saying that without evidence of any explicit quid pro quo, all the Clinton cash is acceptable. Moreover, the inference seems to be that the revelations aren\u2019t even newsworthy because, in the words of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing new\u201d here.\n\nTo advocates for limiting the influence of money in politics, this pushback from Democrats is particularly rich (pun intended) coming from a party that spent a decade asserting that Republicans raking in cash from Big Oil and pushing oil-friendly policies was rank corruption. The Democratic defense of their presumptive presidential nominee registers as especially disturbing to campaign finance reform advocates considering the mighty efficiency of the Clinton fundraising machine.\n\nConsider a few undisputed facts that we surfaced in our reporting at the International Business Times:\n\n\u2014 While Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, Bill Clinton was paid $2.5 million by 13 corporations that lobbied the State Department. Ten of the firms paid him in the same three-month reporting period that they were lobbying Hillary Clinton\u2019s agency. Several of them received State Department contracts, worth a total of almost $40 million.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats condemn the Supreme Court's decision but look the other way when it benefits one of their own", "title": "The left\u2019s Citizens United hypocrisy: Why Hillary is getting a free pass", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Democrats condemn the Supreme Court's decision but look the other way when it benefits one of their own", "title": "The left\u2019s Citizens United hypocrisy: Why Hillary is getting a free pass", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/01/the_lefts_citizens_united_hypocrisy_why_hillary_is_getting_a_free_pass_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/hillary_clinton_14.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democrats condemn the Supreme Court's decision but look the other way when it benefits one of their own", "title": "The left\u2019s Citizens United hypocrisy: Why Hillary is getting a free pass", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/hillary_clinton_14.jpg", "creator": "@@davidsirota", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Sirota", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Citizens United, Democrats, Hillary Clinton, Supreme Court", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "When the ruling was handed down, Democrats were outraged, and Hillary Clinton herself has recently suggested she wants it overturned.\nSeveral of them received State Department contracts, worth a total of almost $40 million.\nMoreover, the inference seems to be that the revelations aren\u2019t even newsworthy because, in the words of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing new\u201d here.\nTen of the firms paid him in the same three-month reporting period that they were lobbying Hillary Clinton\u2019s agency.\nTopics: Citizens United, Democrats, Hillary Clinton, Supreme Court, Business News, Politics NewsLess than three weeks into her presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton has already accomplished a stunning feat: She appears to have unified large swaths of the Democratic Party and its activist base to support the core tenets of the Citizens United decision \u2014 the one that effectively allowed unlimited money into politics."}
