All that remained, really, were the details \u2014 and the question of whether some other interested party would step up. French billionaire Patrick Drahi\u2019s telecom company Altice SA reportedly did approach Time Warner Cable in recent weeks, but Charter\u2019s new offer may be difficult to beat: The $55 billion deal is about 50 percent richer than the $37 billion offer Time Warner rejected early last year as \u201cgrossly inadequate,\u201d and $10 billion more than the Comcast deal accepted about 15 months ago. The new price tag also represents a 14 percent premium to Time Warner Cable\u2019s Friday closing price. Including debt, it values Time Warner Cable at $78.7 billion.\n\nRelated: The Long, Slow Death of Cable Just Reached a Tipping Point\n\nGovernment regulators may be more likely to sign off on this deal than the Comcast one, but the FCC\u2019s Wheeler quickly emphasized that his agency wouldn\u2019t just rubber stamp the new merger. \u201cThe FCC reviews every merger on its merits and determines whether it would be in the public interest,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIn applying the public interest test, an absence of harm is not sufficient. The Commission will look to see how American consumers would benefit if the deal were to be approved.\u201d\n\nCharter is now the third-largest cable provider, but the Time Warner acquisition and a companion $10.4 billion purchase of Bright House Networks, a smaller cable provider, would immediately make it a more significant competitor to Comcast. Charter would grow from about 4.1 million TV subscribers and 4.9 million broadband subscribers to about 24 million subscribers total. Comcast has about 27 million cable and Internet subscribers.\n\nA combined Comcast and Time Warner Cable would have controlled 57 percent of the U.S. broadband market, using the FCC\u2019s recently revised definition of what can be called broadband. The new Charter would reportedly control about 30 percent of the U.S. broadband market.\n\nUnlike Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, Charter also doesn\u2019t own any content providers, which may mean one less hurdle to regulatory approval.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The $55.3 billion cash-and-stock deal that will see Charter Communications buy Time Warner Cable may have been hammered out by the two companies and their bankers, but it was essentially arranged by the U.S. government.", "title": "Charter-Time Warner Cable: How the Feds Played Matchmaker", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/26/Charter-Time-Warner-Cable-How-Feds-Played-Matchmaker", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slides/charter-sign.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/26/Charter-Time-Warner-Cable-How-Feds-Played-Matchmaker", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slides/charter-sign.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The $55.3 billion cash-and-stock deal that will see Charter Communications buy Time Warner Cable may have been hammered out by the two companies and their bankers, but it was essentially arranged by the U.S. government.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3bdf\"", "article_summary": "Charter would grow from about 4.1 million TV subscribers and 4.9 million broadband subscribers to about 24 million subscribers total.\nIncluding debt, it values Time Warner Cable at $78.7 billion.\nA combined Comcast and Time Warner Cable would have controlled 57 percent of the U.S. broadband market, using the FCC\u2019s recently revised definition of what can be called broadband.\nComcast has about 27 million cable and Internet subscribers.\nThe $55.3 billion cash-and-stock deal that will see Charter Communications buy Time Warner Cable may have been hammered out by the two companies and their bankers, but it was essentially arranged by the U.S. government."}
