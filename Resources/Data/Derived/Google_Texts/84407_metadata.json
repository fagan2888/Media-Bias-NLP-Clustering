In that same millisecond, my trainer, glimpsing perhaps smugness, knocked me off my high horse by saying, \u201cA good rider is not one who can ride a good horse and look good; it\u2019s one who can ride a bad horse and look good.\u201d\n\nLife. So humbling.\n\nThis maxim is reverberating in my head as I get psyched up to move next week into the fourth house I will stage to sell. House No. 4 will have design challenges. I don\u2019t know what they are yet, but challenges come with every home, right along with the keys.\n\nA great designer isn\u2019t one who can make a great space look fabulous. A great designer is one who makes a house with issues look as if it fell from the pages of Architectural Digest .\n\nTo gear up for my next staging project, I tapped the vision of Beverly Hills interior designer and master home flipper Nicole Sassaman, whose new book, \u201c100 Sassy Tips: Renovations\u201d (Design Life, 2014) just came out.\n\nWe engage in a little shop talk, then get right to down to business. I throw house problems at her like fastballs, and she hits every pitch.\n\nThat bathroom tile in colors that date back to \u201cMiami Vice\u201d? That hallway that looks as if it leads to the Temple of Doom? That picture window that looks straight onto the neighbor\u2019s air conditioner, that column in the middle of the living room?\n\nWhere many decorators see obstacles, Sassaman sees opportunity.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t just focus on what\u2019s there,\u201d she says. \u201cFocus on what could be.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr divert attention,\u201d I say. \u201cWhenever I don\u2019t like what I see, I put up a mirror to reflect something better.\u201d It\u2019s a cheap trick, I admit.\n\n\u201cIn Los Angeles, where I work, the city is pretty built out,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have the luxury of working with new construction. I\u2019m constantly having to work with and around design flaws.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel that way every time I get dressed,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m done, the former obstacle often becomes my favorite part of the room,\u201d Sassaman says.\n\nNow that\u2019s what I call talent.\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press). marnijameson.com.\n\nTo make it work, work it\n\nHere are some common design challenges designer and author Nicole Sassaman and I have both run up against, and some solutions.\n\nDreary hallway. Often hallways feel like something you just have to get through \u2014 long, narrow and boring. Sassaman adds interest and dimension by creating niches on one long wall. She adds a downlight in the niches and something artful, like flowers or a sculpture. Painting the hallway ceiling darker and walls lighter will also give the illusion of width.\n\nBoring tubs. Straight-up white, rectangular bathtubs are common, but not special. Tearing them out and replacing them gets expensive. Instead, Sassaman suggests covering the prominent flat side with a veneer of stone or tile. Then use the same material around the top to create a ledge all around. The treatment gives the tub more edge.\n\nNo entry. Homes that have a built-in entryway feel more gracious than those where visitors arrive directly into the main room. But when a home doesn\u2019t have an entry, you can make one with furniture, says Sassaman. Put a console table in front of the door, for keys and purses. If the door opens by a wall, add a small bench. An area rug or a change of flooring can also declare the space as an entry.\n\nWasted space. Odd halls, the space under the stairs, landings, and the gap between cabinets and ceilings are often wasted. Make them usable and more attractive by building small desk areas, book niches, or wine racks into them.\n\nOutdated tile. When old tile or floor pavers detract, don\u2019t replace; repaint, says Sassaman. Materials are available to turn orange clay pavers into a more up-to-date color like chocolate. Similarly, when bath tile is turquoise and bubblegum pink, and you want ecru, ask your paint professional about paints specially designed for tile surfaces.\n\nNo boundaries. Many of today\u2019s open floor plans backfire because they are too vast and ill defined. When that happens in a kitchen, for example, a row of hanging pendant lights between the cooking and eating areas can create a subtle boundary.\n\nAn ugly view. If a window looks onto a less-than-scenic view \u2014 say, a cinder block wall or an alley of trash cans \u2014 don\u2019t just close the blinds. Cover the wall with a ceiling-to-floor drapery on a fabulous rod, or place a decorative folding screen in front of the window.\n\nInconvenient columns. When a column lands in the middle of a room or another inopportune place, turn it into a statement or bury it. Cladding it with mosaic tiles or a smoky-mirror veneer will highlight it. Wrap a circular bench around it and add pillows. Or hide it by building a double-sided book case between the column and the wall encasing the column inside, so no one will know it\u2019s there, says Sassaman.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Design obstacles become opportunities for L.A. decorator", "title": "Design obstacles become opportunities for L.A. decorator", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/04/design-obstacles-become-opportunities-for-l-a-decorator/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140404__20140405_C3_FE05AHMARNIp2.jpg", "height": 432}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140404__20140405_C3_FE05AHMARNIp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-05T03:52:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:34:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8feb\"", "article_summary": "A great designer isn\u2019t one who can make a great space look fabulous.\nTo make it work, work itHere are some common design challenges designer and author Nicole Sassaman and I have both run up against, and some solutions.\nI\u2019m constantly having to work with and around design flaws.\u201d\u201cI feel that way every time I get dressed,\u201d I say.\nA great designer is one who makes a house with issues look as if it fell from the pages of Architectural Digest .\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press)."}
