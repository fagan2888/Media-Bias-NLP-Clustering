A large plurality \u2013 44 percent \u2013 wants to see Obamacare repealed and replaced with a conservative alternative. A much smaller group \u201316 percent \u2013 wants to see it repealed but not replaced. [\u2026] Repeal and replace was chosen by a plurality of every age group, every income group aside from those making over $150,000, and both sexes.\n\nAnd at first blush, some might see this as great news for the right. After dozens of polls showing mainstream opposition to repeal, here\u2019s a survey that finally tells conservatives what they want to hear \u2013 even as the Affordable Care Act\u2019s successes become more obvious to more people.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the poll wasn\u2019t conducted by some obscure, fly-by-night operation; it was done by McLaughlin & Associates, a major Republican pollster.\n\nSo what\u2019s the catch? Take a look at the amazing way in which the poll worded the questions.\n\nFrom the actual polling memo published by McLaughlin & Associates:\n\n\u201cWould you support or oppose repealing and replacing Obamacare with a conservative alternative that would save $1 trillion, reduce premiums, enhance access to doctors, and increase the number of people with private insurance by 6 million, but would cover 6 million fewer people overall because fewer people would be on Medicaid?\u201d\n\nJoan McCarter joked : \u201cAnd everybody gets a pony, too!\u201d\n\nThe pollster presented respondents with a bizarre scenario, describing an alternative to the Affordable Care Act that doesn\u2019t exist. The question isn\u2019t why most respondents endorsed the plan; the question is why this wording didn\u2019t produce results above 60%.\n\nKaiser Health Tracking Poll asks the same kind of question this way. \u201cWhich would you rather see your representative in Congress do when it comes to the health care law? Work to improve the law? Work to repeal the law and replace it with something else?\u201d\n\nAnd when it\u2019s asked in this more neutral way, 60% of the public opposes repeal.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Do most Americans support scrapping the Affordable Care Act?
