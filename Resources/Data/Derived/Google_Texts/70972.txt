BESLER Consulting, a leading provider of coding and billing compliance services, is pleased to announce that St. Joseph’s Healthcare System of Paterson, NJ has selected the company to provide Medical Center and Physician Services compliance plan development; documentation, coding and billing audits; staff and physician education and compliance monitoring services.

As the Affordable Care Act transforms how healthcare services are provided and alters the relationship between providers and hospitals, a consistent and comprehensive coding and billing compliance program is essential. Many hospitals are challenged to maintain effective compliance programs that are reliable and encompass all providers and services.

“BESLER’s outsource coding and billing compliance services are scalable to meet the needs of an ever changing healthcare delivery environment,” stated Jonathan Besler, BESLER’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are looking forward to working with St. Joseph’s Healthcare System to minimize their compliance risk with a comprehensive suite of compliance services.”
