Two Jeep models rounded out the top five: the Jeep Patriot Sport 2WD ($1,180) and the Jeep Wrangler Sport 4WD ($1,181).\n\nCheaper insurance rates are generally associated with cars that are easier to repair or that have fewer claims, or both.\n\n\u201cIts no surprise that a family vehicle such as a minivan has taken over the top spot,\u201d Insure.com analyst Penny Gusner said in an Insure.com report. \u201cThe Odyssey has a five-star crash rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and is relatively inexpensive to repair, and the driver carting around children tends to be more cautious than the person driving a muscle car.\u201d\n\nWhile the relative rankings remain stable, the price of insurance varies greatly by state. Insuring the Odyssey costs just $651 on average in Maine, but it costs $2,387 in Michigan.\n\nThe most expensive car to insure this year is the Dodge GT Viper, which costs more than $4,000 a year on average for an insurance policy. The next four priciest cars to insure on the list are all Mercedes models, with annual premiums ranging from $3,513 to $3,797.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Honda bumped Jeep to take the 2016 title for the cheapest car to insure in the U.S., a", "title": "The Cheapest Cars to Insure in 2016", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/24/Cheapest-Cars-Insure-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/honda-earnings_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/24/Cheapest-Cars-Insure-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/honda-earnings_1.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Honda bumped Jeep to take the 2016 title for the cheapest car to insure in the U.S., a", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Honda bumped Jeep to take the 2016 title for the cheapest car to insure in the U.S., according to the latest annual report from Insure.com.\nThe next four priciest cars to insure on the list are all Mercedes models, with annual premiums ranging from $3,513 to $3,797.\nRelated: The 5 Worst Cars at the 2016 Detroit Auto ShowThe Dodge Grand Caravan AVP 2WD took the third spot ($1,174).\nInsuring the Odyssey costs just $651 on average in Maine, but it costs $2,387 in Michigan.\nTwo Jeep models rounded out the top five: the Jeep Patriot Sport 2WD ($1,180) and the Jeep Wrangler Sport 4WD ($1,181)."}
