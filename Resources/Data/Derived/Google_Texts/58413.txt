Ever since I was a child, I’ve enjoyed going to the movies. There’s something about watching a film in a cool, dark theater with others that cannot be replicated in home theaters, no matter how fancy your home audio visual equipment may be.

It’s a bit amazing that I and other people still enjoy the movie theater experience, as theater companies haven’t done much to earn that loyalty. The last time I went to the theater, I noticed that the ticket kiosk had been phased out and patrons had to buy tickets at the concession stand, which appeared to cause a traffic jam of mid-afternoon Atlanta proportions. Also, once I got to the concession stand, prices for popcorn, drinks and candy on signs above the stand had been replaced by the words “Ask me.”

I know times are tough for many industries, but is it really too much to ask that theaters pay a kid minimum wage to sell tickets or at least put up an automated kiosk so patrons can quickly get their tickets? And can’t you just publish the prices upfront and let your customers avoid some Marrakesh-like bartering situation? I just want some popcorn, I’m not there to do human trafficking or buy heroin. Unless that’s on the table.

If movie theater chains are dead set on alienating their customers, I suggest the following strategies for further price-gouging and cost-cutting:

- Increase occupancy of theaters by replacing individual seats with benches and charging customers ticket prices based on how much space they take up on the benches.

- Set up a payday loan joint next to the concession stand where moviegoers can obtain financing to pay for popcorn and candy.

- Save money on 3D glasses by just having ushers punch moviegoers in the face before walking into the theater.

- Have Congress pass an Affordable Movie Ticket law based on the Affordable Care Act.

- Make drink holders in theater seats coin-operated.

- Adopt price-gouging strategies used by music festivals and charge customers parking fees, then make them purchase tickets they can exchange for food and drink at the theater.

- Stop movies 15 minutes before the end and force theatergoers to pay extra to see the end.

- Halt all films mid-way and threaten to replace them with longer director’s cut version of “Sex and the City 2” unless patrons cough up extra cash.

- Squeeze more viewings in by speeding up films to reduce their run time. Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper all sound funnier with chipmunk voices.

The sad thing is that I’ll likely continue to go to movie theaters despite their complete lack of consideration for their customers. I’m just putting movie theater owners on notice that they are really horrible people.
