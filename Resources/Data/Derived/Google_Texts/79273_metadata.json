At the very least, he said the body must pass a budget and all 12 appropriations bills.\n\nThat way, government spending will be fully vetted and not mashed into a massive \u201comnibus\u201d package like the one hastily written and approved Friday to avert a Christmastime shutdown, he said.\n\nMr. McConnell said Democrats appear to be on board with that approach, citing recent comments from Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.\n\n\u201cI say, \u2018Amen.\u2019 Help us do it, and we\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe GOP would like to pass comprehensive tax reform in the coming year, but it would take \u201can epiphany\u201d from President Obama to write reforms that become law before 2017, according to Mr. McConnell.\n\nHe said the effort should focus on relief for small business owners who file as individuals, or \u201cpass-throughs,\u201d and must be revenue-neutral to the government. That means any savings from reform must be used to lower tax rates for Americans, and not to authorize new spending.\n\nMr. McConnell said Mr. Obama won\u2019t agree to the latter point, dimming prospects of a deal.\n\nThe senator insisted on revenue neutrality mere moments after Congress passed a series of tax breaks for businesses and families that cost the government $620 billion.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe tax cuts ought to be paid for,\u201d he said, saying it\u2019s an \u201carticle of faith\u201d among the GOP that cuts will fire up America\u2019s economic engine, creating a net positive for the federal ledger in the long run.\n\nOn the political front, Mr. McConnell declined to wade too far into the 2016 presidential campaign that could influence key Senate races further down the ballot, as the GOP clings to its 54-member majority.\n\nBut he vowed to offer candidates who can win in key swing states, admitting the party suffered in 2010 and 2012 by nominating candidates who crashed out in general elections, citing Christine O\u2019Donnell, Sharron Angle, Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin by name.\n\nIn 2014, \u201cthe people who were nominated were electable,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat will happen again in 2016,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cWe will not nominate anybody for the United States Senate on the Republican side who is not appealing to the general election audience.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Majority Leader Mitch McConnell closed out his first year in charge of the Senate with a victory lap Friday, saying bipartisan passage of a spending and tax-relief package caps a productive year in the upper chamber after years of gridlock.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Majority Leader Mitch McConnell closed out his first year in charge of the Senate with a victory lap Friday, saying bipartisan passage of a spending and tax-relief package caps a productive year in the upper chamber after years of gridlock.", "title": "Mitch McConnell takes 2015 victory lap", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/18/mitch-mcconnell-takes-2015-victory-lap/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/18/Budget_Battle.JPEG-08bca.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/18/Budget_Battle.JPEG-08bca.jpg", "description": "Majority Leader Mitch McConnell closed out his first year in charge of the Senate with a victory lap Friday, saying bipartisan passage of a spending and tax-relief package caps a productive year in th", "card": "summary", "title": "Mitch McConnell takes 2015 victory lap"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Politics, Senate, Mitch Mcconnell"}, "article_summary": "Mr. McConnell said Mr. Obama won\u2019t agree to the latter point, dimming prospects of a deal.\n\u201cThat will happen again in 2016,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.\n\u201cBy any objective standard, I think the Senate is clearly back to work,\u201d Mr. McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said.\nHe quickly pivoted to 2016, saying Congress should not rest because it is a presidential election year.\nMr. McConnell said Democrats appear to be on board with that approach, citing recent comments from Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid."}
