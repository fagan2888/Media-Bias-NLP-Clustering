SAGUACHE â€” Federal officials are keeping a wary eye on a gathering of about 300 people known as the Rainbow Family of Living Light in the Rio Grande National Forest.

The Rainbow Family is a leaderless group that promotes peace, equality and fellowship. They hold events known as Rainbow Gatherings sporadically on National Forest land across the country.

According to the Alamosa Valley Courier (http://tinyurl.com/ptvmgbb), the gathering is expected to continue through Sunday.

Normally, any group of more than 75 people wanting to use the National Forest would be required to sign a group permit.

Acting District Ranger Angie Krall says the group is being allowed to camp because there is no leader to serve with an eviction notice and the group usually behaves, citing their constitutional rights to gather.
