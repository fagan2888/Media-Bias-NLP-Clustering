FAIRFIELD â€” A Rio Vista woman accused of killing a man in a fatal single-car rollover crash was arrested this week in Vallejo after four months on the lam.

Amber Gomes, 31, tearfully claimed during a brief Thursday court appearance that she did not know she had to be in court back in December 2014 when a probable cause hearing was set to be scheduled.

After Gomes did not show up in court, her second missed court appearance, Judge Peter B. Foor ordered a $90,000 warrant for her arrest.

Gomes faces felony charges of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and driving under the influence causing injury. She had originally been let out of jail on her own recognizance.

California Highway Patrol investigators believe Gomes was high on cocaine and behind the wheel of a 1993 Isuzu Rodeo that crashed on the night of April 19, 2014, on eastbound Interstate 80 near the American Canyon exit. The Isuzu careened off the roadway, plummeting down a steep hillside, rolling several times before ending up on McGary Road.

Gomes and her passenger, Ramon Barrozo, 33, were not wearing seat belts and were both ejected from the Isuzu, CHP reports. Gomes was injured. Barrozo died.

Gomes will remain in jail at least until her May 4 probable cause hearing, unless she posts $90,000 bail.
