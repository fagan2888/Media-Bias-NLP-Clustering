Yesterday, the Arkansas House of Representatives gave approval to the state's annual budget and, after a long hard fight, included continuation of its unorthodox health insurance expansion for low-income residents under the Affordable Care Act, dubbed the "private option."

Does this matter beyond Arkansas' borders? Yes. Reversal would have been the first case of a state reversing an ACA expansion, and would have emboldened opponents to seek similar reversals in other states.

The ACA, as originally designed, required that all states expand their Medicaid programs by 1/1/2014 to all uninsured residents with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line (about $15K in annual income for a single adult). The U.S. Supreme Court decision in June 2012 that upheld the ACA's constitutionality also required that the Medicaid expansion be optional for states.

In Arkansas, with a Democratic Governor (Mike Beebe) and a Republican-controlled House and Senate, a traditional ACA-Medicaid expansion was not in the cards. Despite the accusation that the ACA requires a "one size fits all" approach, the Obama Administration agreed to permit otherwise-Medicaid eligible adults to instead receive fully subsidized private health insurance through the state exchange/marketplace -- all private insurance all the time. Since the deal was struck in 2013, Iowa made a similar agreement, and other states such as Pennsylvania and Utah are now negotiating their own alternatives.
