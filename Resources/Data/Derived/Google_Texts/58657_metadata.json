Obama had campaigned for weeks ahead of the crash landing of his law on Oct. 1. He tried again after technical problems with the program\u2019s online home proved far worse than he and his team had promised. But such campaign events went by the wayside briefly when the president was forced to apologize for having deceived voters with his now infamous \u201cif you like it\u201d pledge. But Obama is back today as the nation\u2019s insurance salesman in chief, with a scheduled event at the White House in which he will put on display Americans selected by his team to illustrate the promised benefits of the unpopular law.\n\n[The administration is pushing hard online with virtual campaign events for the young Americans they are trying to herd into the entitlement program. A Monday event featured one of the stars of the \u201cHarold and Kumar\u201d franchise of stoner flicks. Another \u201c#WHYouth\u201d event is set for Wednesday.]\n\nBombs away - The White House has laid out its preliminary plans to offer more money to insurers to \"help offset the loss of premium revenue and profit\" under the president's health law. The regulatory filing, flagged by NYT\u2019s Robert Pear, blames the bailout on President Obama\u2019s sudden reversal of his long-planned regulations forcing insurers to cancel millions of policies. Obama nixed his rules after a public backlash over his misleading promise to voters in 2012 about keeping their insurance policies and doctors. But the bailout, allowed under a little-known provision of the law, may also be in answer to industry outrage over the technical and administrative failures of the president and his team. With huge sticker shock awaiting holders of cancelled policies, many may opt out even after they make it through the crash-prone Web site. Any relief to insurance companies would come on top of $1 trillion in subsidies they are slated to receive over the next ten years.\n\n[Ready on the right - Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., saw this one coming. He has a bill on offer in the Senate closing the door on \"insurance bailouts.\"]\n\nONE THIRD OF OBAMACARE ENROLLMENT RECORDS FLAWED - WaPo reports that nearly one-third of the ObamaCare applications sent to prospective insurers have errors. The errors include \u201cfailure to notify insurers about new customers, duplicate enrollments or cancellation notices for the same person, incorrect information about family members, and mistakes involving federal subsidies.\u201d The errors have been piling up and since the entitlement\u2019s Oct. 1 launch and pose the possibility of a looming disaster as new policies are supposed to kick in next month.\n\nTOP TWEETS - @laurenashburn\u2019s top tweet pick for this morning: ProPublica\u2019s @charlesornstein: \u201cThis @washingtonpost story is a very big deal. Roughly 1/3 of 834 transmissions have errors http://t.co/ryq6lhjKRC.\u201d\n\nLauren Ashburn of \u201c#MEDIABUZZ\u201d tracks the Twitterverse every day in Top Twitter Talk.]\n\nTick, tick, tick - The re-launch of ObamaCare\u2019s online home marks an improvement over the Hindenburg-style debut in October, but worries about the data obtained and the ability to actually deliver insurance policies is growing. For the millions of Americans whose policies were ended by ObamaCare regulations, these concerns are about far more than political optics. \u2013Watch Fox: Chief National Correspondent Jim Angle looks at the next three weeks holds for the millions trying to avoid a coverage gap.\n\nNah, bro - ObamaCare will only succeed if the so-called \u201cinvincibles,\u201d healthy adults ages 35 and under, sign up. But does it make economic sense for a 27-year-old, middle-class male to buy in, especially when he has only seen a doctor once in the three years? The answer is not what the administration is looking for. \u2013 Watch Fox: Correspondent William La Jeunesse talks to \u201cinvincibles\u201d about their choices.\n\n[Watch Fox: Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., discusses the security of ObamaCare\u2019s Web site in the 1 p.m. ET hour]\n\nLaBolt: It wasn\u2019t me - Ben LaBolt, who served as press secretary for President Obama\u2019s re-election campaign, said he wasn\u2019t part of the decision to encourage Obama to continue to make his \u201cif you like it\u201d pledge to voters. \u201cI never discussed it with [President Obama] and I don\u2019t ever recall having that discussion,\u201d LaBolt told Megyn Kelly. Reports have indicated that some in the White House encouraged Obama to drop or explain the deceptive claim fearing a backlash like the current one. When LaBolt ducked on the question of who should be held accountable, saying that the full measure of accountability would be a working system, Kelly shot back: \u201cStop that, \u2019cause you\u2019re too smart to believe that.\u201d Watch the full exchange courtesy of \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d\n\nOBAMACARE\u2019S IRS POWER PLAY HITS FEDERAL COURT - A federal court will hear arguments today from a group of small business owners in six states that claim they should not face IRS penalties over ObamaCare\u2019s employer mandate because their states have refused to comply with the law\u2019s requirement to create localized versions of the troubled \u201cinsurance exchange\u201d program. \u2013 Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream is tracking the latest developments in the case.\n\n[A survey by Pepperdine University finds 60 percent of business owners believe their health care costs will go up under ObamaCare.]\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...Megan McArdle keeps score on the administration\u2019s shifting goal lines in Obamacare's New Goal: Stay Alive Until 2015: \u201cThe administration has given up on success, as it might once have defined it. The object is no longer 7 million people signed up through the exchanges, with 2.7 million of them young and healthy, and the health-care cost curve bending back toward the earth. It is to keep the program alive until 2015. The administration's priorities are, first, to keep Democrats from undoing the individual mandate or otherwise crippling the law; second, to keep insurers from raising premiums or exiting the marketplace; third, to tamp down loose talk about the failures on the exchanges; and, only fourth, to get to the place where it used to think it would be this year, with lots of people signed up for affordable insurance. It is now measuring the program\u2019s success not by whether it meets its goals, but by whether it survives at all. And all of its choices are oriented toward this new priority.\u201d\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

The shutdown marked the first time since Republicans took control of the House that the tea-party wing of the movement was almost fully in control, calling the shots during a showdown with the president.

PRESIDENT - President Obama\u2019s political team is touting an effort by the embattled chief executive to bounce Republican governors up for re-election in states he carried in 2008 and 2012 \u2013Florida, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, who previously led the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Governors Association, is skeptical. He told Politico, \u201cIf it were right now, I don\u2019t know that any Democrat running for governor would like the president involved.\u201d\n\n[The American Petroleum Institute took its pitch for ending federal requirements for gasoline retailers to add ethanol to their products to Monday Night Football.]\n\nTEAM OBAMA PUSHES NEWTOWN POLITICAL EVENTS - Ahead of the one-year anniversary of the Newtown, Conn. school shooting, President Obama\u2019s permanent campaign apparatus wants his supporters to hold events in their homes using the occasion of the attack to push for increased federal firearms restrictions.

Men and women tracked by Bing Pulse, strongly agreed with that observation by Charles Krauthammer during Monday\u2019s Al-Star Panel on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d Both genders also agreed with the Weekly Standard\u2019s Stephen Hayes when he said what the administration has done is \u201crepaint the front of a tear down,\u201d and that it is not going to do anything. Krauthammer also drew high agreement from men and women when he pointed to the government\u2019s own report showing the private sector operates better than the public sector.\n\nViewers were highly engaged during discussion of the reported improvements to the faulty Healthcare.gov Web site. Democrats disagreed with Hayes when he stated problems insurers are having with data management will hurt the implementation of ObamaCare. Agreement was low among men and women when White House Press Secretary Jay Carney discussed improvements to the Web site while error messages persist.

According to a report in the Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, picked up by Catholic News Service, the leader of the world\u2019s largest Christian denomination said that as a young man in Argentina \u201che worked as a bouncer, and that his work later in life, teaching literature and psychology, taught him how to get people back into the church\u2026 \u2018Hypocrisy is a grave sin,\u2019 he said, underlining how important credibility was in helping the church grow, not through proselytism, but by attraction.\u2019\u201d\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cI thought one of the most telling elements of all of this was the government\u2019s own report which said that the Web site is now going to begin operating at a \u2018private-sector velocity,\u2019 which was unbelievable in its irony. Here is an official government document, which is openly admitting that the private sector is infinitely superior to the public sector...\u201d\u2014Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
