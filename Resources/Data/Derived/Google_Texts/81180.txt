NEW YORK (AP) — You know that sullen model stare?

Diane von Furstenberg was having none of it at her New York Fashion Week show on Sunday, in which she channeled the theme of the sunny French Riviera in the 1950s. Many of her models smiled as they sauntered down the runway in little gingham numbers or other cheery prints that succeeded in being both sweet and sexy.

Those models included none other than supermodel Naomi Campbell, who closed the show in a short, multicolored chiffon “boudoir dress,” delighting attendees like Whoopi Goldberg.

And the designer herself? She broke into song as she acknowledged the crowd at the end, not merely waving from the runway entrance, as most designers do, but taking an entire lap around the runway, shaking hands, kissing friends and even singing a few bars of the 1970s song “Paroles Paroles” (Words, words) along with the soundtrack.
