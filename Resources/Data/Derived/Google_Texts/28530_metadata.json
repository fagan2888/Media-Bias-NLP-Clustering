With Prater\u2019s four-game suspension looming, Denver acquired New York Giants\u2019 kicker Brandon McManus for a conditional seventh-round draft pick, according to an NFL source.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely the Broncos will give up the draft pick because the condition is McManus must continue to be the team\u2019s kicker after Prater\u2019s suspension ends.\n\nPrater was the best kicker in the NFL last season and the Broncos plan on having his job waiting for him when his suspension is lifted. Although the Broncos will continue to monitor other kickers who might become available after teams cut their rosters to 53 players Saturday, team officials have liked McManus since he kicked a 50-yard field goal in a preseason game for Indianapolis last year.\n\nDenver moved quickly before McManus was placed on waivers, working a deal as multiple teams were expected to place a claim on the former Temple product, including the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThe Giants\u2019 Josh Brown beat out McManus, despite McManus\u2019 strong preseason. McManus, 23, made two field-goal attempts (46 and 47 yards) and 10 of his 11 kickoffs were touchbacks.\n\nThe Broncos cleared the stage for McManus\u2019 audition in Thursday\u2019s preseason finale by waiving rookie kicker Mitch Ewald. Ewald missed a short field-goal attempt Saturday, hurting his chances of winning the job.\n\nMcManus fits the profile for what the Broncos were seeking, a young kicker with a big leg capable of handling kickoffs and now has two years of NFL preseason experience.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb5b3\"", "article_summary": "With Prater\u2019s four-game suspension looming, Denver acquired New York Giants\u2019 kicker Brandon McManus for a conditional seventh-round draft pick, according to an NFL source.\nThe Broncos cleared the stage for McManus\u2019 audition in Thursday\u2019s preseason finale by waiving rookie kicker Mitch Ewald.\nThe Giants\u2019 Josh Brown beat out McManus, despite McManus\u2019 strong preseason.\nIt\u2019s unlikely the Broncos will give up the draft pick because the condition is McManus must continue to be the team\u2019s kicker after Prater\u2019s suspension ends.\nMcManus fits the profile for what the Broncos were seeking, a young kicker with a big leg capable of handling kickoffs and now has two years of NFL preseason experience."}
