One man is dead and another was hospitalized in critical condition after they were struck by a speeding car while walking on Central Avenue in downtown St. Petersburg early this morning, police said.

Police say Jason Lanard Mitchell, 25, of St. Petersburg, was speeding in a rented Dodge Charger when he ran a red light and struck Aaron Jerome Davis, 31, of Largo, and Brian Lee LaFrance, 28, of St. Petersburg, as they crossed 2nd Street in the north crosswalk around 2:05 a.m.

Lafrance was taken to Bayfront Medical Center in critical condition and was later stabilized, police said. Davis, who was vaulted over the roof of the car before coming to rest nearly 100 feet south of Central Avenue, police said, died at the scene.

After striking the men, Mitchell sped off, hitting two concrete light poles and ripping the right front wheel off of the car before stopping, police said. Mitchell and his passenger, Rayvorris A. Oliver, 27, got out of the car and fled west on Central Avenue before taking off down an alley just west of McNulty Station building, police said.

Police said that employees at Push Ultra Lounge helped apprehend both men at the nightclub located at 128 3rd St. S. shortly after that.

Police said that shortly before the accident, officers spotted the Charger exiting Interstate 375 onto 4th Avenue N. at a high speed, and tried to stop the car before it turned onto 2nd Street and ran a red light at 3rd Avenue N.

Mitchell has been charged with vehicular homicide, DUI manslaughter, aggravated fleeing and eluding, leaving the scene of a crash involving death and DUI with serious bodily injury.

Mitchell attempted to escape from St. Petersburg Police headquarters after his arrest, but was quickly caught, police said.
