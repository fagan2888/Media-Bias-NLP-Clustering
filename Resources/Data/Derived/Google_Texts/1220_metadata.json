And I will always oppose any expiration of the U.S. Treasury debt ceiling. That would be a harmful global economic event. No good. But it is worth remembering that there are no catastrophic political or economic consequences attached to these shutdowns.\n\nSurely, shutdowns are a cumbersome way to make a point. But the GOP base is clamoring for a more aggressive Republican Congress. The grassroots are angry and frustrated that the Republican House and Senate have not passed a series of large-scale bills.\n\nThere's been no repeal and rewrite of Obamacare. There's been no corporate tax reform, at a minimum, or overall personal tax reform. There's been no energy bill -- neither to build the XL pipeline nor to end limits on oil and gas exports and drilling on federal lands.\n\nImmigration reform is a hot topic on the presidential debate scene. But there's been nothing on this from Congress. And the huge issue is the Iran nuclear deal, which in addition to being unverifiable would give Iran $150 billion to kill more American soldiers and advance its domination of the Middle East. But the congressional GOP response has been weak and confusing.\n\nAnd the fact that legislative hurdles -- such as the filibuster, 60-vote rule in the Senate -- prevents these reforms is unsatisfying to the GOP base.\n\nOf course, the arrogant and ideologically stubborn President Obama would veto all these reforms if they ever got to his desk. But if I read the grassroots properly, they know this and believe these vetoes would set the stage for a big Republican victory in 2016.\n\nOf course, a key point here is that you can't govern form Congress alone. You need the White House. Expectations from last November's sweep were always too high.\n\nBut perhaps Republican leadership in both houses might think of this: There are too many deals and not enough principles, beliefs and clear messaging.\n\nThe GOP ultimately will nominate a presidential candidate who will hopefully get the right message out. But in the meantime, as House Republicans choose a new top team and Majority Leader McConnell continues his term in the Senate, the congressional GOP leadership should think harder about principled messaging and less about accommodation.\n\nIf that requires a short-run shutdown, so be it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/09/larry_kudlow_believes_its_time_to_shut_down_the_government.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Larry Kudlow believes it's time to shut down the government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "There's been no corporate tax reform, at a minimum, or overall personal tax reform.\nThe grassroots are angry and frustrated that the Republican House and Senate have not passed a series of large-scale bills.\nBut the GOP base is clamoring for a more aggressive Republican Congress.\nBut it is worth remembering that there are no catastrophic political or economic consequences attached to these shutdowns.\nThe GOP ultimately will nominate a presidential candidate who will hopefully get the right message out."}
