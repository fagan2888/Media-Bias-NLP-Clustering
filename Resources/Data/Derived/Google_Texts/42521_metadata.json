The New York Times\u2019 Paul Krugman, for one, writes that conservatives are \u201cinfected\u201d with a \u201cpathological mean-spiritedness\u201d and want to \u201cgive you an extra kick\u201d when you\u2019re down on your luck. President Barack Obama, on the other hand, says that \u201ckindness covers all of my political beliefs.\u201d\n\nIn Pity Party: A Mean-Spirited Diatribe Against Liberal Compassion, William Voegeli takes a careful look at the principles of care and kindness that are at the heart of modern liberalism\u2019s self-conception. In a straightforward style, he picks apart the relationship between liberals and empathy.\n\nVoegeli explains the dangers of liberals\u2019 insistence on being on the \u201cright side of history.\u201d He gives examples of failed policies born out of the liberal need to feel like they are doing something for those with whom they empathize. One of the most persuasive examples Voegeli presents is the $180 billion Head Start program, the federally funded pre-school program designed to prepare children from impoverished families for elementary school.\n\nFunding has grown for the program over the 50 years since its inception, largely because liberals praise its success. Unfortunately, the only known success the program has had is making liberals feel good about themselves. Voegeli shows persuasively that Head Start has been an ineffective program, and that children who have gone through it end up no better than children in similar socio-economic situations that were without Head Start.\n\nObama himself admitted that until 2011, Head Start has never actually had its success demonstrated. For \u201cthe first time in history \u2026 Head Start programs will be truly held accountable for performance in the classroom,\u201d he said. Then, during the same speech, he lauded the program as a \u201coutstanding program and a critical investment.\u201d\n\nThis is the measure of success determined by liberal compassion. Voegeli explains that liberals do not care much about whether their programs work. They care that they are making an attempt to diminish suffering felt by less fortunate members of society, no matter whether the attempt actually helps.\n\nThe liberal belief that it would be better to try and fail to alleviate suffering than to do nothing at all can be traced back at least to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. \u201cIf [a method] fails, admit it frankly and try another,\u201d said Roosevelt in 1932. \u201cBut above all, try something.\u201d\n\nRoosevelt\u2019s words are embodied by the modern liberal do-something complex. Following the horrific Newtown shooting, liberals demanded strident new gun laws, even as they conceded that those laws would have done nothing to prevent the horrific shootings in question. When proposed gun legislation failed, Obama stood in front of the White House, flanked by families from Newtown, and said it was \u201cshameful day in Washington.\u201d\n\nVoegeli also discusses Obamacare. He notes that liberal response to the botched implementation of its healthcare overhaul was principally concerned with how the failed roll-out might sour Americans on further liberal reforms. The New Republic\u2019s Franklin Foer panicked that the Obamacare disaster could erode \u201cthe public\u2019s willingness to give liberalism another shot.\u201d\n\nThe arguments for Obamacare\u2019s success are rooted in liberal compassion. Clearly, nobody is celebrating the horrendous Obamacare exchanges or the $300 billion the law will add to the federal deficit. The celebration from liberals comes from noting that the percentage of uninsured individuals in impoverished minority populations has decreased, regardless of the much more negative bigger picture.\n\nThe main takeaway from Voegeli\u2019s not-so-mean-spirited diatribe is that liberal compassion is bunk.\n\nIf the concern for those with whom liberals empathize were real, it would be alarming to liberals that their welfare programs are not working. But an honest look by liberals at the effectiveness of the programs they favor would ruin their ability to feel like good people\u2014and in the end, that\u2019s what really matters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Review: William Voegeli\u2019s \u2018The Pity Party\u2019", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Liberals enjoy pointing out that, unlike their mean-spirited and heartless conservative counterparts, they actually care about other people.
