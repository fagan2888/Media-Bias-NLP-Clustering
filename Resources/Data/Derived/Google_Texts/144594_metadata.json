The new book by Colette Heimowitz has just been released to the public according to an email dated December 24. Detroit Healthy Foods Examiner was given a copy for review by the publishing company, Touchstone.\n\n\u201cThe New Atkins Made Easy\u201d is an extension of \u201cThe New Atkins for a New You\u201d which was published in 2011. Colette spends many hours researching the latest data and even spends time on the Atkin.com community forums where she\u2019s available to listen and answer questions. Those question and answer sessions, along with reading success and failures from Atkins followers is what led her to embark on a new journey.\n\nHaving read \u201cThe New Atkins for a New You\u201d there was a bit of disappointment. When reading an original book written by Dr. Atkins, one knows the stance on prepackaged and processed foods. After Dr. Atkins death and the takeover of his company, those same types of items which he fought so hard to keep his patients away from became a part of his program. Many were upset and the forum was flooded with outcries from longtime Atkins fans.\n\nWhen visiting the community forums users will find a community divided between \u2018Old Atkins\u2019 and \u2018New Atkins.\u2019\n\nWith the release of Heimowitz\u2019s latest book, the community is yet again divided. Many argue that Atkins Nutritionals is doing nothing but pushing their prepackaged bars and shakes. While that may have been true with \u201cThe New Atkins for a New You\u201d and there is little mention in the latest publication \u201cThe New Atkins Made Easy.\u201d The latest publication is a book that should have been written after the passing of Dr. Atkins. There is less discussion of and pushing of brand products and it gets back to the message of what Dr. Atkins was trying to convey with his book \u201cDr. Atkins New Diet Revolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe New Atkins Made Easy\u201d is just that, easy. It\u2019s very well put together and much more thought out than previous Atkins editions. All the questions, myths, concerns, and nonsense that people think they know about Atkins are brought forward in an easy-to-understand manual. Week by week, stage by stage, Colette walks you through the program. You will get the hows and the whys as to the reason behind Atkins and the \u2018carb ladder.\u2019 You\u2019ll understand why the need for the 14-day Induction. She\u2019ll also give you all the food and grocery lists along with meal plans to get you started. The best part about Atkins is that there are no prepackaged foods you have to buy, no points to count, and no special foods.\n\n\u201cThe New Atkins Made Easy\u201d is full of tips and recipes that will even delight long-time Atkins and low-carb followers. The book is enjoyable. It\u2019s not bogged down with a bunch of medical science, but gives you what you need to know. Heimowitz should be applauded for finding balance with this book between \u2018Old Atkins\u2019 and \u2018New Atkins.\u2019\n\nAnyone interested in purchasing the book can download a $3 off coupon from Atkins for a limited time.\n\nDisclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher as part of a review program.
