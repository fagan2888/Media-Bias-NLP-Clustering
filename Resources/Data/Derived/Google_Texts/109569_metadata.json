The benefit package would enhance the comprehensive health care services required by Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. Premiums would be collected from Coloradans based on income, securing health care regardless of financial circumstance. This efficient, universal system would operate in the interests of Coloradans. By eliminating layers of bureaucracy and reducing administrative and other nonmedical costs, ColoradoCare would cover all residents and cost less than the current system.\n\nI suspect most of my fellow Americans realize that our nation\u2019s health care system is, at the moment, in a state of crisis. Health care in America is outrageously expensive, notoriously inefficient, and largely inaccessible to the poorest Americans. Many factors have helped create this crisis \u2014 including pharmaceutical and medical technology industries based almost entirely, it seems, on the acquisition of obscene corporate profits. Another factor is the structure of the American insurance industry.\n\nIf you visit the website hosted by the Independence Institute \u2014 a \u201cnon-partisan\u201d Denver-based think tank that claims to \u201cfight for freedom on the streets, in the statehouse, in the media, on the ballot, and in the courts\u201d \u2014 you will read a somewhat different take on Amendment 69:\n\nThe ColoradoCare Amendment imposes the highest state income taxes in the nation. It creates a centrally run, monopoly health program. It does not guarantee health care or replace health insurance. Decades of evaluations of existing centrally planned monopoly health care programs show their costs are poorly controlled, they have long waiting lists for even basic care, limit access to new drugs, have miserable quality, and discourage new discoveries.\n\nBoth websites are in agreement on certain facts about Amendment 69. The proposed amendment would increase Colorado\u2019s income tax rate from 4.63 percent to 14.63 percent \u2014 higher than any other state\u2019s income tax \u2014 for self-employed individuals, farmers, landlords and others with \u201cnon-payroll\u201d income. Employers would pay a new \u201cpayroll tax\u201d of 6.67 percent, and employees would pay an additional 3.33 percent tax on their income. Employees would thus see their Colorado income taxes increase from 4.63 percent to almost 10 percent, one of the highest state income tax rates in the nation. Certain types of Social Security and pension income would also be impacted by the 14.63 percent Colorado income tax rate.\n\nThe amendment would supposedly exempt Colorado residents and employers from certain Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) provisions \u2014 assuming that the federal government agrees to waive those requirements. Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act allows states to receive a waiver from certain Obamacare requirements \u2014 if their own state-run plan provides residents with \u201caccess to high quality, affordable health insurance while retaining the basic protections of\u201d the health care law.\n\nNo state has yet attempted to do this, and the waivers are not available until 2017.\n\nAccording to the language of Amendment 69, the new agency running Colorado\u2019s \u201chealthcare monopoly\u201d would operate independently of the Colorado state legislature and administration, under its own elected 21-member board. (Exactly what state laws would apply to the agency, I am unable to say at this point, except to note that the agency would be exempt from TABOR provisions, specifically.)\n\nI had not followed the unfolding of this citizen-driven initiative until I heard, from a friend, that the issue had been discussed at a recent Archuleta County Republican Women\u2019s luncheon. My friend had been impressed with the presentation, and recommended that I sit down with the presenter, Mary Ann Smith, to get her take on the controversy. Ms. Smith and I met at Higher Grounds, and discussed the statewide impacts of the proposed amendment \u2014 but more specifically, the possible impacts on a rural \u201cretirement community\u201d like Pagosa Springs.\n\n\u201cThe proponents\u2019 argument is that this makes sense, economically,\u201d Ms. Smith explained. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t make sense, because of the impact on small business. I mean, why would you start a small business, with this \u2014 with a 14.63 percent income tax? That doesn\u2019t include the cost of sales tax, it doesn\u2019t count property tax, that doesn\u2019t count federal income tax.\n\n\u201cTo me, this has the potential \u2014 just that one facet of it \u2014 of causing us to have a major implosion. You look at our community; our community is heavily fixed income. None of us, in this community, have seen a 10 percent increase in income in the last few years. None of us. Some of us have had a decrease in income.\u201d\n\n(We might note, in passing, the recent decision by the Archuleta Board of County Commissioners to give all elected County officials a 20 percent pay increase.)\n\nMany of the Pagosa women Ms. Smith has been polling \u2014 casually \u2014 have expressed concerns about losing their existing private healthcare coverage, and about an inability to make ends meet, if this new tax were to be imposed. Some have mentioned moving out of Colorado, as a likely result. Would such a potential exodus have an impact on the real estate market in Pagosa Springs?\n\nAnd on the flip side, what about an influx of people \u2014 perhaps those suffering from serious health issues \u2014 looking for free health care in Colorado?\n\nAt this point, there are more questions about Amendment 69 than there are answers.\n\nMs. Smith noted that she\u2019s not accustomed to speaking publicly about contentious political issues, but feels compelled, in this case, to lend her voice to the conversation.\n\n\u201cI try to keep my presentations concise. I can pretty much depress a whole room full of people in about seven minutes. I like to keep it short and sweet. But it\u2019s not sweet; it\u2019s depressing. If this is what\u2019s coming, then you better be ready, and you better be talking to your neighbor. Because everybody says to me, \u2018There\u2019s no way this can pass.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen someone tells me, \u2018There\u2019s no way this will pass,\u2019 it concerns me greatly. You know, we fought Amendment 66, a few years ago, and it was nothing but a tax increase under the guise of \u2018education for the children.\u2019 We fought that, because there was nothing that mandated that the fund go to the classroom or to teacher salaries. It was all a guise to fund the retirement system, PERA. And we fought that, and people paid attention.\n\n\u201cAnd I hope they are going to pay attention on this, because this has a much greater impact. People are going to leave the state. And we\u2019re going to have an influx of people looking to get on the system, and those people who move in, don\u2019t have to live in Colorado on a permanent basis.\u201d\n\nAmendment 69 defines a \u201cBeneficiary\u201d very simply: as \u201can individual whose primary residence is in Colorado.\u201d No citizenship requirement. No length of residency requirement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not unsympathetic,\u201d Ms. Smith assured me. \u201cBut we can only do so much with what we have.\u201d\n\nMs. Smith provided me with several printed documents that she\u2019d found online, issued by conservative think tanks. The general conclusion of these conservative researchers is that Amendment 69 would be a disaster for Colorado.\n\nRead Part Two\u2026", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pagosadailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/16LogoPDP_120.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Certain types of Social Security and pension income would also be impacted by the 14.63 percent Colorado income tax rate.\nEmployees would thus see their Colorado income taxes increase from 4.63 percent to almost 10 percent, one of the highest state income tax rates in the nation.\nThat doesn\u2019t include the cost of sales tax, it doesn\u2019t count property tax, that doesn\u2019t count federal income tax.\nThe benefit package would enhance the comprehensive health care services required by Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.\nHealth care in America is outrageously expensive, notoriously inefficient, and largely inaccessible to the poorest Americans."}
