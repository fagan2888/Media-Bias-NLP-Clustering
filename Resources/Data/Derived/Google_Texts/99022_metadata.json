They include:\n\n-Defense. More spending on defense is among Trump\u2019s top priorities so \u201cit is likely defense companies would do better,\u201d Braakman said. That could include major contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp. and Boeing Co.\n\n-Health care. Trump calls for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, and wants to allow full interstate competition for the sale of health insurance.\n\nThat scenario would disrupt one of the brightest sectors of the stock market. The S&P Health care index has soared 86 percent in the last four years.\n\n\u201cObamacare has been a boon for the health care industry so any claw-back of that (law) could have a negative impact on health care\u201d stocks, Braakman said.\n\n-Trade. \u201cNobody knows more about trade than me,\u201d Trump told supporters in Maine on Thursday. But Trump\u2019s plan to impose tariffs on exports from China, Mexico and other nations is raising fears of a trade war and harm to the U.S. economy.\n\nAmerican shoppers might see higher prices for goods from those countries, and China and other nations might retaliate with tariffs of their own, harming U.S. companies\u2019 exports to those nations, critics contend.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs \u201cwould penalize global companies who are trying to be competitive globally,\u201d Meg Whitman, chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and a former California gubernatorial candidate, told CNBC last week. She too said the moves \u201cwould sink this country into a recession.\u201d\n\n-Taxes. Trump wants to cut individual income taxes and simplify the system with four brackets: 25 percent, 20 percent, 10 percent and 0 percent. The highest of the seven current brackets is 39.6 percent.\n\nThat could boost Americans\u2019 so-called discretionary spending, which would bode well for stocks in the auto, restaurant and entertainment sectors, to name a few.\n\nTrump also would slash the 35 percent corporate rate to 15 percent. But businesses would lose tax breaks on earnings overseas and various unidentified \u201cloopholes that cater to special interests,\u201d according to a news release outlining his tax plan.\n\nHe also wants to stop U.S. companies from leaving cash abroad to defer paying U.S. taxes on foreign-earned income. If enacted, that would be a huge unknown for stocks of U.S. multinational companies.\n\nTrump also has denounced so-called corporate inversions, in which a U.S. company merges with a foreign company to take advantage of lower tax rates overseas. Drug giant Pfizer Inc., for instance, is doing such a deal with Botox maker Allergan of Ireland.\n\n\u201cYou could see a President Trump taking direct aim at any of the companies that have executed a corporate inversion, to make an example of someone,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cThat would have an impact on others thinking of making that business decision.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the election\u2019s effect on the market will start to be felt in earnest \u201cright after the nominations are set\u201d this summer, Thompson said. \u201cThen investors will start making decisions based on what they believe will be the outcome.\u201d\n\nInvestors already have struggled this year with worries about a slowdown in China\u2019s economic growth, the sharp decline in global oil prices and uncertainty about how quickly the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates.\n\nNow, with Trump\u2019s unexpected success, \u201cthat instability in the market is being amplified,\u201d Janney\u2019s Luschini said. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly an influence even though it\u2019s difficult to attribute X percent of the market\u2019s changes to presidential politics in an election year.\n\n\u201dThere\u2019s always something out there that affects the market and this is one more thing.\u201c\n\nBut the growing realization that Trump could be a presidential nominee, he added, \u201dis one more thing on steroids.\u201c", "article_metadata": {"description": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 What would President Trump mean for the stock market?", "og": {"description": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 What would President Trump mean for the stock market?", "title": "How would a Donald Trump presidency affect the stock market?", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20160307-how-would-a-donald-trump-presidency-affect-the-stock-market.ece", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20160307-trm.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/TRM.JPG", "height": 683}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-03-07T21:18:43Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2016-03-07T21:18:43Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"How would a Donald Trump presidency affect the stock market?\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20160307-how-would-a-donald-trump-presidency-affect-the-stock-market.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20160307-trm.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/TRM.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2679341\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-03-07T21:18:43Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"James F.
