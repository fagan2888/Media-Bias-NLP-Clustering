Instead, the improved outlook is mostly because of new business in states such as Louisiana and Indiana, two regions which have yet to adopt the Medicaid expansion that is part of Obamacare.\n\nThere\u2019s also a considerable amount of new business coming from what are known as \u201cdual eligibles\u201d \u2014 elderly patients who are eligible for Medicaid as well as Medicare. Right now, the added business Centene is seeing has very little to do with Obamacare, though that could change, Neidorff said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to wait and see,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see some more expansion.\u201d\n\nWith only a mild contribution from Obamacare, Centene said Friday it expects 2015 revenue to come in between $20.3 billion and $20.8 billion, up 32% from the $15.3 billion to $15.8 billion it expects to report at the end of fiscal 2014.\n\nCentene said it expects 2015 earnings to reach $5.05 to $5.35 a share, compared with its current projection of $4.35 to $4.50 a share for 2014. Analysts polled by FactSet had projected earnings of $4.92 a share on sales of just under $20 billion for 2015.\n\nOne concern is that Centene\u2019s so-called \u201cmedical-loss ratio,\u201d which measures the amount of money spent on providing medical care for 2014, is rising to a range of 89.2% to 89.6%, up from its earlier projection of 88.9% to 89.4%. But analysts said that\u2019s of little concern.\n\n\u201cGiven the higher-than-expected revenue target is likely from higher acuity populations/new markets, the higher [medical-loss] guidance appears to be a function of mix shift and thus not of concern,\u201d analyst Brian Wright of Sterne, Agee & Leach said in a note to clients. Wright raised his price target on Centene to $122.\n\nCentene shares were up recently by 3.5% to $102.38, a new record.\n\nNeidorff said more business could come his company\u2019s way should more states adopt the Medicaid expansion. Twenty-three states have yet to do so, but he said some more might be planning to make the move.\n\n\u201cAs that comes along we\u2019ll take advantage of it,\u201d he said.\n\nYet there remains a number of other opportunities. Centene currently operates in 18 states, and the Medicaid market is formidable. Neidorff sees a potential $138 billion market over the next several years, and he expects organic prosperity on the horizon.\n\n\u201cI continue to see us being a growth company,\u201d he said.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Centene says it sees more revenue for 2015, but contends the Affordable Care Act\u2019s effects have little to do with it.", "creator": "@russbrittmktw", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DB447_neidor_ZG_20141212141331.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Russ Britt", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Centene says it sees more revenue for 2015, but contends the Affordable Care Act\u2019s effects have little to do with it.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/centenes-growth-has-little-to-do-with-obamacare-ceo-says-2014-12-12", "author": "Russ Britt", "parsely-title": "Centene\u2019s growth has little to do with Obamacare, CEO says", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-12-12T14:52:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Centene says it sees more revenue for 2015, but contends the Affordable Care Act\u2019s effects have little to do with it.", "title": "Centene\u2019s growth has little to do with Obamacare, CEO says", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/centenes-growth-has-little-to-do-with-obamacare-ceo-says-2014-12-12", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DB447_neidor_ZG_20141212141331.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DB447_neidor_ZG_20141212141331.jpg"}, "article.id": "73F9B00C-8227-11E4-AF25-E1D3FAAA89C3", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Right now, the added business Centene is seeing has very little to do with Obamacare, though that could change, Neidorff said.\nNeidorff sees a potential $138 billion market over the next several years, and he expects organic prosperity on the horizon.\nBut Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act have little to do with Centene\u2019s optimistic outlook, said Michael Neidorff, the St. Louis-based company\u2019s chairman and chief executive in a phone interview with MarketWatch.\nNeidorff said more business could come his company\u2019s way should more states adopt the Medicaid expansion.\nAnalysts polled by FactSet had projected earnings of $4.92 a share on sales of just under $20 billion for 2015."}
