CHICAGO (AP) — Reactions in the United States to the escape from Mexican prison of a reputed drug lord ranged from disbelief to outrage, with some observers saying it dramatically illustrated the need for captured cartel kingpins to be promptly extradited to the U.S.

A former administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency said he was dismayed by Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman’s weekend escape — apparently through a mile-long tunnel — from the Altiplano prison, 55 miles west of Mexico City.

“It is a shock that the most dangerous cartel leader in the world has escaped,” Peter Bensinger said Sunday. “He ought to have been housed in an American prison.”

The Chicago Crime Commission, an influential crime-fighting group, said the prison break meant Guzman will regain his title as Public Enemy No. 1 in Chicago, where his Sinaloa cartel has long dominated the cocaine and heroin trade.

“It’s clear that Mexican prisons are not equipped to hold Guzman,” said John Pastuovic. a spokesman for the non-governmental body. “This would not have occurred if he had been in an American prison.”

When the group attached the Public Enemy label to Guzman a year before his capture, it was the first time it had been used since it was applied in 1930 to Prohibition-era gangster Al Capone. The Chicago Crime Commission planned to formally restore the title to Guzman this week.

Several U.S. attorneys’ offices have indicted Guzman on federal trafficking charges, including in Chicago, where more than a dozen Guzman lieutenants have been successfully prosecuted and imprisoned. The U.S. had said after Guzman’s 2014 capture that it would file an extradition request, though it’s unclear if that already happened.
