However, the irony of this attack is thick, given how the Democrats have taken up the burden of fiscal responsibility in the modern era. The Republican Party has no choice but to dig deeply into the history books to find the last GOP president who actually bothered to leave the deficit in better shape than when he was inaugurated. Meanwhile, President Obama, like President Clinton before him, has seen the federal budget deficit fall by record numbers.\n\nAccording to a new report from the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Market Watch site, the federal government ran up a deficit of $439 billion for the 2015 fiscal year. That\u2019s 2.5 percent of GDP, which is the lowest level since 2007. Why is this significant? The Obama administration inherited a $1.4 trillion (with a \u201ct\u201d) budget deficit \u2014 driven in large part by stimulus spending meant to combat the financial crisis \u2014 which authorized George W. Bush in October 2008.\n\nSince then, Obama has presided over a gradual $1 trillion-dollar reduction in the deficit. Insofar as deficit reduction is important \u2014 and remember, according to the rhetoric of the GOP over the past several years, it is very important \u2014 this is a massive achievement for the Obama administration. Massive. And neither he nor the Democrats will get any credit for it.\n\n\n\nChart via Steve Benen\n\nIf Mitt Romney\u2019s lies about the deficit in 2012 were a predictor of the GOP\u2019s attack plan for 2016, we can expect to hear the Republican ticket attack both Obama and the Democratic nominee on this very issue. But they won\u2019t cite deficit numbers because, well, they\u2019re not nearly as dumb as they look. Instead, they\u2019ll recycle the Romney tactic of conflating the deficit and the national debt \u2014 two entirely separate numbers.\n\nFor example, Romney said during his first debate against Obama in 2012: \u201cThe president said he\u2019d cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it.\u201d Well, no. The deficit wasn\u2019t \u201cdoubled\u201d at all. It was the debt that rose, but analysts have repeatedly shown that the chief drivers of national debt were George W. Bush\u2019s wars, Medicare Part-D (a Bush-era policy) and the impact of the Great Recession \u2014 none of which was offset with higher taxes or spending cuts. Obama can hardly be blamed for all that.\n\nNot insignificantly, though, the Obama administration\u2019s deficit reduction has slowed the growth of the debt. In fact, the year-over-year increase in the debt has slowed to 10 percent. Compare that with the highest growth rate for the debt ever \u2014 13.4 percent per year under, yes, Ronald Reagan. We\u2019ll circle back to comparing the records of recent presidents in a second.\n\nMeanwhile, contra Romney, Obama promised to cut the deficit in half, and he did. It took him five years instead of four, but he did it. Suffice to say, when you hear the GOP talk about government spending, listen for their deliberate swapping of the terms \u201cdeficit\u201d and \u201cdebt.\u201d They do it a lot.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For six years, Republicans have pilloried Obama for out-of-control spending.
