In a country as diverse as ours, good people who have opposing views should be able to live side by side.\u201d\n\nThat statement \u2014 a live-and-let-live strategy that closely mirrors his brother George\u2019s approach to abortion a decade ago \u2014 underscored Bush\u2019s personal opposition to same-sex marriage as a devout Catholic. But more than anything, it revealed a maneuvering, modern conservative worried about his party being caught on the wrong side of history \u2014 whatever his personal view of the issue.\n\nDemocrats and many other Americans of varying political stripes enjoyed a feel-good national moment, but the GOP wasn\u2019t invited to the party \u2014 Republicans were worrying about how to keep from being trampled by the accelerating gallop of 21st-century social change.\n\n\u201cIn the state of Nevada, you can get married to a hooker who you met at the bar 30 minutes after meeting her with a blood alcohol level of 3.2 by an Elvis at a drive-through,\u201d said Steve Schmidt, who managed the 2008 presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s an untenable position to be against ultimately millions of actual Americans\u2019 marriages and commitments.\u201d\n\nRichard Land, the firebrand evangelical leader who wrote the famous letter urging Christians to support George W. Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq, summed up the view of many on the right tier of the Republican presidential field. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for the country, and now the battlefield shifts to freedom of conscience,\u201d he told POLITICO. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an important issue in 2016.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a matter of old-fashioned wedge politics, and Democrats are delighted at the growing roster of issues pulling the GOP backward through time. Last week, Southern Republicans were stunned by the wave of public, bipartisan sentiment against state-sanctioned displays of the Confederate flag in the wake of the Charleston massacre. After a stumbling start, local Republicans acted with deliberate speed, and not just in South Carolina: Alabama\u2019s Robert Bentley, one of the country\u2019s most conservative governors, ordered the rebel battle flag lowered over the capitol in Montgomery, where the Civil War was declared and George Wallace delivered his \u201csegregation forever\u201d speech.\n\nStill, many standard-issue Republican positions, though they remain regional political assets in the South and parts of the Midwest, are underwater: The GOP\u2019s blanket opposition to minimum-wage hikes, a more open immigration policy and background checks on guns and lockstep support for tough anti-abortion laws and tax breaks for the wealthy all poll relatively poorly.\n\n\u201cThe problem for the Republican Party is that you have a recalcitrant minority trying to hold off a tolerant majority,\u201d says David Boaz of the libertarian Cato Institute. \u201cThe increased salience of social issues is a challenge for Republicans. Candidates like Bush \u2014 who have to think about running in a general election \u2014 know there\u2019s a shift going on and they have to react. \u2026 That\u2019s why most of the [top-tier] candidates will try to avoid these issues. But the ones who aren\u2019t at that level, they are going to keep bringing them back.\u201d\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the most conservative of the top GOP candidates, put his rivals on notice by calling for a constitutional amendment to allow states to roll back the ruling. Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, accused \u201cfive unelected judges\u201d of redefining \u201cthe foundational unit that binds together our society.\u201d Mike Huckabee, a long-shot Arkansas ex-governor staking everything on an appeal to evangelicals, made an opaque reference to civil disobedience. \u201cI will not acquiesce to an imperial court any more than our Founders acquiesced to an imperial British monarch,\u201d he said in a statement as gay and lesbian couples were posting their plans to wed on thousands of Facebook pages. \u201cWe must resist and reject judicial tyranny, not retreat.\u201d\n\nThat may be smart primary politics in states like Iowa, but it\u2019s a potentially toxic general-election position. Six out of 10 Republican voters oppose gay marriage \u2014 but most national polls show that between 54 percent and 57 percent of American voters as a whole back same-sex marriage, a number that has increased dramatically in the past five years. Ominously for GOP candidates, 60 percent of young Republicans support the court\u2019s move. Even among white evangelical Protestants, support for gay marriage has increased from 13 percent in 2001 to about 27 percent today, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nThe culture wars of the past three decades have taken their toll on the conservative brand. Self-declared conservatives still outnumber liberals, but Ronald Reagan\u2019s success at turning the L-word into an epithet has come undone. Gallup polling out last week suggested 24 percent of Americans identify as liberal, a high-water mark since at least 1992. Though at 38 percent, self-identified conservatives still outnumber them, it\u2019s a sign of new muscle for the left.\n\nWith numbers like these, the Republican establishment is eager to shove most social issues into the closet for 2016 \u2014 as they did successfully in the 2014 midterms, when the party showcased candidates like Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, camera-ready social conservatives who are less likely to push their agenda than a previous generation of candidates.\n\n\u201cFrom the top down, you are seeing Republicans really trying to thread the needle on this issue, to remain consistently opposed to marriage equality while not trying to alienate voters in the general election,\u201d said Gregory Angelo, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, a group that has long advocated for the rights of gay and lesbian conservatives.\n\nEven Angelo, who celebrated the ruling, is eager to put it behind Republicans \u2014 and urged the 2016 presidential candidates to focus on issues he believes should dominate the election: the economy, Hillary Clinton\u2019s woes, and the Obama administration\u2019s struggle to fight the Islamic State. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to go away,\u201d he said of the gay-marriage divide. \u201cBut there are civil wars on the Democratic side as well. It\u2019s no accident that Bernie Sanders is surging in New Hampshire \u2014 it\u2019s not that his opinion on marriage is doing that \u2014 it\u2019s about income inequality and immigration and issues where he\u2019s beating Clinton.\u201d\n\nStill, all the GOP infighting has obscured the tortured history of the gay-marriage issue in the Democratic Party on victory-lap day.\n\nBoth Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton flat-out refused to endorse marriage equality in the 2008 campaign \u2014 when it didn\u2019t poll quite as well as it does these days \u2014 and initially refused to condemn a senior Bush administration official who declared homosexuality \u201cimmoral.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett this week from tweeting Obama\u2019s observation that \u201cWhen I became President, same sex marriage was legal in only two states\u201d \u2014 a time when he was still evolving on the issue.\n\nOver the past several years, Democrats have largely closed ranks over social issues \u2014 in part because young voters tend to be socially liberal, in part because more conservative Democrats have been defeated by Republicans or frog-marched out of the party.\n\nThe court did the GOP a big favor, though, by disposing of the gay marriage (and Obamacare) rulings six months before the first primary ballots are cast, giving the Republican camps time to sort out their differences. For the moment, the most unifying default position for Republicans is to blame the Roberts court for the Obamacare and marriage decisions, even though evangelicals played a critical role in winning the appointments of its ostensibly conservative majority. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s response to the marriage decision was dour enough, but his disappointment was directed more at the court than at backers of the marriage equality movement. \u201cWe live in a republic and must abide by the law,\u201d Rubio said in a more-in-sorrow-than-anger statement. \u201cAs we look ahead, it must be a priority of the next president to nominate judges and justices committed to applying the Constitution as written and originally understood.\u201d\n\nBut no serious candidate has steered as close to the center on gay marriage as Bush. He supported Indiana\u2019s anti-gay-marriage religious freedom law, then subsequently told donors he wanted to avoid all \u201cthe yelling and screaming\u201d of the debate.\n\nBut the demands of the GOP debate and primary process are sure to drag everyone to the right \u2014 because white, religious-minded social conservatives participate in disproportionate numbers. By wedging moderate New Hampshire between social-conservative bastions like Iowa and New Hampshire, Republican presidential candidates are forced into rhetorical contortions that muddy their messages and force them to mix conservative nostalgia with a wink to trending, moderate undercurrents.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of social conservatives in Iowa and South Carolina, and you\u2019ve got more a pragmatic or, I guess, an economic electorate in places like New Hampshire and Michigan and probably Florida,\u201d said Craig Stevens, a Republican activist in the Granite State. \u201cFolks are picking their battleground.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of the gay marriage ruling, Stevens said establishment-oriented candidates are pantomiming another Bush \u2014 George W. Bush \u2014 who walked the finest of lines on abortion: He acknowledged Roe v. Wade as the law of the land but urged the nation to reduce the number of abortions. The parallel, Schmidt said, would be a call to \u201censure that marriage is strong in America\u201d and reject incursions on religious institutions whose faith precludes same-sex unions.\n\nIt was George W. Bush and his aide Karl Rove who saw the Republican Party\u2019s demographic nightmare coming 15 years ago, when they pushed conservatives to embrace immigration reform as a way to woo young Hispanic voters. And gay marriage, above all else, is a generational issue.\n\n\u201cWe look at this issue as left and right to some degree. It\u2019s really under 40-over 40. Under-40 Republicans support the ruling,\u201d said Schmidt, who thinks Walker should drop his marriage amendment idea for the sake of the party.\n\n\u201cSupport for gay marriage is not going to start suddenly contracting now that it\u2019s legal everywhere,\u201d he added. \u201cThis will be the last presidential election where you have Republicans trapped into the positions they have on this issue because it\u2019s no longer a political issue. This is a settled issue now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Republicans fumble for answers in an America changing faster than they are.", "title": "The Grand Old Party's future shock", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/the-grand-old-partys-future-shock-119484.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/26/150626_jeb_bush_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Rick Santorum,Gay Marriage,2016 Elections,Scott Walker,Supreme Court,Jeb Bush,John McCain,Elections,Mike Huckabee,Cory Gardner,Republicans,Politics,Wisconsin,Jeb Bush 2016", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Republicans fumble for answers in an America changing faster than they are.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd890\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSupport for gay marriage is not going to start suddenly contracting now that it\u2019s legal everywhere,\u201d he added.\nEven among white evangelical Protestants, support for gay marriage has increased from 13 percent in 2001 to about 27 percent today, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\u201cThe increased salience of social issues is a challenge for Republicans.\nOminously for GOP candidates, 60 percent of young Republicans support the court\u2019s move.\nAnd gay marriage, above all else, is a generational issue."}
