Marie. Walt. Lydia. Skylar (sic.) Jesse. Badger and Skinny Pete. \"Hello Gretchen.\"\n\nAll trends pertaining to the #BreakingBadFinale Sunday.\n\nThere was, of course, #GoodbyeBreakingBad, the on-screen hashtag provided by AMC for the series finale. But there were other tributes, such as the periodic table-minded \"BrBa.\"\n\nNot only did the episode garner a series best of 10.3 million viewers \u2014 it started the second half of its last season with 5.9 million \u2014 Nielsen's SocialGuide reported 1,472,793 tweets surrounding the finale. (Compare to the Patriots-Falcons football game on NBC with 471,926 tweets.)\n\nJesse, I love you and you will always be a part of me. Thanks for the memories. Your friend, Aaron \u2014 Aaron Paul (@aaronpaul_8) September 30, 2013\n\nThe show was trending as late as Thursday, with events from the conclusion of the Walter White saga (another trend was \"Damn Walt,\" an exclamation previously used during this season) still being weighed and dissected.\n\nAt the same time, anything to do with the drama's cast \u2014 including new roles for its actors \u2014 propelled the hype.\n\n\"Breaking Bad\" was a Sunday Google Trend, with more than 2 million searches.\n\nAaron Paul, meanwhile, was the No. 10 most-searched item for the night. As the episode unfolded, \"Need for Speed,\" Paul's upcoming action movie based on the video game franchise, trended on the strength of a trailer during the commercial break.\n\nIt is not a dream. It is thoughts of a diseased and dying mind. \u2014 Norm Macdonald (@normmacdonald) October 4, 2013\n\nIn connection with his appearance on \"Talking Bad,\" the live post-show chat, tweets also lionized \"Breaking Bad\" creator Vince Gilligan.\n\nLater, famous superfan Norm Macdonald, the comedian, got a fair amount of chatter for a theory explaining the last episode \u2014 Walt, he claimed in a series of tweets, was actually only thinking (or \"sick dreaming\") the final sequences.\n\n\n\nWashington\n\nAccompanying \"Breaking Bad\" in recurring Twitter trends was #governmentshutdown, Sunday's No. 1 Google search. Government was in high focus as #Obamacare came to the fore when open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act began on Tuesday, spurring #Healthcare and #GetCovered hashtags.\n\nBut on Thursday, when reports of a shooting near the U.S. Capitol hit Twitter, #governmentshutdown returned to prominence, along with #shutdown.\n\nEven though a Capitol on \"lockdown\" was seemingly the news of the day \u2014 details emerged about a Connecticut woman named Miriam Carey who was shot dead by police after ramming a car into the White House barricade \u2014 tweets riffed on whether or not various federal personnel would be paid during the time. Carey entered the Google Trends Thursday, with more than 500,000 searches for her name.\n\nThen, yesterday, National Mall trended as reports filtered in of a man setting himself on fire there.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the headlines\n\nThere was no lack of book titles to cite Wednesday as tweets spread the news \u2014 Tom Clancy had died.\n\n\"RIP Tom Clancy,\" tweets read, and the author trended globally as novels \"The Hunt for Red October,\" \"Rainbow Six\" and Clancy protagonist Jack Ryan circulated worldwide. More than 1 million Google searches went to the writer that day.\n\nBut another name, one not usually seen in trends lists, became the subject of 200,000 searches Wednesday.\n\nRonan Farrow, son of Mia, was being scrutinized for how much he does (or doesn't) look like Frank Sinatra. In an interview for Vanity Fair, Mia Farrow said it was possible that her ex-husband Sinatra, not Woody Allen \u2014 her partner at the time \u2014 was Ronan's father. For his part, Ronan, 25, responded in the best possible way \u2014 with a good-humored tweet.\n\n\"Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son,\" he posted. (See another gem of his below).\n\nOn Thursday, Sinead O'Connor topped Twitter for her letter to Miley Cyrus.\n\nYou say skanky, I say YOLOsexual. \u2014 Ronan Farrow (@RonanFarrow) September 21, 2013\n\nCyrus had posed topless for Rolling Stone and in an interview with the magazine likened her own music video to O'Connor's \"Nothing Compares 2 U.\" O'Connor took Cyrus to task, warning her of the dangers of \"pimping\" herself as a sexual object in the music industry.\n\nAnd with 50,000 searches by Thursday, Tropical Storm Karen reminded anyone who forgot that it is, indeed, hurricane season.\n\n\n\nTrending is a weekly column monitoring Twitter, Google and the web.
