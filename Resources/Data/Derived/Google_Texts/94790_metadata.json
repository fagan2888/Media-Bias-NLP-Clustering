Two firms \u2014 Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood \u2014 contend that complying with the law would violate their owners\u2019 religious principles, so the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) demands that the government grant the companies an exception from the rule. We think the firms are wrong.\n\nCongress has wide authority to regulate the public marketplace; that shouldn\u2019t be at issue. But how much did Congress limit itself when it said, in RFRA, that a person\u2019s religious practices can be \u201csubstantially burdened\u201d only when doing so is critical to pursuing a \u201ccompelling governmental interest?\u201d\n\nThe government and its supporters argue that this case doesn\u2019t require the court even to get to that question. Even if corporations\u2019 or their owners\u2019 religious rights are implicated here \u2014 big ifs \u2014 no one\u2019s religious practices are being burdened to a \u201csubstantial\u201d degree. Neither the companies nor their proprietors are involved in the decision of any employee to obtain or use the birth control methods to which they object, and there is no net insurance cost to providing unfettered access to birth control, since unintended pregnancies are expensive.\n\nThat would be good enough for us to throw these cases out. But let\u2019s assume the court moves past these arguments and addresses the question of what legal protections Congress meant to confer on corporation owners via RFRA. It ought to find that the governmental interest in advancing its contraception rule is \u201ccompelling,\u201d and that its means are reasonable. Like it or not, most Americans with private insurance get it through their employers . Congress did not blow up this system as it reformed the health-insurance industry. Rather, lawmakers were obliged to work within and around it to accomplish a variety of worthy public health goals.\n\nOne goal was to provide adequate coverage to women. A panel of independent experts \u2014 not liberal ideologues in Congress \u2014 determined that assuring access to a range of birth control products to all women, not just those who could afford it, would convey major public health benefits. It\u2019s true that some non-compliant plans here and there were grandfathered in \u2014 but they will phase out, making the rule comprehensive.\n\nUnder U.S. law, corporations get substantial privileges, such as limits on owners\u2019 financial liability. Now, they have been asked to take on responsibilities, such as providing decent health-care coverage, with the aid of massive tax subsidies. Not every American of every creed will be comfortable with reasonable, general rules that extend across the marketplace \u2014 requiring vaccinations, say, or prohibiting discrimination against women in the workplace. But it\u2019s not feasible for a corporation to easily opt out of any generally beneficial law that happens to offend its owners. That is a principle vital to maintaining a functional, pluralistic democracy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The government has reason to protect contraceptive coverage.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The government has reason to protect contraceptive coverage.", "title": "The Post\u2019s View: The government must protect contraceptive coverage", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-governments-compelling-interest-in-protecting-contraceptive-coverage/2014/03/24/c76dc5c8-b399-11e3-8020-b2d790b3c9e1_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/03/24/Editorial-Opinion/Images/2014-03-05T184852Z_01_GAC17_RTRIDSP_3_USA-COURT-SECURITIES.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "postopinions"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-governments-compelling-interest-in-protecting-contraceptive-coverage/2014/03/24/c76dc5c8-b399-11e3-8020-b2d790b3c9e1_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "contraception mandate, court contraception, contraception supreme court, aca mandate, obamacare mandate, obamacare contraception mandate, obamacare case, obamacare supreme court, aca supreme court, aca contraception mandate, employer mandate, hobby lobby, hobby lobby case", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions"}, "eomportal-uuid": "c76dc5c8-b399-11e3-8020-b2d790b3c9e1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "contraception mandate, court contraception, contraception supreme court, aca mandate, obamacare mandate, obamacare contraception mandate, obamacare case, obamacare supreme court, aca supreme court, aca contraception mandate, employer mandate, hobby lobby, hobby lobby case"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ed9\"", "article_summary": "Even if corporations\u2019 or their owners\u2019 religious rights are implicated here \u2014 big ifs \u2014 no one\u2019s religious practices are being burdened to a \u201csubstantial\u201d degree.\nIt ought to find that the governmental interest in advancing its contraception rule is \u201ccompelling,\u201d and that its means are reasonable.\nNow, they have been asked to take on responsibilities, such as providing decent health-care coverage, with the aid of massive tax subsidies.\nBut it\u2019s not feasible for a corporation to easily opt out of any generally beneficial law that happens to offend its owners.\nCongress has wide authority to regulate the public marketplace; that shouldn\u2019t be at issue."}
