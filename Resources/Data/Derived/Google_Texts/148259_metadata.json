(Photo: Andrew Ford // ASBURY PARK PRESS)Buy Photo\n\nOCEANPORT \u2013 Justine Talarico stood across the street from her burned business of 41 years, Just Hair and Nails. She looked past policemen and firefighters as they extinguished the last of a three-alarm blaze Friday night. She said after Superstorm Sandy left her salon under two feet of water, she was up and running within a week. She said she\u2019d quickly rebuild after this fire.\n\nThen she saw inside.\n\nShe got close enough to her shop to peek through the entrance. Hair products were still neatly lined up in front of the mirrors along one wall, the floor was soaked and dirty, the front window was grimy from smoke, firefighters blasted ceiling tiles with a hose.\n\nTalarico gasped. This damage was worse than the storm.\n\nTalarico\u2019s business was one of three in the building damaged in the fire, which began at about 9 p.m., according to Oceanport Police Lt. Michael Kelly. Talarico\u2019s salon and adjoining Enzo\u2019s Deli and Pizza suffered \u201csignificant\u201d damage, Kelly said. An adjacent post office endured lighter smoke and water damage.\n\nOne firefighter was taken to a hospital to be examined after suffering from heat exhaustion, according to Kelly. Nobody else was injured.\n\nAuthorities believe the fire started near the back of the businesses. They\u2019re investigating the cause, but have no reason to believe it is suspicious.\n\nAuthorities had the fire under control in about 15 minutes, Kelly said. They spent another hour and half extinguishing hot spots and examining the building.\n\nBuy Photo Just Hair and Nails was one of three Oceanport businesses damaged in a fire Friday night.

At 24, her parents spotted a vacant shop and helped her start her business. She payed them back and stayed in the same shop ever since.\n\nTalarico and her employees cleared their appointments for the weekend, expecting crowds and traffic for Sunday\u2019s William Hill Haskell Invitational horse race, which will take place just a few blocks away.\n\nBut she has to work quickly to find a way to serve customers and keep her business.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t lose your business,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t work, I\u2019m going to lose my customers.\u201d\n\nAndrew Ford: 732-643-4281; aford3@gannettnj.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1IaZ55v", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Three businesses were damaged in a fire on Friday night in Oceanport.
