If so, how many, where and using whose equipment?\u201d\n\nIn response, the MoD said: \u201cUK military personnel embedded with the USA, French and Canadian armed forces have been authorized to deploy with their units to participate in coalition operations against Isil. UK embeds operate as if they were the host nation\u2019s personnel, under that nation\u2019s chain of command. These personnel include pilots flying\u2026 strike missions against Isil targets using the equipment of those units. Of these three nations only the USA and Canada are operating in Syrian airspace.\u201d\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe reply means that UK pilots have been involved in airstrikes in Syria, under the command of U.S. or Canadian forces.\n\nThe UK is participating in the bombings despite the fact that the House of Commonsrejected military intervention in Syria in a vote two years ago. Moreover, Defense Secretary Michael Fallon previously pledged to hold a parliamentary vote before launching airstrikes in Syria, but no such vote has taken place.\n\n\u201cIt is alarming that Parliament and the public have been kept in the dark about this for so long,\u201d said Jennifer Gibson, Reprieve staff attorney. \u201cYet more worrying is the fact that the UK seems to have turned over its personnel to the US wholesale, without the slightest idea as to what they are actually doing, and whether it is legal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need an open and honest debate about UK involvement in Iraq and Syria,\u201d Gibson added. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that, though, until the UK comes clean about what actions its personnel are already undertaking.\u201d\n\nThe UK has been carrying out airstrikes in Iraq since last September.\n\nThe Stop the War Coalition said Friday\u2019s revelations \u201creveal both the government\u2019s contempt for democracy and its subservience to Washington foreign policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop the War demands the government publicly commits to an immediate end to British bombing of Syria,\u201d the organization continued. \u201cMore widely we call for an end to military and diplomatic support for Saudi Arabia in its war on Yemen and for a stop to the bombing campaign in Iraq.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn \u2018Subservience\u2019 to Washington, British Pilots Secretly Bombing Syria\u201d is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License", "article_metadata": {"description": "Airstrikes are being conducted without parliamentary approval, Reprieve learned through a freedom of information request., airstrikes, Middle East, Reprieve, Syria, US-UK relations,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Sarah Lazare | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Airstrikes are being conducted without parliamentary approval, Reprieve learned through a freedom of information request., airstrikes, Middle East, Reprieve, Syria, US-UK relations,", "title": "British Pilots Secretly Bombing Syria On Behalf Of U.S.", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/in-subservience-to-washington-british-pilots-secretly-bombing-syria/207691/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Northrop-800x449.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-17T16:27:38-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Airstrikes are being conducted without parliamentary approval, Reprieve learned through a freedom of information request., airstrikes, Middle East, Reprieve, Syria, US-UK relations,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Northrop.jpg", "title": "British Pilots Secretly Bombing Syria On Behalf Of U.S.", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "US-UK relations", "published_time": "2015-07-18T05:00:51-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-17T16:27:38-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0734\"", "article_summary": "In \u2018Subservience\u2019 To Washington, British Pilots Secretly Bombing SyriaAirstrikes are being conducted without parliamentary approval, Reprieve learned through a freedom of information request.\nIn the initial request, Reprieve asked the Ministry of Defense (MoD): \u201cHave any UK military personnel conducted airstrikes in Syria or Iraq using non-UK equipment?\n\u201cMore widely we call for an end to military and diplomatic support for Saudi Arabia in its war on Yemen and for a stop to the bombing campaign in Iraq.\u201d\u201cIn \u2018Subservience\u2019 to Washington, British Pilots Secretly Bombing Syria\u201d is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License\nMoreover, Defense Secretary Michael Fallon previously pledged to hold a parliamentary vote before launching airstrikes in Syria, but no such vote has taken place.\nThese personnel include pilots flying\u2026 strike missions against Isil targets using the equipment of those units."}
