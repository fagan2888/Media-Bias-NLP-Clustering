Eaves defeated Republican challenger Earl Cooper with 63 percent of the vote to Cooper\u2019s 36 percent in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nAccording to Eaves, \u201cI look forward to continuing to roll up my sleeves, doing what I can, and work with friends, neighbors, constituents and business folk in trying to make our county the greatest county that it can possibly be.\u201d\n\nEaves promoted a platform of a strong healthcare delivery system, which includes Grady Memorial Hospital, criminal justice reform, and economic development. Asked about the future of Grady, Eaves says, \u201cpeople need to be reminded that Grady was about to close seven years ago, and Fulton County stepped up to the plate. We infused about 100 million dollars into their budget. We changed the government structure of the hospital.\u201d And now Grady, according to Eaves, is operating in the black, serving more than 600,000 people a year. But, he says, \u201cGrady still has a way to go. I think continued financial, consistent support from Fulton County is essential.\u201d Eaves says he thinks with the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, championed by President Barack Obama, there still is greater opportunity for more people to be served. And while he admits it might be a dim hope, Eaves says that Medicare expansion would provide more access to affordable healthcare.\n\nFulton County Commissioner Emma Darnell defeated Republican Abraham Watson, taking more than 91 percent of the vote. It means Democrats keep their decades-long control of Fulton County Government. Four of the seven seats on the commission will be held by democrats.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "affordable care act, atlanta ga, democrats maintain control of fulton county commission, emma darnell, fulton county commission, grady memorial hospital, john eaves, maria boynton, president barack obama, v103, waok, wvee", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://atlanta.cbslocal.com/2014/11/06/democrats-maintain-control-of-fulton-county-commission/", "image": {"width": 1195, "secure_url": "https://cbsatlanta.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/jeaves.jpg?w=1195", "identifier": "https://cbsatlanta.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/jeaves.jpg?w=1195", "height": 1500}, "type": "article", "title": "Democrats Maintain Control Of Fulton County Commission"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsatlanta.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/jeaves.jpg?w=1195", "site": "/929TheGame", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Democrats Maintain Control Of Fulton County Commission"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Atlanta", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Atlanta", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/929TheGame", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/929TheGame"}, "keywords": "budget, business, civil rights, general assembly, government, legal, local, news, politics, affordable care act, atlanta ga, democrats maintain control of fulton county commission, emma darnell, fulton county commission, grady memorial hospital, john eaves, maria boynton, president barack obama, v103, waok, wvee", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://atlanta.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/cb20f2b3d78ee0558d63058cc2a0f9ae?s=16"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI certainly want to thank the constituents of Fulton County\u201d, says Eaves, \u201cI got almost 160,000 votes yesterday\u201d.\nIt means Democrats keep their decades-long control of Fulton County Government.\nFulton County Commission Chairman John Eaves has been re-elected to a third term.\nFulton County Commissioner Emma Darnell defeated Republican Abraham Watson, taking more than 91 percent of the vote.\nEaves defeated Republican challenger Earl Cooper with 63 percent of the vote to Cooper\u2019s 36 percent in Tuesday\u2019s election."}
