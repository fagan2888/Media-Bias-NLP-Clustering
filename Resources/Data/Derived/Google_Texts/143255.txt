People seeking insurance coverage that starts on Jan. 1 through the Covered California marketplace face a Tuesday deadline.

Covered California is the exchange created through the Affordable Care Act and is intended to provide coverage to people without insurance. Subsidies are available for those who meet income standards.

Open enrollment for 2016 coverage began in November and continues through Jan. 31. But coverage will start later for people who enroll after Dec. 15.

"Everyone who needs health insurance, or knows someone who does, should know they can get financial help to pay for top-brand health insurance coverage and if they enroll by Dec. 15, their coverage can start on Jan. 1," said Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee in a Los Angeles event on Tuesday.
