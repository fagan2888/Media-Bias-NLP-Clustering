It\u2019s located in the Fortymile Mining District.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cImagine coming up to your diggings, only to see agents swarming over it like ants, wearing full body armor, with jackets that say POLICE emblazoned on them, and all packing side arms,\u201d said Dick Hammond, who works at the Chicken gold mine site.\n\nThe situation sparked a frenzy among conservative commentators, who referred to the armed Environmental Crimes Task Force as an example of the Environmental Protection Agency taking things to an unnecessary level. The EPA defended its armed approach, claiming it received a tip from local law enforcement that the area near the Chicken mine was located in the midst of a drug trafficking zone.\n\nLocal politicians and residents aren\u2019t buying it, claiming it\u2019s a phony excuse by the EPA to take an over-the-top approach to environmental violations \u2014 or crimes, as the EPA sees it.\n\n\u201cThis seems to have been a heavy-handed, and heavy-armed approach,\u201d Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) told the Alaska Dispatch. \u201cWhy was it so confrontational? The EPA really didn\u2019t have any good answers for this.\u201d\n\nThe armed environmental officers\u2019 raid in Alaska follows outrage from Wisconsin residents, who in July claimed a mining company was taking things too far when it hired armed paramilitary troops to protect the site of a proposed iron ore mine from area residents and environmental activists.\n\nThe debate then between environmental activists was the same one being posed by mining advocates throughout the U.S.: Was that really necessary?\n\nWhile the EPA was monitoring alleged crimes committed by the mining industry that have the potential of creating health issues and damage to the environment, the mining companies were allegedly attempting to halt area residents from damaging property.\n\nWhat were officers after?\n\nThe question posed now is whether the AETF went too far in their quest to discover whether the mine was violating section 404 of the Clean Water Act, which relates to the regulation of toxic discharge.\n\n\u201cAny person who wilfully or negligently violates any condition or limitation in a permit issued by the Secretary under this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than $2,500 nor more than $25,000 per day of violation, or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or by both,\u201d the EPA states under Section 404(4)(a) of the Clean Water Act.\n\nThe fine for a second conviction could reach $50,000 per day of violation, or two years in prison \u2014 or both. As noted within the Act, \u201cperson\u201d could be defined as \u201cany responsible corporate officer.\u201d\n\nThe Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation\u2019s Environmental Crimes Unit defines an environmental crime as \u201can environmental violation for which the State Legislature and/or the U.S. Congress have provided criminal sanctions.\u201d\n\nAs noted on the site, violations of environmental crimes, like others, can lead to prison time and criminal fees. As noted on the website, illegal discharge of contaminants into the state\u2019s water sources tops the list as violations deemed to be environmental crimes, as they violate the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.\n\nAlaska\u2019s gold mining industry doesn\u2019t have a clean slate when it comes to compliance with the Clean Water Act. In 2012, the EPA fined Alaska Gold Company more than $177,000 for allegedly violating that law at the company\u2019s Rock Creek Mine.\n\nThe area was inspected by the state\u2019s Environmental Crimes Unit, which discovered that discharge from the mine was contaminating area water sources.\n\nThe team conducted six inspections at the mine between 2009 and 2011, revealing the violations.\n\nMultiple violations were cited throughout the course of the spot investigations, including drainage channels without rock armoring, which led to bank erosion and sloughing of channel walls, according to the press release.\n\nThe EPA also noted the company did not create a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan that met standards relating to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System General Permit \u2014 a serious problem, considering the area has two tributaries to the Snake River, which feeds into the Bering Sea.\n\n\u201cPolluted runoff can damage important habitat and harm Alaska\u2019s natural resources,\u201d Jeff KenKnight, the EPA\u2019s manager for Clean Water Act compliance in Seattle, Wa., said in a press release. \u201cCompanies need to plan for and manage stormwater runoff from their construction sites, and investing the time and energy upfront is always better than repairing damage and paying penalties later.\u201d\n\nDrug trafficking concerns?\n\nAside from possible discharge from the gold mine, Sean Doogan of the Alaska Dispatch indicated there was a recent conference call among the EPA, Alaska Congressional delegates and staff, along with state officers.\n\nDoogan stated that one Senate staffer indicated the federal agency sent in the armed task force because it received information from local law enforcement that there was \u201crampant drug and human trafficking\u201d in the area.\n\n\u201cTheir explanation \u2014 that there are concerns within the area of rampant drug trafficking and human trafficking going on \u2014 sounds wholly concocted to me,\u201d Murkowski said.\n\nThe Alaska State Troopers denied any tips to the EPA regarding drug activity in the area.\n\nOne area miner told the Dispatch that having environmental inspectors at area mines was nothing new, but said the manner in which they conducted themselves was.\n\n\u201cCompliance exams are a normal thing for miners,\u201d David Linkins, a gold miner, told the Dispatch. \u201cUsually the BLM [Bureau of Land Management] or DEC [Department of Conservation] points out a problem and you correct it. This was way over the top and uncalled for. It was a massive show of intimidation.\u201d\n\nCalls made by Mint Press News to the state\u2019s Environmental Crimes Unit regarding the raid were not immediately returned.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some locals are crying foul after Alaska Environmental Task Force officers took a heavy-handed approach to enforcing the Clean Water Act., Alaska, Alaska Environmental Task Force, Clean Water Act, EPA, Mining, pollution,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Trisha Marczak", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Some locals are crying foul after Alaska Environmental Task Force officers took a heavy-handed approach to enforcing the Clean Water Act., Alaska, Alaska Environmental Task Force, Clean Water Act, EPA, Mining, pollution,", "title": "EPA Sends Armed Officers To Storm Alaska Gold Mine", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/epa-sends-armed-officers-to-storm-alaska-gold-mine/168457/", "image": "http://mnpprodpublic.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/090513_chickenalaska_16x9.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-05T17:59:56-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some locals are crying foul after Alaska Environmental Task Force officers took a heavy-handed approach to enforcing the Clean Water Act., Alaska, Alaska Environmental Task Force, Clean Water Act, EPA, Mining, pollution,", "title": "EPA Sends Armed Officers To Storm Alaska Gold Mine", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/090513_chickenalaska_4x3.jpg", "creator": "@TrishaMarczakMP", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: Health & Lifestyle", "tag": "pollution", "published_time": "2013-09-06T05:00:27-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-05T17:59:56-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb23\"", "article_summary": "EPA Sends Armed Officers To Storm Alaska Gold MineSome locals are crying foul after Alaska Environmental Task Force officers took a heavy-handed approach to enforcing the Clean Water Act.\nIn 2012, the EPA fined Alaska Gold Company more than $177,000 for allegedly violating that law at the company\u2019s Rock Creek Mine.\nAlaska\u2019s gold mining industry doesn\u2019t have a clean slate when it comes to compliance with the Clean Water Act.\nAside from possible discharge from the gold mine, Sean Doogan of the Alaska Dispatch indicated there was a recent conference call among the EPA, Alaska Congressional delegates and staff, along with state officers.\nThe situation sparked a frenzy among conservative commentators, who referred to the armed Environmental Crimes Task Force as an example of the Environmental Protection Agency taking things to an unnecessary level."}
