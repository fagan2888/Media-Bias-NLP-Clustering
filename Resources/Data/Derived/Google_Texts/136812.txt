The recent fallout in Iraq has hit President Barack Obama’s foreign policy ratings, knocking them to a steep low in the past month.

A striking 58 percent of Americans, including nearly a third of Democrats, are dissatisfied with the president’s foreign policy decisions, an all-time high for the New York Times/CBS News Poll since Obama took office

“I voted for him because he said, ‘Give me four more years and I will fix everything,’ but nothing is being fixed,” Michelle Roberts, a Democrat from Salem, Mass., told the New York Times.
