Christine Hunsinger MPA\u201908, CEO of BGP Strategies, also spoke.\n\nRhode Island\u2019s health insurance exchange, HealthSource R.I., has outperformed most other states\u2019 systems in the year since it opened to the marketplace but faces challenges of balancing competing stakeholder interests, budget problems and collaboration with state agencies, said invited speakers of a Taubman Center for Public Policy and American Institutions panel discussion Wednesday afternoon.\n\nChristine Ferguson, director of HealthSource R.I., and Christine Hunsinger MPA\u201908, CEO of political communications consulting firm BGP Strategies, spoke about the origins and future of the exchange, set up as part of the Affordable Care Act to help connect consumers with different health insurance options.\n\nHunsinger, a former spokesperson for Gov. Lincoln Chafee \u201974 P\u201914 P\u201917 and HealthSource R.I., opened the discussion by providing background on the history of the health exchange, which came under Ferguson\u2019s direction in June 2012 after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA, allowing the formation of HealthSource R.I. to progress.\n\nThe exchange opened for pre-enrollment last October and coverage became available Jan. 1.\n\nFerguson was charged with the unique task of building a government agency from the ground up, Hunsinger said, adding that Ferguson collaborated with the office of Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts \u201978 and other stakeholders on the project.\n\nSince then, HealthSource R.I. has fared well compared with other states\u2019 exchanges. Rhode Island ranked second nationally for its rate of health insurance enrollments, exceeding the federal enrollment threshold as of March.\n\n\u201cRhode Island\u2019s not often touted as a leader in anything. Every time we make the top of a list, it\u2019s a bad list. And every time there\u2019s a good list, we\u2019re at the bottom. But this is different,\u201d Hunsinger said, adding that it was notable the state excelled at an initiative at the top of the national agenda.\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health and Human Services, the lieutenant governor, the Department of Administration and the governor\u2019s office were the government stakeholders involved in planning HealthSource R.I. and setting up the rules of the exchange.\n\n\u201cAt the leadership table, there are four different agencies with four different competing sets of interests. So it makes it challenging and very collaborative and sometimes very loud,\u201d Hunsinger said.\n\n\u201cThe providers don\u2019t really have a seat at the table right now,\u201d Hunsinger said, attributing this setup to the state\u2019s relatively small size and the power of health insurance companies.\n\nFerguson\u2019s vision of the exchange is straightforward: Providing consumers with clear information about health insurance plans will do a better job of reforming health care than legislation. Consumers can use a tool like HealthSource R.I., which includes an online platform and customer service representatives, to make educated decisions about the best insurance plan for them.\n\nGiving consumers, especially business owners, the information they need to make informed choices is key, Ferguson said. People who are confused by the process have never had to purchase insurance before but are now required to under the ACA, she added. This population segment includes small business owners, many of whom have not been involved because they were not previously mandated to buy insurance for their employees, Ferguson said. \u201cNo one\u2019s made it possible for them to even understand what the hell they\u2019re buying.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe health insurance carriers listen every year to people\u2019s feet,\u201d Ferguson said, adding that consumer behavior impacts companies\u2019 pricing and coverage. Consumers now can call HealthSource R.I. if they are dissatisfied with their plan, which enables the exchange to track problems and inform consumers, she said. \u201cYou fundamentally have to believe that competition drives innovation, price and quality.\u201d\n\nFerguson said HealthSource R.I.\u2019s structure and objectives differ from other states\u2019 exchange platforms. \u201cThe differences of HealthSource R.I. make \u201cpeople really uncomfortable because God forbid that we should do something different,\u201d she said in a sarcastic tone.\n\nRhode Island did a lot of outreach to the community during the open enrollment period and expanded its Medicaid program for enrollees, The Herald previously reported. A November 2013 report from the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council, a nonprofit and nonpartisan public policy group in Providence, found that HealthSource R.I. had the lowest premiums of the New England states\u2019 exchanges, \u201cproceeded with minimal technical obstacles\u201d and offered a variety of available plans for small business owners. But RIPEC also concluded that Rhode Island lacked \u201csustainable funding mechanisms\u201d for HealthSource R.I. and the state needed to find a place to maintain the program within the government.\n\n\u201cThere has never ever been an opportunity like this in the 30 years that I\u2019ve been working in this field,\u201d Ferguson said, adding that there will not likely be a chance to implement similar health care reforms for the next half century.\n\nIf HealthSource R.I. were made a state agency, it would facilitate collaboration with other parts of Rhode Island\u2019s government, but it would also create bureaucratic challenges, such as hiring or setting a budget, which \u201cmake it very difficult to respond quickly,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cDoing things in the public sector means every decision you make and every experiment you try has to succeed,\u201d she added.\n\nLegislation that would make HealthSource R.I. \u201ca quasi-independent agency\u201d making it separate from the government and allowing it to \u201cmove at the speed of a business,\u201d was introduced during Ferguson\u2019s first year.\n\n\u201cThe legislation was a political hot potato,\u201d Hunsinger said.\n\nThe General Assembly ended its legislative period before passing the bill because of resistance from anti-abortion lawmakers since all the plans offered by the exchange covered abortions, Hunsinger said. As a result, the exchange remained under the purview of the governor\u2019s office.\n\nBut when Chafee decided not to run for re-election, he also decided to let the next governor decide what to do with the state health exchange, she said.\n\nCranston Mayor and Republican candidate for governor Allan Fung would scale down the exchange, or possibly regionalize it by working with Massachusetts and Connecticut, Hunsinger said. General Treasurer and Democratic nominee Gina Raimondo would keep the exchange but reduce its budget. Moderate Party candidate Robert Healey wants to turn the exchange over to the federal government, she said.\n\nThe budget for the exchange under the new governor would be between $17 and $23 million, but health care represents 21 percent of the state economy, Hunsinger said.\n\n\u201cI think with a very good and thoughtful, creative leadership \u2026 we could test out new ways of working in government that might marry some of that,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cBut that really requires a lot of energy and thought, and I don\u2019t know whether or not we have the bandwidth as a state in leadership roles right now to really fully be able to explore that, given all the other problems that we have.\u201d\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s gubernatorial debate, the candidates started discussing the exchange, Hunsinger said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a big deal because the governor will have to put in their budget how they\u2019re going to fund it,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s so surprising that the gubernatorial candidates have waited so long to take a position.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Brown Daily Herald", "description": "Rhode Island\u2019s health insurance exchange, HealthSource R.I., has outperformed most other states\u2019 systems in the year since it opened to the marketplace.", "title": "HealthSource R.I. director emphasizes clarity in vision of health exchange", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jerzyk_Taubman_COthe-Taubman-Center-for-Public-Policy.jpg", "url": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/10/23/healthsource-r-director-emphasizes-clarity-vision-health-exchange/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Metro", "published_time": "2014-10-23T09:31:27+00:00"}, "description": "Rhode Island\u2019s health insurance exchange, HealthSource R.I., has outperformed most other states\u2019 systems in the year since it opened to the marketplace.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Emma Jerzyk"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0d4\"", "article_summary": "Christine Ferguson, director of HealthSource R.I., speaks about the functioning of Rhode Island\u2019s health exchange as part of a Taubman Center panel discussion.\nLincoln Chafee \u201974 P\u201914 P\u201917 and HealthSource R.I., opened the discussion by providing background on the history of the health exchange, which came under Ferguson\u2019s direction in June 2012 after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA, allowing the formation of HealthSource R.I. to progress.\n\u201cThe differences of HealthSource R.I. make \u201cpeople really uncomfortable because God forbid that we should do something different,\u201d she said in a sarcastic tone.\nBut when Chafee decided not to run for re-election, he also decided to let the next governor decide what to do with the state health exchange, she said.\nSince then, HealthSource R.I. has fared well compared with other states\u2019 exchanges."}
