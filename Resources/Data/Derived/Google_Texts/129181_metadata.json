(AP) \u2014 A railroad union has rejected a deal with BNSF that would have allowed one-person crews on as much as 60 percent of its tracks.\n\nThe Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers union voted against the contract this week, according to a notice sent to members late Wednesday.\n\nThe deal would have allowed BNSF to use one-person crews on tracks where a system capable of stopping the train remotely had been installed. But trains that carry hazardous materials, such as crude oil and chemicals, would have continued to have two-person crews.\n\nBNSF operates tracks in 28 states in the western U.S. and two Canadian provinces. The railroad, based in Fort Worth, Texas, said it has Positive Train Control systems installed on about 60 percent of its 32,500 miles of track.\n\nMajor U.S. railroads have been steadily reducing the size of train crews for decades to reduce costs and take advantage of technological advances that reduce the need for crew members. Agreements requiring two-person crews have been in place for nearly 30 years.\n\nBNSF and supporters of its proposal had argued that the implementation of Positive Train Control makes it unnecessary to have a second person in the cab of every locomotive. BNSF Vice President of Labor Relations John Fleps said the railroad will honor the union\u2019s wishes.\n\n\u201cThey have decided not to move forward at this time, and we respect the process,\u201d Fleps said.\n\nSeveral different labor unions represent groups of railroad workers. The SMART group involved in these negotiations represents conductors and ground crew workers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rail union rejects deal that allowed one-man crews", "title": "Rail union rejects deal that allowed one-man crews", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Rail union rejects deal that allowed one-man crews", "title": "Rail union rejects deal that allowed one-man crews", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/11/rail_union_rejects_deal_that_allowed_one_man_crews/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/solo-train-crews.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rail union rejects deal that allowed one-man crews", "title": "Rail union rejects deal that allowed one-man crews", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/solo-train-crews.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Josh Funk", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers union voted against the contract this week, according to a notice sent to members late Wednesday.\n(AP) \u2014 A railroad union has rejected a deal with BNSF that would have allowed one-person crews on as much as 60 percent of its tracks.\nBut trains that carry hazardous materials, such as crude oil and chemicals, would have continued to have two-person crews.\nAgreements requiring two-person crews have been in place for nearly 30 years.\nThe deal would have allowed BNSF to use one-person crews on tracks where a system capable of stopping the train remotely had been installed."}
