TALLHASSEE, Fla.-- The FDA has extended the effective date for nation-wide menu-labeling regulations till December 2016.

As a part of the Affordable Care Act, the FDA created requirements for chain restaurants or stores that serve meals of twenty or more locations to ensure consumers are getting all the facts before taking that first bite.

"As we saw those types of regulations cropping up in local jurisdictions across the country we became very concerned that we didn't have a patch work and that there be a consistent standard nationally," says Geoff Luebkemann, vice president of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association. Luebkemann says the FRLA pushed for both the guidelines and the effective-date extension.

Those standards state menus must list calorie intake for each item and have a statement on daily caloric intake information, as well as have written nutrition information available.

But consumers will have to wait a little bit longer because the FDA has pushed back the effective date a year till December 2016. In a statement, the FDA says that many corporations requested more time to implement the regulations.

"That's a lot of money to invest in new menu boards, new menus, training staff the technology that's needed to both manage the process and the restaurant and the technology needed to ensure that the data is correct that the nutrition information we're putting up is accurate," Luebkemann says.

Local nutritionists say that as long as it happens eventually, it's a great step towards a healthier US.

"The food industry is obviously there to sell a product. It's buy or beware so the more informed the consumer can be, the better off," says Rodger Young, the clinical nutrition manger for Tallahassee Memorial Hospital.
