The U.S. economy appears to be maintaining its growth trajectory in spite of global economic uncertainty and weakness in oil markets. March employment growth stayed strong, contributing to a quarterly gain of 628,000 jobs, which is helping fuel demand for commercial real estate. At the same time, new construction has stayed in check. Overbuilding is largely not a concern, except for some property types in selected markets.\n\nThe still-low interest rate environment caused the REIT sector, with its high dividend yields, to strengthen during March. The Federal Reserve\u2019s first rate increase in December unsettled markets and caused them to pull back, but Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s repeated message about moving \u201ccautiously\u201d and the lack of further rate increases have reduced market concerns.\n\nFor REITs, strong real estate market fundamentals are boosting profitability even as rich asset pricing has made acquisitions more challenging. In fact, a number of REITs announced during their quarterly earnings calls that they plan to be net sellers of assets in the current environment. Because REITs continue to trade at a discount to net asset value, some are using proceeds from sales to buy back shares or invest in other REITs.\n\nTREPP-i Survey Loan Spreads (50\u201359% LTV)*\n\nThis Week Previous Week Previous Month End 2015 End 2014 Industrial 166 169 178 163 138.5 Multifamily 165 168 185 168 139.8 Office 175 178 164 168 148 Retail 165 169 177 168 139.8 Average Spread 167.75 171 178.75 166.75 141.5 10-year Treasury Yield** 1.79 1.89 1.73 2.27 2.17\n\nAmong the various REIT sectors, freestanding retail REITs have offered the best returns this year. With bond-like yields that offer safety in an uncertain environment and tenants that are more resilient than traditional retailers in the face of e-commerce, freestanding retail REITS posted an 18.69 percent first-quarter return. Also posting exceptionally strong returns this year are data center REITs, whose 14.29 percent return has been fueled by the expansion of cloud computing.\n\nTimber REITs made a strong recovery in March as greater clarity on interest-rate movement fueled the homebuilding industry. The sector gained 19.60 percent during March and is now up 5.33 percent for the quarter. Despite a gain of 13.30 percent during March, single-family home REITs continue to struggle and are down 1.03 percent for the year.\n\nAt the crux of why shares are trading at a discount to net asset value is concern about whether REITs are plateauing or overshooting and whether they will be able to maintain growth. Certain markets and product types, such as hotels in New York City and office space in tech markets like San Francisco, are most susceptible to these concerns.\n\nInitial public offering (IPO) activity has been minimal this year, but some firms, grandfathered in when Congress passed a bill in December that essentially bans REIT spinoffs, are moving ahead with their plans.\n\nHilton Worldwide is spinning off the majority of its real estate business into a REIT that will include about 70 properties and 35,000 rooms. MGM Growth Properties (MGP) filed for an estimated $1 billion IPO. MGP will be spun off from MGM Resorts International and will own Mandalay Bay, Mirage, New York\u2013New York, Monte Carlo, Luxor, Excalibur, and the Park in Las Vegas, as well as properties in Detroit and Mississippi\u2014a total of 24,466 hotel rooms, about 2.5 million square feet of convention space, retail space, restaurants, and entertainment venues. Macy\u2019s, which rejected the idea of a REIT spinoff in 2015, recently added REIT veteran William Lenehan to its board as it continues to face pressure for a real estate spinoff.\n\nStrong March performance sets the pace for a year in which equity REITs and other listed real estate companies will be reclassified into a new Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sector, and during which foreign investors will be allowed to increase their REIT ownership without triggering Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (FIRPTA) taxes.\n\n* TREPP-i Survey Loan Spreads levels are based on a survey of balance sheet lenders.
