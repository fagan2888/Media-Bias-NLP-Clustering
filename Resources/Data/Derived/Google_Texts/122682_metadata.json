This attack was absolutely catastrophic. Those who describe it as the Pearl Harbor of the First Cyber War are not far off the mark. And it is very clear President Obama and his hapless crew have no idea what to do about it.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIt was bad enough when we thought the personal data of some four million federal employees who sought security clearances over the past 30 years had been compromised. Now the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, J. David Cox, has informed OPM in a letter that his organization believes \u201cthe Central Personnel Data File was the targeted database, and that the hackers are now in possession of all personnel data for every federal employee, every federal retiree, and up to one million former federal employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe OPM data file contains the records of non-military, non-intelligence executive branch employees, which covers most federal civilian employees but not, for example, members of Congress and their staffs,\u201d reports the Associated Press. \u201cThe union believes the hackers stole military records and veterans\u2019 status information, address, birth date, job and pay history, health insurance, life insurance and pension information; and age, gender and race data.\u201d\n\nEvery federal employee. And that is just the tip of the iceberg, because we are learning these hackers were active in that database for a year before they were caught. That gave them plenty of time to use the information they stole to compromise associates of these federal employees with virus-laced \u201cphishing\u201d emails and other scurrilous tactics.\n\nAs a Wired article on the breach observes, the hackers accessed a trove of SF-86 forms \u2013 \u201cdocuments used for conducting background checks for worker security clearances,\u201d which can contain \u201ca wealth of sensitive data not only about workers seeking security clearance, but also about their friends, spouses and other family members,\u201d plus \u201cpotentially sensitive information about the applicant\u2019s interactions with foreign nationals\u2014information that could be used against those nationals in their own country.\u201d\n\nI sure hope none of those federal employees was keeping all of her official correspondence, including sensitive material, on a home-brewed email server even less secure than the government\u2019s official systems are!\n\nThe AP report notes that in his letter to OPM, Cox concedes his union\u2019s conclusions are based on \u201csketchy\u201d information provided by the agency, which the AP notes has \u201csought to downplay the damage, saying what was taken \u2018could include\u2019 personnel file information such as Social Security numbers and birth dates.\u201d The agency still refuses to discuss the specifics of the breach.\n\nCox\u2019s letter called the government\u2019s failure to encrypt Social Security numbers \u201ca cybersecurity failure that is absolutely indefensible and outrageous,\u201d charging that the data breach represents \u201can abysmal failure on the part of the agency to guard data that has been entrusted to it by the federal workforce.\u201d\n\nHe further complained that \u201cvery little information has been shared\u201d with his union, or other victims of the data breach.\n\nHe is right, and the millions of people affected by it are still not getting straight answers because bureaucrats are making the coverage of their posteriors the top priority. Nobody should be working on \u201csketchy\u201d information at this point. Except for a few vital details that must be kept secret to help identify the hackers and thwart further attacks, full disclosure is long overdue.\n\nBut nobody ever gets full disclosure from the Obama administration without filing a stack of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, do they? It is a process that takes years, with Obama\u2019s stonewall artists fighting it every step of the way. We will have to suffer through months of Team Obama trying to blame all this on Republicans for not giving him enough money before any sort of effective action is taken.\n\nEverything we are learning about the OPM breach is trickling out through leaks and inadvertent disclosure. Another false administration claim shredded by such disclosure is the initial statement that government security teams discovered the breach in April. Not so, according to a Wall Street Journal report; it was \u201cactually discovered during a mid-April sales demonstration at OPM by a Virginia company called CyTech Services, which has a networks forensics platform called CyFIR.\u201d\n\n\u201cCyTech, trying to show OPM how its cybersecurity product worked, ran a diagnostics study on OPM\u2019s network and discovered malware was embedded on the network. Investigators believe the hackers had been in the network for a year or more,\u201d the WSJ explains.\n\nA private agency stumbled across this digital dragon, and it had been lurking in those improperly secured government databases for far longer than we were originally told. Even beyond the threat of the information actually stolen \u2013 whose extent investigators still are not certain of \u2013 this attack creates a huge penumbra of uncertainty. With that much time to run amok, the hackers produced a chain reaction of unknowns that will be impossibly difficult for our intelligence services to properly digest and plan around. They simply have no idea how much of our government\u2019s data has been compromised. They face a swarm of question marks beyond counting.\n\nIt is almost impossible for them to determine who might be subject to blackmail; imagine the number of potential cases of inappropriate conduct by federal employees, all the scandals crushed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department, and imagine ten times as much compromising information falling into the hands of our global adversaries.\n\nAnother problem spotlighted by former NSA analyst and counterintelligence officer John Schindler: if the hackers were associated with Chinese intelligence, they would have prioritized information that could help them develop productive espionage contacts.\n\n\u201cArmed with lists of Chinese citizens worldwide who are in \u2018close and continuing contact\u2019 (to cite security clearance lingo) with American officials, Beijing can now seek to exploit those ties for espionage purposes,\u201d Schindler writes, adding:\n\nThis matters because, while many intelligence services exploit ties of ethnicity to further their espionage against the United States \u2014 Russians, Cubans, Israelis, even the Greeks \u2014 none of the major counterintelligence threats to America are as dependent on blood ties as the Chinese. Simply put, in its efforts at recruiting spies abroad, Beijing is often uncomfortable operating outside its ethnic milieu. Spies run by Beijing who are not ethnic Chinese are very much the exception.\n\nAfter listing numerous Chinese espionage cases to prove his point, Schindler concludes the OPM hack might have been not just a game-changer, but a spy-games checkmate:\n\nThe extent of the information loss in the OPM hack is so vast that all the counterintelligence awareness in the world may not be able to offset the advantage in the SpyWar that Beijing has won with this vast data theft. If you are (or have been) employed with the Federal government and have listed Chinese persons in any way on your SF86, it\u2019s time to be vigilant.\n\nAs Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence put it, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know, which is a real concern, and I think that\u2019s why in this new digital age it\u2019s important for everyone to know \u2013 all Americans to know \u2013 that information\u2019s just not safe out there running on the superhighway.\u201d\n\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t such a hot idea to give the government all our healthcare information then. Does everyone remember all the security concerns raised about the Obamacare database? Would anyone like to bet that\u2019s all one hundred percent secure and unaffected by the Pearl Harbor strike?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration's excuses and lies about the OPM hack are melting away.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The Obama administration's excuses and lies about the OPM hack are melting away.", "title": "Obama's Excuses and Lies about OPM Hack Melt Away", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/obama-computer-problem-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-06-13T13:58:33-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/06/13/cyber-war-pearl-harbor-obama-administrations-excuses-and-lies-about-opm-hack-melt-away/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration's excuses and lies about the OPM hack are melting away.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/obama-computer-problem-AP.jpg", "title": "Obama's Excuses and Lies about OPM Hack Melt Away", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "China, Espionage, first cyber war, hacking, office of personnel management,National Security,Hack", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-06-13T11:59:29-07:00", "section": "National Security", "modified_time": "2015-06-13T13:58:33-07:00", "tag": "office of personnel management", "categories": "National Security"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "That gave them plenty of time to use the information they stole to compromise associates of these federal employees with virus-laced \u201cphishing\u201d emails and other scurrilous tactics.\nAnd it is very clear President Obama and his hapless crew have no idea what to do about it.\nThose who describe it as the Pearl Harbor of the First Cyber War are not far off the mark.\nIt is a process that takes years, with Obama\u2019s stonewall artists fighting it every step of the way.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIt was bad enough when we thought the personal data of some four million federal employees who sought security clearances over the past 30 years had been compromised."}
