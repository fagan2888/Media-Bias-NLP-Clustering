American flags flew high, signs that say hash tag we see you were being held in an understanding that at the end of the day behind the badge there is a lot more to the officer.\n\n\"As a family, as a mother, as a wife, as a sister or a brother, I would be very honored by what I saw today,\" said roadside supporter Kim Johnson.\n\nThe thin blue line as many have come to know as the signature of law enforcement was flying everywhere.\n\n\"Between here and Hattiesburg and what's going to go on between Lauderdale County and Starkville it is just amazing,\" Captain Johnson said. \"It shows a great support.\"\n\nA support that stretched for over a hundred miles across the state as the 3 mile long precession took Officer Tate on the hero's journey to his final resting place.\n\n\"It just means a lot because it represents the fact that we're all out here showing our respect for this officer knowing that he put his life on the line everyday and it just means a lot,\" McGill said.\n\nA hero, a son, an officer, a brother, and a community who came out to support him on his final ride home.\n\n\"That's my family,\" Johnson said. \"All those cars, all those different counties, all the different law enforcement agencies that just came through here with Officer Tate, that's our family. that's our extended family that goes all over the nation.\"\n\nMississippi has bad reps over the year of race issues and different stuff,\" 186th Fire Department Bud Brown said. \"I think it shows the whole country where Mississippi is.
