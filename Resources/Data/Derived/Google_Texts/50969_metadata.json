More than a decade later, she still makes the trek from her Glenn Heights home to the West Dallas clinic because she wants a doctor who speaks her language.\n\n\u201cI feel more confident,\u201d said the 29-year-old, who is expecting another child. \u201cThe nurses and doctors are really good people; plus with other [non-Spanish speaking doctors] I don\u2019t feel very comfortable.\u201d\n\nLike many Hispanics in North Texas, Ramirez struggles to find adequate health care because of language and cultural barriers. Complicating the problem, doctors say, is the fact that Hispanics face higher rates of chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease than the general population.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to health, it\u2019s critical to be able to communicate your needs to your doctor,\u201d said James Chanez, president of the North Texas Latin American Physicians Association, \u201cand that can be hard if you don\u2019t speak the same language.\u201d\n\nWhile the Latino population in the U.S. is steadily climbing, to 54 million in 2013, the number of Latino physicians hasn\u2019t kept pace for the past three decades.\n\nA 2015 study found that there were 135 Hispanic physicians for every 100,000 Hispanic residents in 1980, but only 105 doctors for every 100,000 Hispanics in 2010.\n\nIn Dallas County, there are about a million Hispanic residents, and three-fourths of them speak Spanish at home, according to the 2013 census.\n\nThat\u2019s about 40 percent of the total population, but only 4 percent to 6 percent of area physicians are Hispanic, according to the North Texas doctors group. It\u2019s unclear how many doctors of other ethnicities are fluent in Spanish.\n\nAbout 5 percent of the doctors at Parkland Memorial Hospital are Hispanic, though about 22 percent said they were proficient in Spanish, said Ildemaro Gonzalez, chief inclusion and diversity officer for the hospital.\n\nThat\u2019s important because more than half of the patients the charity hospital serves are Hispanic and about a third of them have limited English proficiency.\n\nThe Parkland network also employs 86 certified medical interpreters, all proficient in Spanish. Among them is Eduardo G\u00e1ndara, an interpreter at Parkland\u2019s DeHaro-Saldivar Health Center.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the west Oak Cliff community clinic, Gandara introduced a Spanish-speaking patient to her doctor, translating what each person said verbatim, including the \u201cums\u201d and \u201cyeahs\u201d and even gestures.\n\nIn January, Parkland adopted a diversity initiative to increase the number of minorities it employs. The plan also calls for the hospital to become more \u201cculturally competent\u201d by training or hiring staff members who understand the language and culture of patients.\n\nSeveral other hospitals, clinics and nonprofits in North Texas are also trying to give Hispanics with limited means and English skills better access to health care.\n\nThat\u2019s been Los Barrios Unidos\u2019 mission since 1972, when residents came together to open the clinic in a portable building.\n\nThe clinic, now at the corner of Singleton Boulevard and Sylvan Avenue, has grown to provide primary, obstetric and pediatric care as well as mental health care and dentistry for children.\n\nLos Barrios\u2019 clientele is almost entirely Hispanic at 93 percent, and three-fourths of them are uninsured, according to spokeswoman Joleen Bagwell.\n\nThe clinic helps parents apply for WIC benefits and employs specialists to help enroll eligible patients in Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and Obamacare.\n\nAfter all, if the patient can\u2019t pay, that sometimes forces them to seek routine care at a hospital ER.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t afford to or can\u2019t get in to see a doctor at a private practice, so many go to the emergency room,\u201d Bagwell said. \u201cThat is not where you want to get your primary care. It\u2019s extremely expensive for them and for the state.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "While 40 percent of the Dallas County population is Hispanic, 4 to 6 percent of physicians are fluent in Spanish, a doctors group says.", "og": {"description": "While 40 percent of the Dallas County population is Hispanic, 4 to 6 percent of physicians are fluent in Spanish, a doctors group says.", "title": "Spanish-speaking doctors in short supply in North Texas", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150927-spanish-speaking-doctors-in-short-supply-in-north-texas.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150927-nospanishdoctors_0929met.ece/BINARY/original/nospanishdoctors_0929met", "height": 930}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-09-28T11:54:55Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-09-28T04:03:21Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Spanish-speaking doctors in short supply in North Texas\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150927-spanish-speaking-doctors-in-short-supply-in-north-texas.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150927-nospanishdoctors_0929met.ece/BINARY/original/nospanishdoctors_0929met\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2454416\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-09-28T04:03:21Z\", \"section\": \"Metro\", \"author\": \"PAULINA PINEDA\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150927-nospanishdoctors_0929met.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/nospanishdoctors_0929met", "publishtime": "2015-09-28T04:03:21Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd6ff\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s about 40 percent of the total population, but only 4 percent to 6 percent of area physicians are Hispanic, according to the North Texas doctors group.\n\u201cThe nurses and doctors are really good people; plus with other [non-Spanish speaking doctors] I don\u2019t feel very comfortable.\u201dLike many Hispanics in North Texas, Ramirez struggles to find adequate health care because of language and cultural barriers.\nSeveral other hospitals, clinics and nonprofits in North Texas are also trying to give Hispanics with limited means and English skills better access to health care.\nA 2015 study found that there were 135 Hispanic physicians for every 100,000 Hispanic residents in 1980, but only 105 doctors for every 100,000 Hispanics in 2010.\nComplicating the problem, doctors say, is the fact that Hispanics face higher rates of chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease than the general population."}
