Associated Press\n\nLast night\u2019s telecast served as confirmation that the social media rebuke of the Academy Awards as \u201c#OscarSoWhite\u201d was not only deserved \u2014 it was inadequate.\n\nThe back-breaking straw wasn\u2019t the snubbing of Ava DuVernay\u2019s critically lauded and historically important \u201cSelma,\u201d shut out from all categories except Best Picture and Best Song (it won the latter, but seriously, its makers\u2019 eyes were never focused on the mere prize of victory for Common and John Legend\u2019s anthemic \u201cGlory\u201d).\n\nNor was it the fact that for the first time in 17 years, exclusively white performers were nominated in the Awards\u2019 four acting categories.\n\nNo, it was the awards show production itself, whose writers and directors somehow managed to engineer the most deeply awkward demonstration possible of the widening fault lines between Old Hollywood (white, aging, provincial) and New (nonwhite, young, borderless) \u2014 beginning with the choice of Neil Patrick Harris as emcee.\n\nThough the actor now known as NPH is effortlessly dapper and a deft hand at self-referential snark, his selection was the very opposite of risky. Unlike, say, 2005 host Chris Rock, a teller of prickly, unkind truths, Harris\u2019s forte is the kind of staged patter and show-choir spectacle that evokes a simpler and more innocent Hollywood era.\n\nHis selection represented the Academy\u2019s quest for an awards presenter with a sharp enough edge to win Millennial approval, but not so much that Hollywood\u2019s deep-seated hypocrisies are slashed open and laid bare. (It also likely indicated that neither Justin Timberlake nor Jimmy Fallon was available.)\n\nThis tug of war between the desire to engage the biggest and most diverse generation in American history and to preserve the hidebound establishment was obvious throughout the evening, beginning with the opening monologue, an intensely choreographed musical ode to the movie industry\u2019s \u201cbest and brightest\u201d \u2014 or, per Harris\u2019s faux Freudian slip, its \u201cbest and whitest.\u201d\n\nThe Oscars continued to explicitly acknowledge its lack of diversity all night, trotting out an amazing series of actors of color as presenters \u2014 Lupita N\u2019yongo! Viola Davis! Chiwetel Ejiofor! Idris Elba! Eddie Murphy! Jennifer Lopez, Zoe Saldana and The Rock! \u2014 while regularly sending Harris into the audience to interact with black members of the audience like Oprah Winfrey, David Oyelowo and Octavia Spencer (also presenters).\n\nHarris\u2019s improvised banter was highly uncomfortable: He compared Winfrey to \u201cAmerican Sniper,\u201d because both have made lots of money. He forced British-born Oyelowo to read a joke at the expense of the recent remake of the movie musical \u201cAnnie,\u201d whose nontraditional recasting with black leads triggered an unpleasant controversy \u2014 the gag being that Oyelowo\u2019s sleek English-accented delivery (and, um, blackness) would save the bit from being offensive. And he designated Spencer as unofficial security guard for a locked case that purportedly contained Harris\u2019s highly touted Oscar picks. He returned regularly to ensure she was keeping an eye on the vault, and each return of the camera seemingly prompted more anxiety and dismay in her expression.\n\n(Midway through the show, Daily Show correspondent Samantha Bee finally tweeted out to Harris what all of us were thinking: \u201cOCTAVIA SPENCER DOES NOT WANT TO WATCH YOUR BOX.\u201d)\n\nThe upshot was that the show felt like the Academy bragging to the world that some of its best friends are black (and Hispanic, and Asian) \u2014 doing their best to put people of color everywhere except, you know, on the awards podium.\n\nIn the process, it put the spotlight on exactly what the Academy hoped the show wouldn\u2019t: The disruptive forces of change that are shaking each and every one of Hollywood\u2019s traditional pillars, from financing, as more and more money comes from China, hat-tipped with a throwaway joke in Harris\u2019s musical opening monologue, to creativity, as its most exceptional new talents arrive on the scene from historically un- and underrepresented communities, to the business model of the movies itself, which is increasingly shaped by new technological platforms, global distribution and America\u2019s demographic revolution.\n\nThe last of these was capped by an exchange at the bitter end of the telecast, seen by those who managed to make the four-hour slog to the Awards\u2019 climax. The final presenter was two-time Oscar honoree Sean Penn; in unveiling the winner of the Best Picture category, \u201cBirdman,\u201d he improvised a joke about its director Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s immigration status: \u201cWho gave this son of a bitch his green card?\u201d\n\nAfter the show, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu said he found the gag hilarious, and called Penn a close friend whose \u201cbrutal relationship\u201d with him allowed such questionable gibes. But it was what he said at the podium, in accepting his film\u2019s third award of the night, including Best Director and Original Screenplay, that underscored the stinging subtext of the quip. Referring to the fact that 2014\u2019s winner of the Best Director award was Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, he made a sly prediction: \u201cMaybe next year, the government will inflict some immigration rules [on] the Academy. Two Mexicans in a row \u2014 that\u2019s suspicious, I guess.\u201d\n\nNo, it\u2019s the new Hollywood reality. And the Academy needs to reflect on it \u2014 and reflect it \u2014 fast.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Some viewers found the televised Academy Awards presentations awkward and potentially insulting to certain racial and ethnic groups.", "title": "How the Oscars Reflect Racial, Ethnic Divisions", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/02/23/commentary-how-the-oscars-reflect-societys-divisions/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HB756_nph_G_20150223105446.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "How the Oscars Reflect Racial, Ethnic Divisions", "description": "Some viewers found the televised Academy Awards presentations awkward and potentially insulting to certain racial and ethnic groups.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Jeff Yang", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Some viewers found the televised Academy Awards presentations awkward and potentially insulting to certain racial and ethnic groups.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-02-23T20:00:58-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/02/23/commentary-how-the-oscars-reflect-societys-divisions/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-86904", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Some viewers found the televised Academy Awards presentations awkward and potentially insulting to certain racial and ethnic groups.", "title": "How the Oscars Reflect Racial, Ethnic Divisions", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/02/23/commentary-how-the-oscars-reflect-societys-divisions/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HB756_nph_G_20150223105446.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-86904", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-02-24T13:41:00-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef0c\"", "article_summary": "Associated PressLast night\u2019s telecast served as confirmation that the social media rebuke of the Academy Awards as \u201c#OscarSoWhite\u201d was not only deserved \u2014 it was inadequate.\nAnd the Academy needs to reflect on it \u2014 and reflect it \u2014 fast.\nAnd he designated Spencer as unofficial security guard for a locked case that purportedly contained Harris\u2019s highly touted Oscar picks.\nNor was it the fact that for the first time in 17 years, exclusively white performers were nominated in the Awards\u2019 four acting categories.\nHarris\u2019s improvised banter was highly uncomfortable: He compared Winfrey to \u201cAmerican Sniper,\u201d because both have made lots of money."}
