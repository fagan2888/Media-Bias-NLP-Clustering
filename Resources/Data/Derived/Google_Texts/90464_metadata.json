His cartoons and columns have baffled, angered or made his audience chuckle at their pointed satire. But who is Rick Kollinger really, and what makes him tick?\n\nIn an email interview, the 25-year-veteran cartoonist and columnist for The Star Democrat discussed being placed on the cover of the 2014 edition of \u201cBest Editorial Cartoons of the Year,\u201d and revealed a little bit about himself and the madness behind his methods.\n\nThough he has had cartoons in the prestigious collection for 20 years, Kollinger said, \u201cIt was a thrill to have one on the cover. It\u2019s usually reserved for cartoonists from big city papers.\u201d\n\nHe has one more cartoon in the collection, which features artwork on topics such as Obamacare, gay marriage, the government shutdown, Nelson Mandela and more.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t aware he would be on the cover. \u201cThey called me several months ago and asked for the cartoon in color. I thought that I hadn\u2019t sent them any, since they normally publish the book in November.\u201d\n\nKollinger has his favorites among his fellow artists in the book. \u201cMichael Ramirez is head and shoulders above everyone else, I like Mike Luckovich a lot, and Steve Kelley and Mike Peters are two of the funniest ones around,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI like the old-school guys who draw well and don\u2019t depend on a lot of computer-generated images.\u201d\n\nSome of the writers he uses as templates for his own pieces include Carl Hiaasen, Elmore Leonard, Dave Barry and Harry Crews.\n\nThe reason for those choices, he said, is \u201call these guys had Florida as a backdrop for humorous situations.\u201d\n\nHe cites Mort Drucker from Mad Magazine as \u201cthe best caricaturist I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d but said, \u201cEach cartoonist has their own style, so that you should be able to tell a Luckovich cartoon without looking at the signature.\u201d\n\nIn regards to his own sketches and how he draws inspiration to create them, Kollinger said, \u201cJust about anything does it. A good cartoon should be a metaphor, so the inspiration can come from any daily job or situation that I see that I can compare to something in politics.\u201d\n\n\u201dFortunately, I have a short attention span. My favorite cartoon is usually the last one I did,\u201d he said, answering a question that is posed to him all the time.\n\nNoting that most of his readers\u2019 favorites were not his own personal choices, he says, \u201cIt just shows that different people like different cartoons for different reasons.\u201d\n\nAnother question Kollinger is asked frequently is why did he become a cartoonist and columnist. His answer: \u201cA lack of ambition.\u201d\n\nThough born in Virginia, Kollinger has lived on the Eastern Shore all his life, saying he\u2019s \u201cold enough to be eligible to wear my pants up under my armpits and look under the steering wheel of my Buick.\u201d Before coming to The Star Democrat, he worked in Ocean City, and before that, he was in the swimming pool business.\n\n\u201dDrawing cartoons is the only thing I\u2019m even mildy competent in,\u201d Kollinger said.\n\nAs some of his latest work has addressed, Kollinger recently was diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\u201cI have to condense it into those days or hours when I have energy. So many days I spend just so tired that it\u2019s difficult to pick up a pen,\u201d he said, mentioning how his condition has affected his work. \u201cI have to be careful though, that on the days following chemotherapy, when I\u2019m jacked up on steroids and can\u2019t sleep that I don\u2019t try to write a column.\u201d He also said, \u201cMany of my 3 a.m. cartoons I don\u2019t understand the next day.\u201d\n\nIn his line of work, Kollinger has made many friends and foes.\n\nHe calls his fans \u201cbrilliant, insightful individuals.\u201d\n\nThose who disagree with what he writes or draws and demand his immediate retirement?\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSeriously, I enjoy the different viewpoint,\u201d Kollinger added. \u201cBut it\u2019s like people who root for the Yankees. You know there are a lot of them out there, you just can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @dorian_stardem.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "MyEasternShoreMD", "description": "EASTON \u2014 There have been countless letters to the editor and many phone calls to the newsroom about his work, either supporting his opinions or calling for his head.
