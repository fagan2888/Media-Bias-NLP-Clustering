And my instructions to my team and my instructions to myself have always been that we are going to squeeze every last ounce of progress that we can make when I have the privilege \u2014 as long as I have the privilege of holding this office.\u201d\n\nHe detailed a few items that were still on his list:\n\n1. Expanding Medicaid in states where it was blocked\n\n2. Iran Nuclear deal\n\n3. Major infrastructure spending bill\n\n4. Reforming criminal justice system\n\n5. Two years of free community college\n\nOther items on Obama\u2019s list include closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, renewing the Export-Import Bank, a major cyber security bill, paid sick leave, and free universal pre-K.\n\n\u201cThe list is long,\u201d admitted. \u201cAnd what we\u2019re going to do is just keep on hammering away at all the issues that I think are going to have an impact on the American people. Some of them will be left undone. But we\u2019re going to try to make progress on every single one of them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama\u2019s \u2018Bucket List\u2019 Just Got Longer", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama\u2019s \u2018Bucket List\u2019 Just Got Longer", "title": "Obama\u2019s \u2018Bucket List\u2019 Just Got Longer - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/obama-military-jacket-smile-Reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/01/obamas-bucket-list-just-got-longer/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama\u2019s \u2018Bucket List\u2019 Just Got Longer", "creator": "@charliespiering", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/obama-military-jacket-smile-Reuters.jpg", "title": "Obama\u2019s \u2018Bucket List\u2019 Just Got Longer - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, bucket list,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "bucket list", "published_time": "2015-07-01T06:49:39-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc914\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Well, I have something that rhymes with bucket list.\nPresident, do you have a bucket list?\n'\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNow that the legal case for Obamacare is solidified and his dramatic trade authorities have been granted by Republicans, Obama is continuing to move forward on the more politically difficult elements of his \u201cbucket list\u201d (or his f*cket list?)\nTwo years of free community collegeOther items on Obama\u2019s list include closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, renewing the Export-Import Bank, a major cyber security bill, paid sick leave, and free universal pre-K.\u201cThe list is long,\u201d admitted.\n\u201cThe list is long."}
