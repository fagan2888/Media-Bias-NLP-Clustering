O'Reilly: 'Kill zone' just a 'slang expression'\n\nFox News host Bill O'Reilly doubled down on his criticism of journalist David Corn while stressing that his controversial \"kill zone\" remark was \"simply a slang expression\" that shouldn't be taken literally.\n\nIn a transcript of remarks O'Reilly will make on his prime-time program, the Fox News host once again called Corn \"a liar\" and accused his magazine, Mother Jones, of trying to carry out \"a political hit job.\" On Thursday, Corn published a report alleging that O'Reilly had lied about his experiences covering the Falklands War for CBS News in 1982.\n\nO'Reilly responded to the Mother Jones report on Thursday by calling Corn \"a liar\" and a \"despicable guttersnipe.\" In one of several interviews with reporters, O'Reilly said he expected Corn \"to be in the kill zone. Where he deserves to be.\"\n\nThe editors-in-chief of Mother Jones responded to that attack on Friday by calling on O'Reilly to renounce and apologize for the remark. The EICs said they were alarmed by O'Reilly's \"violent tone.\"\n\nInstead, O'Reilly issued a brief statement saying, \u201cIt\u2019s simply a slang expression.\u201d\n\nThe veracity of Mother Jones' allegations has been a subject of debate among media reporters. O'Reilly has said throughout his career, in varying ways, that he was in a war zone in the Falklands. In fact, O'Reilly was present at a protest against the military junta in Buenos Aires during the Falklands War.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "<p>Fox News host Bill O'Reilly doubled down on his criticism of journalist David Corn while stressing that his controversial &quot;kill zone&quot; remark was &quot;simply a slang expression&quot; that shouldn't be taken literally.</p>", "title": "O'Reilly: 'Kill zone' just a 'slang expression'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/02/oreilly-kill-zone-just-a-slang-expression-202887.html", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201502/1843/1155968404_4074103512001_Weekend-Still003.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "<p>Fox News host Bill O'Reilly doubled down on his criticism of journalist David Corn while stressing that his controversial &quot;kill zone&quot; remark was &quot;simply a slang expression&quot; that shouldn't be taken literally.</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbde8\"", "article_summary": "O'Reilly: 'Kill zone' just a 'slang expression'Fox News host Bill O'Reilly doubled down on his criticism of journalist David Corn while stressing that his controversial \"kill zone\" remark was \"simply a slang expression\" that shouldn't be taken literally.\nOn Media Blog Archives Select Date\u2026 December, 2015 November, 2015 October, 2015 September, 2015 August, 2015 July, 2015 June, 2015 May, 2015 April, 2015 March, 2015 February, 2015 January, 2015An excerpt of a segment from Bill O'Reilly's 'The O'Reilly Factor' that aired on Friday.\nIn one of several interviews with reporters, O'Reilly said he expected Corn \"to be in the kill zone.\nO'Reilly has said throughout his career, in varying ways, that he was in a war zone in the Falklands.\nIn fact, O'Reilly was present at a protest against the military junta in Buenos Aires during the Falklands War."}
