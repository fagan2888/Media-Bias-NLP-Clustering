Gunmen entered his candlelit wake and killed his mother, brother, aunt and sister in an apparent revenge attack ordered by the cartel.\n\nEven in a drug war that has claimed more than 70,000 lives, such cold-blooded murder of an entire family shocked this nation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mexican soldiers arrested the man who headed this cartel, Hector Beltran Leyva, alias \u201cThe H,\u201d brother of the deceased Arturo. Unlike the Beard however, Hector was nabbed without a shot when he was in a seafood restaurant in San Miguel de Allende, the haunt of retired Americans and bohemian Hollywood stars.\n\nThis latest arrest under President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto brings down a dynasty that has been at the very heart of Mexico\u2019s drug war and tears apart a web of subterfuge stretching through Mexican and US security agencies. Wanted on both sides of the border, Hector Beltran Leyva is linked to widespread corruption networks and possibly to an attack on US government agents.\n\nArturo and Hector were the elder and senior partners of four Beltran Leyva brothers, controlling billion dollar cocaine, marijuana, heroin and crystal meth routes from their native Sinaloa state.\n\nA July 2009 grand jury indictment in New York names Hector and Arturo Beltran Leyva as being behind tons of cocaine hitting American streets over two decades.\n\n\u201cThrough a network of corrupt police and political contacts, [they] directed a large-scale narcotics transportation network involving the use of land, air, and sea transportation assets,\u201d the indictment states. They \u201cemployed \u2018sicarios,\u2019 or hit men, who carried out hundreds of acts of violence, including murders, kidnappings, tortures and violent collections of drug debts.\u201d\n\nThe US put out $5 million bounties on both brothers through its narcotics rewards program.\n\nAn informant responded to give vital information that led to marines shooting dead Arturo in 2009. This source was duly paid his $5 million reward, although it took almost two years for him to receive the money, a senior US law enforcement officer told GlobalPost following that payment.\n\n\u201cWe pay up on our promises,\u201d the official said. \u201cTo capture these guys you need good human intelligence and that costs money.\u201d\n\nPaying vast sums of money to confidential informants has come under criticism, as some have been found to themselves be criminals, such as one Homeland Security informant who carried out murders in Ciudad Juarez.\n\nUS Drug Enforcement Administration agents had originally tried to work with the Mexican army to take down Arturo. However, the soldiers refused to move on US intelligence, raising suspicions of corruption in Mexico\u2019s army. The Americans turned to the Mexican marines, run by different leadership.\n\nFormer US Ambassador to Mexico Carlos Pascual detailed this frustration in a cable to Washington later revealed by WikiLeaks.\n\nThe marine unit \u201cis well trained, well-equipped, and has shown itself capable of responding quickly to actionable intelligence. Its success puts the army in the difficult position of explaining why it has been reluctant to act on good intelligence and conduct operations against high-level targets.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The latest arrest by the Mexican government brings down a dynasty that has been at the heart of country\u2019s drug war  VIDEO", "title": "Captured Mexican drug lord was hunted by U.S. agents", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The latest arrest by the Mexican government brings down a dynasty that has been at the heart of country\u2019s drug war  VIDEO", "title": "Captured Mexican drug lord was hunted by U.S. agents", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/05/captured_mexican_drug_lord_was_hunted_by_u_s_agents_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/shutterstock_179052941.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The latest arrest by the Mexican government brings down a dynasty that has been at the heart of country\u2019s drug war  VIDEO", "title": "Captured Mexican drug lord was hunted by U.S. agents", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/shutterstock_179052941.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ioan Grillo", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, CIA, drug war, GlobalPost, Mexican Drug War, Mexico, narcotics, U.S. State Department, Video, War on Drugs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce42a\"", "article_summary": "Even in a drug war that has claimed more than 70,000 lives, such cold-blooded murder of an entire family shocked this nation.\nWanted on both sides of the border, Hector Beltran Leyva is linked to widespread corruption networks and possibly to an attack on US government agents.\nOn Wednesday, Mexican soldiers arrested the man who headed this cartel, Hector Beltran Leyva, alias \u201cThe H,\u201d brother of the deceased Arturo.\nTopics: CIA, drug war, GlobalPost, Mexican Drug War, Mexico, narcotics, U.S. State Department, Video, War on Drugs, News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on GlobalPostIn December 2009, Mexican marines acting on US intelligence stormed an apartment block in the Mexican spa-town of Cuernavaca and shot dead the drug lord Arturo Beltran Leyva, \u201cThe Beard,\u201d during a ferocious firefight.\nUS Drug Enforcement Administration agents had originally tried to work with the Mexican army to take down Arturo."}
