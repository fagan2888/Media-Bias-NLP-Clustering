Richards says she needs health insurance to cover the cost of her weekly chemotherapy treatments, prescription drugs and other medical care. \"Losing insurance would cost me my life,\" she said.\n\nRichards almost lost her coverage because of an Obamacare controversy that's received little public attention. At issue is whether it is OK for hospitals, drug companies and other third parties to pay insurance premiums for people who enroll in coverage through exchanges. Richards' premium is paid by the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, a nonprofit that funds research and helps patients.\n\nThe federal government has given conflicting opinions on the issue of third-party payments, the most recent coming Nov. 4 when the federal Department of Health and Human Services said it \"discourages this practice and encourages issuers to reject such third party payments.\"\n\nWhy would the government oppose third-party payments when the mission of the federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is to make sure everyone is insured?\n\nThe government and the insurance industry fear allowing hospitals and other third parties to pay all or part of patients' premiums will quickly flood the new health insurance exchanges with sick people who have costly medical needs. If the very sick enroll at a much faster clip than young, healthy people who do not run up big medical bills, insurance costs could soar, undermining another goal of Obamacare -- to make coverage affordable.\n\nThe American Hospital Association says subsidizing premiums would support a hospital's charitable purpose of making health care available to those in need.\n\nHospitals also want to pay some patients' premiums because the cost of doing so would be far less than providing free care to poor, uninsured patients, said Robert Belfort, a health care lawyer in the Manhattan office of the Manatt, Phelps & Phillips law firm. By law, hospitals cannot turn away anyone who shows up at their emergency rooms for care.\n\nU.S. hospitals provided $45.9 billion in uncompensated care in 2012, according to the American Hospital Association. That represented an annual increase of $4.8 billion, or 11.7 percent.\n\nRichards' state subsidized health insurance policy - Healthy New York - was cancelled at the end of 2013 because it did not comply with Obamacare. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society had been paying for Richards' insurance for more than three years because she could not afford the premiums. The society receives funding from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to help patients like her.\n\nRichards enrolled Nov. 22 in a new plan offered by Excellus BlueCross BlueShield through the state's online exchange. The exchange is where people who are uninsured or buy insurance on their own can obtain health coverage. The exchange is part of Obamacare, which requires nearly all Americans to get health insurance this year or face a financial penalty.\n\nRichards thought she was all set until her phone rang on Christmas eve.\n\nRichards said the call was from an Excellus representative who informed her the company was not allowed to accept premium payments from third parties like the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society for coverage purchased through the exchange.\n\nRichards spent the Christmas holiday crying.\n\n\"I was devastated,\" she said. \"I knew there was no way I could pay for my medical care. That meant I would have to stop my treatment.\"\n\nRichards contacted syracuse.com, her state and federal elected representatives and officials with the state and federal health insurance exchanges to bring attention to her plight. She also filed a complaint with the state Department of Financial Services. Richards provided syracuse.com with a copy of that complaint, her medical records and other records documenting the health plan she enrolled in on the exchange, payments made on her behalf by the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and correspondence between Excellus and Sen. Charles J. Schumer's office that discusses her case.\n\nRichards said she subsequently received a call Jan. 2 from Excellus, informing her it was accepting the premium payment from the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\n\"What I didn't get was an explanation why I got the phone call on December 24 and was put through absolute hell through Christmas,\" she said.\n\nExcellus spokeswoman Elizabeth Martin declined to discuss Richards' case because of privacy issues. Martin cited the federal government's Nov. 4 advice to insurers to reject third-party payments, but said there are no formal regulations prohibiting insurers from accepting these payments.\n\nHealth care lawyers said they do not think the government is concerned about third-party payments by charities like the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. They speculated that Excellus was being overly cautious when it initially said it could not accept a payment from the charity.\n\n\"A charitable foundation is about the safest third party payer you could have,\" said\n\nSara Coyne, a health care lawyer with Quarles & Brady, a national law firm. \"It's insulated from the incentives the hospitals or other groups might have to pay premiums.\"\n\nBelfort, of Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, said there is nothing in Obamacare that prohibits third-party payments. But he said recent statements by the federal government have created confusion.\n\nIn October, the department of Health and Human Services said in a letter the health plans sold through the exchanges are not subject to federal kickback rules which would block hospitals, drug companies and other third parties from subsidizing insurance premiums and providing other financial assistance.\n\nBut in its Nov. 4 statement, the federal agency said it intends to closely monitor payments by third parties and \"take appropriate action if necessary.\"\n\nBelfort said he does not think the government is concerned about nonprofit charities like the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society helping patients pay their premiums. It is worried about hospitals and drug companies footing the premium bill for patients, he said. The government fears the new health insurance market created by Obamacare could become dysfunctional if it is overwhelmed by very sick patients with high medical bills, he said.\n\n\"Anything that skews enrollment toward sicker people and creates an environment where people wait until they get sick to enroll could create big problems for the program,\" Belfort said.\n\nThe American Hospital Association said in a legal advisory that blocking third-party payments would undermine one of the core objectives of Obamacare and hurt the \"poor and sick individuals most in need of insurance.\"\n\nThe insurance industry opposes third party payments.\n\n\"It is a conflict of interest for hospitals and drug companies to pay patients' premiums and cost-sharing for the sole purpose of increasing utilization of their services and products,\" said Karen Ignagni, president and CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry association.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America says drug companies have provided assistance to more than 8 million Americans since 2005 by providing free or discounted medicines. Without such assistance, many patients would stop taking their drugs, leading to poor health outcomes and higher medical costs, that group said.\n\nAndrea Greif of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society said her organization has not yet heard of any other cases like Richards'. Last year the society provided more than $41 million to help 18,000 patients with their co-payments and insurance premiums.\n\nRichards is afraid other people will run into the same problem she did.\n\n\"Somebody who doesn't have half the fight I do is going to slip through the cracks and die,\" she said.\n\nYou can contact health writer James T.
