A Missouri Republican legislator is suing in federal court for a personal opt-out for his family.\n\nState Rep. Paul Wieland is a devout Catholic who\u2019s petitioned for an exemption to the birth control coverage included on the insurance policy he gets as an elected state official. He doesn\u2019t want it to be available to his two adult daughters, ages 19 and 20, and his youngest daughter, 13. (For that matter, the policy covers birth control for Wieland\u2019s wife, too, but that's not his grounds for suing.)\n\nOtherwise, Wieland\u2019s attorney told a federal appeals court, forcing Wieland to accept birth control coverage would be like forcing Mormon parents to \u201cstock unlocked liquor cabinets\u201d for their children when the parents are away.\n\nNow, this is puzzling for a couple of reasons. The first is that conservatives argue consistently that matters of family morality aren\u2019t for the government to intrude on \u2013 requiring sex education in schools comes to mind. But Wieland evidently wants the courts to help him manage his family\u2019s morality by keeping his daughters away from the enticements of birth control.\n\nThe other perplexing reason is this: if the Wielands are the parents they surely try to be, haven\u2019t they already taught their daughters that their church regards almost all birth control as a sin? Do they not have enough faith in their parenting, and in their daughters\u2019 character, to think they will follow those precepts? Is prohibiting premarital sex the domain of parents but barring access to birth control the responsibility of the government?\n\nTo that point, Wieland\u2019s attorney, Timothy Belz, told the court, \u201cWe all have high hopes for our kids, that is true. We all expect and want them to obey us, and they don\u2019t always.\u201d\n\nIs prohibiting premarital sex the domain of parents but barring access to birth control the responsibility of the government?\n\nAppeals court Judge James Loken, widely quoted in news accounts, evidently didn\u2019t see parallels between Hobby Lobby and the Wieland family. \u201cThere\u2019s much greater control by a parent than an employer. All the parents have to do is say, \u2018We expect you to abide by our religious tenet.\u2019 That\u2019s a non-event.\u201d\n\nWieland had requested the same exemption last year, before the Hobby Lobby ruling, but a lower court turned him down for lack of legal standing. Now he wants his case reinstated.\n\nWieland's attorney acknowledges that Wieland could buy a private insurance policy with no birth control coverage through his business, which is an insurance company. It's more expensive than his current state-issued policy, but how can you put a price on morality? He has the choice, costlier though it may be, so why not opt for that, rather than file a suit which makes him sound like he wants the government to help him bring up his daughters?\n\nFollow Patt Morrison on Twitter @pattmlatimes", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Dad pleads: Don't let health insurance offer my daughters birth control!", "date": "2014-09-22", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Remember the prediction that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to let Hobby Lobby opt out of Obamacare contraception coverage would open the floodgates for more of the same?", "title": "Dad pleads: Don't let health insurance offer my daughters birth control!", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-ol-dad-pleads-health-insurance-daughters-birth-control-20140922-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54206d0f/turbine/la-ol-dad-pleads-health-insurance-daughters-birth-control-20140922", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp15.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Paul Wieland, Obamacare, health insurance, birth control, missouri", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81448679", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "Paul Wieland, Obamacare, health insurance, birth control, missouri", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Remember the prediction that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to let Hobby Lobby opt out of Obamacare contraception coverage would open the floodgates for more of the same?
