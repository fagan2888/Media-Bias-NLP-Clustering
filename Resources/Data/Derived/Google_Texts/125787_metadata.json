The research, which was presented at an African elephant summit in Botswana last month, showed a clear connection for the first time between elephant poaching and child deaths. The research was completed by several conservation groups such as TRAFFIC, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.\n\nReuters reports that most of the places where infant mortality and poverty are highest also see plenty of elephant poaching, but poverty-stricken villagers often do not benefit from the industry. \u201c[T]he ivory trade \u2014 with its long and blood-stained history,\u201d Ed Stoddard writes on Reuters, \u201cis similar to other extractive industries in Africa, which have been exploited to meet demand elsewhere with few rewards for local people.\u201d\n\nThe report measured infant mortality rates, by counting the number of child deaths under the age of one per every 10,000 live births. \u201cHuman infant mortality, which is interpreted as a proxy for poverty, is the single strongest site-level correlate \u2026 with sites suffering from higher levels of poverty experiencing higher levels of elephant poaching,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThis suggests that there may be a greater incentive to facilitate or participate in the illegal killing of elephants in areas where human livelihoods are insecure. Furthermore, this relationship highlights a close linkage between the well-being of people and that of the elephant populations with which they coexist.\u201d\n\nInfant mortality occurs when a baby under the age of 1 dies, usually due to serious birth defects, preterm births, or pregnancy complications. In poorer countries, where pregnant women have little to no access to medical aid, the rate of pregnancy complications and infant deaths is higher. According to the World Bank, Angola, the Republic of Congo, and Somalia were among the countries with the highest infant mortality rates.\n\nElephant poaching, though it had declined in the 1990s, has risen dramatically in recent years. In June 2012, TRAFFIC reported that elephant poaching levels were \u201cthe worst in a decade and recorded ivory seizures are at their highest levels since 1989.\u201d In the same report, TRAFFIC noted that China and Thailand are the two primary destinations for the illicit ivory trade being exported from Africa. Back in 2012, conservation groups had already linked poverty to poaching. \u201cMIKE [Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants] analysis shows poaching to be highest where human livelihoods are most insecure and where\u2026 law enforcement [is] weakest,\u201d Julian Blanc, coordinator of the United Nations-backed MIKE program, said in the TRAFFIC report. However, this is the first time that a report has clear statistics to back up this claim.\n\nThe areas with the highest rates of infant mortality include Ziama in Guinea, Niassa Province in Mozambique, and Bangassou in the Central African Republic, the researchers found in the recent report. These places had an infant mortality rates ranging from 1,240 to 1,400 deaths per 10,000 births. These three areas also had unusually high poaching rates.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "elephant poaching, africa, infant mortality, ziama, conservation", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "For the first time, researchers found a clear connection between elephant poaching in Africa and infant mortality.", "title": "Elephant Poaching Linked To High Rates Of Infant Mortality", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/elephant-poaching-africa-connected-high-rates-infant-mortality-poverty-266209", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/02/elephants.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For the first time, researchers found a clear connection between elephant poaching in Africa and infant mortality.", "title": "Elephant Poaching Linked To High Rates Of Infant Mortality", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/elephant-poaching-africa-connected-high-rates-infant-mortality-poverty-266209", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/02/elephants.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/02/elephants.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-02T17:57:02-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-02T17:56:57-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "For the first time, researchers found a clear connection between elephant poaching in Africa and infant mortality."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42fb\"", "article_summary": "According to the World Bank, Angola, the Republic of Congo, and Somalia were among the countries with the highest infant mortality rates.\nThese places had an infant mortality rates ranging from 1,240 to 1,400 deaths per 10,000 births.\nThese three areas also had unusually high poaching rates.\nElephant poaching, though it had declined in the 1990s, has risen dramatically in recent years.\nReuters reports that most of the places where infant mortality and poverty are highest also see plenty of elephant poaching, but poverty-stricken villagers often do not benefit from the industry."}
