Days earlier, Sanders spoke before about 10,000 people in Madison, Wisconsin. The former secretary of state made no mention of Sanders but warned that Republicans would unravel President Barack Obama\u2019s policies if they recaptured the White House, including the repeal of his signature health care overhaul.\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\u201cI take a backseat to no one when you look at my record of standing up and fighting for progressive values,\u201d Clinton said on a sun-dappled kickoff to the Fourth of July weekend in Hanover, New Hampshire, across the Connecticut River from Sanders\u2019 home state of Vermont.\n\nThe Democratic presidential front-runner portrayed herself as a candidate of continuity to Obama and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, praising the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling upholding health care subsidies under the overhaul. She said if the nation elected a Republican president, \u201cthey will repeal the Affordable Care Act. That is as certain as I can say.\u201d\n\nShe said Obama and her husband had both inherited a series of economic headaches when they entered office and urged voters to elect another Democrat \u201cto continue the policies that actually work for the vast majority of Americans.\u201d\n\nClinton said at the end of her husband\u2019s two terms, the economy had generated 22 million jobs, a balanced budget and \u201ca surplus that would have paid off our national debt if it had not been rudely interrupted by the next administration.\u201d\n\nThe former New York senator\u2019s team has been wary of likening her to the equivalent of Obama\u2019s third term but her acclaim for the president\u2019s policies highlighted a string of recent victories by the White House in its defense of the health care law, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling allowing gay marriage and steady economic numbers.\n\nIn a rare discussion of foreign policy, Clinton spoke supportively of Obama\u2019s efforts to reach an agreement with Iran to curb the country\u2019s nuclear program, talks that she helped set in motion as secretary of state. Previewing next week\u2019s deadline for negotiations, Clinton said she hoped the U.S. would \u201cget a deal that puts a lid on Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program\u201d but said it was \u201ctoo soon\u201d to know if that was possible.\n\nSeeking the Democratic nomination, Clinton\u2019s focus has been on economic issues, the driving force behind Sanders\u2019 recent rise in polls. The senator describes himself as a democratic socialist and has won elections in Vermont as an independent. He has drawn large crowds around the country and reported raising $15 million since late April, about one-third of the $45 million Clinton has brought in.\n\nSanders said on Friday in an email to supporters that he would release a series of policy proposals in the next few weeks \u201cto address the major issues facing our nation.\u201d The campaign is seeking to ramp up its volunteer base and planning to hold organizing meetings across the nation on July 29.\n\nClinton\u2019s allies have sought to lower expectations despite her early command of the primary field. During a stop at an ice cream shop in Lebanon, New Hampshire, Clinton told reporters \u201cI always knew this was going to be competitive\u201d and said she was looking forward to a \u201cgreat debate.\u201d\n\nSome of the people who came to see Clinton at Dartmouth said Sanders could ultimately have a positive influence on her in the nation\u2019s first primary state.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s pushing her to address some issues and I think that will be all for the good,\u201d said Sybil Buell, a Norwich, Vermont, resident who attended the Clinton event. Buell said she was \u201con the fence\u201d over whether to support Clinton or Sanders in the early stages of the campaign.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little feeling of inevitability with her,\u201d said Chuck Manns, of Lebanon, New Hampshire, who backed Clinton in 2008. He said Sanders was a \u201ccuriosity right now,\u201d but predicted Clinton\u2019s electability would shine through.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday she takes a \"backseat to no one\" on championing liberal causes, presenting herself as a standard-bearer for Democrats as primary challenger Bernie Sanders generates large, energetic crowds.", "pubdate": 20150704, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday she takes a \"backseat to no one\" on championing liberal causes, presenting herself as a standard-bearer for Democrats as primary challenger Bernie Sanders generates large, energetic crowds.", "title": "As Sanders draws large crowds, Clinton touts progressive record", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/hrc-july-3.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/hilary-clinton-touts-record-standing-progressive-values/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday she takes a \"backseat to no one\" on championing liberal causes, presenting herself as a standard-bearer for Democrats as primary challenger Bernie Sanders generates large, energetic crowds.", "title": "As Sanders draws large crowds, Clinton touts progressive record", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/hrc-july-3.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Vote 2016"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Democrat, Hillary Clinton, New Hampshire, PBS NewsHour Weekend, Vote 2016"}, "article_summary": "Seeking the Democratic nomination, Clinton\u2019s focus has been on economic issues, the driving force behind Sanders\u2019 recent rise in polls.\nBuell said she was \u201con the fence\u201d over whether to support Clinton or Sanders in the early stages of the campaign.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little feeling of inevitability with her,\u201d said Chuck Manns, of Lebanon, New Hampshire, who backed Clinton in 2008.\nHANOVER, N.H. \u2014 Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday she takes a \u201cbackseat to no one\u201d on championing liberal causes, presenting herself as a standard-bearer for Democrats as primary challenger Bernie Sanders generates large, energetic crowds.\nHe has drawn large crowds around the country and reported raising $15 million since late April, about one-third of the $45 million Clinton has brought in."}
