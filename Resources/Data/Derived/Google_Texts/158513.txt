Taylor Swift is an unlikely uber-nerd in Jimmy Fallon’s latest edition of “Ew!” his recurring “Tonight Show” teen girl sketch. Unlike previous guests, which include Zac Efron and Will Ferrell, Swift’s Natalie and Fallon’s Sara do not seem to have much in common: Natalie likes apricots, wears rimmed glasses, and has a band-aid collection. Ew. But then they play a track by Selena Gomez, the great teen girl unifier, and dance together as they mock Sara’s fuddy-duddy dad. All is ew.
