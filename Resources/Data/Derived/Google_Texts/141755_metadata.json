He knew his competitors were so far back it would have been impossible for them to catch him, as long as he didn\u2019t walk. He won in 16 hours, 33 minutes, 54 seconds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge one for me,\u201d Sharman said at the finish. \u201cIt kind of all went to plan. I would have liked a faster time. But it was a more tactical race than a time trial.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Liza Howard, a 43-year-old mother of an 8-year-old and a 2-year old from San Antonio running the event for the fourth time, didn\u2019t believe she had won her second Leadville 100 until she crossed the finish line in 19:34:09 \u2014 just 20 minutes ahead of Boulder\u2019s Kara Henry. The second-place finisher behind Sharman \u2014 Denver\u2019s Kyle Pietari \u2014 came in nearly two hours later in 18:16:04.\n\nIn a field of nearly 650 runners representing 47 states and 26 countries, Howard was the sixth person \u2014 male or female \u2014 to complete the race.\n\n\u201cOnce I passed her (at Hope Pass), I just kind of kept going,\u201d said Howard, who has finished second twice here. \u201cAnd I was so comfortable, I went back to my plan. And then at mile 75, I realized she was right there \u2014 she was 90 seconds back. So the rest of the race was real stressful.\u201d\n\nA duel in the mountains\n\nFor Sharman, a native of Great Britain who moved to the United States in 2009, the relief and satisfaction of victory were tempered by the disappointment of the collapse of his chief rival, Arvada\u2019s Mike Aish, whose uneven race strategy forced him to eventually drop out at the 86th mile. He pushed the pace early and then suffered from an upset stomach, unable to consume food and calories \u2014 a vital part of successfully completing an ultramarathon.\n\n\u201cMike could have broken the record if he had just run a little bit more conservative,\u201d Sharman said. \u201cI really felt badly for him. I wanted him to have a good race. I wanted to beat him, but I wanted him to have a good race.\u201d\n\nAish passed Sharman near the 24-mile mark at the Outward Bound aid station while Sharman paused for a bathroom break.\n\n\u201cHe went off on his own, and he started speeding up. That\u2019s what brought him down,\u201d Sharman said. \u201cI think he\u2019d have probably won if he had stayed with me. So I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSharman was third at the Winfield aid station turnaround at mile 50, then eventually caught Aish just before Hope Pass. He extended his lead on the descent, and then he never saw him again.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t talking,\u201d Sharman said. \u201cBut he went fast downhill, so he tried to match me on that. And I think that\u2019s where it kind of broke his legs. He couldn\u2019t go as fast later.\u201d\n\nAish had been only six minutes behind Sharman at Twin Lakes about 15 miles before, but the gap grew to about an hour within a short stretch. Aish looked spent by the time he reached Outward Bound on the way back into Leadville, resting for 10 minutes on a cot in the medical area, sipping from a Crush soda, unable to keep down anything else. He hadn\u2019t eaten in hours, and after his pacesetter urged him to go on, he reluctantly stood up before gingerly walking out to the road to continue.\n\n\u201cSome days you have good days, some days you have bad days and you can pull it through,\u201d Aish said. \u201cYou know I was running on fumes about four hours ago. And now I\u2019m just plodding.\u201d\n\nA return to Leadville\n\nHoward\u2019s connection to Leadville goes back years, when the New Balance-sponsored runner spent two summers in her 30s working at Outward Bound in Leadville, a location also used as an aid station about one-quarter and again at three-quarters of the way through the race. Her former boss even met her there and gave her a hug as she passed through.\n\n\u201cThe ultrarunning world is such a small world,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI\u2019m happy for the time, but ultrarunning has done quite a bit to give me extended family.\u201d\n\nRumors about Henry infiltrated Howard and her camp. Howard started out behind Henry and was told by various people: She has never run a 100-miler before, she was young and inexperienced. All of that turned out to be untrue, but it only fueled her fear that she could be passed at any moment.\n\n\u201cI just really expected her to fly by me,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Howard says this will be her last Leadville 100 \u2014 she plans to return to watch and help others race as a crew member \u2014 Sharman was enthusiastic about returning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll definitely be back, probably next year,\u201d Sharman said. \u201cI\u2019ll do this a few more times. I like it; it\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Leadville 100 winners Ian Sharman, Liza Howard run very different races", "title": "Leadville 100 winners Ian Sharman, Liza Howard run very different races", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/23/leadville-100-winners-ian-sharman-liza-howard-run-very-different-races/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150823__Leadville-100p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150823__Leadville-100p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-23T20:10:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T06:40:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSome days you have good days, some days you have bad days and you can pull it through,\u201d Aish said.\nI wanted to beat him, but I wanted him to have a good race.\u201dAish passed Sharman near the 24-mile mark at the Outward Bound aid station while Sharman paused for a bathroom break.\nWhile Howard says this will be her last Leadville 100 \u2014 she plans to return to watch and help others race as a crew member \u2014 Sharman was enthusiastic about returning.\n\u201cOnce I passed her (at Hope Pass), I just kind of kept going,\u201d said Howard, who has finished second twice here.\n\u201cMike could have broken the record if he had just run a little bit more conservative,\u201d Sharman said."}
