Lenexa, Kansas-based AxelaCare Health Solutions, a national provider of specialty home infusion services, has purchased Florida-based Ambient Healthcare for an undisclosed sum, the companies announced this week. The deal expands AxelaCare's home intravenous therapy network.

Ambient Healthcare offers home intravenous therapies and nursing care. The acquisition, announced on Monday, expands AxelaCare’s reach into the Southeast and follows its recent acquisition of Advanced Care, a home IV therapy company in the New York-New Jersey metro area, according to AxelaCare spokesman Chuck Weber.

With its most recent acquisition, AxelaCare has 34 intravenous solutions pharmacies nationwide, adding Ambient Healthcare’s 16 pharmacies in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.

Home infusion is the administration of prescription drugs and solutions in the home via intravenous, intraspinal, epidural and subcutaneous therapies. The use of these therapies shortens hospital stays, saves healthcare dollars, and improves recovery, while avoiding costly hospital readmissions, according to AxelaCare.

As a larger share of the population seeks access to home infusion services, local pharmacies are responding by offering acute infusion services, Weber said.
