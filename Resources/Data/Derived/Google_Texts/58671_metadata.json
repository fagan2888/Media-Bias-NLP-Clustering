Mike Huckabee Hogan Gidley joined Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM with guest host Matthew Boyle, Breitbart News\u2019 Washington political editor, and slammed 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney for claiming the presumptive 2016 GOP nominee Donald Trump isn\u2019t conservative.\n\n\u201cHe claimed to be severely conservative, whatever in the world that is,\u201d Gidley said of Romney.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThis is the guy who created Romneycare, who was the template for Obamacare. Mitt Romney marched in gay pride parades. He did the first same sex wedding in America, put homosexuals in the Supreme Court in Massachusetts. He boasted, remember in that famous clip of him and Ted Kennedy, that he was more pro-choice than anyone and then hosted a Planned Parenthood event and then contributed to them. He puffed up and said the folks that didn\u2019t vote for Reagan, he didn\u2019t identify with those Republicans who liked Reagan.\n\n\u201cIf this were anybody but Donald Trump they would be telling everybody to get on board,\u201d Gidley said of Romney and the establishment wing of the Republican Party. \u201cTheir guy didn\u2019t win and they don\u2019t know what to do. They don\u2019t want to get behind us.\u201d\n\nGidley addressed Cruz supporters, and \u2018Never Trump\u2019 people, saying, \u201cCruz is telling the truth. This is a generational election of the Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton is a horrible choice for national security. She\u2019s a horrible choice for the economy. If that is true, it\u2019s true regardless of who is at the top of the ticket.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is at the top, so it still applies. Hillary is still the worse option for this country,\u201d Gidley charged. \u201cThese folks who are the hold out\u2026 what has their brand of conservative orthodoxy done for us?\u201d\n\nThe debt is larger. The deficit is enormous. We still have job killing trade. There\u2019s an open border immigration policy. It\u2019s killed our middle class. The tax system is still a mess. We\u2019re no closer to ending abortion. Obamacare is still funded. The Iran nuclear deal went through. What have they given us as Republicans?\n\nBreitbart News Sunday airs from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 every Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hogan Gidley to Mitt Romney, 'Never Trumpers': 'What Have They Given us as Republicans?'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Hogan Gidley to Mitt Romney, 'Never Trumpers': 'What Have They Given us as Republicans?'", "title": "Hogan Gidley to Mitt Romney, 'Never Trumpers': 'What Have They Given us as Republicans?' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/AP_546455140997.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-05-15T21:06:19-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/05/15/hogan-gidley-mitt-romney-never-trumpers-given-us-republicans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hogan Gidley to Mitt Romney, 'Never Trumpers': 'What Have They Given us as Republicans?'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/AP_546455140997.jpg", "title": "Hogan Gidley to Mitt Romney, 'Never Trumpers': 'What Have They Given us as Republicans?' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Hogan Gidley, Mitt Romney,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,romney", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-05-15T20:58:22-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2016-05-15T21:06:19-07:00", "tag": "Mitt Romney", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe claimed to be severely conservative, whatever in the world that is,\u201d Gidley said of Romney.\nHe puffed up and said the folks that didn\u2019t vote for Reagan, he didn\u2019t identify with those Republicans who liked Reagan.\n\u201cIf this were anybody but Donald Trump they would be telling everybody to get on board,\u201d Gidley said of Romney and the establishment wing of the Republican Party.\nMike Huckabee Hogan Gidley joined Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM with guest host Matthew Boyle, Breitbart News\u2019 Washington political editor, and slammed 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney for claiming the presumptive 2016 GOP nominee Donald Trump isn\u2019t conservative.\nThey don\u2019t want to get behind us.\u201dGidley addressed Cruz supporters, and \u2018Never Trump\u2019 people, saying, \u201cCruz is telling the truth."}
