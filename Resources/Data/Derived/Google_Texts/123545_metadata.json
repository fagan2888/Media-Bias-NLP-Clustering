I keep a daily journal of the most interesting media that crosses my path each day. See or create something I should check out? Email me at DaveSwindlePJM@gmail.com\n\n1. From the publication where a decade ago I wrote op/ed columns and movie reviews as an undergrad: Ball State students get close for cash\n\nEllis has had a few online conversations, but he has not gone on any dates because he said there are not a lot of Sugar Daddies looking for gay Sugar Babies. \u201cBeing gay in the sugaring world is not a common thing because it\u2019s usually girls who are in their 20s who find older men who just want to spoil them,\u201d Ellis said. Both students use SeekingArrangement.com, a website used to connect potential Sugar Babies to benefactors offering monthly lifestyle budgets ranging from less than $1,000 to more than $10,000. The website recently released a press release announcing the top 20 fastest growing Sugar Baby schools: Indiana University is No. 18, Ball State at No. 58 and Purdue University at No. 66. Seeking Arrangement targets college students looking to earn money to ease student debt. According to a press release, college students make up 42 percent of the website\u2019s Sugar Baby membership. \u201cA lot of these college students don\u2019t have jobs and they\u2019re fighting to pay student loans with increases in the cost of education,\u201d said Leroy Velasquez, public relations manager for the website. \u201cAnd rather than graduate with a financial burden on their back before they even get a job, they could just date a Sugar Daddy on Seeking Arrangement and graduate debt free.\u201d\n\nOne woman chooses to become a prostitute in order to support a drug addiction. That's understandable and tragic. My favorite movie, Requiem for a Dream, is a heartbreaking story. A woman is so desperate for her fix that she abandons the man she loves and degrades herself.\n\nBut so you can avoid having to pay student loans back for a few years? You let some guy you're not attracted to pay you to have a fake relationship with him and then rent your body to him?\n\nIt just breaks my heart that some women place so low a value on themselves.\n\n2. Via Conservative Videos and hat tip to SLM Goldberg: Kirsten Powers: Being A Democrat \u2018Was My Religion\u2019 Before Christian Conversion\n\n3. Victor Davis Hanson here at PJM: Eating Our Young\n\nMajor props to Ed Driscoll for this awesome graphic illustrating the lead story of the week:\n\nThe baby-boomer/me generation demands what its \u201cgreatest generation\u201d parents got \u2014 or, in fact, far more, given its increased rates of longevity. The solution of more taxes and less benefits will fall on young people and the unborn, apparently on the premise that those under 18 do not vote, and those between 18 and 30 either vote less frequently than their grandparents or less knowledgeably about their own self-interest. The Social Security pyramidal scheme is merely the tip of the ephebiphobic iceberg. Currently student indebtedness exceeds $1 trillion. Many of these loans begin compounding before graduation and are pegged at interest rates far higher than parental mortgages. The cause of this tuition bubble is also not controversial. The prices colleges charge for annual tuition, room and board have for over two decades far exceeded the annual rate of inflation. There were four causes of such price gouging of students. None of them had anything to do with offering better education for a more competitive price for job-hungry graduates.\n\n4. Jared Sichel at The Jewish Journal: Holocaust in North Korea\n\nAt the museum, Shin sought the horrific images from 1945 of thousands of decomposing bodies from a liberated Nazi concentration camp being dug up by a bulldozer. The horror of that image, which he had viewed for the first time in South Korea, convinced him that he must do what he can to raise awareness of the plight of the prisoners languishing today in North Korea\u2019s four concentration camps. Shin has become, despite his desire to remain private, a public face for what is a growing movement to shed light on North Korea\u2019s totalitarian government and its unrelenting political imprisonment of its countrymen. The international media coverage of North Korea tends to focus on anything but the country\u2019s humanitarian crisis. We hear about the country\u2019s nuclear program or the budding friendship between former American basketball star Dennis Rodman and North Korea\u2019s 31-year-old dictator Kim Jong-un, or the latter\u2019s recent execution of his uncle, Jang Sung-taek, formerly Kim\u2019s No. 2 man. But Shin is a living testament to the fact that attention must be paid to what is happening to a completely hidden population: Nearly seven decades after the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet forces on Jan. 27, 1945, North Korea\u2019s concentration camps have now existed more than 12 times longer than the Nazi camps and twice as long as the Soviet gulag. ..... As lunch wound down, Shin\u2019s translator said that they had to leave soon for another interview. So I asked him if we could discuss a light topic \u2014 God. Shin responded that although he isn\u2019t entirely convinced of God\u2019s existence, he does believe he received help from above. \u201cI believe that there was a higher being, a higher power involved with my life, for me to be where I am right now,\u201d he said. Like all of North Korea, Camp 14 was devoid of any religion, of anything that could challenge the Kim family\u2019s throne. Today, Shin attends an Evangelical church in Seoul whenever he can, and, in fact, finds solace in Moses and the story of the Exodus \u2014 a self-doubting leader who helped an enslaved people escape a tyrant. \u201cWhen I look at North Korea now,\u201d Shin said, \u201cIt reminds me of ancient Egypt and the Pharaohs.\u201d\n\nRead the whole thing. Jared is an extraordinary writer with a lot of talent. I look forward to seeing what he continues to do.\n\n5. Jeremy Boreing at Truth Revolt: Gay Marriage at the Grammys: All Art is Propaganda\n\nOn the surface, it\u2019s easy to criticize Sunday night\u2019s Grammy Awards telecast for sliding from a celebration of music into a celebration of gay marriage with Macklemore and Ryan Lewis\u2019s live performance of \u201cSame Love,\u201d featuring Mary Lambert, Madonna, Queen Latifa and 33 couples \u2013 gay and straight \u2013 tying the knot. There\u2019s no question that the sanctimonious display, complete with gospel choir, stained-glass cathedral motif and pseudo-religious rhymes was intended to propagandize Americans into further support for gay marriage by giving the appearance of universal acceptance among the glitterati while marginalizing opposition from religious conservatives by reducing their motives to \u201cfear\u201d and \u201cplaying God.\u201d \u201cRight wing conservatives think it\u2019s a decision,\u201d the lyric intones. The fact that the socialist mayor of New York\u2019s former lesbian wife agrees with that assessment is of no more concern to the songwriter than the fact that the current Democratic president \u2013 and indeed all of the Democratic presidents who went before him \u2013 all saw marriage as a male/female issue until right about election time last year. Still, to turn one\u2019s nose up at the Grammys for letting a show meant to honor art turn into a propaganda-fest is to misrepresent art itself. The simple fact is that all art is propaganda. From the first man scrawling on the first cave wall to da Vinci to the Beatles, the purpose of the artist is always to communicate a unique perspective in the hopes of moving the audience. In fact, for most of human history (and perhaps even still\u2026) art has been less a business and more a patronage system where the wealthy would literally pay for art that promoted their vision of the world, not the artists. It\u2019s hard to say what Michelangelo\u2019s personal beliefs on scripture were, but his employer\u2019s motive of inspiring awe in the face of the divine lives on in the Sistine Chapel and the Accademia to this day. As capitalism has imprinted itself on art, the values of the artist themselves have taken a more dominant role. The idea of neutral art is as misguided as the idea of objective journalism \u2013 it has never existed in all of human history, and it shouldn\u2019t.\n\nRead the whole thing. Spot on. Jeremy is someone else I should make a point to keep an eye on. This is a great piece the way he puts the Grammys in a bigger discussion about the nature of art.\n\n6. Michael Ledeen here at PJM: Hey Stupid! It\u2019s Not About Nukes, It\u2019s About Life and Death\n\nThere are none so blind as those who will not see, and hardly anyone wants to see Iran for what it is: an evil regime bound and determined to dominate and destroy us, our friends and our allies. The evidence is luminously clear, but most all of our attention has focused, as usual, on the nuclear issue. Did the Iranians promise to stop enriching uranium or \u201cdismantle\u201d some of the components of their nuclear program? How many Western sanctions are being eased or lifted in exchange? And on and on\u2026 We don\u2019t know the answers to these questions, as the text of the agreement is secret. However, we do know that the Iranians now have six months \u2014 the sort of deadline that often slides \u2014 to reach a \u201cfinal\u201d agreement with the 5 + 1 countries. We can expect the Iranians to prolong and exploit this period to their advantage and our peril. They\u2019ve already begun. The Iranian regime is expanding its regional and global power, killing its domestic enemies, and subverting and intimidating Middle Eastern nations that are reluctant to bend to its will. These matters require serious Western attention, but they aren\u2019t getting much. For us, it\u2019s all about nukes and sanctions.\n\n7. Ed Driscoll here at PJM: The Evil of Banality\n\nAllan Bloom, call your office \u2014 New York intellectual life really had become an enclave of the Weimar Republic by the early 1960s; as Bloom wrote in 1986\u2019s The Closing of the American Mind, \u201cThe self-understanding of hippies, yippies, yuppies, panthers, prelates and presidents has unconsciously been formed by German thought of a half-century earlier; Herbert Marcuse\u2019s accent has been turned into a Middle Western twang; the echt Deutsch label has been replaced by a Made in America label; and the new American life-style has become a Disneyland version of the Weimar Republic for the whole family.\u201d\n\n8. Bryan Preston at the PJ Tatler: Hillary Wants to Get Benghazi Out of the Way\n\nJust for the sake of history, let\u2019s recall that Clinton could have prevented the attack but failed to do so. Her State Department turned down repeated requests for enhancing security at the U.S. facility in Benghazi. After the attack, she blamed it on a YouTube video and promised one of the parents of the victims that the U.S. government would go after and get the man who made that video. Clinton made good on that threat. The perpetrators who actually carried out the attack, however, remain at large and the Obama government has shown no interest in capturing them.\n\n9. Glenn Reynolds at USA Today: How Americans can kill Obamacare, legalize pot: Column\n\nFar fewer than half the number needed by March 31 have signed up. And, as it turns out, most of the people signing up for Obamacare aren't the uninsured for whom it was supposedly enacted, but people who were previously insured (many of whom lost their previous insurancebecause of Obamacare's new requirements). \"At most,\" writes Bloomberg's Megan McArdle, \"they've signed up 15% of the uninsured that they were expecting to enroll. ... Where are the uninsured? Did hardly any of them want coverage beginning Jan. 1?\" It looks that way. In fact, there seem to be more uninsured than there were before Obama took office, leaving Jonah Goldberg to ask, \"So what was the point of Obamacare again?\"\n\n10. Bryan Preston at PJ Tatler: Could Obamacare Become a Generational Problem for Democrats?\n\nThere are a couple of major flaws leading to fewer millennials than needed signing up. One, it\u2019s cheaper just to pay the fine for violating the individual mandate than to buy insurance that most young people don\u2019t need. Young single men don\u2019t need to buy pregnancy and mammography coverage, but Obamacare mandates it, making policies more expensive. Additionally, Obamacare allows younger people to stay on their parents\u2019 plans until they\u2019re 26. That slices off the 18-26 part of the 18-34 demo that needs to sign up in greater numbers.\n\nReading of the Day, from Ann Coulter's Mugged: Racial Demagoguery from the Seventies to Obama, page 94:\n\nBAD IDEAS MEAN MORE MURDER.
