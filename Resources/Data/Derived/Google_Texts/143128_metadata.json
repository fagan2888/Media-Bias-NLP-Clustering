It pushed talking points to a who\u2019s who of liberal groups that support the law.\n\nThe Center for American Progress, the AARP, the Service Employees International Union, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and MoveOn.org are all listed among the group\u2019s 176 partners.\n\nSEE ALSO: President: Obamacare in need of \u2018rebrand\u2019 effort\n\nHerndon has repeatedly advised those groups and individuals through talking points memos posted on its website to promise American health care consumers that Obamacare will not disrupt their health care or health insurance.\n\n\u201cWhen President Barack Obama says Americans can maintain their \u2018choice\u2019 of doctors and insurance plans, he is using a Herndon strategy for wringing fear out of a system overhaul,\u201d Politico noted in a 2009 piece on the group.\n\nHowever, recent events have shown those talking points are false. Millions of Americans are receiving cancelation notices from insurance companies whose plans do not meet Obamacare\u2019s minimum coverage requirements.\n\nAn analysis by McClatchy found that as many as 52 million Americans could lose, or already have lost, their pre-Obamacare insurance plans.\n\nInsurers are also reducing the number of doctors in their networks due to Obamacare regulations, belying promises by Obama and congressional Democrats that, as the president claimed, \u201cif you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period.\u201d\n\nThe speech in which Obama made that promise earned the president Herndon\u2019s \u201cbest messaging of the week award\u201d in June 2009.\n\n\u201cIt was the best messaging we\u2019ve seen on specific health reform issues,\u201d wrote Herndon Alliance executive director Bob Crittenden.\n\n\u201cFor those who have questions about how to talk about the complex issues that surround health care reform they need to look no further than the president\u2019s words\u2014they are spot on,\u201d Crittenden insisted.\n\nHerndon pushed the same talking points to liberal groups and individuals throughout the health care debate.\n\nA June memo laid out an \u201ceffective message frame to counter attack,\u201d advising Obamacare proponents to promise that the law would \u201cgive you the freedom of choice to keep your current plan including keeping your current doctor.\u201d\n\nAnother memo described \u201ca template for responses\u201d and claimed, \u201cReform will give us the freedom of secure choices\u2014to keep our plan and doctors.\u201d\n\nThe group continued to tout those talking points through early 2012, insisting in one talking points memo on Obamacare\u2019s health insurance exchanges that they \u201coffers plans that allow you to keep your doctors\u201d and that they are \u201cvoluntary; if you like what you have you can keep it.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials knew as early as June 2010 that as many as 93 million Americans could lose their health insurance under the law, according to Manhattan Institute health policy expert Avik Roy.\n\nHerndon fully understood how important the preservation of existing insurance plans would be in propping up public opinion of the law.\n\n\u201cGuarantees of coverage, including keeping your current doctor, are the strongest testing features of an exchange,\u201d noted survey results published last year on its website, referring to Obamacare\u2019s health insurance marketplaces.\n\nHerndon did not respond to requests for comment on its repeated promotion of what appear to be false talking points.\n\nThose talking points helped shape the rhetorical and political cases for passing Obamacare in March 2010. The group is \u201csomeone that everybody talks to, that everybody listens to,\u201d AARP toldPolitico.\n\n\u201cThe research from 2006 to 2007 was fundamental to helping shape our view of how to talk about health care and, generally, how progressives and Democrats talk about health care,\u201d a spokesman for the Obamacare-supporting umbrella group Health Care for America Now remarked.\n\nHerndon\u2019s annual revenue shot above $1 million during and directly after the health care debate, but has since declined to under $600,000, according to annual IRS filings.\n\nSome of the county\u2019s most prominent left-wing foundations have supported the group, including the Tides Foundation and billionaire liberal moneyman George Soros\u2019 Open Society Institute.\n\n\u2022 Lachlan Markay is a staff writer for the Washington Free Beacon.
