Republicans shut down the government over their opposition to health care reform.\n\n\"The reason I said that is that Einstein said the sign of insanity is when you do something over and over again and expect a different result,\" Reid told Esquire magazine. \"They've voted forty-four times to defund Obamacare. Is that insanity? I think so.\"\n\nThat's not the first time Reid has hit Republicans with a curious turn of phrase. On Sept. 30 he compared Republicans to bullies, and in July he said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \"tried to make love to the tea party and they didn't like it.\"\n\nRead more of Reid's interview with Esquire here.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: 2013 Government Shutdown 2013 Government Shutdown\n\n1 of 242 John Boehner Speaker of the House Rep.
