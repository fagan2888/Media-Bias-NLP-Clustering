ITelagen provides medical practices and leading EHR platforms with certified technology support and hosting services that ensure both maximum system availability and security in a cost effective way.\n\n\u201cWith increased regulatory pressure and a growing number of healthcare facilities implementing new EHR systems, our market is poised for tremendous growth, and we are particularly well-positioned to become the industry leader,\u201d said John O\u2019Keefe, CEO of ITelagen. \"As we prepare for our next phase of growth, we couldn't be more enthusiastic to be partnering with GPB, a firm that shares our vision and commitment to customers. They are a trusted partner that provides our leadership team with exceptional financial and industry expertise.\u201d\n\nITelagen's technology platform ensures that client applications are running at optimal levels and that data is secure through 24/7 support and system monitoring. Its cloud-based system manages patient\u2019s EHRs, as well as assists with coding and billing records, medical and insurance claims, and categorizing insurance collections.\n\nGPB's capital investment comes as healthcare providers face mandates via the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to demonstrate the \"meaningful use\" of electronic health records practices in 2015 or face financial penalties.\n\n\"The healthcare industry is undergoing a significant transformation, and technology providers like ITelagen are playing a crucial role in making the industry more efficient,\u201d said Mike Frost, director, Managed IT Services, at GPB Capital. \u201cThey provide a well-defined offering of value-added IT and EHR solutions that not only help demonstrate meaningful use, but also help to protect patient data by duplicating the rigorous security standards used in the financial services industry. This is the first of several investments we will make in the Managed IT Services space this year, and we see ITelagen's platform being the foundation upon which will build as the market demand for solutions grows.\u201d\n\nDave Gentile, CEO of GPB Capital added: \"The team at ITelagen has built an outstanding company with a well-deserved reputation for quality, innovation, and customer service. It has demonstrated a track record of robust growth, innovation and has consistently developed strong partnerships with its customers.
