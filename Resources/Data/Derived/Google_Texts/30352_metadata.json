General fund spending is projected at $115.2 million in the new fiscal year that starts July 1. (Read the city's 300-page proposed budget here.)\n\nKey items to reach the $12.8 million figure include $4 million in proposed cuts to employee compensation, a roughly 5 percent trim to salaries and benefits that would require negotiations with labor unions; $4.2 million in savings from eliminating vacant positions; and $4 million from departmental cuts that will likely include some layoffs. Department heads will be asked to come up with an additional $620,000 in savings by making operations more efficient.\n\nA $16 million loan from Measure O, the city\u2019s half-cent sales tax, is also needed before July to maintain liquidity, the city says. Without the loan, the general fund would be $3.5 million in the red after covering deficits totaling $16.4 million in other funds, according to the report.\n\nThe proposed spending plan reflects findings of consultants Nyhoff brought on last fall to, among other things, sort out the city\u2019s convoluted financial picture. The total budget, at $359.4 million, includes separate funds for utilities and other services.\n\nThe reckoning has been grim.\n\n\u201cOur city was headed toward insolvency unless we acted immediately,\u201d Nyhoff wrote in an introductory report released with the budget.\n\nOxnard\u2019s fiscal troubles have hit as many cities are recovering from the Great Recession. Its problems stem from \u201cinappropriate and undisciplined practices\u201d that hid troubles brewing in the city\u2019s checkbook, the report says, including instances where the city was not complying with state laws.\n\nThursday\u2019s proposed spending plan is a vastly different budget document than Oxnard has produced in the past. It provides far greater detail and includes balances and five-year forecasts for all funds.\n\n\u201cPast budgets obscured the fact that many funds had deficit balances,\u201d Nyhoff wrote.\n\nSince early this year, Nyhoff has made clear cuts were coming. But scenarios have changed as more and more problems were uncovered. In recent weeks, public discussion has focused on the need to trim $10.8 million from the general fund. Thursday\u2019s documents put the overall number $2 million higher. On a practical level, however, reductions would total $8.6 million after savings from slashing vacant positions are factored in.\n\nThe budget proposal will be discussed by the City Council on Tuesday night, though no decisions will be made.\n\nA formal hearing is scheduled for June 16, with adoption slated for June 23. Additional workshops could be held next week if the council wishes.\n\nInitial reaction has been harsh from unions for the police and fire departments, which together make up 64 percent of general fund spending.\n\nThe Oxnard Firefighters Association released a statement Thursday night saying if the proposed cuts are enacted, \u201cbusinesses and citizens of Oxnard should be prepared to wait for an extraordinary amount of time for emergency services to arrive.\u201d The group says Oxnard\u2019s fire department already suffers from low staffing and funding. Its statement says the consulting firm Nyhoff hired is using legal and analysis teams that are \u201canti-employee.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday night, the Oxnard Peace Officers Association detailed proposed Police Department cuts on its Facebook page, adding: \u201cSpending more money for the animal shelter while we decrease funds to solve murders, investigate crimes and decrease police services is crazy!\u201d The comment referred to the City Council\u2019s approval this week of up to $1.7 million for county animal shelter services, an item with a significantly higher price tag in the new fiscal year because the county raised prices.\n\nBoth unions are asking supporters to contact council members.\n\nOxnard\u2019s shortfall stems from numerous problem areas.\n\nMore than two dozen funds for assessment districts and development fees had negative balances \u2014 which in some cases were improperly masked by excesses in others funds \u2014 amounting to more than $8 million. Rising pension costs in general are a factor, as is a $1 million budgeting error for a supplemental retirement plan. Some $5.5 million for public safety pensions must now come from the general fund. That\u2019s because Oxnard\u2019s past practice of paying all public safety pension costs from a special property tax wasn\u2019t consistent with state law, the city says. Deficits in the golf course and performing arts center funds total millions, while various budgeting errors and subsidies also contributed.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Oxnard is $12.8 million in the red and cuts are on the way, new budget says", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/oxnard/oxnard-is-128-million-in-the-red-and-cuts-are-on-the-way-new-budget-says-ep-1123269417-342083361.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/oxnardweb_19282984_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 291}, "type": "article", "description": "Oxnard's proposed budget was released Thursday, with calls for cuts affecting every department.", "title": "Oxnard is $12.8 million in the red and cuts are on the way, new budget says"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/oxnardweb_19282984_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Oxnard's proposed budget was released Thursday, with calls for cuts affecting every department.", "site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Oxnard is $12.8 million in the red and cuts are on the way, new budget says"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda153\"", "article_summary": "Without the loan, the general fund would be $3.5 million in the red after covering deficits totaling $16.4 million in other funds, according to the report.\nIt proposes $12.8 million in reductions to the general fund, the city\u2019s main checkbook for basic services such as police, fire and parks.\nGeneral fund spending is projected at $115.2 million in the new fiscal year that starts July 1.\nKey items to reach the $12.8 million figure include $4 million in proposed cuts to employee compensation, a roughly 5 percent trim to salaries and benefits that would require negotiations with labor unions; $4.2 million in savings from eliminating vacant positions; and $4 million from departmental cuts that will likely include some layoffs.\nIn recent weeks, public discussion has focused on the need to trim $10.8 million from the general fund."}
