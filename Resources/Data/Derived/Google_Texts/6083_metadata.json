Eric Cantor in Virginia, on President Barack Obama\u2019s broken promises related his signature health care law. For the rest of the segment, Hannity controlled the direction of the debate.\n\n\u201cDid President Obama promise if you like your plan, you can keep your plan?\u201d Hannity asked.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Dickinson conceded: \u201cHe did.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave people gotten their plans cancelled?\u201d Hannity pressed.\n\n\u201cThey did, just like when George W. Bush stood on that aircraft carrier and said \u2018mission accomplished,\u2019\u201d the Democrat said.\n\n\u201cBush has been out of office for six years,\u201d the host shot back. \u201cDid he say if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor?\u201d\n\nAgain, Dickinson was forced to admit that the president \u201cdid say that.\u201d\n\nWhen Hannity then asked if Obama promised Obamacare would save the average family $2,500 a year on health care costs, he answered that he \u201cmay have.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he said it,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cSo the bottom line is, he told lies and mistruths, the very criticism you have against us \u2014 and yet you support him. \u2026 You sound like a hypocrite.\u201d\n\nChanging the subject, Dickinson again said \u201call you do on your show is promote Obamacare and imply it is socialism.\u201d He also claimed he has talked to a \u201cridiculous\u201d amount of people who have this idea that Obamacare is socialism or \u201cbig government.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is big government,\u201d Hannity interrupted.\n\n\u201cIt is not, you can choose your own plan,\u201d he replied, adding that it was the insurance companies that kicked people off their plans because they are \u201cgreedy.\u201d\n\nConfronted again with Obama\u2019s \u201clie of the year,\u201d Dickinson admitted that \u201cthere\u2019s going to be small errors\u201d when dealing with legislative issues. Hannity pushed back, pointing out that seven million people have lost their plans so far.\n\nWatch the rest of the tough segment here:\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\n(H/T: Mediaite)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Democratic congressional candidate Mike Dickinson, who recently claimed \u201cFox News does nothing but tell lies\u201d and should be monitored by the FCC, was grilled by Sean Hannity Tuesday during an exchange the aspiring congressman may want to forget.  \u201cYou tell lies, you distort the truth, you promote hate,\u201d...", "creator": "@jason_howerton", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/26/sean-hannity-thoroughly-grills-dem-candidate-during-tense-battle-over-obamacare-you-sound-like-a-hypocrite/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Google-ChromeScreenSnapz006-620x347.jpg", "title": "Watch Dem Candidate Attempt to Explain Broken Obamacare Promises in Tough Sean Hannity Interview", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "sean, hannity, grills, democratic, congressional, candidate, mike, dickinson, obamacare", "sailthru.tags": "media, obamacare, politics, sean-hannity, us, video, author-jason-howerton, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 15269, "gplus-count": 3, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/770726", "categories": "obamacare,sean-hannity,video,media,politics,us", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 350, "description": "Democratic congressional candidate Mike Dickinson, who recently claimed \u201cFox News does nothing but tell lies\u201d and should be monitored by the FCC, was grilled by Sean Hannity Tuesday during an exchange the aspiring congressman may want to forget.  \u201cYou tell lies, you distort the truth, you promote hate,\u201d...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 2, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "Democratic congressional candidate Mike Dickinson, who recently claimed \u201cFox News does nothing but tell lies\u201d and should be monitored by the FCC, was grilled by Sean Hannity Tuesday during an exchange the aspiring congressman may want to forget.  \u201cYou tell lies, you distort the truth, you promote hate,\u201d...", "title": "Watch Dem Candidate Attempt to Explain Broken Obamacare Promises in Tough Sean Hannity Interview", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/26/sean-hannity-thoroughly-grills-dem-candidate-during-tense-battle-over-obamacare-you-sound-like-a-hypocrite/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Google-ChromeScreenSnapz006-620x347.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 347}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-02-26T00:28:46+00:00", "twitter-count": 405}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4f1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDid President Obama promise if you like your plan, you can keep your plan?\u201d Hannity asked.\n\u201cYou tell lies, you distort the truth, you promote hate,\u201d Dickinson told Hannity when asked to defend his position.\nAfter a moment of silence, Dickinson conceded: \u201cHe did.\u201d\u201cHave people gotten their plans cancelled?\u201d Hannity pressed.\nHannity pushed back, pointing out that seven million people have lost their plans so far.\nWatch the rest of the tough segment here:Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com(H/T: Mediaite)"}
