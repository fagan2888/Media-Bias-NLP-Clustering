A \u201clarge\u201d employer with 50 employees that did not provide insurance in compliance with the Affordable Care Act, would be subject to $2,000 per employee, with the first 30 employees exempt, for a total of $40,000, Aldridge said.\n\nThe NFIB is backing two measures that have introduced in Congress that would address the situation, he said.\n\nThe Mississippi Department of Insurance said in a prepared statement that if the small employer helps employees by paying their premiums, reimbursing medical expenses or raising salaries to compensate for policies bought by the individuals, the company is considered to be in violation of IRS Code Section 4980D.\n\nA statement from the IRS to the Mississippi Business Journal stated that \u201cthese employer payment plans are considered to be group health plans subject to the market reforms [under the ACA], including the prohibition on annual limits for essential health benefits and the requirement to provide certain preventive care without cost sharing.\u201d\n\nThe Mississippi Insurance Department said: \u201cThe rule appears nowhere in the Affordable Care Act but was developed by the Obama administration\u2019s regulation writers at the IRS.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rule punishes small businesses for providing the only health insurance support many can afford \u2013 a contribution to help employees pay premiums for their individual or family policies or to help finance direct payments for medical services,\u201d the department said.\n\nThe IRS issue comes at a time when the fate of the state-run insurance exchange for small businesses, called One, Mississippi, is uncertain, Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney said in an interview.\n\n\u201cOne, Mississippi has got to be sustainable,\u201d Chaney said. The potential problem is that Aetna is seeking to buy Humana, which is one of the two insurers in One, Mississippi, he said. \u201cIf they buy Humana, they may pull out of the state,\u201d leaving only United Healthcare in the pool. If that happens, there is a \u201cdistinct possibility\u201d that the state will not be able to find a replacement.\n\n\u201cI cannot see the state of Mississippi putting any money into\u201d the pool \u201cand, politically, I\u2019m not certain that the Legislature will let us put any money into it.\u201d The pool has been propped up by federal grants, Chaney said.\n\nState and federal regulators will meet this week in Chicago to talk with Aetna and Humana. While the state officials will have no official say, the federal regulators will hear their comments, Chaney said.\n\nPepper Crutcher, a Jackson lawyer with Balch & Bingham who specializes in ACA compliance, said that, while the IRS situation looks dire, \u201cmy guess is there will be a congressional fix\u201d and President Barack Obama will approve it.\n\nAldridge\u2019s take: \u201cSomething needs to be done quickly before our No. 1 job creators are left holding the bag and are put out of business.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Mississippi Business Journal", "description": "\u00bb Annual tax would be $36,500 per worker for noncompliance with Obamacare\r\nBy JACK WEATHERLY\u00a0\r\n\r\nEmp...", "title": "IRS drops a bomb on small employers", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://msbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/irs-logo-620x330.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-25T10:41:33-05:00", "url": "http://msbusiness.com/2015/08/irs-drops-a-bomb-on-small-employers/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mbjournal", "section": "MBJ FEATURE", "tag": "Ron Aldridge", "published_time": "2015-08-13T11:05:17-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-25T10:41:33-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u00bb Annual tax would be $36,500 per worker for noncompliance with Obamacare By JACK WEATHERLY\u00a0 Employers with fewer than 50 employees were promised a break by not having to provide group health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.
