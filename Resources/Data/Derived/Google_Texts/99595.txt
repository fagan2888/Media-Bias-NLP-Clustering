The City of Tulsa has settled a lawsuit over a building that was damaged by a city employee.

The lawsuit was filed by Dan Mordhorst, the owner of a building at 145 North Lewis Avenue. In the lawsuit, Mordhorst claimed a city employee using a backhoe hit the front of the building, causing the brick front of the building to collapse. No one was hurt.

The incident happened last October and the building, which is used as a bar, has been repaired. The owner told News On 6 the damage costs would have been much higher, but he repaired it with his own workers to save money.

The city settled the case, without admitting negligence, for $23,500. The money will come from property taxes collected inside the city limits.
