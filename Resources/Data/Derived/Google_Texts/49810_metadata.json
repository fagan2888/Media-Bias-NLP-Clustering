Corrine Brown, the ranking Democrat on the committee, who said she\u2019d never seen that sort of profane outburst in 23 years of serving on the committee.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what has happened to this Congress and what has happened to the members. Let me just say, we are all here to serve the veterans,\u201d she said, and encouraged members to keep perspective when asking questions related to the VA and not furthering their political agendas.\n\nRep. Tim Walz, Minnesota Democrat, said he had been encouraged by previous hearings where the VA presented positive plans for reform and change in the agency, but said that too many veterans had lost faith that the many systemic issues plaguing the department could be solved.\n\n\u201cI was so optimistic last week,\u201d he said. \u201cHow is this all unraveling?\u201d\n\nMr. Gibson insisted the VA is doing good work, and said it should not be overshadowed by things that go wrong from time to time in an agency with 350,000 employees.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge we\u2019ve got some things we\u2019ve got to do better, but routinely what happens is that all the good work that VA\u2019s doing, all the progress that VA\u2019s doing, winds up not showing up,\u201d Mr. Gibson told reporters after the hearing. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that the leadership that the VA\u2019s receiving today is making a result today. It\u2019s making a tangible result.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fed up with more than a year's criticism, the Veterans Affairs Department lashed out at Congress, the press and its own internal watchdog on Wednesday, saying calls to fire bad workers won't change things at the troubled department.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Fed up with more than a year\u2019s criticism, the Veterans Affairs Department lashed out at Congress, the press and its own internal watchdog on Wednesday, saying calls to fire bad workers won\u2019t change things at the troubled department.", "title": "Sloan Gibson lashes out during VA committee hearing", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/9/sloan-gibson-lashes-out-during-va-committee-hearin/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/25/4864873257466c1c7a0f6a706700894d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/25/4864873257466c1c7a0f6a706700894d.jpg", "description": "Fed up with more than a year's criticism, the Veterans Affairs Department lashed out at Congress, the press and its own internal watchdog on Wednesday, saying calls to fire bad workers won't change th", "card": "summary", "title": "Sloan Gibson lashes out during VA committee hearing"}, "Author": "Anjali Shastry", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sloan Gibson"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Miller blasted VA leadership for suggesting that the congressional committee had exaggerated VA\u2019s problems.\nIn one egregious example from the Phoenix VA, a whistleblower last year said dozens of veterans died while stuck on the secret waiting lists.\nSEE ALSO: Flake\u2019s \u2018Wastebook: The Farce Awakens\u2019 targets federal spending waste\u201cYou can\u2019t fire your way to excellence,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe acknowledge we\u2019ve got some things we\u2019ve got to do better, but routinely what happens is that all the good work that VA\u2019s doing, all the progress that VA\u2019s doing, winds up not showing up,\u201d Mr. Gibson told reporters after the hearing.\nThe VA demoted them but says it has no legal tools to recoup the money, and Mr. Gibson stood by his decision not to fire the two, saying he was resisting public pressure in order to do what was right."}
