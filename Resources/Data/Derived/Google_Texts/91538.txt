A Tampa man is dead after he lost control of his car early today, leading to a crash in which his car went airborne three times before striking a building in Mulberry, Polk deputies said.

About 1:40 a.m., Jeremiah Grady Simpson, 28, was driving a 2010 Volvo C30 south on State Road 37, north of State Road 60, according to the Polk County Sheriff’s Office.

As Simpson crossed S.R. 60, the Volvo drove into a concave portion of the road, went airborne and then bottomed out, leaving several gouge marks, the sheriff’s office said.

Simpson lost control and spun as the Volvo struck the curb on the west side of South Church Avenue then went onto the sidewalk and grass, according to the sheriff’s office. The car continued south, crossing railroad tracks and sliding across Phosphate Avenue.

Still sideways, the car hit the southern curb on Phosphate Avenue, breaking off part of the curb, before continuing south across the lawn of Master Containers Inc., 209 Phosphate Blvd., the sheriff’s office said.

The Volvo then struck a second set of railroad tracks and went airborne again, flying over Second Street S.W. and landing upright in a grass lot of a business at 307 S. Church Ave., the sheriff’s office said.

The car continued south as it slid sideways, then spun again after its tires dug into the ground and went airborne a third time before striking a building, the sheriff’s office said.

The car went into the building and landed upside down, according to the sheriff’s office. A tire and rim came off the car and struck another part of the wall, leaving a large hole. The hole in the building from the car was approximately 15 feet high and 25 feet wide.

Simpson died at the scene.

The road was closed for about eight hours as crews from TECO cut power to the building and CSX stopped railroad traffic and inspected the tracks, the sheriff’s office said.
