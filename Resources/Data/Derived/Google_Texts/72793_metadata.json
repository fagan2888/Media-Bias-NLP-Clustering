Her burning body was found outside her car, which also had been set ablaze, on a road in Courtland on Dec. 6, 2014. Both she and Tellis are from Courtland, in Panola County.\n\nDistrict 17 District Attorney John Champion tells The Commercial Appeal that Tellis is scheduled for trial in Monroe, Louisiana in May. If he's convicted, says Champion, it could be another three months before sentencing, with time needed after that for Mississippi paperwork to go through the governor's office.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Mississippi prosecutor says it could be late this year before the 27-year-old man accused of burning a 19-year-old woman to death is returned from Louisiana to face a capital murder charge.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Prosecutor-Says-Chambers-Court-Case-Might-be-Later-This-Year-371218081.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/600*657/jessica+chambers5.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A Mississippi prosecutor says it could be late this year before the 27-year-old man accused of burning a 19-year-old woman to death is returned from Louisiana to face a capital murder charge.", "title": "Prosecutor Says Chambers Court Case Might be Later This Year"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "A Mississippi prosecutor says it could be late this year before the 27-year-old man accused of burning a 19-year-old woman to death is returned from Louisiana to face a capital murder charge.", "title": "Prosecutor Says Chambers Court Case Might be Later This Year", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Prosecutor-Says-Chambers-Court-Case-Might-be-Later-This-Year-371218081.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Jessica+Chambers6.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Prosecutor Says Chambers Court Case Might be Later This Year", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Prosecutor Says Chambers Court Case, Might be Later This Year"}, "article_summary": "Quinton Verdell Tellis has been charged with capital murder of Jessica Chambers.\nJessica Chambers (Photo source: The Chambers family)A Mississippi prosecutor says it could be late this year before the 27-year-old man accused of burning a 19-year-old woman to death is returned from Louisiana to face a capital murder charge.\nDistrict 17 District Attorney John Champion tells The Commercial Appeal that Tellis is scheduled for trial in Monroe, Louisiana in May.\nHer burning body was found outside her car, which also had been set ablaze, on a road in Courtland on Dec. 6, 2014.\nIf he's convicted, says Champion, it could be another three months before sentencing, with time needed after that for Mississippi paperwork to go through the governor's office."}
