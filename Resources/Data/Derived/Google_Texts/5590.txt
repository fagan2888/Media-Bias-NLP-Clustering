GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson responded Sunday to his chief rival, Donald Trump, who on Saturday said Carson might have even less energy than another Trump target: Jeb Bush."You know, operating on people for 10, 12, sometimes greater than 20 hours at a time, making critical decisions after many hours of intense work, unexpected situations come up, Carson said on ABC's "This Week." "You don't have to be loud to be energetic.Carson's soft-spoken approach has gotten him to second place in what was until Friday a 17-candidate field. He believes it will carry him to the top once enough voters have had a chance to hear his message."It's a marathon; it's not a sprint," Carson told guest host Martha Raddatz. "That's why we have this elongated process, I think it will serve us well in the end."Carson sparked Trump's ire last week when he was asked to differentiate himself from the front-runner and brought up the issue of faith."In humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life," Carson quoted as one of his favorite Bible verses. "And that's a very big part of who I am. â€¦ I don't get that impression with him."Trump pounced, saying that no one's faith should be questioned, and Carson subsequently apologized. On Sunday, Carson said it was a media-created issue."We live in very perilous times," Carson said. "Our country is in grave danger and if we don't begin to change our direction and change our attitude, I think we may not survive into the future."Asked about the Syrian refugee crisis, Carson said President Barack Obama's plan to bring 10,000-plus refugees into the United States carries "extra danger." Critics have warned that terrorists could be infiltrating the legitimate refugees."We need to tighten it up and be very careful, because we cannot put our people at risk because we're trying to be politically correct, Carson said.
