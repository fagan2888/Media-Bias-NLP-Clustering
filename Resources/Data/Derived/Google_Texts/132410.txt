Farmers Insurance Group has laid off 50 workers at its Wilmington, Del.-based subsidiary, 21st Century Insurance.

According to a spokesman for Los Angeles-based Farmers, said the move is part of the company’s ongoing efforts to retire the 21st Century brand in every state with the exception of California and Hawaii.

The near-closing of the auto insurance brand will shrink 21st Century’s customer base, requiring fewer employees dedicated to that unit. Workers whose positions were eliminated will remain with the company until the end of July.

Most layoffs were in sales, customer service, clerical administrations and information technology.

It is not known how many 21st Century workers will remain in Wilmington after the layoffs are completed.
