Sarah Palin.\n\nHere\u2019s coverage of Obama\u2019s speech from the Rocky Mountain News:\n\nObama accepts nomination, rocks Mile High By Kevin Vaughan\n\nThe Rocky Mountain News Thursday night, on a date symbolic of both the worst and the best of recent life for African-Americans, a black man stood in a football stadium in Denver and made history, accepting the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination for president. Barack Obama\u2019s moment came exactly 53 years after two Mississippi men murdered a black teenager for whistling at a white girl, and exactly 45 years after Martin Luther King Jr. dared to dream of a world where people would \u201cnot be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.\u201d It came with two of King\u2019s children inside Invesco Field at Mile High, and with brown and black faces in every section of the stands.

It was also about pomp and politics and Obama\u2019s call for change.\n\nHere\u2019s coverage of the speech from The Denver Post:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Barack Obama,colorado history,DNC,Mile High Stadium,RNC,Sarah Palin", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Illinois Sen.
