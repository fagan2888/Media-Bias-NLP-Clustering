If elected, Edwards would be only the second Louisiana Democratic governor since Kathleen Blanco defeated Bobby Jindal in 2003 and only the third since Edwin Edwards (no relation) turned back David Duke in the infamous 1991 election.\n\nFormer U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu's 56 percent to 44 percent loss to Sen. Bill Cassidy in 2014 eliminated the last statewide-elected Democrat in Louisiana and helped fuel the conventional wisdom that U.S. Sen. David Vitter would easily defeat any Democrat. Victory would be assured by tying his opponent to an unpopular President Barack Obama and applying the \"liberal\" label. But now, even as Vitter employs that strategy, Edwards is between 12 and 20 points ahead in recent polls, and the pundits are recalculating their formulas.\n\nFor starters, it is the GOP candidate who enters the runoff wounded from a bruising primary while the Democrat appears fit and rested.\n\n\"Vitter and the other Republicans spent all their time attacking each other\" leading up to the Oct. 24 primary,\" said Bernie Pinsonat, a political consultant and pollster at Southern Media & Opinion Research in Baton Rouge. \"Why no one attacked (Edwards) was beyond me. This one will be in the textbooks for how you make the Democrat stronger in Louisiana than he ever should be.\"\n\nIn Landrieu's last race, she was attacked often and early, and entered the runoff burdened by a scandal over improperly paying for charter flights from her Senate office budget. Then, in the general election, she was attacked relentlessly over the airwaves. Politico reported that while there were about 100 TV ads run by outside groups supporting Landrieu, outside groups ran more than 6,000 ads against her.\n\nEdwards may be feeling pressure to respond to ads attacking him now, but he only had about a week under siege from the Republican Governors Association, which swooped in at the end of the primary after Vitter's poll numbers failed to improve. And even with those ads, it's not clear that Louisiana voters are buying the charge that a pro-life, pro-gun conservative Democrat would carry out the \"liberal policies\" of Obama, as Vitter's ads claim.\n\nThis raises the question of whether voters view sending someone to Baton Rouge differently than sending someone to Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Somebody forgot to send him the memo that Obama is going to be out of office next year,\" said Albert Samuels, a political science professor at Southern University. \"This is a race for governor and the governor has to deal with the problems of Louisiana. The job does not require you to go to Washington.\"\n\nDuring the Landrieu-Cassidy race, it was much easier to tie Landrieu to Obama, said Pearson Cross, a political science professor at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette.\n\n\"Mary (Landrieu) was a crucial -- you may count it as a deciding -- vote on the Affordable Care Act,\" which was Obama's signature legislative achievement, Cross said. \"So you could really point to the smoking gun. But John Bel Edwards, he's not a national politician.\"\n\nThat's not to say that Vitter won't find a way to package Edwards, Obama or other national Democrats in a way that will resonate with voters, Cross said. But Vitter's attack ad over Edwards' plan to reduce the prison population doesn't seem to have gained the legs to persuade voters.\n\n\"He's going with all guns on this and trying to find something that's going to work, Cross said. \"He's got nothing to lose ultimately. But is there an ad out there or an approach that's going to start to pay off?\"\n\nAnother change from past races that appears to be benefiting Edwards is a fractured Republican party in Louisiana. Vitter has a history of ruffling his colleague's -- implementing terms limits, attacking perks -- and he's running against \"politicians in Baton Rouge,\" a line that hasn't exactly been an olive branch to the Republican-dominated Legislature that will convene early next year.\n\nThe rupture became public Thursday (Nov. 5) when Republican Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne endorsed Edwards, an intraparty rebellion that hasn't happened since claims of voter fraud prompted three Democratic also-rans to back Republican Dave Treen for governor in 1979. Treen went on to win by fewer than 10,000 votes.\n\nVitter took a hit a week before the primary when a New Orleans blogger posted videos of a woman who had gone public in 2007 claiming that Vitter had paid her for prostitution services in the late 1990s. Her story was contradicted by what she told had reporters eight years earlier and what she told a judge in court filings in a separate case criminal case against her, but the posting created a negative buzz.\n\nAnd then a day before the primary a private investigator working for the Vitter campaign was accused of secretly recording a group of people at a coffee shop that included Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand, state Sen. Danny Martinny and prominent Democratic lawyer. Whether the act was illegal has not yet been decided, but it was another setback for the Vitter camp.\n\nSo, Edwards appears to have all the momentum on his side as early voting starts Saturday. Democratic strategist James Carville, who is holding a fundraiser for Edwards this weekend, said that Vitter's unexpectedly poor showing in the primary could be driving a lack of enthusiasm for his candidacy among his fellow partisans.\n\n\"Six months ago, people were scared to death of David Vitter,\" Carville said. \"Now, at 23 percent, the sheriffs aren't scared of him, the lieutenant governor isn't scared of him. You cannot help but be impressed by the resistance to Vitter.\"\n\nBut it's worth noting that there are still two weeks left before the final polls open, the political winds can shift suddenly. They did for Kathleen Blanco in 2003, when she began attacking her opponent, the Gov. Mike Foster appointee Jindal, in the final weeks of the race over his leadership of the Department of Health and Hospitals and the University of Louisiana System.\n\nSome polls had Blanco down as much as 10 points, Cross said, but she rode to a narrow victory in the end. The difference there, however, is that Louisiana Democrats, like Blanco in 2003 and Landrieu in 1996, had been able to rely on a \"cushion\" of liberal voters in New Orleans -- many of them African-Americans who historically vote overwhelmingly for Democrats -- that no longer exists the way it did before Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\"Post-Katrina, that cushion has been gone and then just the dynamics of the state more favorable to Republicans,\" Samuels said. But this time around, Edwards might be able to claim victory without the cushion based on the weakness of Jindal and a wounded Vitter, who is limping into the general election tinged by scandal and a fractured GOP base.\n\n\"In a sense, John Bel Edwards may be the beneficiary of the right set of circumstances,\" Samuels said. \"Just looking at this on its face, this should be an election in which Republicans should win. But given everything else, there were some unique factors this time that really give John Bel Edwards a better than 50 percent chance of being elected.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "David Vitter, John Bel Edwards, Louisiana, 2015 governor's race, david vitter, homepage, john bel edwards, news, politics", "title": "Can a Democrat be elected governor in Louisiana?
