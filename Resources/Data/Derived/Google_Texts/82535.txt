If there’s one thing Barack Obama seems to love without reservation, it’s…Barack Obama. And the devoted Democratic Party is more than happy to take every opportunity to spread the love among adoring social media sycophants.

On their official Twitter account, the Democrat Party is now tweeting to its 356,000 followers the call to action.
