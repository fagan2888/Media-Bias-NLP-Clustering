(John Leyba / THE DENVER POST)\n\nDENVER \u2014 Emmanuel Sanders broke open from here to Kansas City.\n\nJohn Elway was surprised but didn't miss the man he had targeted all along. When contract negotiations with another wide receiver, Brandon LaFell, hit a snag, the Broncos' general manager glanced toward Sanders, who most recently played for Pittsburgh.\n\nThey connected on a three-year, $15 million contract that became official Sunday. It pays out $6 million in 2014 and includes an additional $3 million in escalators. Sanders replaces Eric Decker as Denver's No. 2 receiver, slotting between Demaryius Thomas and Wes Welker.\n\n\"This is the team that I wanted to go to during free agency,\" Sanders said. \"Somehow, some way, it ended up happening.\"\n\nThe Broncos are nearing the end of their initial free-agent phase. Their four new additions \u2014 DeMarcus Ware ($13 million), Aqib Talib ($12 million), T.J. Ward ($7 million) and Sanders ($6 million) \u2014 account for $38 million, or 27 percent of the team's estimated $140 million cash payroll in 2014.\n\nIf the Broncos can secure former Washington Redskins center Will Montgomery, who visits Dove Valley today, their free-agent spending spree will have its bow.\n\nWhen the Broncos put together their list of free-agent wide receivers, Sanders was No. 1.\n\n\"He can play anywhere,\" Elway said. \"He can play inside, he can be outside. He's explosive. Great separation skills. He can do it all.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProblem was, as the free-agent market opened Tuesday, Sanders' starting point was \"Decker money\" \u2014 $8 million to $9 million per year. Decker was a starting wideout for Denver the previous three years, and his free-agent value exceeded what Denver placed on its \"No. 2\" pass-catching position.\n\nDecker went to free agency and received a five-year contract from the New York Jets at $7.25 million per year.\n\nThe Broncos first secured Ware, Ward and Talib for their defense, then turned to receivers, where Sanders was regrettably filed away as being too expensive. The Broncos began pursuing LaFell, a 6-foot-2, third-round draft pick of John Fox's Carolina Panthers in 2010. LaFell was also negotiating with the New England Patriots. At one point, the Broncos were close in reaching an agreement with LaFell, but as he deliberated, the team checked back with Sanders.\n\nThe Broncos were pleased to discover the market had reduced Sanders' price tag to $5 million a year.", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2014-03-16T23:02:16-0600", "modificationDate": "2014-03-16T23:02:23-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0316/20140316__17TCSBRO_TEST~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Mike Klis \n \n  The Denver Post", "description": "DENVER \u2014 Emmanuel Sanders broke open from here to Kansas City.\n\n\nJohn Elway was surprised but didn't miss the man he had targeted all along.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:25358016:view"}, "og": {"image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0316/20140316__17TCSBRO_TEST~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "DENVER \u2014 Emmanuel Sanders broke open from here to Kansas City.\n\n\nJohn Elway was surprised but didn't miss the man he had targeted all along.", "title": "WR Sanders joins Broncos"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "DENVER \u2014 Emmanuel Sanders broke open from here to Kansas City.\n\n\nJohn Elway was surprised but didn't miss the man he had targeted all along.", "title": "WR Sanders joins Broncos", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0316/20140316__17TCSBRO_TEST~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-16T23:02:16-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2024-03-16T22:58:57-0600", "sailthru.title": "WR Sanders joins Broncos", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Mike KlisThe", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0316/20140316__17TCSBRO_TEST~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-03-16T23:03:41-0600", "news_keywords": "Sports, Sports news, Longmont Colorado Sports news, Longmont Colorado news, Sports Longmont news, Sports Colorado news, US Sports news, world Sports news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb3a\"", "article_summary": "Ex-Steelers receiver gets $15 million contractWide receiver Emmanuel Sanders answers questions at Dove Valley on Sunday after joining the Broncos.\nWhen the Broncos put together their list of free-agent wide receivers, Sanders was No.\nWhen contract negotiations with another wide receiver, Brandon LaFell, hit a snag, the Broncos' general manager glanced toward Sanders, who most recently played for Pittsburgh.\nThe Broncos were pleased to discover the market had reduced Sanders' price tag to $5 million a year.\nAt one point, the Broncos were close in reaching an agreement with LaFell, but as he deliberated, the team checked back with Sanders."}
