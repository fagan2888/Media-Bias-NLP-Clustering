Two simultaneous, lightning-caused wildfires were sparked Thursday afternoon at Rocky Mountain National Park, according to park spokeswoman Kyle Patterson.

One fire was sparked on Eagle Cliff and the other on Beaver Mountain. Both blazes have been contained “due to available resources and immediate response by firefighters,” Patterson said.

“Vegetation conditions were dry enough to allow for a relatively rapid initial establishment of the lightning-caused fires, but wet enough to slow (their) spread,” Patterson said.

Patterson said having to battle two wildfires sparked by lightning at the same time is “unusual.”
