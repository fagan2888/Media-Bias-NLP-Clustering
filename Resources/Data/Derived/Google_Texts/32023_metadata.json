In the final weeks of the 2014 midterm campaigns, it seems like the electricity is once again flowing nicely. Candidates in opposing camps can agree on little, but they both know that telling horror stories about what your opponent might do to Social Security and Medicare is effective.\n\nJohn Dickerson John Dickerson is a Slate political columnist, the moderator of CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, and author of On Her Trail. Read his series on the presidency and on risk.\n\n\n\n\u201cKay Hagan cast a tie-breaking vote not only for the Obamacare law but to take $716 million from Medicare to spend on Obamacare,\u201d said Rep. Paul Ryan on Wednesday at North Carolina\u2019s Wingate University, as he campaigned for Republican Senate candidate Thom Tillis. Ryan reminded voters that his mother is on Medicare and that Hagan had voted against the program. (The Affordable Care Act reduced the rate of Medicare growth, which Republicans have traditionally not considered a cut, and the reductions were aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. Fact-checkers say that this does not constitute a threat to the Medicare system, as Ryan claims.)\n\nRyan regularly makes it seem as though sensible people could agree on budget reforms if they only reasoned together. He has criticized Democrats, saying that when it comes to entitlement reform, their tactic is \u201cto wait for Republicans to propose solutions, then attack them.\u201d But that\u2019s a pretty good summation of what he\u2019s doing here. No one is going to chance putting forward new reforms if Ryan is going to hit the campaign trail and accuse him or her of \u201craiding, robbing, and cutting Medicare,\u201d as he did Hagan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nCampaigning on threats to Medicare and Social Security is a familiar play, but it takes on special meaning when Ryan does it: It\u2019s a testament to just how irresistible it is. After all, Ryan was supposed to be the politician who had touched the third rail of entitlement reform and lived. He proposed changes in Medicare before the last several elections and continues to be re-elected in a district that is not heavily tilted toward Republicans. Democrats attacked Republicans for supporting his plan, but most of these GOP members were also re-elected. But by leveling this blunt attack on Hagan\u2014which obliterates all nuance\u2014Ryan is testifying that the issue is more powerful than any policy details that might explain why a particular reform doesn\u2019t constitute a dire threat to the system.\n\nRepublicans are attacking Democrats for policies that many conservatives support.\n\nBefore watching Ryan, I had been in Louisiana to cover Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu\u2019s race against Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy. For two days Landrieu lambasted Cassidy\u2019s plans for Social Security and Medicare. \u201cI want you to talk to the seniors, \u2019cause they\u2019re going to vote strong in this election\u2014they always do\u2014I want you to tell them my opponent voted to end the Medicare program as we know it,\u201d she said, addressing a group of local female leaders in Baton Rouge. Her attack is actually rooted in Cassidy\u2019s support for the Republican Study Committee budget, which raises the retirement age for Social Security. Ryan and Cassidy also believe in giving Medicare enrollees a fixed amount of money that can be used to buy insurance in the private market.\n\nLandrieu said she understood the entitlement programs need fixing, but not if it was going to fund tax breaks for millionaires at the expense of working people. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been changing hotel beds since you were 20 years old and you\u2019re making $11 to $12 an hour, I think changing beds for 50 years is enough, don\u2019t you? And if you\u2019re building roads in Louisiana in the hot sun, it can be 110 degrees, and when you are driving those tractors and breathing those fumes, I think that 50 years of paving roads is enough.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s old-time religion in Democratic campaigns, but some Republican campaigns are now sounding a lot like Landrieu. As Lori Montgomery of the Washington Post notes, Republicans are attacking Democrats for Social Security reforms that much of their party supports. For example, Republicans are attacking Georgia Democratic Rep. John Barrow for supporting Ryan\u2019s proposal of raising the age for receiving Social Security. The conservative group Crossroads GPS is running ads attacking Democrats on the same issue. In North Carolina an ad says that Hagan is a \u201cbig believer\u201d in a controversial plan that \u201craises the retirement age.\u201d (The ad is referring to the Simpson-Bowles budget reform plan.) Karl Rove founded Crossroads GPS; you may remember Rove once tried to help President Bush reform the Social Security system but failed because members in Congress worried that they would be attacked in just the way members are being attacked now. Bush supported the idea of raising the retirement age, too.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Why October\u2019s campaign attacks explain next year\u2019s political dysfunction.", "fb-share": "Why October\u2019s Campaign Attacks Explain Next Year\u2019s Political Dysfunction", "sailthru.author": "John Dickerson", "description": "WINGATE, North Carolina\u2014For a short time, there was a feeling, shared by Republicans and Democrats, that Medicare and Social Security were losing their ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "WINGATE, North Carolina\u2014For a short time, there was a feeling, shared by Republicans and Democrats, that Medicare and Social Security were losing their ...", "title": "Why October\u2019s Campaign Attacks Explain Next Year\u2019s Political Dysfunction", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/medicare_and_social_security_reform_is_toxic_in_midterm_elections_republicans.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/141023_POL_PaulRyanSeason.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WINGATE, North Carolina\u2014For a short time, there was a feeling, shared by Republicans and Democrats, that Medicare and Social Security were losing their ...", "title": "Why October\u2019s Campaign Attacks Explain Next Year\u2019s Political Dysfunction", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/medicare_and_social_security_reform_is_toxic_in_midterm_elections_republicans.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/141023_POL_PaulRyanSeason.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@jdickerson", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-24T20:39:34Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Why October\u2019s Campaign Attacks Explain Next Year\u2019s Political Dysfunction", "sailthru.headline": "Bad Habits", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Why October\\u2019s Campaign Attacks Explain Next Year\\u2019s Political Dysfunction\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/medicare_and_social_security_reform_is_toxic_in_midterm_elections_republicans.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/141023_POL_PaulRyanSeason.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100141024019\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2014-10-24T20:39:34Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"John Dickerson\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"politics\",\n    \"republicans\",\n    \"democrats\",\n    \"2014 elections\",\n    \"medicare\",\n    \"social security\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Why October\u2019s campaign attacks explain next year\u2019s political dysfunction:", "keywords": "Paul Ryan, Paul Ryan Kay Hagan, Paul Ryan North Carolina, Paul Ryan Social Security, Paul Ryan retirement age, Paul Ryan Thom Tillis, Paul Ryan campaigns for Thom Tillis, Paul Ryan Bill Cassidy, Mary Landrieu, Mary Landrieu social security, Mary Landrieu medicare, Mary Landrieu Bill Cassidy", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "Paul Ryan, Paul Ryan Kay Hagan, Paul Ryan North Carolina, Paul Ryan Social Security, Paul Ryan retirement age, Paul Ryan Thom Tillis, Paul Ryan campaigns for Thom Tillis, Paul Ryan Bill Cassidy, Mary Landrieu, Mary Landrieu social security, Mary Landrieu medicare, Mary Landrieu Bill Cassidy", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/johnfdickerson"}, "sailthru.description": "WINGATE, North Carolina\u2014For a short time, there was a feeling, shared by Republicans and Democrats, that Medicare and Social Security were losing their ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/141023_POL_PaulRyanSeason.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbae2\"", "article_summary": "As Lori Montgomery of the Washington Post notes, Republicans are attacking Democrats for Social Security reforms that much of their party supports.\nFor two days Landrieu lambasted Cassidy\u2019s plans for Social Security and Medicare.\nCandidates in opposing camps can agree on little, but they both know that telling horror stories about what your opponent might do to Social Security and Medicare is effective.\nHer attack is actually rooted in Cassidy\u2019s support for the Republican Study Committee budget, which raises the retirement age for Social Security.\nFor example, Republicans are attacking Georgia Democratic Rep.
