He has the chance to add another two trophies to the 23 he has already won, with Barcelona set to play the Copa del Rey and Champions League finals.\n\n\u201cI feel that I need to leave,\u201d Xavi said at Barcelona\u2019s training ground. \u201cI am 35 and I have spent 17 seasons here. I think it is the moment to leave.\u201d\n\nBarcelona hosts Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final on May 30 before facing Juventus in the Champions League final on June 6 in Berlin.\n\n\u201cThe only thing left is to win the last two finals,\u201d Xavi said. \u201cThis finale is special for me, spectacular. The script couldn\u2019t be better.\u201d\n\nXavi said he made the decision to leave a \u201cfew months ago\u201d - despite the club offering to extend his contact - because he had lost his place in Barcelona\u2019s starting lineup.\n\n\u201cNow I am not playing as many minutes as I would like, I am not a starter like before. It is time,\u201d Xavi said. \u201cI still feel like I can play.\u201d\n\nHe said he will join Al-Sadd on a two-year contract with an option for a third year, as well as start a coaching job along with his two brothers and sister at Qatar\u2019s Aspire Academy. But he linked his future to a return to the Catalan club he joined as a child.\n\n\u201cMy first goal is to return to this house,\u201d Xavi said. \u201cMy principle goal is to return as coach, a sporting director, we will see.\u201d\n\nAs great as Lionel Messi is, Barcelona would never have become the team that has risen and stayed at the top of the sport for the past decade without Xavi.\n\nKnown for his vision, pinpoint passing and uncanny ability to retain possession under pressure, Xavi has been the midfield pillar for Barcelona since enrolling in its youth academy at 11 and debuting under coach Louis van Gaal in 1998.\n\nXavi helped Barcelona win its second European Cup under coach Frank Rijkaard in 2006 before fully flourishing under Pep Guardiola.\n\nHe and midfield partner Andres Iniesta became the keys to Barcelona\u2019s intricate passing attack spearheaded by Messi and forged one of the best teams to have played the game, winning 14 of a possible 19 titles from 2008-12, including two more Champions League titles with Guardiola in charge.\n\nXavi retired from international competition last year following the 2014 World Cup, after he had been a key component for Spain in winning the 2010 World Cup and 2008 and 2012 European Championships.\n\nHe also finished third in the voting for the 2009, 2010 and 2011 Ballon d\u2019Or voting.\n\nLast year, Xavi contemplated leaving Barcelona after a disappointing 2013-14 campaign under Gerard Martino. New coach Luis Enrique persuaded him to stay, and even though he lost his starting job to Ivan Rakitic, Xavi often came off the bench to give Barcelona the extra control it needed.\n\n\u201cI could not have had a better career,\u201d Xavi said. \u201cI am very happy with how it went, with how I performed. I don\u2019t regret anything.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Xavi Hernandez is leaving Barcelona after 17 trophy-laden seasons in which he set club records for appearances and titles won.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Xavi Hernandez is leaving Barcelona after 17 trophy-laden seasons in which he set club records for appearances and titles won.", "title": "Xavi to leave Barcelona after 17 trophy-filled seasons", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/21/xavi-to-leave-barcelona-after-17-trophy-filled-sea/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/21/25addccd1071c316760f6a706700445e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/21/25addccd1071c316760f6a706700445e.jpg", "description": "Xavi Hernandez is leaving Barcelona after 17 trophy-laden seasons in which he set club records for appearances and titles won.", "card": "summary", "title": "Xavi to leave Barcelona after 17 trophy-filled seasons"}, "Author": "JOSEPH WILSON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5646\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI feel that I need to leave,\u201d Xavi said at Barcelona\u2019s training ground.\nSANT JOAN DESPI, Spain (AP) - Xavi Hernandez is leaving Barcelona after 17 trophy-laden seasons in which he set club records for appearances and titles won.\nXavi helped Barcelona win its second European Cup under coach Frank Rijkaard in 2006 before fully flourishing under Pep Guardiola.\nHe has the chance to add another two trophies to the 23 he has already won, with Barcelona set to play the Copa del Rey and Champions League finals.\nLast year, Xavi contemplated leaving Barcelona after a disappointing 2013-14 campaign under Gerard Martino."}
