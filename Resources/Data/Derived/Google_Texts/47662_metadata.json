Got a sugar daddy/momma to pay for those medical bills? Just wondering #BeatTheBuzzer \u2014 Amy Lutz (@amylutz4) March 31, 2014\n\nShorter @OFA_MO: Let the government be your sugar daddy! #GetCovered \u2014 Amy Lutz (@amylutz4) March 31, 2014\n\nTwitter user Caleb Herod wondered just how far Uncle Sugar would be willing to take it:\n\nCan I get one to help me meet the huge Ocare deductibles? @OFA_MO: Not covered? Got a sugar daddy/momma to pay for those medical bills? \u2014 Caleb Herod (@CJHerod) April 1, 2014\n\nAnd what was Lutz\u2019s reaction upon seeing the OFA-Missouri tweet? She shared that, along with her assessment of the organization:\n\n@FakeSamRosado I started crying from laughing so hard \u2014 Amy Lutz (@amylutz4) March 31, 2014\n\nOh @OFA_MO, never change. \u2014 Amy Lutz (@amylutz4) March 31, 2014\n\nSo where did Organizing for Action come up with the idea? Perhaps from SeekingArrangement.com, a tasteless dating website that promotes what it calls \u201cThe sugar daddy insurance plan.\u201d According to the site:\n\nMost Americans believe the only options for getting healthcare and avoiding \u201cObama-drama\u201d are through your employer or your parents. Well, they thought wrong! If you\u2019re a young and beautiful woman (or man), SeekingArrangement.com has got you covered. The average twenty-something woman not covered on her parents\u2019 insurance will likely see an increase to her monthly premium. But with a Sugar Daddy footing the bill, $249/month will seem like no big deal\u2013not to mention the spare cash. Don\u2019t worry about penalties or added costs due to the Affordable Care Act. The average Sugar Baby on SeekingArrangement.com receives $3000 month from her Sugar Daddy. Don\u2019t get screwed by Obamacare, find a Sugar Daddy today!\n\nThen again, maybe discovery of the site is what led them to pull the tweet. But as Organizing for Action discovered Monday, nothing posted on the Internet can be truly expunged. Like diamonds, the World Wide Web is forever.\n\nRead more at Twitchy, then check out \u201cWilliam Shatner\u2019s unrecognizable new look calls for \u2018MOM\u2019 tattoo.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Desperate times call for desperate measures, and Monday being the final official day in which to get covered under the Affordable Care Act through its glitch-ridden web site certainly qualified as a desperate time.
