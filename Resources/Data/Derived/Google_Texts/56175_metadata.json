We\u2019ve had one for years and it looks like we\u2019re going to have one for four more.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing new. It\u2019s the norm. It\u2019s how Washington works.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating for those of us who want a smaller, weaker, cheaper federal government. But divided government doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that nothing a conservative wants ever gets done in D.C.\n\nMy father had to deal with a Congress controlled by Democrats. But he still was able to get enough things done to be considered the greatest president of our lifetime.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the conservatives who support Trump to grow up.\n\nNo party ever gets everything it wants. No voter will, either, especially from Trump.\n\nHe promises to kick out 11 millions illegal immigrants.\n\nHe promises to build the Great Wall of Trump at the border and make Mexico pay for it.\n\nHe promises he\u2019ll temporarily keep Muslims out of America.\n\nHe promises he\u2019ll put a 35 percent tariff on Fords imported from Mexico, repeal Obamacare, rebuild the military, defeat Isis, make better trade bills and make America great again.\n\nSure he will.\n\nIn the era of divided government, unless he magically makes the House and Senate disappear, Trump\u2019s vague promises aren\u2019t worth the hot air they were written on.\n\nMy question to the angry Republican voters who support Trump is this \u2014 How are you going to feel when The Donald is not able to follow through on his promises?\n\nIt\u2019s inevitable, even if he beats Hillary. What will you do when your Republican hero goes to D.C. and fails to deliver? Take to the streets?\n\nElecting a president named Trump or a qualified candidate like John Kasich this fall won\u2019t be enough to get things done in D.C. if the GOP doesn\u2019t increase its hold on the Senate.\n\nNo matter who he is, a Republican in the White House is going to need 60 votes in the Senate or everything important he proposes to pass or repeal will be filibustered to death.\n\nAll remaining Republican primary voters \u2014 especially conservative ones who excuse Trump\u2019s wide liberal streak or are too blinded by his celebrity bluster to see it \u2014 need to ask themselves something important before it\u2019s too late.\n\nDo you know in your heart that the nominee you\u2019ve picked \u2014 even if he wins \u2014 has a chance of changing anything in D.C.? Or are you just hoping?\n\nHoping for change isn\u2019t going to work. Ask Obama. If you really want to start getting things done in Washington, you can\u2019t just be angry, you need to be realistic.\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nCopyright \u00a92016 Michael Reagan.
