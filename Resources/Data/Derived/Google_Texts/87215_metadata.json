What happened after that is unclear.\n\nSandy Smith says losing a child is a hard pill for any parent to swallow.\n\n\u201cWe did have 18 Thanksgivings together. When we all sit down and eat, we\u2019ll just say our prayers and be thankful for what we did have with him,\u201d said Sandy.\n\nPolice began investigating Stephen\u2019s death as a hit and run \u2013 they thought he may have been walking home when he was struck by a vehicle. Sandy says that story just doesn\u2019t add up.\n\n\u201cHe called his sister one night he ran out of gas and he hid in the woods and would not come out until he was sure it was her. We know for a fact it was not a hit and run. Stephen would not have been in the roadway,\u201d said Sandy.\n\nShe added the autopsy results don\u2019t match the story either.\n\n\u201cThe only damage to his body was his head. The right side of his head. From his right eye socket to the back of his head and his right shoulder was dislocated. There was no other marks on his body and he had his shoes and everything on,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd right after he died, she did a little investigating herself.\n\n\u201cNo car parts. There was no blood. I walked from where his car was, all the way to where his body was and found nothing at all,\u201d said Sandy.\n\nWhether it was foul play or a hit and run, Sandy wants the person who\u2019s responsible for her son\u2019s death to know something.\n\n\u201cI hope they enjoy their day because we\u2019re going to enjoy ours. I just want to say I forgive you. I don\u2019t hate you. I just want answers,\u201d she said.\n\nThe South Carolina Highway Patrol and the Hampton County Sheriff\u2019s Office are still investigating Smith\u2019s death. If you have any information about the incident, call CrimeStoppers.\n\nCopyright 2015 WTOC.
