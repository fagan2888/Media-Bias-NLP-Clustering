Second of all, I think it would be very divisive.\u201d\n\nCoates, to say the least, is not satisfied by Sanders\u2019 argument that reparations\u2019 political odds are too long, calling it \u201ca correct observation which could just as well apply to much of the Vermont senator\u2019s own platform.\u201d\n\nCoates continues:\n\n\u201cSanders is a lot of things, many of them good. But he is not the candidate of moderation and unification, so much as the candidate of partisanship and radicalism. [\u2026]Sanders should be directly confronted and asked why his political imagination is so active against plutocracy, but so limited against white supremacy.\u201d\n\nThe moral case for reparations is clear: Black people have been robbed for centuries and amends must be made.\n\nThe United States has long had a set of policies dedicated to bestowing economic advantage on white people and denying wealth and security to black people, a systematic plunder much more recent than slavery, as Coates and historians like Tom Sugrue and Ira Katznelson (the author of \u201cWhen Affirmative Action Was White\u201d) make clear.\n\nNew Deal housing and labor policies systematically excluded black people, who as a matter of policy were denied homes in government-subsidized white suburbs and isolated in segregated cities. Indeed, the political success of these \u201cprogressive\u201d policies was made possible precisely because of their racism, which was key to winning the support of Southern Democrats. Black people were thus denied a key wealth-building asset and are to this day relegated in large numbers to separate and unequal public school systems\u2014a system maintained by current policies like exclusionary zoning that keep poor people out of affluent communities.\n\n\u201cWe cannot deny that African Americans suffer in this country disproportionately in all areas, whether it\u2019s economic, social, political, physical, because of white supremacy,\u201d says former Ohio state Senator Nina Turner, one of Sanders\u2019 most high-profile black supporters. \u201cThat is in the DNA of this country and we have never fully addressed it.\u201d\n\nTurner, however, sees economic justice and racial justice programs as complimentary. The systematic oppression suffered by black people, as Coates documented in his article \u201cThe Case for Reparations,\u201d was in significant part effectuated through economic marginalization and dispossession.\n\nTurner points to Sanders\u2019 support for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which she says would \u201chelp the black family.\u201d She says that Sanders has consistently spoken, including to white people, about the need to \u201ceradicate institutional racism. That statement alone, to a majority white audience, says a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t call it reparations,\u201d says Turner, but he \u201ctalks about institutional racism where he talks about how African-Americans suffer disproportionately.\u201d\n\nJust as economic marginalization was a key tool for maintaining white supremacy, economic justice programs focused on uplifting the poor would have a disproportionately positive effect on black people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sanders' economic platform isn't a cure-all, but it would represent a major step forward for racial justice", "title": "Ta-Nehisi Coates is right about white supremacy \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean that Bernie Sanders is wrong", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sanders' economic platform isn't a cure-all, but it would represent a major step forward for racial justice", "title": "Ta-Nehisi Coates is right about white supremacy \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean that Bernie Sanders is wrong", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/21/ta_nehisi_coates_is_right_about_white_supremacy_but_that_doesnt_mean_that_bernie_sanders_is_wrong/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/sanders_coates2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sanders' economic platform isn't a cure-all, but it would represent a major step forward for racial justice", "title": "Ta-Nehisi Coates is right about white supremacy \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean that Bernie Sanders is wrong", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/sanders_coates2.jpg", "creator": "@danieldenvir", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel Denvir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Bernie Sanders, economic justice, Elections 2016, racial justice, reparations, Ta-Nehisi Coates, The Democratic Primary, White Supremacy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: aol_on, Bernie Sanders, economic justice, Elections 2016, racial justice, reparations, Ta-Nehisi Coates, The Democratic Primary, White Supremacy, News, Politics NewsOn Tuesday, Ta-Nehisi Coates took Bernie Sanders to task in a widely discussed essay at The Atlantic for declining to support reparations for black Americans.\n\u201cThat is in the DNA of this country and we have never fully addressed it.\u201dTurner, however, sees economic justice and racial justice programs as complimentary.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Sanders recently said, when asked point blank if he would support the cause.\nTurner points to Sanders\u2019 support for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which she says would \u201chelp the black family.\u201d She says that Sanders has consistently spoken, including to white people, about the need to \u201ceradicate institutional racism.\nThe systematic oppression suffered by black people, as Coates documented in his article \u201cThe Case for Reparations,\u201d was in significant part effectuated through economic marginalization and dispossession."}
