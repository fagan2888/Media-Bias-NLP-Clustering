The United States Trade Representative (USTR) — responding to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request — is finally revealing the chapter titles of the pending Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, confirming there is a chapter relating to immigration titled, “Temporary Entry for Business Persons.”

Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) warned about the potential of U.S. immigration being included in the Trans Pacific Partnership, but House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan and the White House previously and continuously denied any immigration clause existed within the trade deal throughout their push for President Obama’s fast-track trade authority obtained through Congress’s passage of the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) – a fact now revealed to be false.

Breitbart News previously reported, via documents from WikiLeaks, that there was an entire chapter – roughly ten pages – dedicated to foreign worker visas. Experts reviewed the documents and told Breitbart News that as currently drafted, that chapter within the trade deal could change current U.S. immigration law relating to foreign worker visas.

According to TechDirt.com, Knowledge Ecology International (KEI) issued a FOIA request into the USTR in June to obtain the chapter titles of the trade deal, which has been drafted and negotiated entirely in secret – where only members of Congress are able to read the draft in a secured room on Capitol Hill. Not even the names of the members of Congress who actually read the deal can be revealed to the public or the press.

USTR fulfilled the FOIA request September 10th, according to TechDirt.com, which has published the chapter titles.
