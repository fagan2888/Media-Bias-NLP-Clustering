Ben Carson had a whopper of a past week on the campaign trail, when in the span of a few days he let out at least five wildly offensive statements following a deadly school shooting rampage, including even go so far as to seemingly blame the victims for failing to subdue the gunman, before he eventually revealed his own past encounter with a gunman at a “Popeye’s organization” during which he redirected the assailant to the cashier.

It was quite a doozy of a week for Carson and now he is chalking up all the media attention and controversy his own statements have generated to the tired right-wing complaint of a librul media conspiracy.

“They’re actually playing right into the narrative that I have predicted for them,” Carson told Breitbart.com. The ultraconservative right-wing blog apparently now features its own Sunday news program titled, “Breitbart News Sunday,” hosted by Matt Boyle.

“They can’t stand the thought of a black person who is a conservative, who hasn’t had to make it on their handout and be at their beck and call and doing the things that they want them to do,” Carson said of the media. “It just infuriates them.”

Of course, Carson’s statement won’t be construed as pulling that oh-so-popular “race card” by his conservative supporters but just as a logical conclusion to their ongoing narrative of mainstream media victimization. Carson continued:

So none of that surprises me. In fact, because I fly in the face of the secular, progressive ideology, I expect them to continue to attack me constantly. The only thing that they don’t seem to be bright enough to realize that the more they attack me, the stronger I get. People expect them to do that.
