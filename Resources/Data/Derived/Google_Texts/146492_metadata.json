Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), chairman of the Financial Services Committee, which oversees payday lenders, led congressional recipients by collecting $210,500 from the industry.\n\nPayday lending has been the subject of controversy, as lawmakers and regulators grapple with how to deal with the industry.\n\nCritics say the short-term loans target cash-strapped consumers and charge them exorbitant fees if they can't repay, dragging them into endless cycles of debt.\n\nMany Democrats and consumer advocates complain that payday lenders prey on desperate borrowers, but Republicans say they provide low-income people with access to much-needed cash they otherwise would not qualify for at a traditional bank.\n\nAccording to the report, payday and other types of predatory lending companies spent more than $15 million trying to influence lawmakers during the 2013-14 election cycle, including $11 million in lobbying and $4 million in campaign contributions.\n\nThe biggest spenders included the Online Lenders Alliance ($2.1 million), Cash America International ($1.8 million), Community Financial Services Association ($1.7 million), American Financial Services Association ($1.3 million) and JLL Partners ($1 million).\n\nThese included not only payday lenders, but also other types of lenders that the report considered \"predatory.\"\n\nRepublicans were the biggest recipients of campaign contributions from payday lenders.\n\nRounding out the top 10 congressional recipients, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) received $105,300; Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) received $95,600; Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) received $85,757; Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) received $80,700; Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) received $76,630; Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-Mo.) received $75,350; Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) received $62,800; and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) received $57,870.\n\nThe report noted that some of the donations mentioned above may have been given to independent political committees supporting these candidates, rather than directly to the candidates' campaigns.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Jeb Hensarling, whose committee oversees payday lenders, received $210,500 from the industry.", "description": "Jeb Hensarling, whose committee oversees payday lenders, received $210,500 from the industry.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Tim Devaney", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Jeb Hensarling, whose committee oversees payday lenders, received $210,500 from the industry.", "title": "Payday lenders gave $15M to GOP campaigns in 2014 races: report", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/lobbying/247072-payday-lenders-funnel-millions-to-gop-campaigns-report-finds", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/hensarlingjeb_062514gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-07T16:53:15-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-07T16:53-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/lobbying/247072-payday-lenders-funnel-millions-to-gop-campaigns-report-finds", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-07T13:50-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Tim Devaney", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Payday loan, Personal finance,Jeb Hensarling,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-07T13:50:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-07T16:53:15-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/lobbying/247072-payday-lenders-funnel-millions-to-gop-campaigns-report-finds", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Jeb Hensarling, whose committee oversees payday lenders, received $210,500 from the industry.", "card": "summary", "title": "Payday lenders gave $15M to GOP campaigns in 2014 races: report"}, "dcterms.title": "Payday lenders gave $15M to GOP campaigns in 2014 races: report"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd794\"", "article_summary": "These included not only payday lenders, but also other types of lenders that the report considered \"predatory.\"\nreceived $95,600; Rep.
