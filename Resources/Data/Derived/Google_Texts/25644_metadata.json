And it\u2019s tempting to blow the windfall. But hold tight: There are smarter ways to use your mad money than putting a down payment on a Harley or jetting to Aruba for the weekend, and they will put you a step closer to financial security.\n\nLast year the IRS issued more than 77 million tax refunds averaging about $2,800, the agency said. That\u2019s not pocket change. For many people, that\u2019s bigger than a paycheck. So think before you splurge.\n\n\n\n\u201cHave a plan for the funds before they arrive and implement the plan as soon as you receive your check,\u201d says Michael Busch, president of Vogel Financial Advisors in Dallas. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to let the money sit in your checking account\u2014it might get spent.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s are some do\u2019s and don\u2019ts from financial experts.\n\n1. Fund your golden years. Use the refund to beef up your IRA or Roth IRA, says James Guarino, tax partner at Moody, Famiglietti & Andronico in Wakefield, Massachusetts. This only works as long as you have enough earned income for the year to meet contribution requirements.\n\nRelated: 10 Important Tax Dates for 2016\n\nOr consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k), says Busch. You can\u2019t deposit the refund directly into the 401(k), but you can increase the amount that is taken from your paycheck for the rest of the year. The refund will offset your reduced take-home pay. It\u2019s a double win, too. \u201cNot only will you get the refund into your 401(k) account this way, but you will also lower your tax bill because the increased 401(k) salary deferrals will reduce your taxable wages,\u201d Busch says.\n\n2. Put a dent in your debt. Eliminate that credit card balance once and for all with your tax refund. If you don\u2019t have enough money to cover all of your outstanding balances, start with the one that has the highest interest rate and move down the rate ladder, says Chris Hardy, CEO at Paramount Investment Advisors in Suwanee, Georgia. In certain cases, interest you pay on student loan debt can be deducted from your taxable income (for the following year) up to $2,500, Hardy notes.\n\n3. Save for a rainy day. If you don\u2019t have an emergency fund or have a very small one, use the tax refund to increase your peace of mind. The rule of thumb is to be able to cover at least three months to six months of expenses. Keep it in a savings account or other account that can be accessed quickly.\n\n\u201cYou never know when you need cash and since you have a nice inflow, now is a good place to start,\u201d says Neil Waxman, managing director Capital Advisors in Shaker Heights, Ohio.\n\nRelated: Filing Alert: How Obamacare Affects Your 2015 Taxes\n\n4. Pay down your mortgage. Use your refund to make an extra principal payment on your mortgage, Busch recommends. \u201cA $1,000 extra principal payment at the beginning of a 30-year, $100,000 mortgage at 6 percent will save you nearly $5,000,\u201d he says. \u201cIf your interest rate is higher, the savings will be even greater.\u201d\n\n5. Fund a child\u2019s education. A tax refund is a great opportunity to start or increase your child\u2019s or grandchild\u2019s college savings fund, says Busch. You can use the refund to open a Coverdell IRA or a 529 college savings plan. If used for education expenses, the earnings on these funds grow tax-free.\n\n\u201cAnd the return on this kind of investment\u2014a college education for your children\u2014can\u2019t be measured,\u201d says Busch. \u201cIt\u2019s priceless.\u201d\n\n6. Give it away. Pass along your good fortune by donating your tax refund to your favorite charity. This is also a smart tax move, because you get an extra income tax deduction for the following year.\n\n7. Invest it. Make that tax refund work hard for you by investing the money in a non-retirement brokerage account. Then, watch that tax refund grow over time, increasing your overall net worth. \u201cIf you put away $2,700 a year for 10 years at a modest 5 percent return, you will have over $32,416,\u201d says Vickie Adams, a certified financial planner in San Pedro, California.\n\nRelated: The 8 Most Common Tax Mistakes That Can Cost You Hundreds\n\n8. Buy something. Even financial planners think its O.K. to indulge in guilty pleasures every now and again. \u201cI've never been one to tell a client what they shouldn't do with their money,\u201d says Taylor Schulte, president of Define Financial in San Diego. \u201cIt's important to maintain balance in their lives, and if they think that making a material purchase or taking a family vacation is what would be best, I can respect that.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a good way to figure out how to spend it smartly, according to Waxman. Write down all the things you want to save for and prioritize them by importance. These can be short term, like buying new clothes or furniture; medium term, such as a big vacation or down payment on a house; or long term, like retirement or college savings. \u201cSave or spend according to that list, but try and at least fund all of them,\u201d Waxman says.\n\nNiv Persaud, managing director of Transition Planning and Guidance in Atlanta, recommends doing a little of everything above. \u201cFollow the philosophy spend-save-share,\u201d she says. For example, take 10 percent\u2014that\u2019s $280 of the average refund\u2014and spend it on something frivolous. Save 80 percent or put that money toward a financial goal such as buying a new home, preparing for retirement or college or paying down debt. Give the remaining 10 percent to your favorite charity.\n\nBut don\u2019t\u2026\n\nExperts also offered some of the ways you shouldn\u2019t use your tax refund. Don\u2019t spend indiscriminately without a plan, says Waxman. \u201cConsumption isn\u2019t bad as long as it\u2019s measured and done after thinking about the alternatives,\u201d he says. He also says to avoid investing in your buddy\u2019s stock tip.\n\nDon\u2019t purchase high-cost mutual funds or expensive insurance products, says Hardy.\n\n\u201cDo not spend it without having agreement in your family,\u201d says Angela Giboney, owner of AFG Financial in Mill Creek, Washington. \u201cDo not use it as a down payment on a car.\u201d\n\nLast, don\u2019t get a refund next year, says Bryan Lee, founder of Strategic Financial Planning in Plano, Texas. \u201cRather than giving Uncle Sam an interest-free loan throughout the year,\u201d he says, \u201cthey should change their withholding and use that money to invest throughout the year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Getting a tax refund can feel like winning a small lottery.", "title": "The Best and Worst Ways to Spend Your Tax Refund", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/16/Best-and-Worst-Ways-Spend-Your-Tax-Refund", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05022010_uncle_sam_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/16/Best-and-Worst-Ways-Spend-Your-Tax-Refund", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05022010_uncle_sam_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Getting a tax refund can feel like winning a small lottery.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "But don\u2019t\u2026Experts also offered some of the ways you shouldn\u2019t use your tax refund.\nA tax refund is a great opportunity to start or increase your child\u2019s or grandchild\u2019s college savings fund, says Busch.\nEliminate that credit card balance once and for all with your tax refund.\nGetting a tax refund can feel like winning a small lottery.\nPass along your good fortune by donating your tax refund to your favorite charity."}
