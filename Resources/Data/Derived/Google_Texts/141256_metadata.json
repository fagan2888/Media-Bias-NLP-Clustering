Stacks of Barbie dolls, trendy headsets, musical instruments and board games grew several feet high by the second week of December.\n\nThis vacant space was headquarters for the Asbury Park Toy Drive \u2014 \"Toy Central,\" as the organizers call it.\"We're the female elves,\" said Mickey Carter, as she and Beth Foderaro sifted through bags of donations that Connie Breech collected the night before at Johnny Mac's. The three of them, as well as Barbara Lesinsky and Corey Lowell, lead the effort.\n\nFast forward one week: Shortly after 9 a.m. Saturday, a line of people stood outside \"Toy Central,\" which was located this year in a space on Bangs Avenue donated to the toy drive by developer Carter Sackman.\n\nShivering in a cold wind, the families, many with young children in tow, waited their turn to enter the building and receive bundles of toys, along with warm clothing like coats, mittens and hats.\n\nAfter receiving toys and clothing, the families stepped outside to an area at the rear of the building where volunteers allowed each child to pick out one extra donated toy, along with a book. Free hot dogs and hot chocolate also were available, courtesy of The Windmill. Santa Claus, aka Barry Bowling, handed candy canes to children and invited them to pose for pictures.\n\nBuy Photo Nicole Andrews and Malachi Gary, both of Asbury Park, look over toys the received for their son Malachi Andrews Jr. The Asbury Park Toy Drive takes over a vacant storefront in downtown Asbury Park as hundreds of people line up for gifts, clothing, and food.

Andrews' 21- year-old daughter, Jasmine, was also at the toy drive, where she received toys for her son Alijah, 2.\n\n\"It's a relief on our end,\" Gary said of the bag of gifts. \"This way, more money can go towards the bills. Right now it's really hard to get by.\"\n\nAsbury resident Giovanna Buenaventura and her daughter, Laylanni Caldeira, 8, stopped to say hello to Santa.\n\n\"Have you been a good girl?\" Santa asked Laylanni. \"Yes!\" she assured him. When Santa asked her for a high-five she happily obliged.\n\n\"Every year I come here,\" Buenaventura said of the toy drive. \"It's the feeling of Christmas that is here, and I get to take care of my daughter.\"\n\nWhat started off as a small charity for a few dozen kids has grown into a full-blown holiday operation with an application process and dozens of sponsors. This year the organizers received more than 500 applications for more than 1,331 children.\n\nSome families can't afford presents under the Christmas tree. Others have suffered from fires or other mishaps and lost their gifts. No matter what the situation, Breech said, it's the organizers' mission to get something for every child.\n\nBuy Photo The Asbury Park Toy Drive takes over a vacant storefront in downtown Asbury Park as hundreds of people line up for gifts, clothing, and food.

Breech and Foderaro kept the tradition going the following years.\n\nFoderaro remembers when Toy Central was the back of a friend's van. She and Breech, who were among the first volunteers, stood outside in the snow trying to pile dozens of large garbage bags with toys into the back. That was before parents had to submit applications.\n\nNow the toy drive is a citywide operation. A property owner donates a vacant space to the organizers. The campaign gets donations from Jimmy's Italian Restaurant to the Wonder Bar and the Stone Pony, along with several other local businesses. The year after Sandy hit, the toy drive got $11,000 worth of Hess toy trucks donated from the company.\n\n\"One year we had a fire truck and Santa,\" Foderaro said. \"We're too big doing this to even fathom doing that (this year).\"\n\n\"Anything great, it starts like this,\" she said, holding her thumb and index finger an inch apart.\n\nBuy Photo Lori Marie Ciello, a volunteer from the Monmouth County Sheriffs office distributes coats for those in need.

They have children of their own or come back to help out.\n\nOne of them is Jay'von Britt. He was around 10 years old the year he found an extra Christmas present under the tree. The bright angel sat perched atop the tree inside his east-side house as he opened the gift.\n\n\"It was a basketball and a football,\" Britt recalled years later. \"I loved the gifts.\"\n\nA budding athlete, he practiced with his new presents. He went on to join both the basketball and football team in high school, eventually playing varsity football and helping clinch the state championship.\n\nToday, Britt is a 22-year-old patrolman for the Asbury Park Police Department. He volunteers for the toy drive from time to time, helping Breech sort through the gift bags and hand them out to the families before Christmas.\n\n\"I was a kid that got those gifts before, so I just wanted to help out,\" said the city resident. \"It was wonderful because some people aren't fortunate enough to have families buy them gifts.\"\n\nFor Breech, it's about making the city a little brighter over the holidays, one toy at a time.\n\n\"It takes a village to raise a child,\" she said. \"If it's in your heart to help somebody, that's what you do.\"\n\nHow to help\n\nThe Asbury Park Toy Drive accepts donations year-round. Volunteers also distribute toys to local churches, as well as to the Community Affairs & Resource Center Jan. 6, for families who celebrate Three Kings Day.\n\nThe nonprofit also hosts Easter basket giveaways, essay contests for Mother's Day and Father's Day and school supply drives.\n\nSend donations to:\n\nAsbury Park Toy Drive\n\nPO Box 1469\n\nAsbury Park NJ 07712\n\nFor more information, visit the organization's website asburyparktoydrive.com.\n\nFor more headlines check out the NewsBreak below:\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Democratic presidential debate; State trooper killed in crash; Star Wars: The Force Awakens premieres\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
