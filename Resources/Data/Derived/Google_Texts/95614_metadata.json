Also, Covered California said 100,000 of its customers received 1095-A forms with errors and 50,000 more didn\u2019t receive the form, according to the IG report.\n\nFederal and state officials scrambled to send out new forms, but it was too late in some cases.\n\nThe Treasury decided it would not try to recoup the amount it overpaid by forcing affected customers to file an amended return, saying it wanted to \u201cmitigate any harm to tax filers,\u201d although Obamacare customers who were shortchanged could re-file.\n\nThe 2015 filing season marked the first time that American taxpayers had to address their health care status on their returns.\n\nWhile most people just had to check a box saying they were covered, others had to pay a tax penalty for flouting the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d requiring most Americans to hold health insurance, or else claim an exemption from the rule.\n\nOverall, the inspector general\u2019s report said the government properly calculated the tax subsidy in 93 percent of the 2.6 million cases it examined.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s office said it is working with the IRS to sort out discrepancies in calculating subsidies tied to 150,000 returns, though it did say the agency incorrectly calculated subsidy amounts for nearly 28,000 returns because of \u201ccomputer programming errors.\u201d\n\nIn response, IRS management said it would take a look at the those returns and \u201cprioritize them against existing workload demands and resource constraints so that they may be addressed accordingly.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The IRS mistakenly overpaid more than $8 million to HealthCare.gov customers and Obamacare users in California, and cheated tens of thousands of others out of nearly $2 million in 2015 because the government relied on incorrect information to figure their taxes, an audit revealed Tuesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The IRS mistakenly overpaid more than $8 million to HealthCare.gov customers and Obamacare users in California, and cheated tens of thousands of others out of nearly $2 million in 2015 because the government relied on incorrect information to figure their taxes, an audit revealed Tuesday.", "title": "Obamacare customers overpaid $8M by IRS", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/3/obamacare-customers-overpaid-8m-by-irs/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/30/aca-new_customers.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/30/aca-new_customers.jpeg", "description": "The IRS mistakenly overpaid more than $8 million to HealthCare.gov customers and Obamacare users in California, and cheated tens of thousands of others out of nearly $2 million in 2015 because the gov", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare customers overpaid $8M by IRS"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Internal Revenue Service"}, "article_summary": "Obamacare customers use information off a form known as the 1095-A to reconcile the amount of federal tax credits they received against what they actually earned.\nAfter the error, the Treasury Department decided it wouldn\u2019t bother to try to collect the overpayments, leaving tens of thousands of Obamacare customers with a bonus, courtesy of their fellow taxpayers.\nThe Treasury decided it would not try to recoup the amount it overpaid by forcing affected customers to file an amended return, saying it wanted to \u201cmitigate any harm to tax filers,\u201d although Obamacare customers who were shortchanged could re-file.\nOverall, the inspector general\u2019s report said the government properly calculated the tax subsidy in 93 percent of the 2.6 million cases it examined.\nThe problem stemmed from erroneous forms the government sent to about 800,000 customers, which used the wrong benchmark to measure what their Obamacare payments should have been."}
