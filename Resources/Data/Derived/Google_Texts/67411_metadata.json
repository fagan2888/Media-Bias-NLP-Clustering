The district would lease its land and buildings to PeaceHealth. Steiger said the two had recently reached full agreement on terms.\n\nIn the case of Skagit Regional, also owned by a public hospital district, PeaceHealth proposed a \u201cstrategic alliance\u201d to potentially operate joint ventures and consolidate some services. Under the proposal, Skagit Regional would have retained control of operations, finances and staff employment.\n\nPeaceHealth plans to hire a Chief Operating Officer, Steiger said in her memo, who will then assess the \u201cstrategic efficacy and value\u201d of proposed alliances such as those with Cascade Valley and Skagit Regional \u201cin light of the rapidly shifting payment and regulatory environment.\u201d\n\nIn the pre-Affordable Care Act days, Steiger explained in the interview, \u201cthe more people you had in the hospital the better you did\u201d financially. But new payment systems and regulations emphasize keeping people in the community healthy and out of the hospital, which puts pressure on big health-care systems, she said. \u201cWe think of the hospital as the center of the world, and it\u2019s not any more,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is changing around us.\u201d\n\nAlthough all three hospitals have heard from residents and others who wanted to stop the affliations, saying they feared religious control or even affiliation would limit services, Steiger said the reason for the pullback was strictly about resources. She said neither the protests nor the Seattle archbishop played a part in the decision to stop moving ahead.\n\nSkagit Regional\u2019s CEO Gregg Davidson said the hospital is not under financial pressure to affiliate. \u201cSkagit is healthy and growing,\u201d Davidson said in an email.\n\nIn a memo to staff, said the hospital is a \u201cstrong, independent organization,\u201d and will continue to move forward, including considering alternative options.\n\n\u201cWe are in a solid financial position and our organization continues to evolve into a growing integrated health care delivery system\u2026.\u201d Skagit plans to open an orthopedic and sports medicine clinic next month, he noted, and has a growing graduate medical education program, with 22 medical residents working and training there now.\n\nCascade officials were not available Tuesday for comment. Skagit partners with Cascade with programs and services through Cascade Skagit Health Alliance.\n\n\u201cI remain hopeful that collaboration in the future remains a possibility,\u201d Steiger said.", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "PeaceHealth, a Catholic health-care system, has delayed indefinitely its planned affiliations with small hospitals in Snohomish and Skagit counties, citing higher-than-expected costs\u00a0in the effort to roll out a\u00a0medical information-technology system.
