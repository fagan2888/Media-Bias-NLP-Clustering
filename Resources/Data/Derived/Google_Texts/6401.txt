Fresh off of endorsing socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders for president, UFC banthamweight (and now former champion) Ronda Rousey was knocked out by Holly Holm.

It was reported on Tuesday she had endorsed Sanders “because he doesn’t take any corporate money… I don’t think politicians should be allowed to take money for their campaigns from outside interests.”

She’s also shown some distain for Donald Trump, saying she doesn’t “really want a reality TV star to be running my country.”

Rousey was a growing star in the sports world and arguably the most famous current UFC athlete. She made headlines recently, not only for politics, but for not shaking hands with her opponents and losing much of the charm that made her iconic.

One has to (jokingly) wonder if endorsing Sanders was the beginning of the end for Ronda Rousey.

Here are the fight highlights:
