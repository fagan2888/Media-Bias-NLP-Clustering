Both decided that there was no contest: Doocy proclaimed that Obamacare was \"clearly\" worse than the \"slimdown,\" and Napolitano agreed that it was \"[n]ot even a close call.\" As evidence, Napolitano pointed out that \"the biggest inconvenience\" of the government shutdown was \"a couple hundred well-intended people trying to get into national parks and monuments and the government had closed them.\" In contrast, he claimed that Obamacare hurts people by forcing them to buy expensive \"high end, one-size-fits-all\" health insurance policies.\n\nFox's faulty comparison ignored the significant impacts of the government shutdown, which harmed the economy and slashed funding to necessary programs for low-income Americans.\n\nBecause of the shutdown, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), a program that helps provide health care for at-risk babies and \"helps new mothers feed themselves and their babies properly,\" saw its funding slashed, and states that were unable to lend the program local funds were forced to stop accepting enrollees. The shutdown also cut federal funding to at least 2,000 shelters for victims of domestic abuse, workplace safety inspections were halted, federal workers stopped inspecting toxic waste sites, and the CDC stopped monitoring the spread of the flu. National Geographic further reported that the shutdown caused long-term setbacks in scientific research, and The Washington Post detailed how the shutdown's fallout cost low-income workers their economic stability.\n\nThe shutdown also did lasting damage to the U.S. economy. Moody's Analytics estimated that the shutdown \"cut real GDP by $20 billion, shaving half a percentage point off growth in the fourth quarter,\" according to a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report. CRS also noted that \"JP Morgan Chase's chief economist was quoted as estimating that the shutdown reduced fourth quarter growth by 0.5 percentage points, with half the reduction attributable to lower government spending and half to 'spillover effects and lost activity' in the rest of the economy.\" The shutdown also eroded consumer confidence and may have derailed our gradual economic recovery, and economists argue that the shutdown will have lingering effects on the labor market and overall economy for several months.\n\nNapolitano's argument that \"5,500,000 innocent Americans were told they don't - they won't have health insurance on January 1st\" is also inaccurate. Fox has repeatedly worked to hide the fact that rather than losing coverage outright, most of these consumers are simply being offered new, often better, options because policies will be required to include basic standards of care. Moreover, the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, though rocky, has successfully allowed hundreds of thousands of Americans to sign up for Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Media Matters for America", "description": "Fox News claimed the Obamacare rollout has \"clearly\" been worse for the American people than the government shutdown, because the shutdown's \"biggest inconvenience\" was a few closed national parks and memorials -- ignoring the shutdown's cuts to domestic violence centers, women and children's food and health care, stalled scientific research, and", "title": "Fox: Obamacare Rollout Is Worse Than Shutdown That Drained Billions From Economy", "url": "http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/11/21/fox-obamacare-rollout-is-worse-than-shutdown-th/196998", "image": "http://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/uploader/image/2013/11/21/ShutdownVsObamacare.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-21T11:23:55-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/11/21/fox-obamacare-rollout-is-worse-than-shutdown-th/196998", "title": "Fox: Obamacare Rollout Is Worse Than Shutdown That Drained Billions From Economy", "site": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}, "card": "summary", "creator": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}}, "fb": {"admins": 1092360128}, "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "Fox News Channel", "published_time": "2013-11-21T11:23:55-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-21T11:12:01-05:00", "author": "http://mediamatters.org/authors/ellie-sandmeyer/210"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd540\"", "article_summary": "Fox's faulty comparison ignored the significant impacts of the government shutdown, which harmed the economy and slashed funding to necessary programs for low-income Americans.\nIn contrast, he claimed that Obamacare hurts people by forcing them to buy expensive \"high end, one-size-fits-all\" health insurance policies.\nBoth decided that there was no contest: Doocy proclaimed that Obamacare was \"clearly\" worse than the \"slimdown,\" and Napolitano agreed that it was \"[n]ot even a close call.\"\nMoreover, the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, though rocky, has successfully allowed hundreds of thousands of Americans to sign up for Medicaid.\nThe shutdown also did lasting damage to the U.S. economy."}
