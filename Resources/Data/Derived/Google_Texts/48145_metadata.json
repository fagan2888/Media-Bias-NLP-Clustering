Fears of Ebola and terrorism and a generalized feeling of insecurity were a factor, but 45 percent of voters said the economy was their most important issue.\n\nAnd here is the biggest red flag for Republicans moving forward: After six years of Obama, these voters broke for the GOP by just 2 points, 48 percent to 50 percent.\n\nAfter every election, whether Republicans win or lose, social issues get a disproportionate share of the \u201cproblem defining\u201d blame. But the GOP\u2019s biggest branding problem, even in victory, is clearly the economy. GOP candidates are not yet naming the biggest problem voters are facing: wage stagnation and a pervasive decline in the average household\u2019s standard of living.\n\nIn 1999, inflation-adjusted median household income peaked at $56,080. The Bush era was not a good one for the middle class; still, by 2007, people were only slightly worse off, at $55,627, than they had been under Clinton. In 2008, the year of the financial panic, median household income dropped to $53,644. Since then, incomes have stagnated. In June 2013, median household income logged in at $52,100. Real income for the middle class is down 6 percent under Obama and even more since its peak, 15 years ago under Bill Clinton.\n\nAnd of course our official inflation measure undercounts the stuff the average family making $50,000 a year spends its money on. Male wages have been in decline for even longer, and the average family\u2019s strategy of having fewer kids and putting wives (or live-in girlfriends) to work to compensate has run its course, in terms of being able to compensate.\n\nFor more than a decade Americans have been losing ground financially, and the GOP has yet to address the issue.\n\nThe Democrats offer increases in the minimum wage. While popular, including among Republicans, this is not a very good answer, since most workers do not have or want minimum-wage jobs. But at least it is a policy prescription that addresses voters\u2019 key concern.\n\nWhat is the Republican answer moving forward? Coming up with one is the key to victory, in 2016 and beyond.\n\n\u2014 Maggie Gallagher is a senior fellow at the American Principles Project.
