Given the troubles the administration has had in getting the web site up and running after a month in operation, one has to wonder whether the hardware used to build the troubled HealthCare.gov came off a Silicon Valley scrap heap.\n\nA stoic Obama uses what looks like Gordon Gekko\u2019s cell phone from 1987\u2032s \u201cWall Street\u201d while a nervous Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius crosses her fingers and prays for the best. The two are watching an unnamed techie inserting what appears to be a floppy disk \u2014 remember those? \u2014 into what appears to be either a Commodore 64 or an Apple II. We\u2019re not sure. And a crude hammer and screwdriver remains handy nearby, just in case someone wants to torpedo the whole program.\n\nWhat puzzles us is whether the tech guy is supposed to be someone in the administration, or just some random tech guy. We were thinking Microsoft founder Bill Gates meets White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, but we\u2019re open to suggestions\u2026\u2026\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter@russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter@MWHealthBlog", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-11-01T11:59:02-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "The New Yorker magazine mixes a modern-day presidency with crude 1980s technology to point out flaws with the trouble HealthCare.gov web site.", "title": "HealthCare.gov: Relying on floppy disks and giant cell phones to fix?", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/11/01/healthcare-gov-relying-on-floppy-disks-and-giant-cell-phones-to-fix/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BO420_new_yo_ME_20131101111718.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Barack Obama,health care,Kathleen Sebelius,New Yorker magazine,Obamacare", "article.headline": "HealthCare.gov: Relying on floppy disks and giant cell phones to fix?", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama,health care,Kathleen Sebelius,New Yorker magazine,Obamacare", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "The New Yorker magazine mixes a modern-day presidency with crude 1980s technology to point out flaws with the trouble HealthCare.gov web site.", "article.published": "2013-11-01T11:59:02-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/11/01/healthcare-gov-relying-on-floppy-disks-and-giant-cell-phones-to-fix/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "The New Yorker magazine mixes a modern-day presidency with crude 1980s technology to point out flaws with the trouble HealthCare.gov web site.", "title": "HealthCare.gov: Relying on floppy disks and giant cell phones to fix?", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/11/01/healthcare-gov-relying-on-floppy-disks-and-giant-cell-phones-to-fix/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DR328_mw_soc_NS_20150801233302.png", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1467", "article.updated": "2013-11-01T11:59:02-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb0e2\"", "article_summary": "What puzzles us is whether the tech guy is supposed to be someone in the administration, or just some random tech guy.\nWe couldn\u2019t resist this one: The latest cover of New Yorker magazine probably articulates what many are thinking when it comes to HealthCare.gov.\nThe two are watching an unnamed techie inserting what appears to be a floppy disk \u2014 remember those?\nWe were thinking Microsoft founder Bill Gates meets White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, but we\u2019re open to suggestions\u2026\u2026Follow Russ Britt on Twitter@russbrittmktwFollow Health Exchange on Twitter@MWHealthBlog\nAnd a crude hammer and screwdriver remains handy nearby, just in case someone wants to torpedo the whole program."}
