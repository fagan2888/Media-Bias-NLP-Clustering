The comment came in an interview with Valeurs Actuelles, which targets a very conservative audience in France.\n\nHis comments came in a discussion of the December terror attacks in Paris, where more than 120 people were killed and many more wounded by ISIS-inspired terrorists who targeted public spaces, including the Bataclan concert hall.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Shocking Suggestion for What to Do About North Korea\u2019s Kim Jung-un\n\n\u201cThe only people who had weapons were the killers,\u201d he said, calling it an \u201copen bar for a massacre.\u201d\n\nHe added: \"I always carry a weapon on me. If I'd been at the Bataclan or one of those bars, I would have opened fire. Perhaps I would have died, but at least I would have taken a shot. The worst thing is the powerlessness to respond to those who want to kill you,\" he said.\n\nTrump has previously revealed that he holds a concealed-carry permit, and has said that he sometimes carries a gun. The claim that he now carries a weapon at all times seems to be new. Trump has a Secret Service detail protecting him at all times.\n\nThe magazine\u2019s cover features a picture of a gesticulating Trump, possibly at a campaign rally, with the headline \u201cTrump Dit Tout\u201d \u2013 Trump Tells All. It also carries a quote from the interview, in which Trump says to the people of Europe, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be facing real revolutions.\u201d\n\nRelated: As Trump Comes Roaring Back, the GOP Reshuffles the Deck\n\nMuch of the interview focused on the question of immigration, which is roiling Europe as refugees from the carnage in Syria and other trouble spots in North Africa and the Middle East flood into the continent. France, in particular, has struggled with a large population of African immigrants, many of them Muslim, who have been both victims and perpetrators of violence and hate crimes.\n\nTrump also pointed to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s open-door policy to Syrian refugees has led to both a deluge of asylum-seekers and massive public pushback.\n\n\u201cMy German friends no longer know where they are. They can't believe their eyes about what is happening\u2026they're desperate,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cWhat's happening in Europe can lead to its collapse. It's dramatic what she has allowed to happen, this flood,\u201d he said, and predicted that if the problem is not addressed immediately, \u201cthen yes, it's the end of Europe.\u201d\n\nRelated: Did He Really Say That? Trump Hits a New Low in New Hampshire\n\nThe man who constantly promises that as president he would \u201cMake America great again,\u201d also seem to think that France needs the same treatment.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he said, \u201cFrance isn't what it was, nor Paris.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In news that should give both tomato-throwing protesters and his debate opponents pause, Donald Trump revealed to a French magazine that he always carries a gun on his person.
