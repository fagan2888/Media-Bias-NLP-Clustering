He straight-armed a defender and romped into the end zone. Just feet from where rapper Wiz Khalifa stood on a makeshift pregame stage extolling the crowd with \u201cBlack and Yellow,\u201d the gray began to lift on the Broncos\u2019 slump.\n\nThey led the Steelers 27-10 in Pittsburgh. Everything seemed possible, including a franchise-record seventh road victory. Then came the second half. Steve Harvey crowned Denver the winner. Lucy pulled away the football.\n\nEveryone in Colorado, from coach Gary Kubiak to the most angry fan, continues to ask the same question: How can the Broncos offer such a contradiction, dominating the first half of games before disappearing after halftime?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a little puzzling, but there are other things that are puzzling too,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cYou have to work through them and keep pushing. We\u2019ll keep digging until we find a way to come out of the locker room the right way.\u201d\n\nThe numbers are blunt. Denver has been outscored 36-0 in the second half of the past three games, including back-to-back losses to Oakland and Pittsburgh that have placed this season on the brink. No NFL team since the 2003 New York Giants has gone four consecutive games without a second-half point.\n\nWhat makes Denver\u2019s spiral jarring is the juxtaposition. In December, the Broncos have held a combined 56-16 advantage in the first half. Nothing illustrates the climb and subsequent cliff dive like third down. During the past three games, the Broncos have converted on 17-of-23 first-half third downs, while going 2-of-25 in the second half.\n\nThey have become to halves what the Rockies are to home and road splits.\n\n\u201cWe just have to find a way to finish for 60 minutes,\u201d running back C.J. Anderson said. \u201cThat\u2019s on us. We don\u2019t want to blame anybody. We\u2019re not going to blame the coaches. It\u2019s on us to make it go.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlay with excitment\u201d\n\nNo one person can be fingered. The answers for the collapses are complicated because they reveal problems across the board and leave flaws exposed. While Kubiak\u2019s arrival in Denver was welcomed, it came with baggage. His Houston Texans teams struggled down the stretch over his final three seasons, going 18-12 through their first 10 games and 8-14 thereafter.\n\nKubiak earned his reputation as a premier offensive coordinator by scripting the game\u2019s first 15 plays. He has experimented with scripting them in the second half. Nothing has clicked this month.\n\n\u201cI have done a little bit of everything in my career. The bottom line is that you are talking and making adjustments,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cHow are you getting played? What are they doing to you? To be honest, it\u2019s like anything in football. If it\u2019s not going good, you find a way to change it.\u201d\n\nIf the Broncos don\u2019t rebound in the second half, they face the possibility of becoming the first NFL team to start a season 10-2 and miss the postseason.\n\nThe Broncos entered halftime leading each of the past three games: 17-3, 12-0 and 27-13. They knew opponents would switch up their defenses. In San Diego, Denver turned conservative, correctly believing the Chargers\u2019 offense stood no chance against the Broncos\u2019 defense. But in the consecutive losses, the lack of counterpunch has been striking.\n\nThis Broncos offense doesn\u2019t resemble those of 2013 and 2014. Audibles typically feature two options: a tweak of the called play or a single alternative. Under former offensive coordinator Adam Gase, quarterback Peyton Manning had an entire playbook at his disposal at the line of scrimmage.\n\nLack of creativity, lack of balance \u2014 Denver gained only 25 yards rushing in the second half of the past two games \u2014 has created results that are lacking.\n\n\u201cAs an offense we just really need to play with excitement and play loose,\u201d said offensive tackle Ryan Harris. \u201cYou can\u2019t worry about last week. We\u2019re practicing loose, we\u2019re practicing fast, we\u2019re having fun. As long as we continue to do that, I think we will be very confident.\u201d\n\nThe Raiders, recognizing Denver\u2019s inability to run well enough to force a safety to drop down into the box, became more aggressive up front. It led to linebacker Khalil Mack obliterating tackles Michael Schofield and Harris for five second-half sacks. The Raiders surprised the Broncos by staying in cover-two and cover-three zones. The Broncos rarely exploited seam routes, and on the few times they did, drops followed.\n\nThe Steelers reacted by blitzing more in the second half and ditching their soft coverage.\n\nAnd no Broncos player could camouflage the offense\u2019s weaknesses by making a big play.\n\nOver the past three weeks, quarterback Brock Osweiler has completed 73 percent of his first half passes compared with 49 percent in the second half. Opponents recognize if they take away Osweiler\u2019s first read, he has a tendency to hold the ball too long and drift in the pocket.\n\nAppearing overmatched\n\n\u201cIt boils down to the fundamentals,\u201d Osweiler said. \u201cI know it sounds basic, but it\u2019s the little things that get you back on track. I am the first one that needs to fix things. I need to play better in the second half, and I will.\u201d\n\nThe players take ownership across the board, with no one publicly grumbling. But it\u2019s fair to wonder if Kubiak has too much faith in his players in this scheme, given the injuries to two left tackles, left guard Evan Mathis, Anderson and Manning. He has said repeatedly that sometimes it comes down to players \u201cwinning their one-on-one\u201d battles.\n\nStill, this isn\u2019t the Super Bowl title teams when the Broncos featured seven offensive Pro Bowlers and three Hall of Famers. This year\u2019s offense placed no one in the Pro Bowl, and players appear overmatched in the second half the past three weeks, averaging just five first downs and 100 total yards.\n\nThe three-and-outs \u2014 which feature penalties and sacks \u2014 sting. Momentum shifts become drastic with opponents gaining confidence from Denver\u2019s mistakes.\n\n\u201cThe key thing is those third downs, because it keeps you on the field,\u201d general manager John Elway told the team\u2019s website. \u201cWe know where we have been the last couple of weeks. We haven\u2019t performed in the second half like we\u2019d like to, but I think the key thing is that we do control our own destiny. We have to play 60 minutes. We\u2019ve done a good job, especially the last couple of weeks, in the first 30 minutes, but we played very poorly that second half. So we have to put 60 minutes together. Fortunately we\u2019re going to be back at home against a very good Cincinnati Bengals team. If we play 60 minutes like we\u2019re capable of, then we can beat anybody.\u201d\n\nAs the Broncos practiced Wednesday, a workout multiple players said was the team\u2019s best of the season, Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself\u201d blared at Dove Valley:\n\n\u201cLook, if you had, one shot, or one opportunity\n\n\u201cTo seize everything you ever wanted. In one moment\n\n\u201cWould you capture it, or just let it slip?\u201d\n\nThe answer lies in the second half.\n\nTroy E.

They are trying to avoid becoming the first NFL team since the 2003 New York Giants to not score in the second half of four consecutive games:", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos\u2019 postseason chances depend on playing better after halftime", "title": "Broncos\u2019 postseason chances depend on playing better after halftime", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/26/broncos-postseason-chances-depend-on-playing-better-after-halftime/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151226__SP06FBNBRONCOS_JA23159ap1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151226__SP06FBNBRONCOS_JA23159ap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-26T13:02:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:07:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd25f1\"", "article_summary": "In one moment\u201cWould you capture it, or just let it slip?\u201dThe answer lies in the second half.\nDuring the past three games, the Broncos have converted on 17-of-23 first-half third downs, while going 2-of-25 in the second half.\nThe Steelers reacted by blitzing more in the second half and ditching their soft coverage.\nWe haven\u2019t performed in the second half like we\u2019d like to, but I think the key thing is that we do control our own destiny.\nThen came the second half."}
