Reuters\n\nBeijing, China\u2019s capital, is seeing a huge increase in lung cancer cases. Although Chinese officials attribute the high number of cases to smoking, air pollution has been identified as another major cause of lung cancer in the country.\n\nAccording to the state-run Xinhua news agency, the number of lung cancer cases per 100,000 people in Beijing was 39.56 in 2002, but has soared to 63.09 by 2011.\n\nThe levels of air pollution in China have been receiving a lot of press lately. Last week, Xinhua News Agency identified China\u2019s youngest lung cancer patient: an 8-year-old girl. Doctors from the Jiangsu Cancer Hospital said that the smog in the Jiangsu province was most likely the cause of the girl\u2019s cancer. The government also recently shut down roads, schools, and the airport in the city of Harbin, as the air pollution level hit 40 times higher than the safe limit set by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, there are some 3.2 million deaths per year around the globe due to air pollution, 200,000 of them from lung cancer. \u201cMore than half of the lung cancer deaths attributable to ambient fine particles were projected to have been in China and other East Asian countries,\u201d the WHO notes.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of carcinogens emitted with industrial pollution,\u201d C. Arden Pope, an economics professor at Brigham Young University who researches air pollution, told National Geographic. \u201cOur respiratory systems filter out the relatively large particles from air pollution\u2026 The tiny ones come nearly entirely from burning things \u2014 coal, gasoline, and diesel. Those tiny combustion particles are small enough to penetrate the lungs, and they\u2019re made up of all sorts of nasty particles.\u201d\n\nEven in 2008, Chinese officials were sounding alarms about lung cancer, noting that it had surpassed liver cancer as the number one killer of people with malignant tumors living in China. Other cancers, such as intestinal, breast, and bladder cancer, have also had rising rates in the past few decades, Chinese official Qi Xiaoqiu said in the 2008 report. The report also noted that the death rate from malignant tumors was higher in China\u2019s urban areas than it was in rural areas.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the industrial activity in China that is contributing to their economic well-being also contributes to poor health effects,\u201d Pope continued. \u201cThe benefits [of industrialization] versus loss of health and productivity are trade-offs not fully understood. But we know from our experience in the U.S. that we get quite substantial benefits when we are able to reduce air pollution.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lung cancer, china, air pollution, beijing", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The number of lung cancer patients in Beijing has jumped significantly, due in part to the heavy smog hanging over the city.", "title": "Beijing Lung Cancer Cases Rise By 50 Percent Over The Past Decade", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/beijing-lung-cancer-cases-rise-50-percent-over-past-decade-262475", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/09/beijing.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The number of lung cancer patients in Beijing has jumped significantly, due in part to the heavy smog hanging over the city.", "title": "Beijing Lung Cancer Cases Rise By 50 Percent Over The Past Decade", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/beijing-lung-cancer-cases-rise-50-percent-over-past-decade-262475", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/09/beijing.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/09/beijing.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-11-09T19:16:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-09T19:16:18-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The number of lung cancer patients in Beijing has jumped significantly, due in part to the heavy smog hanging over the city."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a93\"", "article_summary": "ReutersBeijing, China\u2019s capital, is seeing a huge increase in lung cancer cases.\nThe number of lung cancer cases in Beijing has jumped significantly in the past decade, due in part to the heavy smog that hangs in the city.\nAccording to the state-run Xinhua news agency, the number of lung cancer cases per 100,000 people in Beijing was 39.56 in 2002, but has soared to 63.09 by 2011.\nLast week, Xinhua News Agency identified China\u2019s youngest lung cancer patient: an 8-year-old girl.\nAlthough Chinese officials attribute the high number of cases to smoking, air pollution has been identified as another major cause of lung cancer in the country."}
