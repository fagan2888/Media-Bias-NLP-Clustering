One terrible trade deal - the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).\n\nWe know a trade deal must be truly devastating to hardworking families when leading presidential candidates from opposite ends of the political spectrum find common ground in opposing it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe reasoning behind this diverse opposition is simple \u2013 the TPP is a massive giveaway to corporate special interests that will give hardworking Americans two things they can\u2019t afford \u2013 lost jobs and lower wages. Anyone who thinks otherwise, Republican or Democrat, is in denial.\n\nThe fight to stop this trade agreement goes well beyond the presidential campaign trail. Ford Motor Company, AFL-CIO, Doctors without Borders, and Sierra Club have all called for the TPP to be rejected. If top presidential candidates, major corporations, labor unions, and global health care and environmental leaders opposing this deal isn\u2019t a big caution sign, then what is?\n\nOf course, the ultimate fate of the TPP rests in the hands of Congress. With that in mind, to any member of Congress who truly believes that this trade pact is good for America, we only have one thing to say \u2013 read it.\n\nMembers of Congress who support TPP should have the courage to publicly confirm to the people of this country that they have read every word of this massive 6,000 page trade deal before they vote for it.\n\nWe can\u2019t imagine anyone supporting this deal after actually taking the time to fully absorb its impact, let alone read it. The text is filled with details that are both harrowing and harmful to everyone in America who is fighting to build a better life.\n\nFor example, Americans will be pushed into an unfair competition with workers in Vietnam who make less than a dollar per hour. The result will be a race to the bottom where corporations either lower wages or send jobs overseas.\n\nThe trade pact also includes extended patent monopolies for life-saving medicines. This means big pharmaceutical companies will be able to keep drug prices high by locking out more affordable generic versions.\n\nAs if lowering wages and raising drug prices wasn\u2019t enough, the TPP will also force us to accept more seafood and meat imports from countries like Malaysia whose food safety standards are notoriously lax.\n\nIf you did not know some or all of these terrible details, don\u2019t feel badly. The text of this 6,000-page deal has only recently been made public. Unaccountable trade representatives negotiated the deal in nearly complete secrecy, and it\u2019s clear that corporate lawyers stuffed it full of complicated, dense, legal language that benefits their special interest clients at the expense of everyone else.\n\nGiven what we know about who negotiated the deal, how they negotiated it, and what they ultimately wrote, it is incomprehensible how any reasonable person could believe that this deal benefits a majority of hardworking men and women and their families. This deal might be good for corporate donors, but for a vast majority of Americans it spells disaster and must be stopped.\n\nAs such, we, the 1.3 million hardworking members of the UFCW family, along with countless allies, will be asking every member of Congress \u2013 Republican and Democrat \u2013 to pledge to read every page of the TPP before they vote on it.\n\nWe hazard to guess that not one supporter of TPP in Congress has ever read the full text, which naturally begs the question, why are they planning to vote for it?\n\nWhen fully printed, the pages of the TPP trade agreement stand nearly 4 feet tall. But there is just too much at stake for any member of Congress to vote on this deal without reading it.\n\nWe urge anyone who believes in building a better America to join us in this effort. Simply asking Congress to read a trade bill before they vote on it shouldn\u2019t be too much to ask for.\n\nPerrone is president of the 1.3 million member United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "To any member of Congress who truly believes that this trade pact is good for America, we only have one thing to say \u2013 read it.", "description": "To any member of Congress who truly believes that this trade pact is good for America, we only have one thing to say \u2013 read it.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "To any member of Congress who truly believes that this trade pact is good for America, we only have one thing to say \u2013 read it.", "title": "TPP: Massive giveaway to corporate interests", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/260964-tpp-massive-giveaway-to-corporate-interests", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/obamaabe_042815getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/260964-tpp-massive-giveaway-to-corporate-interests", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-23T10:30-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Marc Perrone", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-23T10:30:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/260964-tpp-massive-giveaway-to-corporate-interests", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "To any member of Congress who truly believes that this trade pact is good for America, we only have one thing to say \u2013 read it.", "card": "summary", "title": "TPP: Massive giveaway to corporate interests"}, "dcterms.title": "TPP: Massive giveaway to corporate interests"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6c6\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTThe reasoning behind this diverse opposition is simple \u2013 the TPP is a massive giveaway to corporate special interests that will give hardworking Americans two things they can\u2019t afford \u2013 lost jobs and lower wages.\nWhen fully printed, the pages of the TPP trade agreement stand nearly 4 feet tall.\nOne terrible trade deal - the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).\nSimply asking Congress to read a trade bill before they vote on it shouldn\u2019t be too much to ask for.\nFord Motor Company, AFL-CIO, Doctors without Borders, and Sierra Club have all called for the TPP to be rejected."}
