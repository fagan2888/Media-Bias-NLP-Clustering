Service Employees International Union reported 243,799 agency fee payers. Many of the employees represented by SEIU work in the private sector.\n\nDOL defines agency fee payers as \u201cthose who make payments in lieu of dues to the reporting labor organization as a condition of employment under a union security provision in a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d Public-sector unions can impose agency fees in 23 states.\n\nAccording to the Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, 7.2 million of the country\u2019s 20.4 million public-sector workers were members of unions in 2013. Another 690,000 government employees were represented by unions but weren\u2019t union members.\n\n\u201cUnions were first developed years ago to protect workers but too often, in today\u2019s world, they exist solely for one thing and one thing only \u2014 raw, crass political power,\u201d Brett Healy, president of the Wisconsin-based MacIver Institute, told Watchdog.org via email. \u201cBig Labor bosses are more worried about supplying politicians with donations than the wellbeing of the rank-n-file or what is best for the rest of us \u2014 the taxpayers.\n\n\u201cGovernment workers understand this and that is why so many refuse to pay for the political spending of unions,\u201d Healy said. \u201cBy becoming an agency fee payer, the money forcibly removed from a public employee\u2019s paycheck cannot go toward political candidates or causes.\u201d\n\nDetermining the total number of agency fee payers nationwide is difficult because certain public-sector unions \u2014 including those with less than $250,000 in revenue \u2014 are exempt from many DOL reporting requirements.\n\nAdditionally, American Federation of Teachers and other large unions representing government workers do not report a total number of agency fee payers because of the way workers\u2019 money flows to each union\u2019s headquarters through state and local chapters.\n\nExcluding New York State United Teachers, an affiliate of both NEA and AFT with 23,622 agency fee payers, AFT locals took mandatory fees from at least 38,644 workers in at least 12 states.\n\n\u201cWhy should one be forced to hand over their hard-earned money to a political organization they may not agree with? We live in the land of the free not the land of forced association,\u201d Healy said.\n\n\u201cLuckily in Wisconsin, Act 10 has put rank-n-file government workers and the taxpayers back in charge. Government unions are not allowed to forcibly remove any dues or fees from a worker\u2019s paycheck,\u201d Healy added. \u201cIf an employee wants to be in a union, they can write the check themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith so many government workers across the country opting to just be agency fee payers, it would not be a surprise if more and more states start to reform their collective bargaining laws, just as the Badger State did in 2011, to ban the un-American practice of forced automatic dues deduction.\u201d\n\nA state-by-state overview of government union agency fee payers follows, based on data from unions\u2019 2013 DOL reports.\n\nFor the reasons described above, the following is not an exhaustive list. And, while Michigan and Wisconsin still allow public safety unions to take agency fees, recent reforms in both states forbid AFSCME, NEA, SEIU, and others from negotiating mandatory fees in future contracts.\n\nAlaska: Forced dues taken from at least 418 public-sector workers\n\nAFT Alaska: 418 agency fee payers in 2013\n\nCalifornia: Forced dues taken from at least 48,362 public-sector workers\n\nAFSCME Local 3930 United Domestic Workers of America: 27,575 agency fee payers in 2013\n\nAFT California: 11,690\n\nAFSCME Council 57: 5,119\n\nAFSCME Council 36: 3,978\n\nConnecticut: Forced dues taken from at least 1,415 public-sector workers\n\nAFT Connecticut: 877 agency fee payers in 2013\n\nSEIU Local 2001, Connecticut State Employees: 538\n\nDelaware: Forced dues taken from public-sector workers\n\nNEA affiliate Delaware State Education Association takes agency fees, but did not submit an annual report to DOL in 2013.\n\nDistrict of Columbia: Forced dues taken from at least 3,620 public-sector workers\n\nAFSCME Council 20: 3,620 agency fee payers in 2013\n\nHawaii: Forced dues taken from at least 1,122 public-sector workers\n\nAFSCME Local 646: 1,122 agency fee payers in 2013\n\nIllinois: Forced dues taken from at least 7,723 public-sector workers\n\nAFT Illinois: 7,723 agency fee payers in 2013\n\nMaine: Forced dues taken from at least 2,630 public-sector workers\n\nSEIU Local 1989, Maine State Employees Association: 2,630 agency fee payers in 2013\n\nMaryland: Forced dues taken from at least 13,454 public-sector workers\n\nAFSCME Council 3, Maryland State & University Employees: 9,631 agency fee payers in 2013\n\nSEIU Local 500: 3,823\n\nMassachusetts: Forced dues taken from at least 431 public-sector workers\n\nAFSCME Council 93: 431 agency fee payers in 2013\n\nMichigan: Forced dues taken from at least 4,019 public-sector workers\n\nWith the exception of public-safety unions, public-sector unions in Michigan cannot include agency fee requirements in new contracts as a result of the state\u2019s 2012 Right to Work law.\n\nAFT Michigan: 3,328 agency fee payers in 2013\n\nMichigan Education Association (NEA): 582\n\nAFSCME Council 25: 109\n\nMinnesota: Forced dues taken from at least 6,145 public-sector workers\n\nEducation Minnesota (NEA): 6,145 agency fee payers in 2013\n\nMontana: Forced dues taken from at least 1,157 public-sector workers\n\nAFT Montana: 1,157 agency fee payers in 2013\n\nNew Hampshire: Forced dues taken from at least 85 public-sector workers\n\nAFT New Hampshire: 85 agency fee payers in 2013\n\nNew Jersey: Forced dues taken from at least 8,875 public-sector workers\n\nAFT New Jersey: 3,936 agency fee payers in 2013\n\nAFSCME Council 1: 2,700\n\nAFSCME Council 71: 1,247\n\nNew Jersey Hospital Professional & Allied Employees (AFT): 992\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCommunications Workers of America Local 7076 and AFSCME Council 18 both take agency fees from State of New Mexico employees, based on the latest contracts posted by the New Mexico State Personnel Office.
