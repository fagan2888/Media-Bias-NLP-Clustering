I\u2019ve been watching the \u201cweirdies\u201d (as my grandmother dubbed horror flicks) since I was a kid. I watched so many and talked about them so often that the Sisters of Christian Charity who taught at my elementary school called my mother in for a parent-teacher conference. Was there a problem at home? (There wasn\u2019t.) As an adult, I\u2019m still on the lookout for that special film which will have me digging my nails into the upholstery. That experience is harder to find in the age of the internet where overexposure has dampened our feelings.\n\nI may have found what I\u2019ve been looking for in Game of Thrones.\n\nWhen I settled down to watch \u201cTwo Swords,\u201d the Season Four premier of HBO\u2019s mega-hit, I posted on Facebook, \u201cNo one should have to watch Game of Thrones alone.\u201d (I wasn\u2019t exactly alone. There were 6.6 million viewers of the 9 pm broadcast.) But there I was, in my apartment on a Sunday night, imagining 6.6 million people holding my hand as I huddled on my sofa, a box of Thin Mints (don\u2019t judge!) at my side, watching with jaw clenched and toes curled. That kind of unbearable, nearly-painful suspense is what I imagine audiences felt when they first saw movies like The Exorcist, Psycho, The Last House on the Left and Night of the Living Dead.\n\nFans of George R. R. Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire know (and will tell over and over and over again) that Martin\u2019s world is not wanting for brutality. The television adaptation, created by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (with Martin as Co-Executive Producer) has even bested some of the novel\u2019s shocks, but pure brutality isn\u2019t enough to keep us playing. Surprise doesn\u2019t sustain drama, nor does it keep millions of fans engaged. In Game of Thrones, the horrific and the grievous, the heroic and the vengeful are part of a larger thematic map of a complex and sometimes confusing world. Game of Thrones doesn\u2019t rise above its sensational moments, it makes them necessary. Characters have multi-layered motivation, decisions have consequences, and the plot twists keep the next big moment hidden. The surprises come but, on reflection, seem inevitable; if we are paying attention, clues have been there all along. The result is that viewers are constantly listening for danger in the subtext and watching for daggers at the corners of the screen\u2026 hoping (sometimes against hope) that their favorite characters will not suffer cruel ends.\n\nThe shocking death of a lead character is a device used to unnerving effect in Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho. In Game of Thrones, Ned Stark\u2019s beheading at the end of Season One massacres expectation in the same way. The result is that Westeros is transformed from a fantasy kingdom into a real place \u2014 despite dragons, demon babies, and men with changing faces. To say \u201cno one is safe\u201d is trivial: the greater danger is that good might not triumph over evil. This will be no typical hero\u2019s journey.\n\nOne of my friends has broken up with Game of Thrones. \u201cI will not be Red Wedding\u2019d again\u201d he tells me. And there are others like him. From the torture of Theon Greyjoy to The Red Wedding, the cruelty feels helter-skelter. But Martin has a code. In his Westeros, the na\u00efve are punished. It\u2019s not really win or die, as Cersei declared in S1E7, it\u2019s \u201clearn or lose.\u201d Game of Thrones suggests that cunning is more valuable than honor. The fallen Starks are those who haven\u2019t learned fast enough. The Red Wedding, like so much of what happens to the Starks, makes integrity seem like naivet\u00e9. The Starks\u2019 belief in honor is a noble trait which impairs their judgment, blinding them to the treachery of others.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It goes beyond \"The Red Wedding.\" The HBO series is as much an extended horror film as it is a fantasy series", "author": "TOM GUALTIERI", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "It goes beyond \"The Red Wedding.\" The HBO series is as much an extended horror film as it is a fantasy series", "title": "\u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d American horror story", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/12/game_of_thrones_makes_me_want_to_dig_my_nails_into_the_upholstery_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/game_of_thrones.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It goes beyond \"The Red Wedding.\" The HBO series is as much an extended horror film as it is a fantasy series", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/game_of_thrones.jpg", "title": "\u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d American horror story", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d American horror story", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Game of Thrones, Horror, The Weeklings", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd61ca\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Game of Thrones, Horror, The Weeklings, Entertainment News, NewsThis article originally appeared on The WeeklingsI\u2019M A HORROR FAN.\nIn Game of Thrones, Ned Stark\u2019s beheading at the end of Season One massacres expectation in the same way.\nWhen I settled down to watch \u201cTwo Swords,\u201d the Season Four premier of HBO\u2019s mega-hit, I posted on Facebook, \u201cNo one should have to watch Game of Thrones alone.\u201d (I wasn\u2019t exactly alone.\nI may have found what I\u2019ve been looking for in Game of Thrones.\nIt\u2019s not really win or die, as Cersei declared in S1E7, it\u2019s \u201clearn or lose.\u201d Game of Thrones suggests that cunning is more valuable than honor."}
