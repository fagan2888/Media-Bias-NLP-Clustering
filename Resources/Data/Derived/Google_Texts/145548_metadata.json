Facebook\n\nOne 24-year-old girl with a rare skin condition has taken on the world by storm, choosing to get a tattoo to reduce the stigma associated with her disease.\n\nTiffany Posteraro has vitiligo, which causes white splotches across tanner or darker skin. She first started seeing the strange spots at an early age but didn\u2019t know what was causing them.\n\n\u201cI showed my parents, but we just thought they must be scars or something,\u201d she told Woman\u2019s Day. \u201cWe had no idea what it was. A dermatologist gave me some ointment, but it did nothing.\u201d\n\nHow a doctor never figured out what her skin condition was is beyond me \u2014 but a random stranger at a grocery store ultimately made the diagnosis, pulling Posteraro aside and telling her she had vitiligo.\n\nVitiligo is a disease that\u2019s caused by a lack of melanin in your skin and even hair, and it leads to the loss of skin color on any part of your body, including your eyes and mouth. Melanin is the pigment that gives your skin, hair, and eyes color \u2014 and darker-skinned people tend to have more of it than light-skinned people. Vitiligo sufferers tend to have white splotches across their skin.\n\nOver the years, Posteraro\u2019s skin condition worsened \u2014 and people began calling her \u201ccow,\u201d \u201cDalmation,\u201d and \u201cburn victim.\u201d The bullying and staring spurred her to turn to heavy foundations to cover the skin spots: \u201cI tried everything possible to cover it up,\u201d she told Woman\u2019s Day. \u201cI got really dark spray tans and used industrial-strength foundation, the kind used to cover deep scars.\u201d\n\nEventually, however, Posteraro had a change of heart. \u201cWhy should I hide who I am?\u201d she ultimately concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when she decided to get a tattoo on her arm that allowed her to embrace her condition \u2014 as well as confront the bullying front on. \u201cIt\u2019s called Vitiligo\u201d is tattooed right across a dividing line of splotches on the inside of her left arm, serving both as a reminder to herself to accept and love herself as well as to raise awareness and reduce stigma among others.\n\nA vitiligo sufferer has come up with the PERFECT response to people's stares http://t.co/SQx6exVYvW pic.twitter.com/AcVZfxHJ52 \u2014 Daily Mirror (@DailyMirror) August 20, 2015\n\n'It's called vitiligo': Woman with rare skin condition gets tattoo as perfect response to people's stares pic.twitter.com/Pg4ZCeFH3A \u2014 \u00c7apaMag in English (@CapaMagENG) August 20, 2015\n\nSome one to two percent of the world population has the skin condition, and it\u2019s most noticeable in people with darker skin.
