On the way home, I stopped at Exxon for gas, and at Walgreens for cough medicine.\n\nAt some level, I know these purchases ended up in the coffers of a big company headquartered elsewhere, but it really didn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s part of life. Big is everywhere.\n\nMost of us accept the advantages of big when we buy things like our coffee, newspapers, over-the-counter medications and fuel. At some level, we rationalize that were it not for big, there would be less variety, fewer locations, shorter operating hours, and something different than a mom and pop economy could provide. And lenders and investors see the advantages of big: they invest in start-ups that have the potential to go big, and in established big\u2019s that are growing through innovation and acquisition. In most industries, the big\u2019s enjoy advantages others don\u2019t\u2014the ability to attract top talent, the capacity to access and deploy game-changing technologies and adequate capital to fund entry into new markets and businesses. But being big is no guarantee of success: recent disappointments by big names like McDonalds and WalMart illustrate the reality that every organization, big or small, must innovate and adapt to survive and thrive.\n\nBig is part of healthcare too. Last week\u2019s news of Walgreens\u2019 intent to acquire Rite Aid and Pfizer\u2019s pursuit of Allergan are the two most recent deals getting news coverage. The pursuits of Cigna by Anthem, Humana by Aetna are still being vetted by the Department of Justice as four big\u2019s become two, and with United, the new Big Three in health insurance. The fact is that major players in each sector of healthcare are big and getting bigger. They\u2019re doing well for the most part, based on their most current earnings reports (below), and they are getting bigger.\n\n1 Income loss from operations\n\nHighlighted indicates 2Q data since 3Q not reported as of 10/30/15 1 Income loss from operations; Express Scripts only provides mail pharmacy services; it has no retail chains.There is no precise market share for each of the top players; an estimate can be seen here: http://www.mdm.com/2014_pharmaceuticals_mdm-market-leaders\n\nBut at the center in healthcare are local providers, and relatively speaking, they\u2019re small. The reality is that those that deliver health care services in our communities\u2014hospitals, physicians, post-acute providers, and allied health professionals are David in the land of Goliaths. Some local boards and medical groups say. \u201cAs long as we are able to fulfill our mission and serve our community, the big\u2019s can\u2019t hurt us.\u201d But ask yourself: Did Walgreens or CVS ask permission of the hospital board or local physicians to set-up retail clinics in your community? Did the big insurer ask permission to enroll the patients in its care management programs and direct its members to providers they chose? Did the big employer ask permission to send its open heart and joint replacement cases elsewhere to get a better deal? And are digital health services doing a better job educating the local citizenry about the quality, costs and safety of the services provided than we do ourselves?\n\nTo compete in this industry, providers must get bigger, deeper and wider. Granted the regulatory climate is uniquely perplexing\u2013regulations that constrain programs via certificate of need procedures, practice parameters set by licensing boards within state boundaries, antitrust issues and safe harbors that define markets locally while competing with organizations whose scope and scale is national and others. But regulation in healthcare is a framework, not a straight jacket. While the Affordable Care Act was seen by some as threatening, for many it\u2019s unleashed innovation and growth.\n\nFor providers, going big means building a fully integrated system of health that spans a region, provides preventive, chronic, acute and post-acute services seamlessly in a variety of retail, virtual, alternative and traditional settings. It\u2019s an organization whose brand connotes value and the breadth of its services and programs extends well beyond those compensated through third-party payments. It takes full financial and clinical risk for its traditional programs and services under capitated agreements with multiple payers including its own plan. And its focus is total population health\u2014from cradle to grave for the sick and the well. It connects health and human services and its investments in healthy communities and digital technologies to empower self-care are as critical to core operations structure as clinics, hospitals, ancillaries and post-acute programs.\n\nFor healthcare providers, the transition to big is not without risk, but the greater risk is to be run over by the big\u2019s. There are certainly limits to going big: monopolies are carefully policed in our economy, but relative to the consolidation in other parts of healthcare, providers remain small and at a disadvantage.\n\nThe breadth and depth of services necessary to be a big system of health requires transformational leadership and well-equipped boards. The C suite must be led by a visionary leader with wide, diverse industry expertise and a board that\u2019 shares a vision about the breadth of the enterprise of the future. It\u2019s exciting, but scary at the same time, and not everyone will be happy with the changes.\n\nIn an ideal world, I would love to get my 5 am coffee and papers from a local barista but Starbucks is my only option at that time. They\u2019re big but I like their coffee and I value their product. I feel no guilt about spending money at Starbucks though I recall an earlier day when they weren\u2019t around at all. In some communities, the same reminiscing might be true of local health providers. In one sense, it boils down to go big or get out.\n\nPhoto: Flickr", "article_metadata": {"description": "For healthcare providers, the transition to big is not without risk, but the greater risk is to be run over by the big\u2019s.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "For healthcare providers, the transition to big is not without risk, but the greater risk is to be run over by the big\u2019s.", "title": "As consolidation forces health systems to get bigger, how are they managing risk?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/4598642399_60bd392b22_z.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-06T11:49:51-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/11/consolidation-and-health-systems/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/4598642399_60bd392b22_z.jpg", "description": "For healthcare providers, the transition to big is not without risk, but the greater risk is to be run over by the big\u2019s.", "card": "summary", "title": "As consolidation forces health systems to get bigger, how are they managing risk? - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,hospitals, OB, payers, Population Health, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Population Health", "published_time": "2015-11-02T13:27:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-06T11:49:51-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In some communities, the same reminiscing might be true of local health providers.\nFor healthcare providers, the transition to big is not without risk, but the greater risk is to be run over by the big\u2019s.\nAnd are digital health services doing a better job educating the local citizenry about the quality, costs and safety of the services provided than we do ourselves?\nThe breadth and depth of services necessary to be a big system of health requires transformational leadership and well-equipped boards.\nThe reality is that those that deliver health care services in our communities\u2014hospitals, physicians, post-acute providers, and allied health professionals are David in the land of Goliaths."}
