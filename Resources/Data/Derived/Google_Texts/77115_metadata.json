For both Selena and Justin, these albums signaled to the world their \u201ccomebacks.\u201d Justin was back to deliver himself from the evil of bratty deposition videos, throwing eggs at a neighbor\u2019s house, and screwing with ex-girlfriend Selena\u2019s heart. Selena\u2019s comeback, also signaling the beginning of her contract with new label Interscope, was framed as more of a restart. It signaled her transformation into a full-on grown adult woman who has found confidence on the inside as well as the outside, after finally having moved on from the heartbreak she endured from her famously tumultuous relationship with \u201cbad boy\u201d Bieber.\n\nJustin and Selena were rumored to have started dating under contract, but regardless of the couple\u2019s origins, the two dated publically on and off for five years. Anyone who has spent time on gossip blogs between now and 2009 knows the two have serious history. In the promotional interviews for their albums, both Selena and Justin openly acknowledged their relationship with one another. Watch Seacrest ask Selena about Justin, read Justin\u2019s Complex cover story, which reads a lot like a confessional, and they both answer insightfully about one another, either at length or emphatically. In the last couple of months, Justin posted throwback photo after throwback photo of him and Selena during happier times, leaving all of us to wonder hungrily, What is currently going on between the two of them, really?\n\nThe biggest pop stars of 2015 have participated in what I have decided to refer to as the \u201csoap opera-fication\u201d of themselves, or the capitalization on their relationship narratives for clicks and hits. We have seen soap-operafication everywhere this year. Meek Mill\u2019s first single off his debut LP \u201cDreams Worth More than Money,\u201d \u201cAll Eyes On You,\u201d was released in June and featured his rap star girlfriend Nicki on the track and in the video. October\u2019s One Direction single \u201cPerfect\u201d off their fourth LP is a suspiciously deliberate response to Swift\u2019s \u201cStyle,\u201d which came out as a single in February and was very publically regarded as being about 1D frontman Harry Styles. Kylie Jenner popped up in Tyga\u2019s two pretty forgettable music videos released this year, and Tyga popped up often on Kylie\u2019s snapchat and on her holiday gift guide. Newcomer and rapper Lil Durk put out \u201cMy Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d a love song about his rumored girlfriend, DeJ Loaf, featuring said rumored girlfriend \u2014 and soon after it was released, the pair was photographed PDA-ing hard. Looking back at 2015, the \u201cit\u201d move was not to just publicly address the relationship you were in, but to drum up interest in the idiosyncrasies of it with everybody watching in real time.\n\nThere are obvious advantages of publicly associating with your famous significant other, especially if this person is more famous than you, or just has wider reach. \u201cAll Eyes on You\u201d is not a good representation of the kind of rapping Meek Mill is capable of, but it did make him well-known for being Minaj\u2019s boyfriend, and she\u2019s a household name.\n\nFocusing heavily on the relationship drama of pop stars during promotional seasons to assist with record releases is not a new concept, of course \u2014 Justin Timberlake\u2019s song \u201cCry Me a River,\u201d released in 2002, was famously rumored to be about ex-girlfriend and tabloid staple Britney Spears. But Justin himself did not publicly confirm this until 2011, nine years after the record was released. The tiny nugget of a rumor that the song might be about Britney was leaked to gossip mags around the time the song was announced as a single, and gossip mags spun it however they wanted to. Beyonc\u00e9 went public with her relationship with Jay Z as part of the strategy to launch her solo career in \u201903. They were seen together in music videos and on red carpets, but in interviews the pair remained famously private about their relationship over the last decade and were rarely mentioned in gossip rags. Flash forward to 2015, though, and you can go to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Tumblr for personal photos of her life with her husband Jay Z \u2014 or you can wait until gossip blogs write about them, rehashing content that Beyonc\u00e9 has already offered up herself. The Beyonc\u00e9 content that makes the news is what she posts to her Instagram or Tumblr: idyllic family scenes of Jay and Blue Ivy on vacation in Italy or the family at a Halloween party. Whatever happened in the elevator between Jay and Solange in 2014 became old news fast, but only because Beyonc\u00e9 quickly and publicly dismissed it \u2014 if that had happened 10 years ago, when Beyonc\u00e9 had no direct platforms from which to do damage control, the rumors would have lingered on.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Selling an album now means selling your story directly to the fans\u2014every detail of heartbreak and intrigue included", "author": "Christina Drill", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Selling an album now means selling your story directly to the fans\u2014every detail of heartbreak and intrigue included", "title": "The year pop music\u2019s soap opera became self-aware: How Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber wrote their comebacks", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/26/the_year_pop_musics_soap_opera_became_self_aware_how_selena_gomez_and_justin_bieber_wrote_their_comebacks/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/bieber_gomez.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Selling an album now means selling your story directly to the fans\u2014every detail of heartbreak and intrigue included", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/bieber_gomez.jpg", "title": "The year pop music\u2019s soap opera became self-aware: How Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber wrote their comebacks", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The year pop music\u2019s soap opera became self-aware: How Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber wrote their comebacks", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Beyonce, Instagram, Justin Bieber, kourtney kardashian, Meek Mill, Music, Nicki Minaj, pop music, selena gomez, Social Media, Twitter", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In the promotional interviews for their albums, both Selena and Justin openly acknowledged their relationship with one another.\nJustin and Selena were rumored to have started dating under contract, but regardless of the couple\u2019s origins, the two dated publically on and off for five years.\nBut Justin himself did not publicly confirm this until 2011, nine years after the record was released.\nSelena\u2019s comeback, also signaling the beginning of her contract with new label Interscope, was framed as more of a restart.\nBeyonc\u00e9 went public with her relationship with Jay Z as part of the strategy to launch her solo career in \u201903."}
