(AP) \u2014 California\u2019s inspector general gave a failing grade to medical care at a fourth prison Monday as the state tries to regain responsibility for health treatment after a decade of federal control.\n\nValley State Prison in Chowchilla received a failing grade in nine of the 14 benchmarks used by inspectors. Medical records often were missing, misfiled, incomplete or illegible. Medicine often was not provided as needed. Essential supplies and basic equipment were missing from many examination rooms.\n\nProblems included a failure to provide inmates with follow-up care after initial appointments. Some appointments were delayed for months, while others never occurred, inspectors found. Nurses repeatedly failed to carry out doctors\u2019 orders, to identify and act on patients\u2019 medical problems, or to recognize those with urgent needs.\n\nIn one case, a patient who went untreated for low blood sodium for three weeks had a seizure that required life-support measures and sent him to an intensive care unit at an outside hospital.\n\n\u201cPoor care resulted in bad or potentially really bad outcomes,\u201d said Steven Fama, an attorney with the Berkeley-based Prison Law Office that represents ill inmates.\n\nThe medium-security prison houses nearly 3,400 inmates about 40 miles northwest of Fresno.\n\nJoyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the federal receiver who runs the prison health care system, said officials are fixing the problems.\n\nThe inspector general previously found that prisons in Delano, Susanville and Vacaville are providing inadequate care.\n\nSeven other prisons have received passing grades, and one prison, in Folsom, has been returned to state control.\n\nU.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson said last year that the state must successfully operate all 34 adult prisons for a year before he considers ending a long-running class action lawsuit.\n\nHenderson seized control a decade ago after he found that conditions were so poor that an average of an inmate a week was dying of medical malpractice or neglect.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The failing grade harms California's efforts to regain responsibility for health treatment after a decade of federal control.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Another California Prison Fails Health Review\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/02\\/22\\/chowchilla-another-california-prison-fails-health-review\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-02-22 17:13:11\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-02-22 17:13:11\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":151811,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"News\",\"Prison Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/02\\/8419390651_547d9665ac_o.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The failing grade harms California's efforts to regain responsibility for health treatment after a decade of federal control.", "title": "Another California Prison Fails Health Review", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/02/22/chowchilla-another-california-prison-fails-health-review/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/02/8419390651_547d9665ac_o.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "news,prison health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Valley State Prison in Chowchilla received a failing grade in nine of the 14 benchmarks used by inspectors.\nJoyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the federal receiver who runs the prison health care system, said officials are fixing the problems.\nSeven other prisons have received passing grades, and one prison, in Folsom, has been returned to state control.\nSACRAMENTO, Calif.
