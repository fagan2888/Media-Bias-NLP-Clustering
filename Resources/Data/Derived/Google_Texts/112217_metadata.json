The resolution, which Boehner discussed in a closed Republican meeting Tuesday, could authorize the House to take several different forms of legal action against the administration, but no final course of action has been decided. For example, the resolution could authorize the House to join a lawsuit that states have filed against President Barack Obama over the executive action. \u201cWe are finalizing a plan to authorize litigation on this issue \u2014 one we believe gives us the best chance of success,\u201d Boehner said in the meeting.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi blistered Boehner for not governing, \u201cRepublicans control both houses of Congress, but Speaker Boehner still doesn\u2019t have the wherewithal to legislate. House Republicans\u2019 latest lawsuit against the President is an embarrassing admission of failure. Republicans\u2019 radical anti-immigrant legislation is dead on arrival. Once again, House Republicans are crawling to the courts to relieve them of their responsibility to govern. Republicans should stop wasting millions of taxpayer dollars suing the President, and start showing some seriousness for the security of the American people.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans announced yesterday that they were delaying a vote on their border security bill because of the blizzard, but the real reason for the delay is that Speaker Boehner doesn\u2019t have the votes to pass the bill. Boehner has refused to govern most of the time, but when he has tried to pass legislation, he often doesn\u2019t have the votes to pass his own bills.\n\nJohn Boehner can\u2019t govern, so he is going to sue President Obama for using his executive powers. Speaker Boehner\u2019s Obamacare lawsuit is costing taxpayers $500/hour in attorney fees. Instead of passing legislation, Speaker Boehner\u2019s answer to everything is to abuse the court system by filing frivolous lawsuits against President Obama.\n\nThe lawsuit strategy was born out of Republican desperation, ineptitude, and failure. Speaker Boehner\u2019s lawsuits are an attempt to distract the country from the fact no matter how big of a majority Boehner has in the House, Republicans remain unfit to govern.", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Boehner told House Republicans that he was finishing plans that will waste millions more taxpayer dollars on a lawsuit against President Obama's immigration executive actions.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "John Boehner told House Republicans that he was finishing plans that will waste millions more taxpayer dollars on a lawsuit against President Obama's immigration executive actions.", "title": "Boehner To Waste Millions More Taxpayer Dollars By Launching Second Lawsuit Against Obama", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/01/27/passing-immigration-bill-boehner-plans-sue-obama-acting-president.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/obama-boehner.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-27T14:36:23+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-01-27T14:33:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-27T14:36:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "John Boehner told House Republicans that he was finishing plans that will waste millions more taxpayer dollars on a lawsuit against President Obama\u2019s immigration executive actions.\nInstead of passing legislation, Speaker Boehner\u2019s answer to everything is to abuse the court system by filing frivolous lawsuits against President Obama.\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi blistered Boehner for not governing, \u201cRepublicans control both houses of Congress, but Speaker Boehner still doesn\u2019t have the wherewithal to legislate.\nSpeaker Boehner\u2019s Obamacare lawsuit is costing taxpayers $500/hour in attorney fees.\nHouse Republicans\u2019 latest lawsuit against the President is an embarrassing admission of failure."}
