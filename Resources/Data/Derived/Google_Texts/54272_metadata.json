Even if those were valid deductions in prior years, they might not be this year if Congress fails to extend them.\n\n\u201cYou want to be aware when you sit down to do your 2015 tax projection for the end of the year that you\u2019re not taking deductions for them at this point because they aren\u2019t valid deductions,\u201d said Rosica. \u201cHopefully that will change by the end of the year, but we don\u2019t really know. I think the first step right now is to sit down and take out last year\u2019s tax return for 2014 and start to sketch out, maybe on a copy of that, what you have thus far for 2015 and see if things are different. If you think you might be in alternative minimum tax this year, if you were last year and you have similar income and expense items, there\u2019s a good chance you will be again, or if something has changed in our life, that you take that into account as to what type of tax bracket you\u2019ll be in.\u201d\n\nClients should understand their tax bracket. \u201cHave you reached the upper tax brackets? Maybe you\u2019re typically in a higher tax bracket, but based on some stock losses you may have this year, that\u2019s perhaps kept you down in a lower bracket,\u201d said Rosica.\n\nHe advises looking at the big picture. \u201cStart with a projection of what 2015 is going to look like and then assess what actions you should take, whether accelerating income into this year or deferring income into next year is a good strategy for you,\u201d he said. \u201cThen move on to deductions. Are you going to get the benefit of deductions this year, things like charitable deductions and real estate taxes? Many of those are within your control as to when you\u2019re going to incur those kinds of things, whether you make estimated state income tax payments at the end of the year, or wait until the beginning of next year. Identifying what kind of benefit you get out of those is a great thing to be doing over the next few weeks to determine where you think you\u2019re going to end up.\u201d\n\nThe end of the year is a good time for high net worth clients to decide what to do about estate planning. \u201cYou want to use your annual gift exclusion, where you're eligible to give up to $14,000 a year to as many people as you choose,\u201d said Rosica. \u201cIt expires every year if you don't use it by December 31. Make sure you've thought through that and made the appropriate gifts that you want to make during the year. It\u2019s also a good time to look to see what lifetime exclusion you have left. If you've done some gifting that might eat into it, look at what that is, and if you want to do some additional gifting or not. Then also take into account that there are potentially some tax regulations that may come out to deal with taking discounts on certain types of assets that are gifted. It\u2019s important to understand that and see how it fits into the potential planning that you may be doing around year-end.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act will be an important part of tax planning for some taxpayers. \u201cWith the Affordable Care Act comes the tax penalty if you don\u2019t have health insurance, and that\u2019s higher this year than it was last year,\u201d said Rosica. \u201cIf you were subject to that penalty because you didn\u2019t get health insurance, then you\u2019re going to have a higher penalty if you still haven\u2019t done it. I\u2019d be focused on that if you\u2019re in that situation.\u201d\n\nAnother issue associated with the Affordable Care Act is the Net Investment Income Tax, a 3.8 percent tax on investment-type income, such as interest, dividends and capital gains \u201cIf your income has gone up, in 2015 you may enter the bracket that includes the Net Investment Income Tax,\u201d said Rosica. \u201cPerhaps you haven\u2019t been in that before, so keep your eyes out for any changes from prior years and start to think through what additional taxes might affect you.\u201d\n\nHe advises looking back over any major changes that might have occurred in a client's life over the course of the year. \u201cReflect back on what\u2019s happened throughout 2015, whether you\u2019ve changed jobs or gotten married or divorced, or had any kind of life event change,\u201d said Rosica. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to start thinking about what those events, are as well as what impact they have on your overall tax situation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.accountingtoday.com/blogs/debits-credits/news/year-end-tax-planning-for-next-tax-season-76364-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.accountingtoday.com/media/ui/webcpa-socialshare-logo.png", "site_name": "Debits & Credits", "title": "Year-End Tax Planning for Next Tax Season"}, "google-site-verification": "j5muKh-DQfTuFwnYFV7lcz1jyUXULO2A4sj9MiXsHc4", "news_keywords": "year end tax planning, affordable care act, aca, tax brackets, tax extenders, greg rosica, ernst young, ey", "description": "It s never too late in the year for you and your clients to get ready for next tax season.", "title": "Year-End Tax Planning for Next Tax Season"}, "article_summary": "Greg Rosica, a tax partner at Ernst & Young and a contributing author to the EY Tax Guide, has some useful advice for year-end tax planning.\nIt\u2019s never too late in the year for you and your clients to get ready for next tax season.\n\u201cIf you were subject to that penalty because you didn\u2019t get health insurance, then you\u2019re going to have a higher penalty if you still haven\u2019t done it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to start thinking about what those events, are as well as what impact they have on your overall tax situation.\u201d\nIt\u2019s important to understand that and see how it fits into the potential planning that you may be doing around year-end.\u201dThe Affordable Care Act will be an important part of tax planning for some taxpayers."}
