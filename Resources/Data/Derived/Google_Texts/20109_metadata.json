Ticks and deer flies can also spread the bacteria. Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, chest pain and coughing.\n\nIf tularemia is caused by the bite of an infected insect or from bacteria entering a cut or scratch, it usually causes a skin ulcer and swollen glands, according to the advisory. Eating or drinking food or water containing the bacteria may produce a throat infection, stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting.\n\nTularemia can be treated with antibiotics and anyone with the symptoms should get medical attention as soon as possible.\n\nDogs and cats also get tularemia by eating infected rabbits or other rodents and through tick and deer fly bites.\n\nIf a dead animal must be moved, people should avoid direct contact with it. They should put on a repellent to protect themselves from its fleas or ticks. They can use a shovel to scoop it up, put it in a plastic bag and throw it in an outdoor trash can.\n\nPeople can avoid infection by using insect repellent containing DEET when outdoors, the advisory says.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wild rabbit in Fort Collins infected with tularemia", "title": "Wild rabbit in Fort Collins infected with tularemia", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/04/wild-rabbit-in-fort-collins-infected-with-tularemia/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-04T08:04:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-04T08:04:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3bf4\"", "article_summary": "Dogs and cats also get tularemia by eating infected rabbits or other rodents and through tick and deer fly bites.\nThe bacteria causing tularemia may be found in rabbits, rodents and hares, according to the advisory sent late Friday.\nA \u201cdie-off\u201d of rabbits in southeast Fort Collins has triggered a health warning that tularemia bacteria found in one of the rabbits could make people and pets sick, authorities say.\nPeople can be infected if they handle sick or dead animals infected with the disease.\nTularemia can be treated with antibiotics and anyone with the symptoms should get medical attention as soon as possible."}
