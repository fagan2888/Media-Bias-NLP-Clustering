But in an interview with NBC\u2019s Richard Engel on Meet the Press, Kurdish Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani seemed to suggest that those words haven\u2019t been backed up with deeds.\n\nRelated: The Perverted, Powerful Logic Behind ISIS\u2019s Burned Pilot\n\nThe U.S. has mounted air strikes that helped prevent further ISIS advances, and has supplied the Kurds and Iraqis with weapons, but in terms of actually rolling back the radical group, much less has been done.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama has said there\u2019s a strategy in place to degrade and defeat ISIS,\u201d said Engel. \u201cDo you believe him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s the President of the United States,\u201d Barzani began diplomatically. \u201cWhen he \u2013 \u201c\n\n\u201cBut do you believe there is a strategy in place that will do that?\u201d Engel interrupted.\n\n\u201cI hope there is,\u201d Barzani said slowly, \u201cbut we need that strategy to be translated into action.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Muted Response to the ISIS and Ukraine Crises\n\nEngle asked whether the Kurds had seen any sign of such a plan.\n\n\u201cSo far we have not seen any serious action that can quickly defeat ISIS,\u201d said Barzani.\n\nCan it work over the long term?\n\n\u201cIt can, it can. But once again, I mean we are sacrificing more lives and putting many innocent lives at risk by allowing ISIS to survive for a longer period.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry, who also appeared on the program, said, \u201cI understand [Prime Minister] Barzani\u2019s impatience. I fully understand it. The peshmerga have been particularly brave and courageous. We have supplied them with enormous amount of ammunition, weapons and other things. And others are supplying them, our allies.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Three hidden Messages Behind ISIS\u2019s Bloody Rampages\n\nHowever, he defended the administration\u2019s decision to move deliberately when it comes to pushing back on the territorial gains ISIS has made.\n\n\u201cWe have said consistently that this is going to take a certain amount of time,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cNow why? Is that because we want it to take a certain amount of time? No. The fact is that the Iraqi army itself needs to be retrained and stood up. There have to be ground troops involved in order to win this victory\u2026they are going to be Iraqi and that\u2019s the way the Iraqis want it.\u201d\n\nKerry said the Iraqi army is not yet ready to confront ISIS and warned that it would be \u201ca great mistake\u201d to throw them into the fight before they are prepared.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are challenging the administration over its activities in the Middle East. House Homeland Security Committee Chair Michael McCaul (R-TX) on Sunday criticized the Obama administration for pursuing only a \u201cpolicy of containment.\u201d\n\nRelated: Jordan\u2019s Revenge and the Arab World\u2019s ISIS Awakening\n\nIn a rare moment of bipartisan unity on Sunday, Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Tim Kaine (D-VA) agreed that the administration should avoid sending U.S. troops to the region in significant numbers, despite the fact that one prominent Republican, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, has called for sending up to 10,000 U.S. soldiers.\n\nIf nothing else, one enemy of ISIS rededicated itself to the group\u2019s destruction with more determination this week. After the terror group released a video of a captured Jordanian fighter pilot being burned alive, an infuriated King Abdullah stepped up air strikes dramatically.\n\nU.S. Special Envoy Gen. John Allen, the retired Marine Corps General who acts as U.S. liaison to the other nations battling ISIS said that the killing of the Jordanian pilot had backfired badly on ISIS, adding that it \u201cgalvanized and unified the coalition.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to divulge our plans, but it is not just about increased air campaign or air sorties. It is everything we have. This is our fight,\u201d said Nasser Judeh, the Jordanian foreign minister. \u201cAnd if there was any shred of doubt that these people are evil I think this horrific video was evidence enough.\u201d\n\nRelated: ISIS Outrage Dominates Ash Carter\u2019s Senate Hearing\n\nHowever, even the Jordanians are hesitant about introducing ground troops into the conflict.\n\n\u201cAt this point, coalition members are not speaking about boots on the ground,\u201d said government spokesman Mohammed Al-Momani. \u201cHaving said that, this is a war. His Majesty described it at one point as a third world war. If circumstances change we will discuss it at that point. At this point in time no one is talking about boots on the ground.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The leader of a key U.S.", "title": "Kurdish Leader Doubts Obama Has an ISIS Plan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/08/Kurdish-Leader-Doubts-Obama-Has-ISIS-Plan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06162014_Baghdad_Volunteer_Iraqis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/08/Kurdish-Leader-Doubts-Obama-Has-ISIS-Plan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06162014_Baghdad_Volunteer_Iraqis.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The leader of a key U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbef7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPresident Obama has said there\u2019s a strategy in place to degrade and defeat ISIS,\u201d said Engel.\nU.S. leaders frequently cite the bravery and military prowess of the Kurdish peshmerga fighters who have been battling ISIS in northern Iraq.\n\u201cSo far we have not seen any serious action that can quickly defeat ISIS,\u201d said Barzani.\nIf nothing else, one enemy of ISIS rededicated itself to the group\u2019s destruction with more determination this week.\nAt this point in time no one is talking about boots on the ground.\u201dTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:"}
