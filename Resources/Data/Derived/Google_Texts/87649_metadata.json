Currently, four petitions are before the Supreme Court asking for final resolution of the issue by June 2016.\n\n\u201cThe government keeps digging the hole deeper,\u201d said Ad\u00e8le Auxier Keim, legal counsel at the Becket Fund. \u201cJust last week the Supreme Court ordered HHS not to enforce the exact rules they finalized today. But the government still won\u2019t give up on its quest to force nuns and other religious employers to distribute contraceptives.\u201d\n\n\u201cEspecially after the Supreme Court\u2019s recent King v. Burwell decision allowed the government to expand its healthcare exchanges, there is no reason at all the government needs religious employers to help it distribute these products,\u201d she added.\n\nAs Keim observes, the Obama administration has already told thousands of businesses they need not comply with the HHS mandate at all.\n\n\u201cSo why is it continuing to go out of its way to force religious objectors, from nuns to business owners, to do something it is more than capable of doing itself?\u201d she asks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration has been handed \u201cmultiple losses in contraceptive mandate cases at the Supreme Court.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The Obama administration has been handed \u201cmultiple losses in contraceptive mandate cases at the Supreme Court.\"", "title": "Obama Administration Defies Supreme Court, Issues Final Contraceptive Mandate Rule - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/RU-486-abortion-pill-afp.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/10/obama-administration-defies-supreme-court-issues-final-contraceptive-mandate-rule/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration has been handed \u201cmultiple losses in contraceptive mandate cases at the Supreme Court.\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/RU-486-abortion-pill-afp.jpg", "title": "Obama Administration Defies Supreme Court, Issues Final Contraceptive Mandate Rule - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, contraceptives, HHS mandate, Hobby Lobby, Little Sisters of the Poor, Obama administration, U.S. Supreme Court, Wheaton College,Big Government, Faith, Obamacare,contraceptive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Wheaton College", "published_time": "2015-07-10T16:47:34-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Faith,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Currently, four petitions are before the Supreme Court asking for final resolution of the issue by June 2016.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLast week, the Supreme Court ordered the Obama administration not to enforce the contraceptive mandate against Catholic organizations from Pennsylvania, making this case the government\u2019s sixth loss in a row at the Supreme Court.\n\u201cJust last week the Supreme Court ordered HHS not to enforce the exact rules they finalized today.\nAs Keim observes, the Obama administration has already told thousands of businesses they need not comply with the HHS mandate at all.\nAs a news release at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty states, the Obama administration has been handed \u201cmultiple losses in contraceptive mandate cases at the Supreme Court,\u201d including the Hobby Lobby decision, and cases involving the Little Sisters of the Poor and Wheaton College."}
