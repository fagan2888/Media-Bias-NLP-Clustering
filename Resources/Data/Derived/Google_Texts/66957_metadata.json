(AP) \u2014 Bridges get a lot of attention when they fail, but scientists are working to eliminate what they say can be an even greater scourge, because of their sheer numbers and their effect on wildlife: culverts.\n\nThese passages that carry smaller streams under roads and driveways number in the thousands across the East, and their importance came into sharp focus during storms Irene and Sandy in the past few years, when floodwaters washed many of them out and cut off access for days or weeks.\n\n\u201cEvery culvert is a potential disaster for our roads,\u201d said Rose Paul of the Vermont Chapter of the Nature Conservancy, which has been working with the state to assess its culverts. \u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s a potential big problem for fish and other aquatic life. So we need culverts, but we need them to be well designed.\u201d\n\nVermont, which has been assessing its culverts for about a decade, helped develop a program being put into place for 13 Eastern states that are contributing to a regional database of those road-stream crossings that will help policymakers decide which culverts should be replaced or upgraded first, said Rich Kirn, a biologist with the Department of Fish and Wildlife who has helped lead Vermont\u2019s efforts.\n\nThe crossings are being examined to determine if the culvert is big enough for the waterway it is carrying by looking at the width of the stream and the stream bank. Crews are also looking at how far the water falls when it comes out of the culvert.\n\nA short stretch of back road in the town of Duxbury provides an example of what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not.\n\nThe good: The bottom of a large culvert carrying the Crossett Brook is the same combination of rock, sand and gravel as the streambed, and there\u2019s no clear indication where it begins or ends.\n\nThe bad: In another culvert, the water from a smaller brook that empties into the Crossett falls about 3 feet from a round pipe that has scoured a deep pool in the brook.\n\nThe network standardizes uniform data collection for the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of culverts across the region. In addition to the six New England states, it includes Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and New York.", "article_metadata": {"description": "13 states catalog culverts to protect fish, mitigate floods", "title": "13 states catalog culverts to protect fish, mitigate floods", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "13 states catalog culverts to protect fish, mitigate floods", "title": "13 states catalog culverts to protect fish, mitigate floods", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/20/13_states_catalog_culverts_to_protect_fish_mitigate_floods/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/cataloging-culverts.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "13 states catalog culverts to protect fish, mitigate floods", "title": "13 states catalog culverts to protect fish, mitigate floods", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/cataloging-culverts.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Wilson Ring", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In addition to the six New England states, it includes Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and New York.\nThe network standardizes uniform data collection for the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of culverts across the region.\nA short stretch of back road in the town of Duxbury provides an example of what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not.\nCrews are also looking at how far the water falls when it comes out of the culvert.\n\u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s a potential big problem for fish and other aquatic life."}
