Virginia Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam is the subject of nationwide condemnation today for refusing to shake hands with his pro-life black conservative Republican opponent, E.W. Jackson. Northam was caught on camera refusing to shake Jackson’s hand after supporting Obamacare and attacking conservative Christian voters.

As a pro-life, conservative African-American, Jackson has been pegged with the typical “Uncle Tom” attacks throughout the campaign from liberals who claim he is selling out his ethnicity by taking principled conservative stances and opposing abortion.

The incident comes after Jackson found that one of his campaign signs in Virginia’s Loudoun County had vandals smearing the sign with white paint.

Brietbart News has more and a video (below at the 6:30 mark) of what happened.

Virginia’s top Democratic candidates Terry McAuliffe (running for governor) and Northam have portrayed themselves as pragmatic centrists who are happy to reach across the aisle. But this video shows Northam won’t even reach across his chair. After a lively debate, at 6:30 in the video, Jackson—the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor—attempts to shake hands with Northam, who will not shake it and doesn’t even look Jackson in the eye. At first, a viewer might give Northam the benefit of the doubt that somehow he doesn’t see the extended hand. But Jackson dispels that doubt by taking his outstretched hand to tap Northam on the arm and then re-extends his hand almost into Northam’s lap. Northam still refuses to take it.
