Police say Kayson Shelton climbed up on a large, heavy dolphin statue, causing it to tip over on him, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. His 6-year-old sister tried to stop the fall, but the bronze statue was too heavy. At first, the boy did not appear seriously hurt, but he had sustained serious internal injuries and was pronounced dead in San Francisco General Hospital four hours after the incident.\n\nPolice investigating his death believe the dolphin was on the wrong side of a blue line in place to keep the busy sidewalks clear. Officers \"had asked this business to move their dolphins back across on the other side of the blue line because of the high volume of pedestrian traffic,\" a police spokesman tells CBS5. Kayson's family has now returned to Utah. \"The last words he spoke in this life were 'I love you,'\" the family says on a website set up to help them with funeral expenses. \"Such a beautiful and loving child, and while we are greatly comforted in the knowledge that families are forever, we will dearly miss his smiling face until then.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "Boy, 2, Dies in Freak Accident at Fisherman's Wharf", "image": "http://img1-azcdn.newser.com/image/981726-0-20140610054244.jpeg?width=300&height=300", "description": "He was crushed by falling dolphin statue"}, "description": "A Utah family's visit to San Francisco ended in horror when their 2-year-old son died after a freak accident outside a Fisherman's Wharf antique store.
