Beth McLacklan, a yoga instructor and owner of Ebb and Flow Wellness in Onset, brought a group of eight brave souls Friday evening (another class went out at 9 a.m.) for what was most of the participants\u2019 first time doing yoga on water.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little nervous,\u201d said Stephanie White of Bourne prior to the class, which she took along with her son Shaun.\n\nWhite said they had tried stand-up paddleboarding, one of the fastest-growing outdoor activities in the country of late, before and had enjoyed it. Though she was a little anxious at first, she got right on the board and seemed to do well with the yoga, especially for a first-timer.\n\nTo perform the balancing-act that is SUP yoga, each rider was equipped with an oversized surfboard, a paddle, and an improvised anchor tethered to the end of the board to help keep it in place while its rider got into yoga-mode.\n\nOnce the her students were settled, McLacklan led them through a one-and-a-half hour yoga class, consisting of breathing exercises, poses such as \"downward dog,\" \"dolphin,\"\"Warrior I,\" \"Warrior II,\" and others, all while attempting to balance on a board.\n\n\u201cI enjoyed it,\u201d said Jen Churchill of New Hampshire, who summers in Onset.\n\nChurchill, who is six-months pregnant, also teaches yoga at Ebb and Flow, which just recently added yoga to the mainly skin care and massage-focused business.\n\nShe thought she'd be a little more tentative to try some of the more difficult moves on a board, but after getting her balance down, that wasn't the case.\n\n\u201cI thought there would be some things I\u2019d shy away from being on a board. It\u2019s great when you find your balance,\u201d she said following the class.\n\nMcLacklan said that being on the board takes a lot of people out of their comfort zones. But if they can get over the fear of falling of the board (which they often do), they\u2019re able to relax, which is one of the general goals of yoga.\n\n\u201cOnce you get tense, it\u2019s not easy to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cBalancing on a board is much more difficult than being in a studio.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was wonderful,\u201d said White following her time on the water.\n\nFor those interested in trying SUP yoga with Ebb and Flow, McLacklan said she\u2019d probably be offering more classes in the near future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of interest of late,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Town", "google-site-verification": "Lxh-TQqnfjqDP3kBHi9EWBzFlV8uaDhicg3nJfqF3Jc", "og": {"url": "http://wareham-ma.villagesoup.com/p/1217679", "image": "http://wareham-ma.villagesoup.com/media/Common/18/D4/1234094/t600-warrior1.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Yoga with a twist: Yogis bring class to the water - By Nick Walecka"}, "description": "Yoga requires focus, balance, patience, strength, flexibility and a whole lot more.\nFor a yoga novice, it can be difficult to get used to at first, but with a little practice, the body becomes ...", "robots": "NOARCHIVE"}, "article_summary": "For those interested in trying SUP yoga with Ebb and Flow, McLacklan said she\u2019d probably be offering more classes in the near future.\nChurchill, who is six-months pregnant, also teaches yoga at Ebb and Flow, which just recently added yoga to the mainly skin care and massage-focused business.\n\u201cBalancing on a board is much more difficult than being in a studio.\u201d\u201cIt was wonderful,\u201d said White following her time on the water.\nNow imagine doing it on a stand-up paddleboard, also known as a SUP, out on the water.\n\u201cI\u2019m a little nervous,\u201d said Stephanie White of Bourne prior to the class, which she took along with her son Shaun."}
