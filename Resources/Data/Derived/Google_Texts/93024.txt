Lyon County, IA

A $40,000 grant made up of gambling money in Iowa is allowing a local sheriff's department to go hi-tech in all of its patrol cars.

The Lyons County Sheriff's department had cameras installed in three vehicles already with the goal of adding one camera per year. Thanks to the Riverboat Foundation grant, it was able to install cameras in the remaining seven vehicles.

The camera is installed on the window of the car, with the monitor built inside the rear-view mirror. It starts recording either manually, if the sirens are turned on, or if the car suddenly accelerates, brakes, or swerves. The new cameras have been in the vehicles for about a month. Sheriff Stewart Vander Stoep says they are still working out the bugs, but once they get it worked out, the department will benefit from the new technology.

“Now we can see exactly what happens at those stops. Sometimes we had people accuse the officers of doing something or saying something that now we can look back at that video and say no that's not what happened,” Stoep said.

There is also a camera that records what happens inside the patrol car. That allows officers to see if they are doing everything correctly.

Coming up tonight on KELOLAND Weekend News, we hear how the grant will help the wallets of Lyon County Residents in the future.
