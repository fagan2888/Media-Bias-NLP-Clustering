But at least if you know this, you can be prepared to counter the snark with reason and find alternative ways to disseminate your message. If, however, this latest example of media bias is indicative of what we can expect until 2016, we\u2019re in for a long cycle.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard, the former chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard has thrown her hat in the ring to compete for the 2016 Republican nomination for President. Whether or not she\u2019s your pick, you have to admit that her story is uniquely compelling; she started out her career as a secretary and worked her way up to become the leader of one of the largest technology companies in the world. Only in America, right? She undoubtedly adds a diverse face and voice to the Party in this exciting contest.\n\nSo, when she launched her candidacy earlier this month, you might think that the driving narrative would focus on her background, positions, or plans for the country. Instead, she\u2019s been asked in every interview about a cyber squatter, who used her domain name (\u201ccarlyfiorna[dot]org\u201d) to bash her candidacy. As a fairly avid consumer of news, I have scarcely been able to find an article about her candidacy without a passing mention or lengthy feature about a guy who had a vendetta, ten bucks, and a GoDaddy account. Journalists are free to write what they want, but it\u2019s difficult to believe that a single voter will cast their ballot on the basis of whether or not someone claimed their domain name early. Fellow presidential candidate, Senator Rand Paul, reportedly had to pay over $100,000 to reclaim his domain name. Is that the price you pay for avoiding (and sparing the rest of us from) these moronic process stories?\n\nIt\u2019s simply clutter \u2013 stories for a breathless Washington to consume while we wait the 500+ days until Election Day. And where there\u2019s clutter, we tend to miss what\u2019s important. Earlier this year, presumptive Democratic nominee and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted that she not only built a private email system in her home so as to obfuscate public record laws, but also erased the server after self-selecting what emails the public should be able to see. We then learned that the former Secretary and former President Bill Clinton have been engaged in a number of financial transactions with foreign governments that coincide with key decisions Secretary Clinton made in her official capacity. They say that where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire. Unsurprisingly, where the Clintons are involved, there\u2019s also arson.\n\nBut where is the outrage over this blatant and arrogant attempt to deceive the public? Where is the demand for greater media availability from Candidate Clinton to answer these important questions? Over the past week, Carly Fiorina has answered over 200 questions from the media, whereas former Secretary Clinton has answered a total of seven questions since April 12th. It seems as though journalists are content to quote from vanilla statements and Tweets released by the Clinton campaign and report based on Chipotle surveillance footage, while saving their most exacting scrutiny for Republican candidates. This is an important election with serious consequences; let\u2019s hold all of the candidates to higher standards. And more importantly, let\u2019s make sure our standards are measuring the right things.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It is well documented how the media tend to be more critical of conservative candidates than their liberal counterparts..05/26/2016 19:26:47PM EST.", "author": "Alex Smith", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "It is well documented how the media tend to be more critical of conservative candidates than their liberal counterparts.", "title": "Alex Smith - A Tale of Two Presidential Candidates", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/alexsmith/2015/05/12/a-tale-of-two-presidential-candidates-n1997969", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/130/2015-05-10T171938Z_1_LYNXMPEB490DE_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-FIORINA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "It is well documented how the media tend to be more critical of conservative candidates than their liberal counterparts.", "title": "Alex Smith - A Tale of Two Presidential Candidates", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/alexsmith/2015/05/12/a-tale-of-two-presidential-candidates-n1997969", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/130/2015-05-10T171938Z_1_LYNXMPEB490DE_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-FIORINA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "A Tale of Two Presidential Candidates, Alex Smith, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "It is well documented how the media tend to be more critical of conservative candidates than their liberal counterparts.\nThis is an important election with serious consequences; let\u2019s hold all of the candidates to higher standards.\nWhere is the demand for greater media availability from Candidate Clinton to answer these important questions?\nFellow presidential candidate, Senator Rand Paul, reportedly had to pay over $100,000 to reclaim his domain name.\nWe then learned that the former Secretary and former President Bill Clinton have been engaged in a number of financial transactions with foreign governments that coincide with key decisions Secretary Clinton made in her official capacity."}
