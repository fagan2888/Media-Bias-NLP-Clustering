Its finding? The federal budget deficit continues to tumble, falling to $486 billion in fiscal 2014 after reaching a high of $1.4 trillion during the financial crisis in fiscal 2009.\n\nSo why weren\u2019t Alan Simpson, Erskine Bowles, and Peter Peterson running victory laps down the National Mall? That\u2019s essentially the question economist Paul Krugman sets out to answer in his New York Times column today.\n\nDeficit scolds like Simpson are reluctantly admitting that the hysterical predictions of imminent economic crisis they made a few years ago haven\u2019t come true, but the deficit-obsessed continue to insist that we\u2019re headed for a reckoning sooner or later. As Krugman points out, however, the long-run fiscal picture is nowhere near as dire as the deficit scolds have long envisioned. Health care costs, long seized upon by deficit hawks, are coming under control, for instance \u2014 thanks in large part to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd yet, Krugman observes, \u201cfiscal hysteria\u201d persists. That\u2019s because for deficit scolds, a declining deficit is bad for business. In order to push their ultimate agenda of fiscal austerity and social insurance cuts, he argues, deficit hawks need the specter of fiscal catastrophe looming over the nation. Given the ideological proclivities of the deficit alarmist industry\u2019s leading backers, it\u2019s hard not to find Krugman\u2019s take on what really motivates their manufactured panic persuasive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal deficit continues to decline, so why aren't deficit hawks happy?", "title": "Paul Krugman: Why deficit scolds actually love deficits", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The federal deficit continues to decline, so why aren't deficit hawks happy?", "title": "Paul Krugman: Why deficit scolds actually love deficits", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/10/paul_krugman_why_deficit_scolds_actually_love_deficits/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/paul_krugman.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The federal deficit continues to decline, so why aren't deficit hawks happy?", "title": "Paul Krugman: Why deficit scolds actually love deficits", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/paul_krugman.jpg", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Brinker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Alan Simpson, Congressional Budget Office, deficit hawks, Economics, Erskine Bowles, federal budget, Federal Deficit, Medicare, Paul Krugman, Peter Peterson, Simpson-Bowles, Social Security", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f84\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s because for deficit scolds, a declining deficit is bad for business.\nAs Krugman points out, however, the long-run fiscal picture is nowhere near as dire as the deficit scolds have long envisioned.\nThe federal budget deficit continues to tumble, falling to $486 billion in fiscal 2014 after reaching a high of $1.4 trillion during the financial crisis in fiscal 2009.\nHealth care costs, long seized upon by deficit hawks, are coming under control, for instance \u2014 thanks in large part to the Affordable Care Act.\nTopics: Affordable Care Act, Alan Simpson, Congressional Budget Office, deficit hawks, Economics, Erskine Bowles, federal budget, Federal Deficit, Medicare, Paul Krugman, Peter Peterson, Simpson-Bowles, Social Security, Politics NewsThis Wednesday, the Congressional Budget Office released its last Monthly Budget Review for fiscal year 2014."}
