She has survived two kinds of breast cancer and she was a University of Colorado researcher in cancer prevention. She lost her job in 2009, and 18 months later, she lost her health insurance.\n\n\u201cAfter my coverage ran out I had to buy my own insurance,\u201d Tosher said. \u201cI absolutely fall into that pre-existing condition category. No one would insure me.\u201d\n\nTosher scrambled to find coverage and eventually succeeded with CoverColorado, a state-subsidized plan for what had come to be called the \u201cuninsurable.\u201d\n\nEven with governmental support, it\u2019s not cheap. Tosher currently pays a monthly premium of about $800.\n\nFor decades, health care reformers have placed priority on lowering costs and providing more coverage for people who need it, especially for people with pre-existing health conditions, who have been effectively frozen out of the private market, where the bottom-line considerations control service calculations.\n\nIndeed, in 2011, as Republicans made moves to defund the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the department of Health and Human Services reported that as many as half of the American population was either ineligible for health insurance or priced out due to pre-existing conditions.\n\nEven though she now has insurance, Tosher said she still avoids going to the doctor when she doesn\u2019t feel well, because the co-pay costs can be daunting on top of her monthly premium.\n\nShe also said she\u2019s far from the worst off.\n\n\u201cI know people who don\u2019t have insurance because they can\u2019t afford it. And they may have serious problems: gastrointestinal issues, lumps \u2014 I don\u2019t deal well with lumps. But they won\u2019t go to the doctor because they\u2019re afraid that if it\u2019s something serious they won\u2019t be able to feed their kids. These are people who might be able to afford a couple hundred a month on insurance, but not six hundred.\u201d\n\nTosher became aware of the Affordable Care Act or \u201cObamacare\u201d not just through the news but also through groups like the National Breast Cancer Coalition. She worked with the group during the drafting of the new law to try to win coverage for various forms of cancer treatment.\n\nWhen Obamacare passed, Tosher was thrilled.\n\n\u201cI knew it meant so much, not only for me personally, but also for an enormous number of people not just with cancer but other conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just acute issues like cancer, multiple sclerosis or muscular dystrophy, but much simpler things like arthritis or asthma that have caused people to be denied insurance.\u201d\n\nTosher also helped shape Connect for Health Colorado, the website where Coloradans will be able to shop insurance policies off the Obamacare exchange next month.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just have insurance and organizational people involved in what\u2019s going to be on those plans or how they\u2019re explained,\u201d Tosher said. \u201cThey also needed us folks who\u2019ll use it.\u201d\n\nTosher admits the signup process might be a little complicated, particularly for those who, like her, qualify for a federal premium subsidy; that is, anyone making below 400 percent of the poverty line, which is about $12,000 for an individual and $24,000 for a family of four.\n\nAdam Fox, the Director for strategic engagement at the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, said people looking for Obamacare coverage and applying for financial assistance will need to call the new exchange\u2019s customer service center, at least until early November.\n\nThose who aren\u2019t applying for the assistance, or who have the financial flexibility to take the subsidy at the end of the year with their tax returns, can enroll in policies online beginning in October.\n\nWith four days till the exchange website rollout, no one expects there won\u2019t be glitches. But organizers say the policy-purchasing process is designed to be as time consuming and as complicated as buying an airplane ticket online.\n\nColorado also won additional federal and local grant funding in order to provide \u201chealth coverage guides\u201d for the rollout. The guides will be real life human beings available to talk with consumers over the phone or even to meet in person to discuss insurance options on the exchange and to assist in enrollment.\n\nFox said the guides are crucial, particularly for Coloradans who have little to no experience with health insurance. Guides will also give on-the-ground assistance in communities where few people are plugged into digital life.\n\nTosher feels that she\u2019s part of a major group of Obamacare beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cIf my income stays at the same level it\u2019s been for the last two years, the subsidy will continue, which means I\u2019ll be able to actually afford my health insurance until I\u2019m eligible for Medicare. That\u2019s one of the most exciting things for me.\u201d\n\nIn October, Tosher won\u2019t just be choosing between CoverColorado and no coverage at all.\n\n\u201cPeople keep complaining that [the government] is \u2018taking away my choice,\u2019 but when I worked for a company, my employer made the choice,\u201d Tosher said. \u201cThey chose what provider and limited my options to either a [health maintenance organization or a preferred provider organization]. Maybe I could choose between two or three plans. Now, I have a choice between almost 200 plans.\u201d\n\nConnect for Health Colorado notes that so far \u201cTen carriers requested approval to provide about 150 health plans,\u201d on the exchange. When Tosher purchases one of those plans, she expects to cut her monthly premiums at least in half.\n\n\u201cTo me that just takes the lid right off the pressure cooker,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I can just cook.\u201d\n\n[ Image by Jamelle Bouie. ]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "DENVER -- Vicki Tosher, now 61, knows a lot about cancer.
