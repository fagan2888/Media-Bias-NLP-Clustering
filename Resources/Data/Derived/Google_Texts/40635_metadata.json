Many farmers looking for a quick buck launched ventures to fill the void, only to go under.\n\nMost who remain in business come from agricultural backgrounds and have eased into hops. The goal now seems to be slow-but-steady growth, even in areas where brewers are offering high-priced contracts or money to help start farms.\n\nPaul Graham, president of Central Waters Brewing Co. in Wisconsin, remembers when his phone rang daily with would-be growers. He partnered with four other brewers in 2009 to provide a handful of farmers with seed money. More than four years later, the cooperative has only about six acres of hops in production. The entire state\u2014known for its love of beer\u2014has about 50 acres.\n\n\u201cThe success that we\u2019ve seen is mostly with some experienced farmers who are kind of diversifying or who have experience on a farm for a long time,\u201d Graham said. \u201cA lot of the hobbyists who got into it right away, most of them are back out of it just because it\u2019s labor-intensive and you\u2019re not making much money.\u201d\n\nRandy Flores started a farm in western Colorado in 2008 but gave it up two years later. He had banked on a partner\u2019s real estate commissions to provide capital to buy processing equipment, and the money fell through during the recession.\n\nWith a limited market and falling prices for unprocessed hops, Flores didn\u2019t see the farm making it. The 54-year-old Denver resident now has a business buying and selling hops to smaller brewers.\n\nPeople were \u201cromanced\u201d into growing hops, Flores said, but \u201cit\u2019s a hell of a lot of work for just a little bit of money.\u201d\n\nIt costs about $10,000 to buy rootstock and set up the trellis system required to grow hops vines. Farmers erect 16- to 20-foot poles connected by cables, from which they run strings to the ground for the plants to climb up. The cone-like flowers that grow atop the vines give beer its unique, bitter taste.\n\nEquipment to pick, bale and dry hops costs tens of thousands of dollars more, putting the initial investment for a 10-acre farm at close to $250,000, said Ron Godin, a hops specialist with Colorado State University Extension.\n\nRandy Urness and his wife conducted a \u201cscavenger hunt\u201d with Craigslist and newspaper ads to find old telephone poles and secondhand cable to build trellises on their farm in Rosholt, Wis. They planted 700 rhizomes, or rootstocks, on 1.5 acres in 2010 and have gradually built up to about 2,100 plants on three acres.\n\nUrness said it will be years before his investment pays off, particularly since the plants take up to five years to reach full production.\n\n\u201cThe last year has been, by far, a net loss,\u201d said Urness, 47. \u201cHopefully, after another year or two, we\u2019ll be able to say, \u2018OK, what we\u2019ve put into it this year vs. what we\u2019ve gotten out of it, we have made some profit and been able to cover loans and things of that nature.\u201d\n\nHops can be used fresh, or wet, but they spoil rapidly\u2014the cones Graham buys are used within 24 hours of harvest. Most beer is made with hops that have been dried, crushed into a powder and formed into shelf-stable pellets that resemble rabbit food. One pound of dry hops is equivalent to four pounds of wet hops.\n\nMaking the jump from producing wet hops for single-batch beers to providing pellets for year-round brewing is the \u201cmajor hurdle\u201d most growers face, said Ryan Houghton, a 34-year-old software consultant from Portland, Maine, who has been building a hops farm with several partners.\n\nA pelletizer can cost as much as $250,000. Wisconsin has at least three, but states like Colorado have none.\n\nAC Golden Brewing Co., the Colorado-based craft arm of MillerCoors, has helped its 13 contract growers get around this problem by hauling dried cones to Washington state for processing before using them in its Colorado Native Lager. The brewer also pays $15 per pound for hops\u2014well over the market rate\u2014to help offset its farmers\u2019 startup costs.\n\nBut even with AC Golden\u2019s incentives and more than 100 other craft brewers eager to buy Colorado-grown hops, farmers have planted only about 75 acres there.\n\nIn New York, which has more than 140 craft breweries, farmers have planted about 150 acres and hope to increase to more than 250 by summer, said Steve Miller, a Cornell University Cooperative Extension hops specialist.\n\nAnother big challenge for those farmers is a lack of information.\n\nHops haven\u2019t been grown commercially outside the Pacific Northwest for more than 100 years, and knowledge of the plant died out in that time. Methods used to combat fungus, ward off pests and irrigate in arid parts of Washington state, with its 27,000 acres of hops, don\u2019t necessarily work in more humid climates, said Ryan Trzebiatowski, a 33-year-old engineer who has a small hops farm in Amherst, Wis.\n\nIn many cases, farmers don\u2019t even know how much they can grow per acre. Trzebiatowski harvested 3,000 wet pounds last year; his goal is 5,000. Some Western farms hit 10,000.\n\nBut one thing is clear\u2014there\u2019s a \u201csex appeal\u201d in hops that other crops don\u2019t have, Trzebiatowski said.\n\n\u201cPeople ask if I\u2019m going to continue doing this, and my answer is yes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fun project, it\u2019s not all consuming of my time, and it\u2019s a good conversation starter.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hops farming grows slowly despite brewers\u2019 demand", "title": "Hops farming grows slowly despite brewers\u2019 demand", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/11/hops-farming-grows-slowly-despite-brewers-demand/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-11T12:04:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-11T12:04:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc76b\"", "article_summary": "One pound of dry hops is equivalent to four pounds of wet hops.\nBut even with AC Golden\u2019s incentives and more than 100 other craft brewers eager to buy Colorado-grown hops, farmers have planted only about 75 acres there.\nThe 54-year-old Denver resident now has a business buying and selling hops to smaller brewers.\nMore than four years later, the cooperative has only about six acres of hops in production.\nHops prices ran high in 2008 after a drought and storm damage in Europe and a fire at a major warehouse in Washington state sparked fears of a shortage."}
