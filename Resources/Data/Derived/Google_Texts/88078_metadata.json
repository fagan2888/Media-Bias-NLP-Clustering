Still, the subject of growing estrangement between Christian belief and secular power needs attention in the presidential campaign.\n\nThe evangelical evening six Republican presidential contenders spent at cavernous Prestonwood Baptist Church, in the Dallas suburb of Plano, suggests that the campaign won\u2019t be given over entirely to emails, Benghazi, inequality issues and Donald Trump\u2019s hat size.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s religious component \u2014 the sincere, unstated part of it, not the element trumpeted at political rallies these days \u2014 is immense.\n\nIn trying to understand why and how, we shouldn\u2019t be sidetracked by Ted Cruz\u2019s claim the other night: \u201cReligious liberty is under threat today like it never has been in this nation.\u201d The threats, said my state\u2019s junior senator, \u201cgrow darker and darker.\u201d Well, I don\u2019t know that the government is yet buying up and breeding lions for use in the arena against opponents of Obamacare.\n\nThe problem one sees against the dark backdrop Cruz would show us is alarming in a way unconnected to physical danger: the official discomfiture of bakers, florists, and a county clerk or two for trying to maintain their commitment to marriage as the union of a man and a woman; the attempted federal coercion of a Catholic religious order, the Little Sisters of the Poor, for uncompromising opposition to birth control; the Orwellian \u201cmemory hole\u201d at the bottom of which lie recollections of a recent time when prayer in a public place didn\u2019t receive fierce looks from the constituted authorities.\n\nThere\u2019s been a philosophical shift in this country, from the religiousness taken for granted in the 1950s to today\u2019s secularism, which is present even in theoretically non-secular circles (e.g., liberal churches). This new philosophy embraces abortion, non-traditional marriage, and a more relaxed standard of morality than formerly, on the theory that what goes on in private homes is the business of who\u2019s doing business there. The theory is presently testing natural limits: Witness the outcry over rape at college parties. Still, we constantly learn (or seem to) that the religious viewpoint is just one viewpoint, deserving only a measure of the protection it once took for granted.\n\nWhen one opens one\u2019s eyes wide and looks around, the zeal of the Prestonwood Baptist audience crowd becomes more understandable.\n\nCruz\u2019s talk of threats to \u201creligious liberty\u201d \u2014 and Jeb Bush\u2019s call, at the same rally, for laws protecting \u201creligious conscience\u201d \u2014 do not come wholly amiss. However, they overlook the otherwise non-overlookable point, which isn\u2019t that the country could benefit from more laws; rather, that the law \u201cwritten on the heart,\u201d in St. Paul\u2019s phrase, the natural law of common understanding regarding duty and obligation and love, is the thing that needs major reinforcement from every perspective of life.\n\nRestored to its place at the center of human affairs, integrated with statutory law, and backed by religious teaching, the natural law alone stands between civilization and barbarism, between \u2014 if you put it in a way our time can easily grasp \u2014 human dignity and respect versus semi-drunken rape in a frat house. Suppress the law written on the heart, after the manner of modern times, and what follows is the disorder that Power tries to control through edicts and troop movements.\n\nIn the matter of human freedom, religion has very much the upper hand over moral anarchy. Anarchy invites crackdown: a victor\u2019s peace, a long winter of suppression and suffering. Religion looks to the fulfillment of human purposes long observed to exceed the sensual and highly temporary ends we often see as irresistible.\n\nThe Prestonwood Baptist shindig starring Ted Cruz can\u2019t hurt the quest for moral recovery. But closer attention to the underpinnings of the crusade could help far more. \u201cPersecuted\u201d Christians could ask: Why more laws? Haven\u2019t we got right now, awaiting recovery, all the laws we need?\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2015 CREATORS.COM", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Opposition to Christian cultural and political arguments doesn\u2019t rise quite to the level of persecution \u2014 a point that eludes various Christians (including Ted Cruz, but more on him in a minute).\nThe Prestonwood Baptist shindig starring Ted Cruz can\u2019t hurt the quest for moral recovery.\nWhen one opens one\u2019s eyes wide and looks around, the zeal of the Prestonwood Baptist audience crowd becomes more understandable.\nThe campaign\u2019s religious component \u2014 the sincere, unstated part of it, not the element trumpeted at political rallies these days \u2014 is immense.\nThe evangelical evening six Republican presidential contenders spent at cavernous Prestonwood Baptist Church, in the Dallas suburb of Plano, suggests that the campaign won\u2019t be given over entirely to emails, Benghazi, inequality issues and Donald Trump\u2019s hat size."}
