He may not have had enough time to erase the big lead that Hillary Clinton enjoys with the state\u2019s African-Americans, but he\u2019s far from hopeless on that front.\n\nAllen University, where the prayer breakfast took place, is a small, historically black school, where every student gets at least some need-based financial aid. A few professors were pretty much the only white people in the audience, and Sanders was the only white person on stage.\n\nSanders, who was brought up Jewish, has said he\u2019s not \u201cparticularly religious,\u201d but the people next to him were ministers, and when one asked the audience to bow their heads in prayer, the senator bowed, too.\n\nWhen R&B star Shirley Murdock, a born-again Christian invited to sing, asked those who had a dream to raise a hand, Sanders\u2019 hand shot up with the others.\n\nSanders is an unlikely choice for the people who welcomed him at Allen. State Rep. Joe Neal (D), who is also a Baptist pastor, had to come up with a creative way to integrate the senator\u2019s stump speech into what was essentially a prayer meeting. He recalled Sanders responding to a question about his faith by saying, \u201cMy spirituality is that we are all in this together.\u201d \u201cThat resonated with me,\u201d Neal said.\n\nSanders is a white guy of 74. At one point, he asked the audience whether any of them were around during Martin Luther King\u2019s march on Washington. \u201cIt makes me feel really old,\u201d he said, when no hands went up. \u201cI was there.\u201d\n\nYet the magical simplicity of Sanders\u2019 socialist agenda does resonate with audiences, black or white. He got enthusiastic applause for the speech he has been making since Iowa, and at times, everyone rose to their feet to acknowledge the boldness of his ideas.\n\nThat speech has always contained parts about combating youth unemployment, particularly severe among blacks, and about ending arrests for marijuana possession, which give too many black youngsters a criminal record.\n\nA local Sanders campaign staffer, who had been with him since the early days of his run, told me at the beginning, no one in South Carolina had even heard of him, but as the grapevine and the volunteers worked, he began attracting unlikely allies.\n\nSanders\u2019 strategy was simple but smart: Knowing he is popular with students, the Vermonter has been purposefully touring historically black schools. He has also gone to the leftist pastors who could relate to his preaching manner and his message of sharing and compassion.\n\nHe has made a connection with Black Lives Matter activists and people close to the victims of police shootings. At a rally in Columbia on Tuesday, Sanders was accompanied by state Representative Justin Bamberg, the lawyer for the family of Walter Scott, the black motorist shot by a cop in North Charleston last year.\n\nAll this has worked to some extent. Sanders\u2019 support among South Carolina Democrats has risen from 1.9 percent in July 2015 to about 36 percent today.\n\nClinton\u2019s better name recognition is still part of it. The other part \u2014 Clinton\u2019s pragmatic, step-by-step approach to the progressive agenda \u2014 may turn out to be more important to black voters in South Carolina than it was to almost exclusively white ones in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nI talked about it with Ken Riley, president of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association\u2019s Local 1422, which counts about 850 members, almost all of them black. The union has endorsed Clinton, and Riley supports her.\n\n\u201cI have lived in the South all my life,\u201d Riley told me, \u201cand I struggle every day against the establishment. I like Bernie and the lofty goals he\u2019s laying out, but how realistic are they? Tell me how, what bills you\u2019re gonna pass with this Congress? Hillary is a leftist tempered by reality. I like her connections on both sides of the aisle.\u201d\n\nRiley fears that if Sanders wins and tries to push his idea of a single-payer health-insurance system, that will only open up the health-care issue to Republican interference. \u201cI have a 23-year-old son who is covered by my policy thanks to ObamaCare,\u201d Riley said.\n\nYet Riley isn\u2019t a Clinton fan in the way Sanders\u2019 supporters are fans. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling the movement, not even seeing any signs or anything,\u201d he complains.\n\nI can\u2019t help thinking that had Sanders been more active in the South before, he could have broken through the skepticism of important African-American leaders such as Riley.\n\nAs it is, his effort is impressive but it probably comes too late both for South Carolina and for the Southern states that will vote on Super Tuesday, March 1.\n\nClinton\u2019s superior preparation counts for more here than it did in the first two states. African-American voters\u2019 experience has taught them that it\u2019s harder to get things done than to break things. They want a president who can make progress.\n\n\u00a9 2016, Bloomberg View", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Anyone who thinks Bernie Sanders can\u2019t win black votes should\u2019ve seen him at a prayer breakfast in Columbia, SC, Tuesday.
