(Photo: Jamie Page / The Tennessean )Buy Photo\n\nHuff\u2019s Grocery has been around about as long as anyone in Williamson County can remember. And rest assured, the tradition will continue despite the family\u2019s recent loss of its beloved patriarch.\n\nAfter 72 years as the face of the iconic general store, the May 23 passing of Kenneth E. \u201cKen\u201d Huff \u2014 known to friends and customers as \u201cPops\u201d \u2014 sent shock waves of sorrow throughout the county.\n\nIt even prompted a legislative proclamation, presented July 2 by state Sen. Jack Johnson and Rep. Jeremy Durham to the family in honor of Ken Huff and his lasting contribution to the community.\n\nBut his legend will live on through his son, Charlie Huff, who will continue running the store after 36 years of working there since he was a teen.\n\n\u201cIt would make Pop proud,\u201d Charlie Huff said, standing behind the counter. \u201cWe will strive to be half as good as he was. He believed in treating people right. When you have done that, the rest takes care of itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cPop\u201d kept the store open more than 14 hours a day, seven days a week for most of his years, working right up to his 86th birthday last year, when his health began to fail. He still continued going into the store a few hours a day. The store remains open 12 hours a day, six days a week.\n\n\u201cThat would be a piece of cake to him,\u201d Charlie Huff said. \u201cHe was a tireless worker. He loved this store and the customers. My daddy could probably outwork anybody.\u201d\n\nKen Huff\u2019s obituary called him \u201ca mighty oak,\u201d a decorated Korean War veteran and former deputy sheriff under his brother Mutt Huff.\n\nWhen customers ask Charlie, \u201care you Mr. Huff now?\u201d he\u2019s quick to tell them he\u2019s not.\n\n\u201cHe tells them, \u2018I\u2019m just Charlie, I can\u2019t fill those shoes.\u2019 \u201d said his wife, Robin Huff, who works at the store when she\u2019s not at her full-time job.\n\nBut the store\u2019s bread and butter, making sandwiches and selling convenience items, continues like clockwork. Charlie reminisces about how when he was a kid, the store sold a variety of clothes, shoes, area rugs, animal feed and a great deal more hardware.\n\nBut they still don\u2019t sell beer or lottery tickets, even though the store served as the set of a state lottery television commercial in late 2012. And the lack of such ubiquitous items has never seemed to hurt business.\n\nIn fact, though it\u2019s the only available stop for gasoline in that area for many miles off State Route 840. The store\u2019s lack of a restroom also has never dissuaded customers from stopping.\n\nA sign at the front door reminds visitors of just how unique the place is, reading: \u201cNo bathroom. Built in 1911. This 103-year-old building has never had one.\u201d\n\nTrue to its roots\n\nWilliamson County Mayor Rogers Anderson said Huff\u2019s Grocery was sometimes a stop on a tour of the county when courting out-of-town commercial business recruits. When a representative of one of them asked Anderson if there was a place to wash his hands, he said, \u201cDid you not see the sign?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople come here from all over the state,\u201d Robin Huff said. \u201cAnd now that 840 is open, people come through from other states. They stop for gas and they\u2019re surprised when they see it\u2019s this old country store and they say they want to stop in again on their way back through.\u201d\n\nThe store, which was put on the National Register of Historic Places 25 years ago, was, indeed, built in 1911, by the Akin Brothers, whose original store was across the street.\n\nIn 1937, they sold the business to Ken\u2019s parents, R.G. and Hattie Huff, known to everyone who knew them as \u201cPop and Ma Huff.\u201d By 1942, at age 15, Ken began working there. He rarely missed a day, with the exception of a few surgeries, Charlie said.\n\nCounty Commissioner Judy Hayes lives down the road from Huff\u2019s. It\u2019s the kind of place where she can call ahead if she\u2019s going to be coming by later, after closing time, and find a gallon of milk left on the front porch for her to pick up and pay for later on her ticket of credit. That\u2019s the way it has been her whole life.\n\nIt\u2019s where her family bought groceries, clothing and supplies. When they needed a 50-pound bag of flour, Hayes\u2019 mother took her to pick out the one she wanted because the fabric would eventually be used to make her a dress.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine Burwood without Huff\u2019s store; Burwood is Huff\u2019s store, as are the people who are their customers,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cWhen this was a tobacco-growing neighborhood, it was the lifeblood of the community. It still is the fabric of our community, and the whole nation.\u201d\n\nReach Jamie Page at 615-771-5460 and on Twitter @JamiePage101.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nHuff\u2019s Grocery is located at 5452 Carters Creek Pike, near exit 23 of S.R. 840, in the Burwood community about five miles west of Thompson\u2019s Station.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/2014/07/04/huffs-grocery-legacy-continues-third-generation/12189261/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Since the death of Ken Huff, his son, Charlie, will continue to run the old general store.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Since the death of Ken Huff, his son, Charlie, will continue to run the old general store.", "title": "Huff\u2019s Grocery legacy continues under third generation", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/2014/07/04/huffs-grocery-legacy-continues-third-generation/12189261/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Since the death of Ken Huff, his son, Charlie, will continue to run the old general store.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/03/huffsgrocery055.jpg", "title": "Huff\u2019s Grocery legacy continues under third generation", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local/williamson", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/06ba27a0362a386e9000c02e5ad114cc3f2d85e9/c=714-0-2550-2448/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/03/huffsgrocery055.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70261845367a788a3f907a9f1f073a9c7298db27/c=408-0-2856-2448/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/03/huffsgrocery055.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/209496ef8e15ec974055f2b972cb017799a2d254/c=0-0-3264-2448/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/03/huffsgrocery055.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c5366816a2be01ce320de9a1b7d4fcd3d9671846/c=0-306-3264-2142&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/03/huffsgrocery055.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-07-04T11:00:56.520000-05:00", "shorthed": "Huff\u2019s Grocery legacy continues under third generation", "articleid": 12189261, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd81f7b80aef18fc9ff3cd911b276728a9998bb7/c=0-306-3264-2142/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/03/huffsgrocery055.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4ddfec6da1e1c49c540a50418fed8521c9471641/c=944-0-2321-2448/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/03/huffsgrocery055.jpg"}, "author": "Jamie Page", "title": "Huff\u2019s Grocery legacy continues under third generation", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "huff's grocery, burwood, store, market, ken huff, charlie, legislators"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9de\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine Burwood without Huff\u2019s store; Burwood is Huff\u2019s store, as are the people who are their customers,\u201d Hayes said.\nBuy Photo Huff\u2019s Grocery in Burwood, which was built in 1911, is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\u201cIt would make Pop proud,\u201d Charlie Huff said, standing behind the counter.\n\u201cThat would be a piece of cake to him,\u201d Charlie Huff said.\nThis 103-year-old building has never had one.\u201dTrue to its rootsWilliamson County Mayor Rogers Anderson said Huff\u2019s Grocery was sometimes a stop on a tour of the county when courting out-of-town commercial business recruits."}
