I don\u2019t follow college football, and the initial reporting on the assault allegations made the case sound \u201cmurky\u201d or ambiguous. We use those words too easily talking about these things, don\u2019t we? What happened two winters ago between Winston and an FSU freshman named Erica Kinsman \u2013 yes, his accuser has now come forward and identified herself \u2013 seemed like a classic \u201che said, she said.\u201d It might have been about drunken miscommunication or a celebrity athlete\u2019s sense of entitlement (I told myself) more than \u201crape-rape,\u201d to use the infamous phrase of Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nAfter seeing Kinsman speak for herself, in the biggest news-making moment of \u201cThe Hunting Ground,\u201d Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering\u2019s powerful documentary about campus rape and its consequences, I now view my reluctance to read or think about the Winston case in different terms. On one level it was a defense mechanism. On another it was the result of a cultural scrim that gets pasted over cases like this, a cloak of denial, obfuscation and phony mystery. In fairness to myself, that defense mechanism and the Cloak of Bogus Uncertainty can be found everywhere in our culture. Those were the very forces that led ESPN commentators Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith to describe the rape allegations against Winston as \u201cterribly unfair,\u201d suspiciously timed and quite possibly the result of some sinister conspiracy, after they surfaced late in 2013.\n\nWe see that ESPN clip in \u201cThe Hunting Ground,\u201d not long after hearing Kinsman tell her story, and at least for me it touched an acutely painful nerve. Sure, Smith and Bayless are just a pair of TV jock-sniffers whose instinct was to rally around an alpha-male sports deity. But the combination of entitlement and bogus certainty and low-information sexual paranoia \u2013 coming from two guys who would certainly tell you, in earnest tones, that rape is a terrible crime that should never go unpunished \u2013 spoke volumes about the nature of the larger cultural problem. I watched that and I felt ashamed.\n\nI want to circle back to that question of shame and collective responsibility, both because I can feel some male readers nervously hauling out their #NotAllMen tweets and their MRA FemiNazi-backlash talking points and because I believe that watching \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d can be an eye-opening experience for many men, as it was for me. But I also want to make clear that this film is more about female agency than male agency, and that its real subject is the way young women have organized to share their experiences, tell their stories and confront the deeply entrenched bureaucratic resistance that has shamed and defeated so many assault victims who dared to ask for justice and accountability. Erica Kinsman\u2019s testimony is made more potent by the fact that she is one example among many. The true stars of \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d are Annie Clark and Andrea Pino, who both survived sexual assault as undergraduates at the University of North Carolina and went on to form End Rape on Campus, the activist group that has spearheaded numerous anti-discrimination complaints and lawsuits based on the handling of assault complaints at colleges and universities.\n\nThat defense mechanism I mentioned earlier is not limited to men who don\u2019t want to confront the widespread problem of rape and sexual assault and its consequences, although men are highly vulnerable to that form of collective blindness. It\u2019s also not limited to college administrators (a dishearteningly large percentage of them female) who are eager to protect their brands by suppressing allegations and sweeping assault cases under the institutional carpet, although such tactics appear to have been universal among schools of all kinds from coast to coast. But those phenomena have undeniably fed into each other in toxic fashion, producing shameful delusions like the Smith-Bayless moment on a grand scale. Those guys had no idea whether Jameis Winston had raped anybody, and they may well look back on that broadcast now with regret. But instead of treating the charge as an unproven question of fact \u2013 as they would have treated an investigation of shoplifting or drunk driving or murder \u2013 they proceeded from the assumption that it was unlikely and bizarre on its face, and probably reflected some hidden agenda.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s a good way of summarizing the net effect of our collective confusion and discomfort when it comes to rape and sexual assault \u2013 a confusion that gets magnified in the hothouse atmosphere of a college campus, where a cadre of young people is isolated from their families and communities. An entire class of violent crime, which turns out to be distressingly common on campus, has been ignored, denied, willfully misinterpreted or depicted as some kind of impenetrable mystery. Many young women, as we see in \u201cThe Hunting Ground,\u201d have now taken it on themselves to dispel the aura of shame and doubt and self-blame that so often surrounds this issue. Their example is inspiring, but there\u2019s still a long way to go.\n\nIf \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d is not especially artful cinema, and could have benefited from a broader cultural context, it performs an invaluable service by attaching an impressive range of compelling human faces and human voices to the issue of campus sexual assault, which is sometimes presented as a controversial or divisive \u201cfeminist issue.\u201d In this context, how you feel about such a label, or a gender-studies term like \u201crape culture,\u201d is irrelevant. It\u2019s about watching and listening while one young woman after another, using her real name, tells us a clear and straightforward story about being raped or assaulted by another student and about what happened later, which invariably involves the school administration doing its utmost to make the whole thing go away. These women come from Arizona State and Harvard Law School, from Berkeley and Michigan and Swarthmore, from the University of Tulsa and from Saint Mary\u2019s College, a small Catholic school in Indiana.\n\nAt first, the story of Winston and Kinsman may seem anomalous, since it involves not merely a famous student-athlete but quite likely the biggest name in American collegiate sports. But Dick and Ziering make clear that in other ways it is all too typical. Kinsman told both FSU officials and the local police in Tallahassee that Jameis Winston had taken her to his apartment in a semi-conscious condition, quite likely after drugging her in a bar, and then had pinned her down on his bathroom floor and raped her, while she repeatedly told him to stop. Even Winston\u2019s roommate, Kinsman says, could see that she wasn\u2019t into it and told Winston to stop.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Women fight back against campus rape in a powerful new documentary -- but there are deep lessons here for men too", "title": "Campus rape as a men\u2019s issue: Jameis Winston and the culture of male complicity and denial", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Women fight back against campus rape in a powerful new documentary -- but there are deep lessons here for men too", "title": "Campus rape as a men\u2019s issue: Jameis Winston and the culture of male complicity and denial", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/28/campus_rape_as_a_mens_issue_jameis_winston_and_the_culture_of_male_complicity_and_denial/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/hunting_ground.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Women fight back against campus rape in a powerful new documentary -- but there are deep lessons here for men too", "title": "Campus rape as a men\u2019s issue: Jameis Winston and the culture of male complicity and denial", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/hunting_ground.jpg", "creator": "@andohehir", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Amy Ziering, Campus rape, Documentaries, Kirby Dick, Movies, Rape, Rape Culture, Sexual assault, sexual violence, The Hunting Ground", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9579\"", "article_summary": "Even Winston\u2019s roommate, Kinsman says, could see that she wasn\u2019t into it and told Winston to stop.\nWe see that ESPN clip in \u201cThe Hunting Ground,\u201d not long after hearing Kinsman tell her story, and at least for me it touched an acutely painful nerve.\nIn fairness to myself, that defense mechanism and the Cloak of Bogus Uncertainty can be found everywhere in our culture.\nThose guys had no idea whether Jameis Winston had raped anybody, and they may well look back on that broadcast now with regret.\nI don\u2019t follow college football, and the initial reporting on the assault allegations made the case sound \u201cmurky\u201d or ambiguous."}
