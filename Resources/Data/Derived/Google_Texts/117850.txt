Shivers are likely to abound in Denver as temperatures remain unseasonably cold on Saturday, forecasters said.

Early morning temperatures hovered in the teens with an afternoon high of 28 degrees expected in the metro area, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder.

Light snow and patchy fog will be making their way through the plains in the morning, the weather service said, but skies are likely to clear into the afternoon.

Chances of snow continue in the mountains, although little to no accumulation is expected, forecasters said.

On Sunday, light flurries will lead to minimal snow accumulation in the mountains.

A slow warming trend is expected to begin along the Front Range that should bring temperatures back to seasonable conditions.

A high of 35 degrees is predicted with sunny skies, and temperatures are likely to gradually increase into the 40s for the early part of the week.
