The 10-race playoff series begins next Sunday at Chicagoland.\n\nKenseth has won three of the last six races, and JGR has won eight of the last 11.\n\n\u201cCertainly right now as a company we\u2019re on a roll,\u201d Kenseth said.\n\nThe 16-driver Chase field was set in the regular-season finale, where only four spots were really up for grabs. Jamie McMurray clinched his berth as soon as he took the green flag, but Jeff Gordon, Ryan Newman, Paul Menard and Clint Bowyer all had to protect their positions.\n\nGordon had to finish 17th or better to guarantee his slot, and he finished seventh.\n\nBowyer was in a little bit more of a precarious position as he came to Richmond ranked 16th in the field and unable to afford any mistakes Saturday night. He finished 10th.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be difficult for Newman or Menard, but the Richard Childress Racing drivers struggled the entire race. They both ended three laps down from the leaders, with Newman 20th and Menard 26th.\n\nIt all resets now as the Chase gives the entire field an equal shot to race for the championship. Divided into three rounds before the Nov. 22 finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, a win automatically advances the driver into the next round. Four drivers will be knocked out after every third race.\n\nMartin Truex Jr. of Denver-based Furniture Row Racing finished 32nd.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Matt Kenseth captures fourth win of year", "title": "Matt Kenseth captures fourth win of year", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/12/matt-kenseth-captures-fourth-win-of-year/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150912__kensethp1.jpg", "height": 528}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150912__kensethp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-12T22:15:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T02:52:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a3e\"", "article_summary": "The 16-driver Chase field was set in the regular-season finale, where only four spots were really up for grabs.\nMartin Truex Jr. of Denver-based Furniture Row Racing finished 32nd.\nRICHMOND, va. \u2014 Joe Gibbs Racing cemented itself as the team to beat for NASCAR\u2019s championships with a dominating run Saturday night that ended in Matt Kenseth\u2019s fourth win of the season.\nKenseth has won three of the last six races, and JGR has won eight of the last 11.\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be difficult for Newman or Menard, but the Richard Childress Racing drivers struggled the entire race."}
