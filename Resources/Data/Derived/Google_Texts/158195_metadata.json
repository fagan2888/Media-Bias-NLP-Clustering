Then I just get blasted with this huge wall of snow, ice and everything that was in there.\u201d\n\nThe windshield of Duffy\u2019s 2014 Dodge Ram 3500 caved in, causing an explosion of glass shards. Unable to see, Duffy rolled down his window, put his hazard lights on and managed to drive five miles to his house. Aside from some minor cuts, Duffy said he was uninjured.\n\nOnce home, Duffy called the police and reported the incident. He also called the city of Boulder.\n\nHe said he hasn\u2019t heard much back from either entity, although he was told the city was investigating whether it was, in fact, their plow. \u201cI guess it\u2019s possible that there\u2019s some kind of Robin Hood-type person that was plowing the roads for the city, but I kind of doubt it.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally reported by KUSA 9News.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Man\u2019s truck totaled in Boulder when blasted with snow from plow", "title": "Man\u2019s truck totaled in Boulder when blasted with snow from plow", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/mans-truck-totaled-in-boulder-when-blasted-with-snow-from-plow/", "image": {"width": 490, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__ruined_car_snowp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__ruined_car_snowp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T12:04:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:17:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Traffic"}, "article_summary": "Erik Duffy saw a nearly 7-foot wall of snow and ice barreling toward his truck as he was finishing food deliveries in Boulder on Friday, but he couldn\u2019t get out of the way.\nThen I just get blasted with this huge wall of snow, ice and everything that was in there.\u201dThe windshield of Duffy\u2019s 2014 Dodge Ram 3500 caved in, causing an explosion of glass shards.\nOnce home, Duffy called the police and reported the incident.\nDuffy started slowing as he saw the large load headed toward him, but another car kept him from changing lanes.\nThe snow was pushed down Broadway near Mapleton Avenue by what he believes to be a city of Boulder snowplow that was southbound as he was headed north."}
