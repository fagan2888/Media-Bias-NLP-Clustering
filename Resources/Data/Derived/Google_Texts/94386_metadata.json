It\u2019s intended to empower nearly 75,000 Afghan women between the ages of 18 to 30 to become political, business and civil service leaders. The program is also supposed to engage younger girls, ages 14 through 18\u2014in leadership development programs.\n\nRelated: Agencies Don\u2019t Know Which Women\u2019s Programs Get Million in Afghanistan\n\nThough the idea of Promote sounds promising, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction is raising questions about its implementation and sustainability.\n\nIG John Sopko expressed his concerns in a letter sent to USAID on Thursday, the agency in charge of the program: \u201cSIGAR is concerned that some very basic programmatic issues remain unresolved and that the Afghan women engaged in the program may be left without any tangible benefit upon completion. SIGAR is also concerned about whether USAID will be able to effectively implement, monitor, and assess the impact of Promote.\u201d\n\nSIGAR isn\u2019t alone in its concerns. Afghanistan\u2019s new First Lady also recently expressed similar skepticism about the program meant to empower women in her country, according to the letter.\n\nRelated: $100 Billion in Aid Squandered in Afghanistan\n\n\u201cI do hope that we are not going to fall again into the game of contracting and sub-contracting and the routine of workshops and training sessions generating a lot of certificates on paper and little else,\u201d said Afghan First Lady Rula Ghani, during a speech last November.\n\nSo far, USAID has committed about $216 million to fund the program, with an additional $200 million reportedly coming from other donors. Three main contractors are working on Promote\u2014including Chemonics International, Development Alternatives, Inc., and Tetra Tech, Inc.\n\nThe auditors said since there is no \u201cmemoranda of understanding\u201d between the contractors and USAID, it will be extremely difficult to track spending on the program.\n\nFor its part, the agency said it would be keeping close tabs on the program and others like it.\n\nRelated: How Many Agencies Does It Take to Change a Lightbulb?\u200b\n\n\u201cUSAID has helped Afghan women achieve dramatic gains since 2001 through programs to improve maternal health, increase girls' education, and expand women's participation in the workforce and politics,\u201d USAID Spokesperson Ben Edwards said in a statement.\u201d\n\nBuilding on this progress is critical to Afghanistan's future, which is why we worked closely with Afghan women, the Afghan government, and the private sector to design a gender program that will promote women leaders over the long term. As part of our commitment to results and accountability, we will apply robust oversight to all gender programs to ensure they are achieving their intended goals.\"\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time SIGAR has flagged the U.S.\u2019s numerous efforts to empower women in Afghanistan. Late last year, the auditors released a report revealing that USAID, the State Department and the Defense Department couldn\u2019t readily identify all of the various projects, programs and initiatives they\u2019ve poured millions into to support Afghan women. The auditors also said the agencies had no way to track the programs\u2019 progress.\n\n\u201cThis lack of accountability is primarily due to the fact that none of the three agencies has effective mechanisms for tracking the funding associated with these projects,\u201d SIGAR said in the report.\n\nRelated: 5 Most Egregious Examples of Government Waste This Year \u200b\n\nThe agencies, however, disputed the auditor\u2019s findings \u2013arguing that their programs have been successful.\n\n\u201cOver the last thirteen years, Afghan women and girls have achieved significant progress and it is important to accurately convey this to the American people,\u201d USAID program coordinator Charles Randolph wrote in a response to the IG. \u201cThe progress is not accidental. Support to Afghan women and girls has been one of the key goals of the development community and our Afghan partners.\u201d\n\nA USAID official repeated Randolph\u2019s sentiment in an interview with The Fiscal Times on Thursday\u2014saying the agency has a system in place to monitor its programs\u2019 effectiveness.\n\nUSAID plans to respond to SIGAR\u2019s letter on the Promote program by April 11, the official said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The largest women\u2019s empowerment program in U.S.", "title": "Another $400 Million Afghan Program May Be Failing", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/02/Another-400-Million-Afghan-Program-May-Be-Failing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05052014_Afghan_Woman.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/02/Another-400-Million-Afghan-Program-May-Be-Failing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05052014_Afghan_Woman.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The largest women\u2019s empowerment program in U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ac6\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s intended to empower nearly 75,000 Afghan women between the ages of 18 to 30 to become political, business and civil service leaders.\nSo far, USAID has committed about $216 million to fund the program, with an additional $200 million reportedly coming from other donors.\nUSAID plans to respond to SIGAR\u2019s letter on the Promote program by April 11, the official said.\nThe largest women\u2019s empowerment program in U.S. government history is coming under scrutiny by auditors who are questioning whether the $400 million initiative is actually working.\n\u201cOver the last thirteen years, Afghan women and girls have achieved significant progress and it is important to accurately convey this to the American people,\u201d USAID program coordinator Charles Randolph wrote in a response to the IG."}
