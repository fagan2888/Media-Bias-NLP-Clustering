President Obama is continuing setting records for private sector job growth, and there are a few numbers that belie Republican claims. Or, as Republicans whine, \u201cThanks, Obama.\u201d\n\nJason Fuhrman Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement, \u201cOur businesses have added 13.2 million jobs over 67 months of growth\u2014extending the longest streak on record.\u201d\n\nOh, dear. \u201cThe economy added 142,000 jobs in September, extending the longest streak of private-sector job growth on record.\u201d\n\nAll is not peachy, as you probably already know. \u201cThe economy added jobs in September at a pace below that seen earlier in the year, as slowing growth abroad and global financial turmoil have weighed on economic activity.\u201d\n\nBut before Republicans start celebrating the downfall of the country, \u201cOverall, however, the unemployment rate remains at its lowest level since early 2008 and the private sector has added 13.2 million jobs over 67 straight months of job growth\u2014the longest streak on record.\u201d\n\nAnd a warning shot for Republicans, \u201cGiven the increased uncertainty around the world, it is imperative that the United States not further exacerbate that uncertainty with unnecessary brinksmanship and austerity. Instead, we must take steps to continue the domestic momentum that the U.S. economy has enjoyed in the last several years. That includes passing a budget that reverses the sequester and makes critical investments that help our economy continue to grow, reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank so that our businesses can compete on a level-playing field abroad, and increasing investments in infrastructure.\u201d\n\nGood luck with that, sane people. Republicans are blowing off Wall Street\u2019s terror over their inability to govern, they certainly aren\u2019t going go care about the people or the economy. They have nutters to appease, after all, and a shutdown over what they know to be fake Planned Parenthood videos. Very serious people, the Republicans.\n\nAnother sour note for Republicans is that, as Fuhrman noted on Twitter, \u201cFull-time jobs more than fully account for all job gains since early \u201910, with part-time jobs holding steady\u201d. Read it and weep, Republicans. So much for the claims that Obamacare was ruining the world and everyone would be working part-time.\n\nFrom Fuhrman\u2019s key points on the job numbers:\n\nThe rise in employment since early 2010 is more than fully accounted for by the increase in full-time employment, with part-time employment holding steady. The economy has added 11 million full-time jobs since February 2010, according to a separate survey of households that measures full-time and part-time status. Part-time employment has fallen slightly over this period. While 75 percent of part-time workers do so for family, health, and other reasons, the fraction of the labor force working part-time for economic reasons declined in September. This shift drove the reduction in the underemployment rate to its lowest level since May 2008.\n\nIn fact, Dan Diamond, the Executive Editor of the Daily Briefing, noted, \u201cObamacare was signed into law in March 2010. The private sector hasn\u2019t lost jobs since\u201d:\n\n2) Obamacare was signed into law in March 2010.

Republican presidential candidates keep trying to sell the fake reality that jobs have suffered under President Obama and only they know how to fix things, with a little more trickle down. They know how to jump-start the economy for jobs! It\u2019s by giving tax breaks to the top 2! But so much nope.\n\nDiamond also shared this, \u201cBush inherited 4% unemployment, and doubled it. Obama faced 10% unemployment in his first year\u2014and cut it in half.\u201d\n\nBush inherited 4% unemployment, and doubled it.
