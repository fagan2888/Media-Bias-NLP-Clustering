And Hillary Clinton\u2019s solution, proposed last week, does include useful elements.\n\nFor example, she advocates an income-based loan repayment program \u2014 in other words, to cap loan payments to a certain percentage of discretionary income.\n\nSuch programs already exist, and Clinton would consolidate them. Nor are they the sole province of Democratic politicians. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican presidential contender, is championing another income-based repayment plan with Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat.\n\nIt\u2019s important, though, that a repayment program not encourage people to choose lower-paying careers in order to gain earlier debt forgiveness, as an existing model does.\n\nThe remainder of Clinton\u2019s plan, meanwhile, has serious flaws.\n\nFirst, it would create the equivalent of another entitlement, in this case to free or more heavily subsidized college, that would cost $350 billion over the next decade. And that estimate would almost surely turn out to be low.\n\nThe U.S. still has a long-term debt problem that will begin to worsen again in the 2020s. The next president is likely to enjoy a first term when annual deficits seem relatively under control, but the Congressional Budget Office and other experts warn that this will only be the calm before the storm.\n\nGiven an aging population and the insipid economic growth of recent years, it doesn\u2019t make sense to saddle the federal budget with another major burden.\n\nSecond, Clinton would increase federal control over \u2014 or at least interference into \u2014 state colleges and universities. She seeks to pressure states into boosting their own support for higher education by granting those that do $175 billion so students would not have to take out loans to cover tuition. The states would be expected to do a variety of things, such as slow the growth of tuition. And according to The New York Times, the plan would \u201cimpose penalties on colleges whose graduates cannot repay their loans.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in an echo of an idea offered by President Obama, Clinton would offer two years of free community college to all takers.\n\nBut that\u2019s questionable policy as well. So long as college remains a path that some choose and some don\u2019t, those who do go should be responsible for some of the cost \u2014 especially if they can afford it.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Overshooting on student debt", "title": "Overshooting on student debt", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/14/overshooting-on-student-debt/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150814__20150816_Z00_OP16E_CLINTONEDp1.jpg", "height": 430}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150814__20150816_Z00_OP16E_CLINTONEDp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-14T10:56:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T08:12:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae0a\"", "article_summary": "Florida Sen.
