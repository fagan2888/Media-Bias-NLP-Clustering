The 33rd Gulf Coast Triathlon is in the books, athletes have crossed the finish line, medals have been awarded, and race officials say this year's triathlon was one of the most successful.

More than 1,800 people registered for the events and about 90 percent of the triathletes finished the course.

Unlike last year, no sections of the race were cancelled due to water conditions.

Race Co-Director Steve Harvard says the transition to Edgewater Beach Resort as the new host site went very well.

"The site was fabulous," explained Harvard. "Edgewater really went up and beyond to help us make sure that it was. It was family oriented we had everything out that night by the pool and we had a number of family events Thursday and Friday for the people so they could have something to do. That worked out great for us.

Registration for the 2016 Gulf Coast Triathlon will be in the fall.
