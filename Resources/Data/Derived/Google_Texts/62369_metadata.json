As I wrote over the weekend, when surveys about Planned Parenthood are worded accurately \u2013 that is, informing respondents that the GOP-led Congress is not a bunch of ogres and actually wants to shift funds from the abortion giant to lifesaving pregnancy centers, a majority agrees that defunding the organization doesn\u2019t sound so bad after all. Now, a new poll from The Polling Company reveals more of the same.\n\nThe Polling Company offered basic truths about the supposedly \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d friendly Planned Parenthood, and the results were not flattering.\n\n\"When we communicate three basic truths about Planned Parenthood being the nation\u2019s top abortion provider, that: senior officials there have been shown on video to be discussing; the harvesting and trafficking of aborted baby body parts, and; engage in one-sided partisan electioneering, support for the organizations and their taxpayer funding tumbles.\"\n\n\u201cTumbles\u201d is putting it kindly. Once Americans become aware of the Center for Medical Progress\u2019 disturbing undercover investigation, a majority of poll takers, including a majority of Democrats, support a further examination into Planned Parenthood's practices.\n\nOn a separate question, a 68%-majority of Americans, including majorities of self-identified Republicans (76%), Independents (72%), and Democrats (64%) back continued investigations based on the video allegations.\n\nThese are encouraging results. But, the next question is: Will we see these statistics on the nightly news?\n\nUnfortunately, the media is quick to report on surveys showing the public\u2019s support for Planned Parenthood and slow to report on the actual investigation in question. That may be largely why only 28 percent of those surveyed say they have seen any of the CMP videos. The organization's PR nightmare has urged mainstream news outlets to do more damage control than usual.\n\nIt\u2019s time to report the truth about Americans\u2019 souring relationship with Planned Parenthood.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Imagine that..05/27/2016 10:48:39AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Imagine that.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Hm: 'Basic Truths' About Planned Parenthood Are Exposed In New Poll And Support Tumbles", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/12/15/hm-new-poll-finds-that-when-basic-truths-about-planned-parenthood-are-exposed-support-tumbles-n2093684", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/272/2015-09-29T204114Z_1_LYNXNPEB8S18B_RTROPTP_3_USA-FISCAL-PLANNEDPARENTHOOD.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Imagine that.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Hm: 'Basic Truths' About Planned Parenthood Are Exposed In New Poll And Support Tumbles", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/12/15/hm-new-poll-finds-that-when-basic-truths-about-planned-parenthood-are-exposed-support-tumbles-n2093684", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/272/2015-09-29T204114Z_1_LYNXNPEB8S18B_RTROPTP_3_USA-FISCAL-PLANNEDPARENTHOOD.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Hm: 'Basic Truths' About Planned Parenthood Are Exposed In New Poll And Support Tumbles, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The Polling Company offered basic truths about the supposedly \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d friendly Planned Parenthood, and the results were not flattering.\nIt\u2019s time to report the truth about Americans\u2019 souring relationship with Planned Parenthood.\nUnfortunately, the media is quick to report on surveys showing the public\u2019s support for Planned Parenthood and slow to report on the actual investigation in question.\nOnce Americans become aware of the Center for Medical Progress\u2019 disturbing undercover investigation, a majority of poll takers, including a majority of Democrats, support a further examination into Planned Parenthood's practices.\nThat may be largely why only 28 percent of those surveyed say they have seen any of the CMP videos."}
