Other World Heritage Cities include Paris, Rome, Cairo and Tel-Aviv.\n\nCities earning this title must have made significant impacts on the world and be home to UNESCO World Heritage sites. Independence Hall was named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979.\n\nMORE: Stallone visits Philly to promote new film\n\nHow will this designation benefit Philadelphia? Increased tourism is the most obvious answer, according to a story on Philly.com.\n\nOfficials with the city and the World Heritage organization noted in the story that there are other long-term benefits.\n\nPhiladelphia will now have access to programs that can help maintain and promote its heritage and the city could establish education and business partnerships with other World Heritage cities.\n\n\"As a World Heritage City, Philadelphia is being officially recognized on the global stage for its wealth of contributions to the world as the epicenter of American democracy and for its enduring commitment to preserving the unique historical and cultural assets in our diverse community,\" Mayor Michael Nutter said in a statement. \"As we celebrate this milestone, the next step is to focus on the future and how we can optimize this World Heritage City recognition to attract more people to visit, invest, work, study and live in Philadelphia.\"\n\nThe city will celebrate the new designation with a \"Toast to World Heritage PHL\" at the Independence Visitors Center on Nov. 11 at 4 p.m.\n\nMatt Gray may be reached at mgray@njadvancemedia.com.
