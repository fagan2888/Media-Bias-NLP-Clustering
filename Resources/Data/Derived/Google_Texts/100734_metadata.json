A permanent agreement also must be reached.\n\nIt\u2019s a matter of public safety, no matter what Adams County Sheriff Doug Darr might contend.\n\nDarr has maintained the cap was necessary because of staffing problems and to ease jail crowding. And he has pointed out that inmates turned away were among the lowest-level offenders, implying that releasing them might not jeopardize public safety.\n\nIn March, however, Denver said it could no longer house Aurora\u2019s inmates who had been turned away from the Adams County jail. The six who were released had a combined record of more than 100 arrests for crimes including burglary, assault, and assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nSure enough, three of the six were re-arrested by Aurora Police.\n\nTwo were arrested in June on assault and battery charges, proving the point that setting a cap with an arbitrary number is dangerous public policy.\n\nThe standoff between the municipalities and Adams County lasted more than two years \u2014 and this from entities that should be working together.\n\nThe temporary agreement increases the daily cap on municipal inmates to 65, up from 30, and cities must pay for any inmates beyond that limit.\n\nThe cap can be increased now, Darr said, because the jail can accommodate the additional inmates due to expansion of the supervised release program.\n\nWith the agreement, a lawsuit filed by Aurora, Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn and Federal Heights is on hold until next May.\n\nMeanwhile, a permanent solution must be reached. Just as it is senseless to release inmates, it is unwise to spend taxpayer money on a lawsuit between governments.\n\nThe cap may have forced cities to stop jailing people on low-level offenses like unpaid dog leash tickets. But it was also a detriment to public safety and put bad guys back on the street.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Long-term deal needed on Adams County jail inmate cap", "title": "Long-term deal needed on Adams County jail inmate cap", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/28/long-term-deal-needed-on-adams-county-jail-inmate-cap/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140828__adams-countyp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140828__adams-countyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-28T17:54:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:42:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17ff\"", "article_summary": "The temporary deal between municipalities in Adams County and the county jail that increases a cap on the number of municipal inmates is progress, but it\u2019s not enough.\nIn March, however, Denver said it could no longer house Aurora\u2019s inmates who had been turned away from the Adams County jail.\nThe standoff between the municipalities and Adams County lasted more than two years \u2014 and this from entities that should be working together.\nIt\u2019s a matter of public safety, no matter what Adams County Sheriff Doug Darr might contend.\nAnd he has pointed out that inmates turned away were among the lowest-level offenders, implying that releasing them might not jeopardize public safety."}
