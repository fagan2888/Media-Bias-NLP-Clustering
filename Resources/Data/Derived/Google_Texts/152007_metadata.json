You\u2019ve come of age in the time of 9/11, 7/7, you\u2019ve had friends go off to war, seen families in the middle of a recession. The challenges are vast, economic inequality, climate change, terrorism, migration, all these things are real.\u201d\n\nOPTIMISM\n\nEven against a backdrop of adversity, the historic leader shared a message of optimism and renewed faith in the emerging generation of leaders and change influencers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what gives me such hope about your generation; so many of you are driven by that same impulse. You\u2019re a generation that has seen immigration and globalisation not as threats but as opportunities. You see differences, pluralism and diversity not as curses but as gifts,\u201d said Obama.\n\nRolling up his sleeves, the man of the hour opened the forum up to some wide-ranging questions, which touches upon issues such as tackling Islamaphobia and climate change.\n\nOn his legacy, the President whose tenure comes to an unofficial end in November candidly explained that he wasn\u2019t keeping track of his accomplishments but there are particular milestones he is proud of.\n\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t think I will get a sense of my legacy until about 10 years from now when I can look back with some perspective of what worked and what didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThere are things that I am proud of like the basic principle that in a country as wealthy as the United States, every person should have access to high-quality healthcare that they can afford.\u201d\n\n\n\nATTENTION: President Obama said he felt the Black Lives Matter movement highlighted problems in the US criminal justice system\n\nAlongside the introduction of the health service popularly known as Obamacare, the American president counted the reform of Wall Street and the public health response to the Ebola crisis as successes for his administration.\n\nPresident Obama reminded the audience that legacy comes with perspective.\n\nHe said: \u201cI will look at the scorecard at the end but I am proud about the fact that I think that I have been true to myself throughout this process. Sometimes I look back at what I said when I was running for office and what I am saying today and they match up.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the pace of change, the US President took the audience on a brief history lesson on America\u2019s ever-complex story of racial inequality.\n\n\u201cSomething I\u2019m most familiar with is the American civil rights movement,\u201d he began.\n\n\u201cYou had abolitionists in the 1700s who were fighting against slavery for 100 years, a movement that eventually lead to a civil war and the amendments to our Constitution that ended slavery and called for equal protection under the law. But it then took another 100 years for those rights enshrined in the Constitution to actually be affirmed through the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\u201d\n\nBringing it to the present context Obama pointed out how, more than 50 years later, the same rights are still not fully recognised.\n\n\u201cThere is still discrimination in aspects of American life even with a black president. In fact one of the dangers of electing a black president is that people become convinced that there must be no problems at all, but obviously we\u2019ve seen Ferguson, and some of the issues that we\u2019ve seen with the criminal justice system indicating a degree to which that was always false.\u201d\n\nCYNICISM\n\nObama called on young people to not succumb to cynicism in the face of the slow pace of change.\n\n\u201cDr King said \u2018the Ark of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice\u2019, and it doesn\u2019t then on its own bend because we pull it in that direction. But it requires a series of generations working and building off of what the previous one has done.\u201d\n\nOn social movements that had resonated with him during his presidency, Obama highlighted the strides made by the LGBT community and Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnd he credited the movement for its effectiveness: \u201cI think that for example what Black Lives Matter is doing to bring attention to the problem of a criminal justice system that is sometimes not treating people fairly based on race, reacting to shootings of individuals by police officers has been really effective in bringing attention to the problem.\u201d\n\nEffective social activism requires a degree of compromise advised the leader who urged the audience to be prepared to meet lawmakers and policy changers half way.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that I caution young people about, and that I don\u2019t think is effective, is once you\u2019ve highlighted an issue and brought it to people\u2019s attention and elected officials or people who are in position to start bringing about change are ready to sit down with you then you can\u2019t just keep on yelling at them.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t refuse to meet with them because that might compromise the purity of your position,\u201d said Obama.\n\nHe added: \u201cYou then have a responsibility to prepare an agenda that is achievable that can institutionalise the changes that you seek and to engage the other side.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/obama-i%E2%80%99ve-been-true-myself", "image": "http://www.voice-online.co.uk/sites/default/files/voice_logo.png", "type": "Article", "title": "Obama: 'I\u2019ve been true to myself'"}, "fb": {"admins": 271339423214882}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "President Obama reminded the audience that legacy comes with perspective.\n\u201cThere is still discrimination in aspects of American life even with a black president.\n\u201cSomething I\u2019m most familiar with is the American civil rights movement,\u201d he began.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t refuse to meet with them because that might compromise the purity of your position,\u201d said Obama.\nYou see differences, pluralism and diversity not as curses but as gifts,\u201d said Obama."}
