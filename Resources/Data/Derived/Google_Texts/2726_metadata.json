AIR could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nRoman Muraviev, head of catastrophe bonds at fund manager Twelve Capital, said traders had marked the bond as low as 0-10 cents on Friday in expectation of a default. Little trade had been seen in the bond on Monday, the broker said.\n\nThe catastrophe bond market has grown rapidly in the past few years, attracting hedge funds and institutional investors, because of its high yields, low default rates and low correlation with global markets. A record $8 billion in catastrophe bonds were issued last year.\n\n, according to specialist website Artemis. Swiss Re declined to comment.
