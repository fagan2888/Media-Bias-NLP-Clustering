That total didn\u2019t include other in-house advertising and promotional activities that could greatly add to the total cost. The biggest spenders in 2013 included the Department of Defense ($419 million), HHS ($197.4 million), the Department of Education ($128.8 million) and the Department of Veterans Affairs ($61.8 million).\n\nRelated: The Future of Advertising: Everything, Everywhere, All the Time\n\n\u201cAmericans have long been of mixed mind about advertising,\u201d the study noted, especially when it comes to government efforts to alter their perceptions of the quality of government or promote specific policy issues. \u201cMany individuals also believe that government should not needlessly or wantonly spend taxpayer money, and that citizens should be thrifty and self-reliant.\u201d\n\nWhile critics generally discount government spending on public service announcements that inform citizens about services available to them, they frequently object to government \u201cmessaging\u201d to advance the policy agenda of a president or overcome adverse publicity about a department or agency.\n\nIn the latest dustup, Senate Budget Committee Chair Mike Enzi (R-WY), has demanded that the Office of Management and Budget provide him with precise figures on the cost of an HHS agency contract with the Edelman public relations firm, and \u2013 more broadly \u2013 how much the administration has spent this year on outside advertising services.\n\nThe Washington Post reported this week that the Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration was attempting to \u201crefine their agency messaging\u201d with reporters. Edelman \u2013 a prominent public relations firm \u2013 was retained to conduct a study on ways to better influence reporters covering the agency. \u201cOur clients are national government agencies within the health industry,\u201d an Edelman public relations employee informed one journalist who was contacted for the survey, according to the Post. \u201cWe are hoping to gain insight into how our messages are being received by journalists.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Next Debt Crisis Could Be Much Worse than in 2013, GAO Warns\n\nEnzi said in a letter to OMB Director Shaun Donovan that he was concerned about how across the board government spending on these types of activities in light of a national debt in excess of $18 trillion.\n\n\u201cUnnecessary media relations spending is a cost that the nation simply cannot afford,\" Enzi wrote. \"With the administration again asking Congress to raise the federal debt limit, it is essential that the Executive Branch avoid spending on unessential and inappropriate activities, and that Congress be made aware to the extent that such spending continues to occur.\"\n\nEnzi added that agency spending on public relations activities is \"largely a black box,\" and that the Congressional Research Service had trouble pinpointing exactly how much was being spent. He also noted that this spending continues despite several laws that aimed at discouraging government spending on \"publicity or propaganda purposes,\" or to influence legislative outcomes.\n\nRelated: Audit Uncovers $124.7 B of Overpayments and Fraud in Medicare and Medicaid\n\nAccording to the CRS figures extracted from the Federal Procurement Data System, here is how much the Obama administration spent at a minimum on outside advertising contracts during the first five years the president was in office:\n\nFY 2009 -- $1.18 billion\n\nFY 2010 -- $946 million\n\nFY 2011 -- $750 million\n\nFY 2012 -- $700 million\n\nFY 2013- $892.5 million.\n\nThe OMB has not yet responded to Enzi\u2019s request for more data, according to a spokesperson for the Senate Budget Committee.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The recent disclosure that the Department of Health and Human Services contracted with", "title": "Obama Administration Spent Billions on Image Advertising", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/09/Obama-Administration-Spent-Billions-Image-Advertising", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-trade-obama_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/09/Obama-Administration-Spent-Billions-Image-Advertising", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-trade-obama_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The recent disclosure that the Department of Health and Human Services contracted with", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cUnnecessary media relations spending is a cost that the nation simply cannot afford,\" Enzi wrote.\nThe Washington Post reported this week that the Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration was attempting to \u201crefine their agency messaging\u201d with reporters.\nEdelman \u2013 a prominent public relations firm \u2013 was retained to conduct a study on ways to better influence reporters covering the agency.\n\u201cOur clients are national government agencies within the health industry,\u201d an Edelman public relations employee informed one journalist who was contacted for the survey, according to the Post.\nEnzi added that agency spending on public relations activities is \"largely a black box,\" and that the Congressional Research Service had trouble pinpointing exactly how much was being spent."}
