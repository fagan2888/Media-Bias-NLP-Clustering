That website is widely used by the pubic in evaluating and comparing 15,000 nursing homes nationwide, and is thus crucial to family decisions about where to place a loved one who needs care.\n\nWhereas it was previously possible for a facility to receive less than four stars in both the registered nurse and total staffing sub-categories and still earn a four-star ranking for staffing overall, now nursing homes must receive the four-star level mark in at least one of those sub-categories in order to receive the four-star staffing rating, according to Patrick Conway, chief medical officer for CMS, the federal agency responsible for overseeing nursing homes. Conway added that homes also must receive at least three stars in both the registered nurse and total staffing components in order to achieve the overall four-star rating for staffing.\n\nThomas Hamilton, director of the agency\u2019s survey and certification group, said 13 percent, or about 2,000, of the nation\u2019s nursing homes will lose one or two stars on staffing as a result of these policy changes, and other changes in the data underlying nursing homes\u2019 staffing ratings. He explained that the staffing and other changes are part of the agency\u2019s effort to promote continuous improvement in the industry that he said has occurred since the launch of the five-star rating system in December 2008. Staffing is but one criteria used to determine the broader quality score; among the others are health inspections and the percent of residents who are physically restrained.\n\nIn all, about one in three, or about 5,000 nursing homes, will see their broader quality star rating decrease as a result of the changes, according to Conway.\n\n\u201cWe view these changes as part of our continuing journey of quality improvement for the Nursing Home Compare website,\u201d Conway said.\n\nA Center for Public Integrity investigation published in November found widespread gaps between staffing levels reported by nursing homes and staffing levels calculated through an analysis of the homes\u2019 annual financial documents, called cost reports.\n\nThe gaps occurred in both nonprofit and for-profit nursing homes, and for all types of direct care staffing positions, though the gaps were greatest for reported levels of registered nurses.\n\nIn 2012 the self-reported staffing levels for registered nurses were higher than the average daily level calculated through cost reports in more than 80 percent of nursing homes, the Center found.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act required that nursing homes transition from the self-reported staffing method to a payroll-based system with audited information by March 2012. Officials have said that a payroll-based system for calculating staffing would be the most accurate of all. Hamilton said $11 million in funding awarded to CMS in October 2014 though the IMPACT Act would allow it to complete the process by the end of 2016. He acknowledged that the variation in payroll systems in nursing homes across the country makes the task a steep one, but said the agency is committed to accomplishing it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working hard to make it a reality,\u201d Hamilton said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Feds tweak system that was subject of Center investigation", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Feds announce changes in nursing home rating system", "og": {"site_name": "Center for Public Integrity", "description": "Feds tweak system that was subject of Center investigation", "title": "Feds announce changes in nursing home rating system", "url": "https://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/02/23/16802/feds-announce-changes-nursing-home-rating-system", "image": "https://static-00-www.publicintegrity.org/files/styles/12col/public/img/shutterstock_215217070.jpg?itok=H6v2e770", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://static-00-www.publicintegrity.org/files/styles/8col/public/img/shutterstock_215217070.jpg?itok=Cjnf3yLV", "site": "@Publici", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-02-23T10:00:00+00:00", "0": "Array", "fb": {"admins": 59300693, "app_id": 208489549167264}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/publici", "published_time": "2015-02-23T05:00:00-0500", "author": "https://www.publicintegrity.org/authors/jeff-kelly-lowenstein", "section": "Health", "modified_time": "2015-06-17T09:27:27-0400", "tag": "Mark Parkinson"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d3f\"", "article_summary": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced changes Friday to its often-critiqued five-star rating system for nursing home quality \u2014- changes that are likely to negatively affect the ratings for thousands of facilities.\nThomas Hamilton, director of the agency\u2019s survey and certification group, said 13 percent, or about 2,000, of the nation\u2019s nursing homes will lose one or two stars on staffing as a result of these policy changes, and other changes in the data underlying nursing homes\u2019 staffing ratings.\nA Center for Public Integrity investigation published in November found widespread gaps between staffing levels reported by nursing homes and staffing levels calculated through an analysis of the homes\u2019 annual financial documents, called cost reports.\nHe acknowledged that the variation in payroll systems in nursing homes across the country makes the task a steep one, but said the agency is committed to accomplishing it.\nIn all, about one in three, or about 5,000 nursing homes, will see their broader quality star rating decrease as a result of the changes, according to Conway."}
