A man critically hurt at a Phoenix bar is fighting for his life and the suspect accused of injuring him is in police custody.

Investigators said they were able to develop leads that led to the arrest of Jose Beltran, 43, Saturday night.

Beltran is accused of hitting another man in the face with a pool cue at Wild Billâ€™s Saloon at 6840 N. 27th Ave. at around 1:15 a.m. Wednesday.

The victim placed his hands over his face and then collapsed, Phoenix police Sgt. Vince Lewis said.

Beltran and other suspects left the victim on the floor and as they walked out of the bar, Lewis said.

The victim, whose name has not been released, was taken to the hospital, where he remains in extremely critical condition.
