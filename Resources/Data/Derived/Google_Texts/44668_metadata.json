Last year, with an election to be won, he played 19 times. This year, with the economy still faltering, a full agenda to get through Congress, and the Middle East in flames, he has already played 32 times.\n\nGuys, I\u2019m totally serious this time.\n\nObama doesn\u2019t really want to put the time into the sometimes grinding mechanics of governing. He not only doesn\u2019t care about building relationships on Capitol Hill, but he has failed to create consistent, reliable messages about his policies that people feel they can grab onto and believe. And you can\u2019t govern by attacking Mitt Romney.\n\nAnd so we were told that the stimulus of 2009 would bring unemployment down quickly below 8 percent and that we were entering a \u201csummer of recovery.\u201d Instead, unemployment stayed high and the summer simply sucked.\n\nWe were told Gitmo would be closed. That Syria\u2019s Bashar Assad, upon whose head we now want to drop bombs, was a reformer. That Obamacare would bring down costs and that you could keep your own doctor and health insurance. That the deficit would be cut in half.\n\nNope. None of it.\n\nThese are not minor verbal errors. They are significant unkept promises and mistakes that suggest the president either was dishonest or extremely sloppy in offering them up in the first place.\n\nEven seeking a vote in Congress on Syria is a reversal.\n\nAnd so nobody listens. Despite an ongoing White House Obamacare PR campaign and a similar, earlier TV blitz by Obama, his signature health care program remains as unpopular as ever. He spent the summer of 2013 advocating some kind of economic program. Does anyone even remember what he was talking about?\n\nObama\u2019s TV campaign to bash Bashar won\u2019t change many minds. Unless one means that some inclined to support him will recoil in horror and oppose the attack.\n\nIf he\u2019s going to win this, he\u2019ll have to twist arms on Capitol Hill, pleading to skeptical Democrats that his presidency is on the line and to Republicans that Al Qaeda will, if we don\u2019t punish Assad, get the green light to set off chemical weapons up and down the prairie.\n\nProblem is, nobody on Capitol Hill really believes him either.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb08a\"", "article_summary": "Problem is, nobody on Capitol Hill really believes him either.\nObama\u2019s TV campaign to bash Bashar won\u2019t change many minds.\nHe not only doesn\u2019t care about building relationships on Capitol Hill, but he has failed to create consistent, reliable messages about his policies that people feel they can grab onto and believe.\nDespite an ongoing White House Obamacare PR campaign and a similar, earlier TV blitz by Obama, his signature health care program remains as unpopular as ever.\nObama doesn\u2019t really want to put the time into the sometimes grinding mechanics of governing."}
