His father, Troy, would scrupulously watch and often offer encouraging words. As this story was passed around by baseball people, Troy\u2019s passion intensified, to the point that when I heard the story, Troy supposedly said: \u201cLook at you \u2014 other 1-year-olds are asleep, and you\u2019re getting better.\u201d\n\nThe anecdote, of course, captures the maniacal dedication that made Tulo Tulo. A burning yearning. I can\u2019t recall meeting an athlete who wanted to win more. Alas, he only did occasionally, playing for baseball\u2019s afterthought, the Rockies.\n\nAs such, I hope all of Denver is as happy for Tulo as I am, when I share this astounding stat: In the games he\u2019s started for the Toronto Blue Jays, they\u2019ve never lost. They\u2019re 11-0.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Tulo play at any level but high,\u201d Toronto teammate LaTroy Hawkins texted. \u201cIt goes unnoticed when you aren\u2019t winning games.\u201d\n\nBaseball isn\u2019t basketball. Even the best player at his position cannot carry a team. Three Mondays ago, it dawned on me as I sat in the Wrigley Field press box: Is Tulo the modern version of Ernie Banks, the big-star shortstop who never wins big? A few hours later, Tulo was traded.\n\nI can\u2019t help but hope Tulo makes the playoffs, because there are few players to whom it would mean more. When he was traded to Toronto, the Blue Jays were .500, even- steven, with a 50-50 record. They lost the next day, while the trades went through, and they\u2019ve lost just once since. The Jays are coming off a statement sweep at Yankee Stadium, where the home team mustered one run all weekend. Toronto entered Monday only 1\u00bd games back of the Yankees for first place in the AL East. Incredible.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, I\u2019ve become very interested in Toronto Blue Jays scores,\u201d Colorado manager Walt Weiss said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun to watch. (With the trade), we went through a range of emotions. Now, when I turn on the TV and see him playing, I\u2019m thrilled. I\u2019m thrilled for him. The fact that he\u2019s back in the pennant race, and he\u2019s had the impact he\u2019s had already with that club, I\u2019m thrilled. \u2026\n\n\u201cI know how he\u2019s wired, and I know how much he\u2019s loving being in a race right now.\u201d\n\nLike Weiss, many Denverites suddenly have made the Blue Jays their second favorite team. At the popular hat store Lids, in the Cherry Creek mall, two workers gushed about how often they\u2019re selling Blue Jays lids. At Fanzz Sports at the FlatIron Crossing mall, \u201cWe\u2019ve been getting asked more often about Blue Jays shirts and hats,\u201d store manager Nate Hill said. \u201cA lot of fans support Tulo and feel the Rockies didn\u2019t do their part in giving him a winning team. So they are sad he is gone, but a lot of fans say good for him.\u201d\n\nYes, Tulo\u2019s injuries were frustrating, and his robot approach to the game may have been off-putting for some, but here\u2019s a guy who proudly put on your pinstripes, who made the Rockies cool (for a little while), who approached the game the way you\u2019d want your favorite player to do so. In an era when we find out too much about off-field activities, it was refreshing to know that Tulo was the class dork when it came to homework assignments \u2014 getting better as a hitter, year-round.\n\nThese days in baseball, SS can mean shortstop or sample size. Fans are becoming acutely aware that a player\u2019s play in a small sample size isn\u2019t indelibly implicative of his abilities. OK. So with that caveat, let\u2019s look at Toronto\u2019s Tulo. Taz\u2019s dad has hit three home runs in 12 games (he pinch hit in the game he didn\u2019t start), while hitting 12 in 87 games for the Rockies. And his batting average is uncharacteristically low at .244, but he\u2019s walking at a higher clip, and his Toronto on-base percentage (.358) is actually higher than it was in Colorado (.348).\n\nSo check your Blue Jays box scores and wear those flat-brimmed Toronto hats proudly, Colorado. It\u2019s an homage to baseball and to the epitome of a baseball player.\n\nAnd, who knows, maybe Tulowitzki\u2019s Jays will make it to the World Series, perhaps against the St. Louis Cardinals and Tulo\u2019s old friend and ours, Matt Holliday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hochman: Troy Tulowitzki quick to make impact with Toronto", "title": "Hochman: Troy Tulowitzki quick to make impact with Toronto", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/10/hochman-troy-tulowitzki-quick-to-make-impact-with-toronto/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-10T19:45:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T06:32:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ecb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAll of a sudden, I\u2019ve become very interested in Toronto Blue Jays scores,\u201d Colorado manager Walt Weiss said Monday.\nWhen he was traded to Toronto, the Blue Jays were .500, even- steven, with a 50-50 record.\nAt the popular hat store Lids, in the Cherry Creek mall, two workers gushed about how often they\u2019re selling Blue Jays lids.\nSo check your Blue Jays box scores and wear those flat-brimmed Toronto hats proudly, Colorado.\nAt Fanzz Sports at the FlatIron Crossing mall, \u201cWe\u2019ve been getting asked more often about Blue Jays shirts and hats,\u201d store manager Nate Hill said."}
