And vice versa.\n\nThe infidelities, the gossip, the mother-in-law issues! Those angles, plus the way the media dutifully kept FDR\u2019s polio out of the headlines and his ungraceful efforts out of the newsreels contribute to our understanding of the times. (Burns has located a few glimpses of FDR struggling to stand or walk that are sadly illuminating.)\n\nSome will find the tone overly celebratory, at times almost worshipful of this American dynasty. Certainly it\u2019s not critical enough on crucial subjects. Students of the Holocaust will be aware of numerous books and films treating Roosevelt\u2019s indifference to the plight of European Jews in depth. Burns doesn\u2019t explore the Presidential inaction that cost so many lives.\n\nYet the trove of photographs is so engaging, the family dynamics so curious, the overall story so epic in nature, it\u2019s a rewarding investment of time.\n\nThe fact is, these one-percenters devoted much of their lives to improving the lot of the masses. That\u2019s a theme Burns returns to often: why would these privileged, wealthy people devote themselves to public service, sometimes pushing radical agendas, like the New Deal?\n\n\u201cWhat we do is sort of engage mystery,\u201d Burns said. \u201cWe don\u2019t solve it.\u201d\n\nThe scope of the project is enormous, and not just in terms of timespan. The film begins with Teddy\u2019s birth in 1858 and ends with Eleanor\u2019s death in 1962. The bare bones of the tale are bizarre enough: Theodore becomes the 26th president of the United States, and his beloved niece, Eleanor, marries his fifth cousin, Franklin, who becomes the 32nd president.\n\nTragic losses in the family and mental health issues heighten the drama. The changing culture, the gains of minorities and women, the isolationist attitudes of most Americans and the national impact of New York state politics are intriguing sidelights.\n\nThe unbelievably flashy Teddy, working the Rough Rider image apparently to over-compensate for his sickly start as a child; the chin-up, camera-ready aristocratic Franklin, seemingly built for caricature; and the wise, altruistic and long-suffering Eleanor become knowable personalities over the course of the project. (Check the episode guide here.)\n\nThe recurring suggestion is that somehow they felt it was their destiny to lead.\n\nIn his erudite way, Burns told TV critics that he and long-time collaborator Geoffrey Ward (who wrote the script) have always found the Roosevelts \u201cirresistible, deeply flawed, inspirational, complicated human beings central to an understanding of the national narrative that we call an American history.\u201d Most of the historians who weigh in (notably biographers Doris Kearns Goodwin and Jon Meacham) are inclined to downplay the flaws.\n\nBurns once again employs celebrities to read from key characters\u2019 diaries, letters and such. Meryl Streep, Paul Giamatti and Edward Hermann provide the voices of Eleanor, Teddy and Franklin, respectively. (Streep is wonderful, as usual, but seems to underplay the impossibly high register and sing-song phrasing of Eleanor\u2019s notorious voice.)\n\nThe film tiptoes around insinuations of Eleanor\u2019s affairs with women and is careful to avoid details about Franklin\u2019s better known liasons.\n\n\u201cThe film sticks to the facts,\u201d Burns said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get into psycho-biography in any way.\u201d\n\nAnd yet\u2026 there\u2019s plenty of psycho-bio offered in the interpretation of Teddy\u2019s hyper-masculine hijinks, in the triangle formed by Eleanor, Franklin and his mother (and their unusual living arrangements), and in the effects on the national psyche of FDR\u2019s outward optimism during wartime.\n\nFeel free to analyze.\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ostrowdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "PBS\u2019 \u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d by Ken Burns an addictive 14-hour, 7-night ride", "title": "PBS\u2019 \u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d by Ken Burns an addictive 14-hour, 7-night ride", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/08/pbs-the-roosevelts-by-ken-burns-an-addictive-14-hour-7-night-ride/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140908__AE12TVOSTROW-001p1.jpg", "height": 529}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140908__AE12TVOSTROW-001p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-08T12:14:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:30:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe19b2\"", "article_summary": "(Burns has located a few glimpses of FDR struggling to stand or walk that are sadly illuminating.)\nThe film tiptoes around insinuations of Eleanor\u2019s affairs with women and is careful to avoid details about Franklin\u2019s better known liasons.\nStudents of the Holocaust will be aware of numerous books and films treating Roosevelt\u2019s indifference to the plight of European Jews in depth.\n(Streep is wonderful, as usual, but seems to underplay the impossibly high register and sing-song phrasing of Eleanor\u2019s notorious voice.)\nMeryl Streep, Paul Giamatti and Edward Hermann provide the voices of Eleanor, Teddy and Franklin, respectively."}
