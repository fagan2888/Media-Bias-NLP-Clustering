A spokeswoman for Jimmy Carter says the former president does not need further treatment for cancer.

Carter apparently shared the good news on Sunday with those attending one of his regular Sunday school lessons at Maranatha Baptist Church in Carter's hometown of Plains, Georgia.

Carter's spokeswoman Deanna Congileo says doctors will continue to perform scans on the 91-year-old to ensure cancer has not returned. She says he will resume treatment if necessary.

Carter announced in December that a scan had found no sign of cancer on his brain. He said then that he would continue receiving doses of Keytruda, an immune-boosting drug intended to help his body seek out and destroy any cancer cells.

Carter revealed in August that he had been diagnosed with melanoma that spread to his brain.
