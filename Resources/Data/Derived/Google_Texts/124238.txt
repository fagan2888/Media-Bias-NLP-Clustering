This past weekend, an eclectic group of singers — from Boy George to David Byrne, Rufus Wainwright and Ezra Koenig — performed in “If I Loved You: Gentlemen Prefer Broadway.”

The show, created by Wainwright and musical director Stephen Oremus, was part of Toronto’s Luminato Festival. “If I Loved You: Gentlemen Prefer Broadway” began with Wainwright singing “I Hate Men” from the musical “Kiss Me Kate,” included duets with Byrne, Koenig and Josh Groban, and ended with the entire group singing “Summer Nights” from “Grease.”

“These songs are a testament to everything that’s great and good about Classic American pop culture,” wrote Wainwright in the program, according to Global News. Watch the highlights below, including the group singing “Summer Nights.”
