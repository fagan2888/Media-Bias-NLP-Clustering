Congress didn\u2019t do so. Here\u2019s what that means, why it matters, and what could happen next.\n\nWhat is this law?\n\nLegislators concerned about obesity and hunger passed the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act in 2010. It amended the original school lunch law from 1945, providing more money for food and setting stricter nutritional standards. It also provided some support for schools to tap into local food systems.\n\nMichelle Obama and the School Nutrition Association \u2014 a group representing cafeteria workers and school lunch coordinators \u2014 championed the bill. But the SNA and Obama have turned from allies to foes as they differed on interpreting the law\u2019s mandates. The SNA has said that the law\u2019s requirements for reducing salt and increasing whole grains are so strict that some kids have stopped eating the lunches, while Obama\u2019s team has argued that we need to take bold steps to improve America\u2019s diet.\n\nCongress blew past the deadline \u2014 what happens now?\n\nNothing! The funding for the existing programs will continue, and the deadlines for meeting the law\u2019s requirements will stand as they are. The reauthorization deadline is basically a reminder to lawmakers that they should look closely at the school lunch program and see what needs to be done. But both the SNA, and the various food advocacy groups I talked to, want a reauthorization, and see it as an opportunity to increase funding. If this pinchpenny Congress doesn\u2019t go for that \u2014 or does nothing, which is its favorite answer to all questions \u2014 then the law just stands as is.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nFeeding kids is a way to fight poverty and reduce the burden of food-related disease on the nation\u2019s and our households\u2019 budgets. In 2012, diabetes cost U.S. residents $245 billion, and the cost of obesity was estimated at $168 billion in 2010. (For comparison, the federal government spends about $140 billion a year on science, research, and development of new technology.) Without good food, kids get diet-related diseases, and they don\u2019t learn as well. This has alarmed both business leaders \u2014 who want well-educated employees \u2014 and military leaders. In a document called \u201cToo Fat To Fight,\u201d a group of retired generals has argued that diet-related disease is hurting the country\u2019s armed forces.\n\nIn a speech last month, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack argued for re-upping the Act with more programs, saying:\n\nI think I can make the case that what we are discussing today is significant in relationship to national security \u2014 and it\u2019s not the Iranian nuclear deal. I think I can make the case that it\u2019s central to the economic competitiveness of the United States in the future \u2014 especially against our Asian competitors, and it\u2019s not the Trans-Pacific Partnership discussions that will take place in Congress this month. And I think I can make the case that this is a way in which we can significantly reduce expenditures in health care \u2014 and it\u2019s not protecting the importance of the Affordable Care Act from any budget gimmicks that may take place. This is important work.\n\nNow, it\u2019s easy to make the case that something needs to be done to reduce diet-related disease. It\u2019s harder to argue that the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act is that something. But the general idea looks right on paper: The evidence suggests that if we want to trim America\u2019s waistline, we can forget about the gluten-free fad and concentrate on getting healthy food to the people who might not otherwise eat it.\n\nWill we get a reauthorization?\n\nOn the one hand, it seems unlikely that the current Congress will do anything. On the other hand, maybe the fact that lawmakers are refusing to collaborate on other bills will force them to search for something that they can find some kind of bipartisan agreement on.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the last bipartisan issues. And, especially for a new Speaker [of the House] going into a difficult year, I think it behooves Congress to work on an issue that benefits thousands of kids in every district,\u201d Ellen Teller, director of government affairs for the nonprofit Food Research and Action Council, told me.\n\nWhat would better-late-than-never reauthorization look like?\n\nOne draft proposal would provide money so that needy kids in pre-schools more than eight hours a day could have two snacks and a lunch (right now the government pays for one snack and a lunch). There are also efforts to make it easier for kids to get food over the summer. Teller would like to see some simple fixes to reduce the amount of paperwork kids need to get these benefits, and that organizations need to do to provide them. Groups like the SNA and the National School Boards Association want more wiggle room in the nutritional guidelines, and more money to improve food service.\n\nThe politics\n\nRepublicans and Democrats are working together on most of the ideas proposed for the reauthorization. The one sticking point is the question of whether to dial back the nutrition standards. And it\u2019s not all the standards: There are just a couple of very specific challenges that the school nutrition people are having with salt and whole grains.\n\nRhonda McCullick, the director of food service operations for the Park Hill School District in Missouri, told me that her kitchens went to 100 percent whole grains initially, but when they saw that kids stopped eating certain foods, they dialed that back. Now they use white flour for breadsticks and for rotini; all the other breads and pastas are whole grains. When it comes to salt, Park Hill is meeting the requirements, but those requirements are slated to tighten. \u201cOur ninth to twelfth graders get less than 1,420 milligrams of sodium a day. That is probably lower than you eat at home unless you are on a low-sodium diet,\u201d said McCullick, who is also a dietitian. \u201cWe are at a very healthy and good level.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s always a lot of dispute about what is healthy when it comes to diet \u2014 it\u2019s just not an exact science. But Teller points out that the Institute of Medicine, a highly respected body, set the recommendations. \u201cThe Institute of Medicine is the entity that decides, and the USDA implements, and I think that\u2019s how it should be,\u201d she said. \u201cNot Congress inserting its will.\u201d\n\nA different way of thinking?\n\nSo far, the debate over this act has made it look like a zero-sum game: Do we make it easier for the schools and jeopardize childrens\u2019 health? Or champion health and force schools and kids to bite the bullet of whole-wheat breadsticks?\n\nBut a recent piece in the New York Times suggested that it might be possible to have a little more flexibility in the foods that schools serve children, and improve health at the same time. Kate Murphy, the journalist who did that analysis, wrote:\n\nConsider that in France, where the childhood obesity rate is the lowest in the Western world, a typical four-course school lunch (cucumber salad with vinaigrette, salmon lasagna with spinach, fondue with baguette for dipping and fruit compote for dessert) would probably not pass muster under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, because of the refined grains, fat, salt and calories. Nor would the weekly piece of dark chocolate cake.\n\nInstead of pushing strict compliance, perhaps schools should take a page out of France\u2019s book and teach moderation, while giving students more time to enjoy their food, Murphy suggests.\n\nAmerica\u2019s school lunch programs have already improved a lot, and at this point we are down to some relatively small sticking points. If there were any room for compromise on the act\u2019s targets, it might allow a reauthorization bill to pass.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/school-lunch-obama-e1443827393207.jpg?w=50", "sailthru.author": "Nathanael Johnson", "pocket-site-verification": "600c3e036c3d0b8412be38a78681c7", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Grist", "description": "Advocates are hoping a new school lunch law will include some modest additions to the national programs.", "title": "Congress just missed a chance to help hungry kids.
