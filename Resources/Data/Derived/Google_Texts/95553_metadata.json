Unfortunately, modern-day medicine isn\u2019t as black and white as the administration seems to think. Take cancer care, my specialty. There are very few instances when the substitution of a less expensive cancer drug is appropriate or safe for patients. After all, there is a reason the newer, more advanced drugs\u2014such as those that helped former President Jimmy Carter put his cancer into remission\u2014are considered groundbreaking.\n\nThe Medicare drug payment rule is significant in several ways, perhaps most important of which is that it is yet another Obama use of the \u201cadministrative state,\u201d sometimes referred to as the fourth branch of government, to \u201cmake\u201d laws. Once again, as with Obamacare, illegal immigration, and, most recently, gender ideology executive action \u2013 to name just a few \u2013 Obama and his deputies are attempting an end run around Congress, \u201cmaking\u201d laws for Americans.\n\nIn the case of the current proposed Medicare rule, the rule-maker is the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) \u2013 an agency that was actually created by Obamacare itself. As progressive administrations have known for years, once bureaucratic agencies \u201cmake\u201d laws, Congress often shrinks from addressing their repeal or alteration in timely fashion, if at all. Consequently, Congress weakens itself as the legislative branch of government while Americans simply absorb changes to their lives made by unelected bureaucrats.\n\nWriting at Hillsdale College\u2019s Imprimus, Columbia Law School Professor Philip Hamburger describes how easy it has been for progressive politicians to gradually assume \u201cabsolute power\u201d over American citizens through the administrative state.\n\nHe writes:\n\n[O]ver the past 120 years, Americans have reestablished the very sort of power that the Constitution most centrally forbade. Administrative law is extra-legal in that it binds Americans not through law but through other mechanisms\u2014not through statutes but through regulations\u2014and not through the decisions of courts but through other adjudications. It is supra-legal in that it requires judges to put aside their independent judgment and defer to administrative power as if it were above the law\u2014which our judges do far more systematically than even the worst of 17th century English judges. And it is consolidated in that it combines the three powers of government\u2014legislative, executive, and judicial\u2014in administrative agencies.\n\nIn his opening statement at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, chairman Rep. Joe Pitts (R-PA) specifically cited the danger of the Medicare payment proposed rule due to administrative rule-making:\n\n[P]erhaps the most concerning aspect of this proposal is that it came from unelected bureaucrats in this Administration who made decisions behind closed doors affecting our seniors and their health care. What happened to the transparency and regard for stakeholders that we expect when considering proposals of this magnitude?\n\nAs Pitts states, the proposed rule regarding Medicare part B provider payment cuts is so controversial that 242 members of Congress have written to the Obama administration and asked that the rule be withdrawn.\n\nThe members\u2019 letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services states:\n\nCMS\u2019 proposed Medicare drug experiment would unnecessarily disrupt care for the sickest seniors who depend on Medicare, including those with cancer, macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, neurological disorders, and primary immunodeficiency diseases. Given these concerns outlined here, we ask that CMS withdraw this proposed rule that could endanger access to care for America\u2019s most vulnerable seniors.\n\nAdditionally, Rep. Larry Bucshon (R-IN) and Rep. Robert Dold (R-IL) have introduced legislation that would prohibit any further action on the Medicare Part B rule.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow unelected DC bureaucrats to run an experiment with Medicare beneficiaries that could disrupt care for the people who need medications most, including those with cancer, arthritis, and other diseases,\u201d Bucshon and Dold said in a statement. \u201cTheir unilateral decision to cut Medicare benefits will compromise the health of our nation\u2019s most vulnerable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nationwide Medicare Drug Funding Cuts Decided By Unelected Bureaucrats", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Nationwide Medicare Drug Funding Cuts Decided By Unelected Bureaucrats", "title": "Nationwide Medicare Drug Funding Cuts Decided By Unelected Bureaucrats - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/AP_16100507509147.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/05/25/nationwide-medicare-drug-funding-cuts-decided-by-unelected-bureaucrats/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nationwide Medicare Drug Funding Cuts Decided By Unelected Bureaucrats", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/AP_16100507509147.jpg", "title": "Nationwide Medicare Drug Funding Cuts Decided By Unelected Bureaucrats - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "administrative state, cancer drugs, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, concealed funding cuts, Medicare, Medicare drug payment rule, Medicare Part B, Obama administration, seniors,Big Government, Medicine, Obamacare,Medicare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "seniors", "published_time": "2016-05-25T07:48:25-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "There are very few instances when the substitution of a less expensive cancer drug is appropriate or safe for patients.\nThe proposed rule will affect all Medicare Part B providers and nearly all Medicare drugs by implementing a \u201ctest program\u201d nationwide that will impose a new Medicare payment for doctors and hospitals.\nIn the case of the current proposed Medicare rule, the rule-maker is the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) \u2013 an agency that was actually created by Obamacare itself.\nTake cancer care, my specialty.\nGiven these concerns outlined here, we ask that CMS withdraw this proposed rule that could endanger access to care for America\u2019s most vulnerable seniors."}
