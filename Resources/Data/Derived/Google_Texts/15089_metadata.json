It is not governed by the state Constitution section that guarantees public service retirement benefits, Freitag said.\n\nThere are two options, based on the plan\u2019s bylaws, for the approximately $400,000 remaining in the fund, he said:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Dissolve the fund, then pay out to retirees what they paid into the plan with interest, and use the remainder of the money \u2013 which would be composed of the CYFD\u2019s contributed matching dollars \u2014 to pay toward CYFD\u2019s $23 million obligation to the Public Service Personnel Retirement System. Freitag noted that there are likely retirees from the 1980s who have already received more than they contributed to the plan.\n\n\u2022 Let the fund continue to pay benefits until it runs out of money, which Freitag said could be \u201c10 or 12 years,\u201d depending on its return on investment.\n\n\u201cThe (fund\u2019s) bylaws do not have any provision to use additional taxpayer dollars to fund that forever,\u201d he added.\n\nUntil a full actuarial analysis is done, there\u2019s no way to know how much, if anything, anyone who hasn\u2019t yet turned 55, but would then be eligible for benefits, might be able to receive.\n\nThe reserve pension committee meets Wednesday, April 13, at 9 a.m. at The CYFD Administration Conference Room, 8555 E. Yavapai Road, and will discuss the fund\u2019s future, but, Freitag said, no decision on which plan would be implemented will be made.\n\n\n\nOne reservist\u2019s viewpoint\n\n\u201cAbout four or five months ago, I started hearing some rumblings,\u201d said one former reservist, who has yet to turn 55, and who asked to remain anonymous, \u201cand what the rumblings were, was that Central Yavapai was going to get rid of that pension fund. It was just going to go away.\u201d\n\nThe rumors were the only way he knew there was a problem, he said, because \u201cwe don\u2019t get newsletters, emails or anything from the people who are running our pension fund.\u201d\n\nThe former reservist said he understood that, if there were no more reservists to pay into the fund, CYFD would have to shut it down. But, he said, the retirees should expect to receive benefits from the funds in the account.\n\n\u201cIf they paid it out until the fund died, I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with that, that\u2019s business. But pay the benefits until the funds are gone,\u201d he said.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t like the idea of paying out a lump sum and then using what\u2019s left to pay PSPRS.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem right to me. For 35 years I have had an understanding that I had a pension benefit at $350 a month for the rest of my life,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt may be legal, but it\u2019s wrong.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.dcourier.com/news/2016/apr/12/central-yavapai-fire-district-ending-reserve-firef/", "site_name": "dcourier", "type": "article", "description": "The Central Yavapai Fire District is in the process of eliminating its reserve firefighter program, and, as a result, it will also shut down its pension fund for former reservists, ending payments to them.", "title": "Central Yavapai Fire District ending reserve firefighter program"}, "fb": {"app_id": 157422494277}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "title": "Central Yavapai Fire District ending reserve firefighter program"}, "viewport": "width=1020"}, "article_summary": "PRESCOTT \u2013 The Central Yavapai Fire District is in the process of eliminating its reserve firefighter program, and, as a result, it will also shut down its pension fund for former reservists, ending payments to them.\nIt is not governed by the state Constitution section that guarantees public service retirement benefits, Freitag said.\nThe plan in question is not related to the state\u2019s Public Service Personnel Retirement System; this is CYFD\u2019s own private pension plan.\n\u2022 Let the fund continue to pay benefits until it runs out of money, which Freitag said could be \u201c10 or 12 years,\u201d depending on its return on investment.\nFreitag noted that there are likely retirees from the 1980s who have already received more than they contributed to the plan."}
