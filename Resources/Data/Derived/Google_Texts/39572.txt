Acadia Healthcare Co. this week said it wrapped up three acquisitions of behavioral health centers in the United Kingdom. With the deal closing, Acadia adds six inpatient facilities in the overseas country, run by Partnerships in Care, the company's U.K. subsidiary.

According to Acadia, its U.K. business now manages 52 facilities, which generate a combined $35 million in annual revenue.

"These latest acquisitions demonstrate the ongoing potential we have to expand geographically in the U.K. and through the expansion of our services as we consolidate care pathways," Acadia CEO Joey Jacobs said in a statement.

Acadia has announced a slate of deals in 2015, several in the United Kingdom. In its largest deal, Acadia announced plans to buy Quality Addiction Management for $53 million.

Acadia is not the only healthcare provider expanding into the United Kingdom.

In March, for-profit hospital operator Tenet Healthcare said it would pay $215 million to buy Aspen Healthcare, a U.K.-based hospital operator.
