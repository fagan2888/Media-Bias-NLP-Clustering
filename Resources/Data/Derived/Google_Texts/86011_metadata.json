Steve Griebel said that officers were called to 815 Lotus Way around 12:50 p.m., on reports of a domestic violence dispute.\n\n\"We found there was a shooting at the house, and the victim did indeed die,\" Griebel said.\n\nThe victim was dead on scene, Griebel added. He has not been identified beyond his age, as the coroner has yet to notify his next of kin.\n\nSuspect Matthew Britton was arrested for first-degree murder, felony menacing and domestic violence.\n\n\"I'm not sure what other charges will be formally filed,\" Griebel said. \"That'll probably be later next week.\"\n\nLittle is known to this point about the dispute that preceded the alleged killing, but Griebel said that the two men involved were believed to have engaged in an argument that also involved an unidentified woman.\n\nPolice do not believe the three were involved in a \"love triangle,\" Griebel said.\n\nThe home at 815 Lotus Way is two blocks from Midway Park, where the city's annual Broomfield Days festival was ongoing at the time of the incident.\n\nAlex Burness: 303-473-1389, burnessa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/alex_burness", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-09-19T20:13:57-0600", "sailthru.author": "By Alex Burness \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28844605:view"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Broomfield police have  arrested a 33-year-old man on suspicion of first-degree murder, after a  5\n4-year-old man was found dead by gunshot wounds Saturday afternoon.", "title": "Broomfield police allege 54-year-old man murdered on Lotus Way", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0919/20150919__20DCAMURw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-09-19T23:36:58-0600", "endDate": "2025-09-19T23:35:50-0600", "news_keywords": "Camera: Top Stories, Camera: Top Stories news, Boulder Colorado Camera: Top Stories news, Boulder Colorado news, Camera: Top Stories Boulder news, Camera: Top Stories Colorado news, US Camera: Top Stories news, world Camera: Top Stories news.", "byline": "By Alex BurnessStaff", "pubDate": "2015-09-19T20:16:24-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-19T20:13:57-0600", "sailthru.title": "Broomfield police allege 54-year-old man murdered on Lotus Way", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0919/20150919__20DCAMURw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Broomfield police have  arrested a 33-year-old man on suspicion of first-degree murder, after a  5\n4-year-old man was found dead by gunshot wounds Saturday afternoon.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Broomfield police have  arrested a 33-year-old man on suspicion of first-degree murder, after a  5\n4-year-old man was found dead by gunshot wounds Saturday afternoon.", "title": "Broomfield police allege 54-year-old man murdered on Lotus Way"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0919/20150919__20DCAMURw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Britton (Broomfield Police Department)Broomfield police have arrested a 33-year-old man on suspicion of first-degree murder, after a 54-year-old man was found dead by gunshot wounds Saturday afternoon.\nThe home at 815 Lotus Way is two blocks from Midway Park, where the city's annual Broomfield Days festival was ongoing at the time of the incident.\nSteve Griebel said that officers were called to 815 Lotus Way around 12:50 p.m., on reports of a domestic violence dispute.\nSuspect Matthew Britton was arrested for first-degree murder, felony menacing and domestic violence.\n\"We found there was a shooting at the house, and the victim did indeed die,\" Griebel said."}
