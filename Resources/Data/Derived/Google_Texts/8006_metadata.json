Under the same logic, Cornyn's bill would allow people with concealed-carry permits granted in one state to keep their guns handy in other states that also let people carry concealed weapons.\n\n\"This is perfectly reasonable, except for the part about gun permits being anything whatsoever like drivers\u2019 licenses,\" as New York Times columnist Gail Collins points out.\n\nDifferent states, however, have different standards for concealed-carry permits.\n\nFor example, all a concealed-carry permit requires in Mississippi is the ability to fill out an application. Virginia offers online courses. And Florida grants concealed-carry permits to people who have never actually lived there \u2014 as long as they pay $112, according to Collins.\n\nRelated: The Army\u2019s New Handgun: A Weapon for Criminals?\n\nAll 50 states and DC allow concealed-carry to varying degrees, and most states require owners to apply for a permit, according to The Hill.\n\nCornyn argues concealed-carry reciprocity upholds both the Second Amendment and states' rights. Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia), John Thune (R-South Dakota), and David Vitter (R-Louisiana), all back him, which makes the bill a bipartisan endeavor.\n\nMany states already have reciprocity laws that honor concealed-carry permits granted in neighboring states with similar standards, according to The Guardian. Cornyn's bill, however, could permit people to carry guns in states where they couldn't even purchase one. For example, New York prohibits stalkers from possessing guns. New Hampshire doesn't, as the New York Daily News reported.\n\nUnder the bill, New York would have to honor New Hampshire's law, which would \"make the weakest state requirements the law of the land,\u201d John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told the Daily News. Also, police sometimes have no way to verify out-of-state conceal carry permits, as Collins notes.\n\nRelated: 10 Weapons You Won't Believe Are Legal\n\nCornyn attempted to pass the same bill back in April 2013 but failed with a Democratic majority in the Senate. Under Republican control in both houses, he could have a better chance now, The Hill speculates.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the National Rifle Association and other gun groups have rallied behind the proposed law.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Business Insider.\n\nRead more at Business Insider:\n\n7 incredible narco tanks built by Mexican Cartels\n\nHere's why you shouldn't wear the same pair of shoes every day\n\nWal-Mart is making 3 changes so people will want to shop there", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) introduced a bill last week that would essentially allow", "title": "New Bill Would Radically Change Concealed Carry Gun Limits", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/19/New-Bill-Would-Radically-Change-Concealed-Carry-Gun-Limits", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-01-20T061240Z_1_CBRE90J0H9N00_RTROPTP_2_USA-GUNS-AMMUNITION.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/19/New-Bill-Would-Radically-Change-Concealed-Carry-Gun-Limits", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-01-20T061240Z_1_CBRE90J0H9N00_RTROPTP_2_USA-GUNS-AMMUNITION.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) introduced a bill last week that would essentially allow", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) introduced a bill last week that would essentially allow gun-owners to carry concealed weapons around the country.\nCalled the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2015, the proposed law would \"treat state-issued concealed-carry permits like drivers licenses,\" according to his office's press release.\nAlso, police sometimes have no way to verify out-of-state conceal carry permits, as Collins notes.\nFor example, all a concealed-carry permit requires in Mississippi is the ability to fill out an application.\nUnder the same logic, Cornyn's bill would allow people with concealed-carry permits granted in one state to keep their guns handy in other states that also let people carry concealed weapons."}
