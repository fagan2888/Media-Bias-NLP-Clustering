$501 million dollars. Thatâ€™s the price tag for excess medical costs associated with the high rates of obesity in the Finger Lakes, according to a study by Excellus Blue Cross Blue Shield.

Two-thirds of the adults in the region are either overweight or obese. This puts them at greater risk for serious medical conditions and a diminished quality of life.

The problem is associated with higher risks for a number of chronic conditions, including diabetes, asthma, gallbladder disease, and depression.

On a whole, obesity costs the state 8.7 billion dollars in excess medical costs. Upstate accounts for 2.5 billion dollars of that cost, according to the study.

Obese New Yorkers spend 2 thousand dollars in annual incremental healthcare costs.

Excellus officials say sedentary desk jobs and eating out too often contribute to the problem.
