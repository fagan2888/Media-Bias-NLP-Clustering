It\u2019s one of those places where you can close your eyes, drop a finger on the list, and come up with a winner.\n\nTwo recent visits on a pair of frigid evenings found a kitchen operating in its winter wheelhouse, though I have eaten enough spring and summer dishes at this neighborhood spot to vouch for its way with warm-weather produce.\n\nTables seems equally assured in putting out small, shared plates and large entr\u00e9es that double-dog dare you to make room for dessert. (Though do consider the carrot cake with mascarpone icing.)\n\nOn one visit, we were in a noshing mood.\n\nThat meant a starter of deviled eggs. Theirs departed from the traditional mustardy picnic style and were sparked by a cornichon relish and a ring of a puckery caperberry-parsley vinaigrette.\n\nAnother hit was a roasted beet salad. It was decked with Brussels sprouts leaves that, in a stunning turn of events, had not been crispy-fried with bacon. They were raw but tender, with the cabbage-like flavor shining through against a cream sauce of mustard and smoked garlic.\n\nA flatbread bore a nice contrast of duck confit and tart goat cheese, speckled with roasted pecans and shaved mimolette. The latter is a French cow\u2019s milk cheese that is similar to Edam but is seasoned with annatto, which gives it some nuttiness.\n\nAnother visit saw a longer walk through the dinner menu.\n\nMushroom soup was nicely textured \u2014 I have endured some gloppy versions of late \u2014 and bore a crostini with a smear of Meyer lemon spread. The combo sounded a tad counterintuitive, but it worked beautifully.\n\nSweetbreads \u2014 that sounds so much more appetizing than \u201cthymus glands,\u201d doesn\u2019t it? \u2014 were saut\u00e9ed with baby parsnips and bacon. They were crispy, with just enough give in the texture.\n\nTwo entr\u00e9es stood out, a pork chop and a duck breast, although both left me second-guessing myself when a neighboring diner\u2019s New York strip arrived, paired with a horseradish Yorkshire pudding with a mushroom-burgundy sauce.\n\nThe pork chop was beautifully cross-hatched on the grill. It was just a bit on the dry side, despite the waiter\u2019s assurance that the kitchen would cook it medium rare. It came with a coarse-ground, porridge-y polenta with a dried cherry sauce.\n\nThe duck breast was crispy and gleamed under a spicy pepper jelly glaze. It was paired with a moist persimmon-herb bread pudding, perfect on a bone-cold night.\n\nBarrett and Vitale have an eye for design detail, too. There is a rustic, homey quality to the room, belying the plain-Jane entrance on a commercial stretch of Kearney Street running between East 22nd and 23rd avenues.\n\nThe wooden floors gleam, and distressed wooden doors hang as art pieces on the walls.\n\nLike the rest of the restaurant, the bar was expanded several months ago. This makes it a bit of a magnet for neighborhood residents seeking some of the excellent cocktails, such as the House Setting Sun, which does, in fact, have an orange glow. The wine list is well-edited, with plenty of by-the-glass options, and it trots the globe.\n\nAbout the service: It is friendly and accommodating, and the folks at the host stand work hard to make everyone feel welcome. They\u2019re total pros, and when rail service starts running from Union Station to DIA, you get the feeling they would make terrific station masters.\n\nIn short, Tables offers plenty of reasons to pull up a chair.\n\nWilliam Porter: 303-954-1877, wporter@denverpost.com or twitter.com/williamporterdp\n\nTABLES\n\nContemporary American.\n\n2267 Kearney St. 303-388-0299 tablesonkearney.com\n\n*** Great\n\nAtmosphere: Charming, cozy atmosphere that belies the storefront entrance.\n\nService: Efficient and knowledgeable, with friendly pros at the host stand\n\nBeverages: Beer, wine, cocktails\n\nPlates: Small and shared, $6-$15; entr\u00e9es, $19-$30; desserts, $7\n\nHours: Tuesday-Saturday, 5-9:30 p.m.\n\nDetails: Street parking.
