The study found that many publicly insured patients were using the emergency room for non-emergencies.\n\n\u201cIncreasing ED use by Medicaid beneficiaries could reflect decreasing access to primary care,\u201d the study authors wrote.\n\nThe study also noted that the 2014 healthcare law changes, which extend Medicaid coverage in some states, will likely make the problem worse.\n\n\u201cA lot of people make the assumption that once someone is insured, they will automatically get access to a primary care physician,\u201d study author Renee Y. Hsia, M.D., M.Sc., of the University of California, San Francisco, told Healthline.\n\n\u201cMany patients who are already on Medicaid have difficulty finding access to both primary care doctors and specialists. Newly insured Medicaid patients may likely experience similar\u2014if not even more severe\u2014problems, since even more people are now \u2018covered,\u2019 thereby placing further demands on an over-saturated system,\u201d Hsia added.\n\nDisappearing Doctors\n\nThe U.S. is in a primary care physician drought, and there\u2019s little relief on the horizon. A senate report from earlier this year said the country is currently short 16,000 primary care physicians.\n\nAnd many current primary care doctors are choosing to opt out of Medicaid care altogether.\n\n\u201cWe know from other work that across the nation, over 30 percent of physicians are unwilling to take on new Medicaid patients; in California, this is even higher at 56 percent,\u201d Hsia said.\n\nOver the past few years, many states have decreased Medicaid reimbursement payments to doctors. This decrease in Medicaid dollars may cause them to sit out of the program.\n\nThat sends primary care patients to the ER window. A 2011 Centers for Disease Control survey found that nearly 80 percent of adults visited the ER due to lack of access to other providers.\n\n\u201cThere is not one solution or cure for this problem,\u201d Hsia said. \u201cIt will require a multi-faceted approach to address the deficiencies in our system.\u201d\n\nHsia suggested finding creative ways to convince physicians to open their offices to Medicaid patients. She said that expanding primary care to include nurse practitioners could help as well.\n\nShe also noted that the ACA has a provision to increase Medicaid doctor reimbursement rates to match Medicare rates, though only for two years.\n\nMedicaid and Medicare Explained\n\nThe Doctor Is Not In\n\nSan Diego doctor Ted Mazer told Healthline, \u201cThe JAMA article and the declining access to care under current conditions for Medi-Cal (California\u2019s version of Medicaid) patients should be seen as writing on the wall.\u201d\n\nMazer fought against a 10 percent cut to Medi-Cal reimbursement, but the state ultimately won, earning the right to cut payments as long as service remained sufficient.\n\nEven without looming cuts, Mazer says payouts are already too low. \u201cIn San Diego,\u201d he said, \u201cMedicare pays about $75 for a routine follow up visit for both primary and specialty offices, while Medi-Cal pays $24, and as of now that will be further reduced 10 percent in the next month.\u201d\n\nMazer doesn\u2019t believe the federal Medicaid/Medicare matching funds supplied by the ACA will attract primary care physicians to work with Medi-Cal patients. \u201cEven primary care physicians who might think of doing so fret over what might happen at the end of 2014 when the feds begin to reduce the payment and the state has to start picking up some of the costs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cJust as we add 1 to 2 million new beneficiaries to Medi-Cal under ACA expansion, [the state] is going to sustain the program by increasing state payments? Not likely,\u201d he added.\n\nMazer proposes some solutions, including the use of expanded primary care medical teams, including nurses, under doctor supervision. He believes tax incentives, liability protections for safety net care, and loan forgiveness for new doctors could also help. \u201cAnd for goodness sake,\u201d he adds, \u201ccuts are not the way to go when we are already paid at the lowest rates in the nation.\u201d\n\nAs care providers and public payers across the country work to balance their books, the Medicaid expansion nears. It will be up to Medicaid patients, who earn less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, to decide where to go for care.\n\n\u201cIt is crucial to remember that we cannot place blame on patients for seeking care in the emergency department,\u201d Hsia said. \u201cEDs are the only place where all patients can receive care regardless of their ability to pay.\u201d\n\nMore on Healthline", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "primary care, Medicaid, Medi-Cal, Medicare, ACA, Obamacare, hospital, ER", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "A new study shows that increased Medicaid coverage, combined with a lack of primary care doctors, could overextend emergency departments.", "title": "Without More Primary Care Doctors Medicaid's Newly Insured Will Stress ERs", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/policy-without-more-doctors-medicaid-patients-will-fill-ers-092013", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/emergencyroom.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/emergencyroom.jpg", "description": "A new study shows that increased Medicaid coverage, combined with a lack of primary care doctors, could overextend emergency departments.", "card": "summary", "title": "Without More Primary Care Doctors Medicaid's Newly Insured Will Stress ERs"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-20", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A new study shows that increased Medicaid coverage, combined with a lack of primary care doctors, could overextend emergency departments."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd963\"", "article_summary": "And many current primary care doctors are choosing to opt out of Medicaid care altogether.\nDisappearing DoctorsThe U.S. is in a primary care physician drought, and there\u2019s little relief on the horizon.\nA senate report from earlier this year said the country is currently short 16,000 primary care physicians.\nThat sends primary care patients to the ER window.\nMazer proposes some solutions, including the use of expanded primary care medical teams, including nurses, under doctor supervision."}
