Bobby Jindal, who declared his candidacy for president last Wednesday, is passionate about what he calls \u201creligious freedom.\u201d In speech after speech over recent years, the Indian-American governor \u2013 a convert from Hinduism to Catholicism in his teens \u2013 warns Christian evangelical audiences that liberals are hell-bent on squelching religious speech.\n\nOn Friday, after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling affirming same-sex marriage rights, Jindal reacted with predictable outrage. He cast the ruling as an assault on Christian values.\n\n\u201cThis decision will pave the way for an all out assault against the religious freedom rights of Christians who disagree with this decision,\u201d Jindal said in his statement. \u201cThis ruling must not be used as pretext by Washington to erode our right to religious liberty.\n\n\u201cThe government should not force those who have sincerely held religious beliefs about marriage to participate in these ceremonies,\u201d Jindal added, previewing a struggle over whether businesses may deny services to same-sex couples. \u201cThat would be a clear violation of America\u2019s long held commitment to religious liberty as protected in the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nLong before he declared his candidacy, some political observers pegged Jindal as the presidential hopeful most likely to rely on his policy chops to win support for a White House bid (he ran the University of Louisiana System, served as the state\u2019s secretary of Health and Hospitals and was an assistant secretary of George W. Bush\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services).\n\nInstead, the former Rhodes scholar has emerged as the candidate most eager to cash in on his religious faith.\n\nJindal routinely speaks at churches and religious gatherings in early primary and caucus states. He delivered the spring 2014 commencement speech at Virginia\u2019s Liberty University, asking the graduates, \u201cWhat happens when our government decides it no longer needs a \u2018moral and religious people?'\u201d\n\nThis is how Jindal answered his question: \u201cIt is a war \u2014 a silent war \u2014 against religious liberty. This war is waged in our courts and in the halls of political power. It is pursued with grim and relentless determination by a group of like-minded elites, determined to transform the country from a land sustained by faith \u2014 into a land where faith is silenced, privatized, and circumscribed.\u201d\n\nJindal clearly wants to be seen as religion\u2019s field general in this imaginary war. Last January, Jindal presided over a controversial prayer rally, \u201cThe Response,\u201d on the campus of Louisiana State University. The American Family Association, identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a \u201chate group,\u201d helped sponsor the event. Moments before he announced for president at a convention center in Kenner, Louisiana (just outside New Orleans), Jindal invited photographers to snap pictures of him in a prayer circle of evangelical pastors.\n\nIn December 2013, when Phil Robertson, of A&E\u2019s once-popular reality show \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d was caught making homophobic remarks in a GQ article, Jindal rushed to Robertson\u2019s defense. He claimed that the network\u2019s brief suspension of the show and the criticism of Robertson\u2019s odious remarks were a violation of the reality star\u2019s free speech rights. \u201cI remember when TV networks believed in the First Amendment,\u201d Jindal said in defense of Robertson, now an icon of the religious right. \u201cIt is a messed up situation when Miley Cyrus gets a laugh, and Phil Robertson gets suspended \u201d\n\nIn March, after the governors of Indiana and Arkansas withdrew their support of legislation that permitted businesses to refuse services to same-sex couples, Jindal stepped boldly into the fray of religious intolerance. In his speech opening the 2015 Louisiana Legislature in April, Jindal pushed a bill similar to those proposed in Arkansas and Indiana, counting it among his top priorities.\n\n\u201cThere used to be bipartisan support for the principle of religious liberty,\u201d Jindal told lawmakers. \u201cHowever, these days, some think diversity of belief is too risky and scary to be tolerated. But that\u2019s wrong \u2026 In the United States, a state should not be able to take adverse action against an individual for holding a sincerely held religious view regarding marriage. That would be true discrimination.\u201d\n\nUnimpressed and far more concerned about a $1.6 billion budget shortfall, legislators quickly spiked the bill. Undeterred, Jindal issued a legally questionable executive order that prohibits local and state government officials from taking any action against businesses that discriminate against same-sex couples. \u201cThis is even bigger than marriage,\u201d Jindal said, defending his order. \u201cIt\u2019s the right to live your lives 24 hours a day, seven days a week, according to your sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nWhen some business leaders in Louisiana, including IBM executives, expressed concern over the order, Jindal responded like the culture warrior he pretends to be: \u201cMy warning to those corporate leaders is: If you think you are going to come to Louisiana and bully the governor of Louisiana, don\u2019t waste your breath.\u201d\n\nEven before he began ramping up his presidential campaign and making \u201creligious freedom\u201d a major theme of his speeches, Jindal eagerly pandered to the religious right.\n\nHe supported and signed legislation in 2008, which allows the teaching of creationism in Louisiana public schools. Asked recently about his views on evolution, the Brown University biology graduate said, \u201cLet\u2019s teach them about the big bang theory, let\u2019s teach them about evolution \u2013 I\u2019ve got no problem if a school board, a local school board, says we want to teach our kids about creationism, that people, some people, have these beliefs as well, let\u2019s teach them about \u2018intelligent design.\u2019\u201d\n\nJindal has also been an enthusiastic supporter of removing children from \u201cfailing\u201d public schools and enrolling them, at state expense, in private schools. The vast majority of the schools participating in what Jindal calls a \u201cscholarship\u201d program are substandard, church-based schools that have proven no better, and often worse, than the schools from which the students came. Many of these schools refuse to teach evolution in their science courses.\n\nNot surprisingly, Jindal\u2019s rhetoric and actions on these and other controversial matters have earned him scorn and criticism from many quarters.\n\n\u201cAs an orthodox Jewish man and a rabbi, I find Jindal\u2019s pursuit of this bill\u2019s passage to be sacrilegious and offensive,\u201d Orthodox Rabbi Gabriel Greenberg wrote in the New Orleans Times-Picayune in April after Jindal backed the same-sex discrimination bill. \u201cWhy would our political leadership \u2014 and particularly those who identify as religious \u2014 choose to seek further action and legislation against the very sectors of our society who are already marginalized and persecuted?\u201d\n\nAfter Jindal\u2019s action, an indignant New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu issued his own executive order, protecting gay couples in his city from discrimination. \u201cIn New Orleans, we believe religious liberty and freedoms should be protected and discrimination prohibited, and we have passed our own laws to reflect that principle,\u201d Landrieu said, adding that his counter-order was \u201can important, symbolic affirmation that discrimination in any form will not be tolerated in New Orleans \u2014 and it should not be tolerated anywhere in Louisiana.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Rhodes scholar seemed likely to run for president on policy.
