An 18-year-old Homestead woman who underwent breast augmentation surgery at Coral Gables Cosmetic Center three weeks ago has been in a coma ever since at Mercy Hospital, the Miami Herald reports. The family says the medical staff there has not been optimistic.



The woman, Linda Perez, has a 3-year-old son, lives with her parents and works at an adult nightclub, her mother told The Herald. Family members said they hired an attorney to help them get information after a week went by and no one would tell them what happened.



The Herald reports that the attorney is focused on the anesthesiologist, Dr. Mario Alberto Diaz, who appears not to be a board-certified anesthesiologist. Diaz served time in prison for illegal sale of pills online, but was allowed to keep his Florida medical license.
