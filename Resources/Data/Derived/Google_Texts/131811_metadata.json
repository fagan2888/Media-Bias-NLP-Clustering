But there\u2019s another side to the story. (Photo: iStock)\n\nThe average cost of maternity care and delivery without complications is $23,000. With complications, that number jumps steeply. Imagine facing that cost if you\u2019re uninsured? For approximately 13 percent of the over 6 million women who become pregnant yearly, these costs are a harsh reality.\n\nBut there\u2019s a strong movement that\u2019s trying to change that.\n\nToday, Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ) led 54 members of Congress in a letter to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell urging the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish pregnancy as a \u201cqualifying life event,\u201d triggering a 60-day special open enrollment period in the federal health insurance exchange for women who have become pregnant.\n\nThis action comes just weeks after a coalition of over 20 organizations including the March of Dimes, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), Planned Parenthood, and Young Invincibles began lobbying the Obama administration and HHS to amend its current policy regarding open enrollment for insurance through the Healthcare.gov marketplace, asking that a special enrollment period (SEP) be granted that allows women to enroll in an insurance plan upon learning of a pregnancy.\n\nCurrently, no such exceptions are made, though a SEP is offered at the time of birth, and a woman can enroll her newborn child then.\n\nThe advocacy coalition, having grown to include 32 organizations, also sent a separate letter today to Secretary Burwell, as well as petition that had gained over 50,000 signatures from American citizens voicing their support for the measure.\n\nIn their letter the Congressional coalition writes:\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has made historic progress towards ending discrimination against women in the health insurance market by requiring plans to cover maternity care as an Essential Health Benefit. This is a critical protection \u2014 good maternity care is essential for the well-being of women and children. Studies show that women who do not receive prenatal care are more likely to have an infant die in the first month after birth, and maternal mortality rates are up to four times higher for women who do not receive prenatal care than for women who do. \u2026 However, many women are still vulnerable. If a woman becomes pregnant while uninsured at a time outside of the annual Open Enrollment period, or is enrolled in a grandfathered plan that does not cover maternity services, she will not be able to access coverage for maternity care.\u201d\n\nHHS had previously issued a statement stating that, at this time, their final ruling on the matter would deny the creation of a SEP for pregnant women. In a statement regarding HHS\u2019s current decision, Christina Postolowski, the Health Policy Manager for Young Invincibles, a national organization working to engage young adults on issues such as higher education, health care, and jobs, said, \u201cWe believe the Department of Health and Human Services can and should fix this problem. The average cost of maternity care and delivery without complications is $23,000. HHS has stood on the side of expanding access to coverage for millions of people \u2014 that shouldn\u2019t change now. We urge the Department to issue immediate guidance to classify pregnancy as a trigger for Special Enrollment.\u201d\n\nRelated: It\u2019s 10 Times Harder To Get Pregnant At 43 Than At 37\n\nA spokesperson for Planned Parenthood explained to Yahoo Health that currently, the open enrollment period to purchase insurance through the marketplace is once every year, for about 3 months a year. If an individual does not sign up during that time, there\u2019s no chance to sign up outside of that time without meeting certain conditions such as giving birth or adopting a child. And yet, a woman who finds out she\u2019s pregnant \u2014 but doesn\u2019t have coverage and wants pre-natal care \u2014 can\u2019t sign-up for insurance outside of open enrollment. What the coalition is advocating for is to establish a special enrollment period (SEP) for when a woman finds out she\u2019s pregnant so women can enroll when they become pregnant and get the care they need.\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "Becoming pregnant without insurance will cost tens of thousands of dollars, at the very least.
