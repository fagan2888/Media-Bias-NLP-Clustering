As the Affordable Care Act continues to find its footing and the system grows stronger, its detractors are finding that their arguments are running into each other in unhelpful ways.\n\nFor example, for years, Republicans have argued that \u201cObamacare\u201d redistributes wealth in such a way as to punish the wealthy. The party stuck to that line, right up until Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) argued the exact opposite: \u201d[Obamacare] exacerbates income inequality. This is why the rich have gotten richer under President Obama.\u201d\n\nYou can say the ACA goes too far to help the poor, or the ACA goes too far to help the rich, but you shouldn\u2019t say both at the same time.\n\nThe same is true of enrollment numbers \u2013 critics of the law tend to complain that enrollment totals to date are both too high and too low.\n\nLikewise, the right has long believed the health care law goes too far to help bring coverage to the uninsured. Now, however, some conservatives are arguing it doesn\u2019t go far enough. Consider Charles Krauthammer\u2019s take last night on Fox News:\n\n\u201c[Y]ou get this crazy paradox where the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, has projected that the number of uninsured Americans in 10 years will be 31 million. \u201cWhen Obama launched Obamacare in 2009, he explained the moral imperative was because there were 30 million uninsured Americans. So here we\u2019re going to go through a complete revolution of one-sixth of the U.S. economy, the dislocation of doctors, hospitals, patients, and plans everywhere, including insurers, in order to achieve a result in a decade where we have essentially the same number of uninsured. So what was this all about?\u201d\n\nJohn Podhoretz of the New York Post raised a similar argument last week. New York Post\n\nThe problem, of course, isn\u2019t just the rhetorical contradiction. More to the point, these ACA critics are simply wrong.\n\nPart of the trouble seems to be some confusion over that the Congressional Budget Office actually said. Jonathan Cohn had a good piece on this last week.\n\nCBO actually starts with a much higher baseline for the number of uninsured \u2013 57 million non-elderly Americans \u2013 because of the data it uses. (Estimates of the uninsured vary a lot depending on which survey you choose and how you define the term.) And the Affordable Care Act, according to CBO, will reduce that number significantly. Without the law, CBO says, the number of uninsured Americans would stay at roughly 57 million. But thanks to the various coverage expansions \u2013 not just the creation of new private insurance marketplaces, but also the expansion of Medicaid and ability of young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 plans \u2013 the number of uninsured will decline markedly. By 2017, according to CBO, Obamacare will have reduced the number of Americans without insurance by nearly half \u2013 or more, if you don\u2019t count undocumented workers.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the number of uninsured Americans will be even lower still if more \u201cred\u201d states embraced Medicaid expansion, but conservative opponents of the law don\u2019t want that to happen, either.\n\nGiven this, it\u2019s hard to understand what in the world Krauthammer was even trying to say. He told a national television audience that the CBO found that the nation will \u201chave essentially the same number of uninsured\u201d in the near future as we did in 2009. That\u2019s plainly, demonstrably wrong \u2013 it\u2019s not what the CBO said and it\u2019s not consistent with any projections from any source.\n\nIf conservative critics of the law want to argue that expanding coverage isn\u2019t a worthwhile goal, that\u2019s fine. If they believe there are better ways to reach that goal, that\u2019s fine, too.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Obamacare critics have said the law goes too far in helping the uninsured.
