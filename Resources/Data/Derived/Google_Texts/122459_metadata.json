Seventy-thousand. It was heartbreaking and it gave me greater resolve,\" he said. \"I said, 'Well then let's do one for every single one of them. Let's not leave anybody out.'\"\n\nAmong the worshippers were Schaumburg residents Laura and Will McKinney, members of the church for 30 years.\n\n\"These people are basically alone. They're unloved. We're reaching out with our love to touch them, particularly at this time of year,\" Will McKinney said.\n\nHeather Larson, executive pastor, said the items, including the bags, were cleared with the Illinois Department of Corrections.\n\n\"Once we give the gifts, it's in their hands,\" she said, adding that the treats are the items most in demand.\n\nThe church began distributing the care packages two years ago, but this is the first year all state prisoners are expected to receive one. The church has been ministering to the incarcerated for years, and its members often visit prisoners.\n\n\"When an iron door closes behind you and you hear the click, you realize, well now I'm locked in while I'm going to do my pastoral visit here, but I anticipate the click of the key to let me out,\" Hybels said of a visit to prison. \"For a prisoner, they hear the final click -- and many of the prisoners I visit are never going to get out.\"\n\nDuring Sunday service, Steve Carter, director of evangelism, talked about a recent visit to Stateville Correctional Center near Joliet, where one of the volunteers shouted the last two syllables of the word hallelujah, getting the prisoners in the cells to respond.\n\nCarter related the prison ministry to scripture, referring to the apostle Paul's being held captive.\n\nThe service also featured an interview between Hybels and Burl Cain, warden of the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola. Cain has transformed his prison, which now has 28 churches functioning within its grounds.\n\nA video was shown in the service, containing testimony from a church volunteer named \"Joe,\" who served time in prison for attempted murder and after being released, attended services and found enlightenment.\n\nBrandon Grissom of Elgin, who led the worship during the service, told the audience about how he experienced the emotional strain and the complexity of having family members in the prison system.\n\n\"I'm so thankful that we're part of a church that has a vision for extending the love of Christ to those who are incarcerated,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The standard paper bags were packed with a few simple items -- Krispy Kreme treats, inspirational books, a journal and a Christmas card with a calendar.
