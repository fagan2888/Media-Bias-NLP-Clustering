The wonkiest conservative governor in America versus America\u2019s most famous populist conservative senator, debating an issue that\u2019s helped define both of their careers? I\u2019d watch. You\u2019d watch. Some Iowa voters would watch. It\u2019s a no-brainer \u2026 for everyone except Ted Cruz.\n\nWin/win for Jindal, though. If Cruz declines, then Sen. Debate Champion looks like a chicken. If he accepts, then Jindal gets a forum to show off his health-policy chops opposite the guy who\u2019s blocking his lane in Iowa.\n\n\u201cHe said he\u2019ll debate anyone, anytime, so let\u2019s do it in Milwaukee,\u201d Jindal said in an interview with The Washington Post. \u201cI\u2019m happy to do it.\u201d Jindal pointed to Cruz\u2019s recent comments on Fox News as the impetus for calling him out. \u201cI\u2019m happy to have as many debates as we can,\u201d Cruz said on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m happy to debate anywhere, anytime.\u201d Jindal said he\u2019d like his debate with Cruz, if it ever happened, to focus on their plans for replacing President Obama\u2019s health-care law. He also questioned the significance of Cruz\u2019s efforts in 2013 to shut down the government. \u201cYou get Ted Cruz who wants to shut down the government, but he\u2019s never even come up with his own plan,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cWe\u2019ve written our own plan and campaigned on it, rather than just complaining about Obamacare.\u201d\n\nIt occurs to me that Cruz is the only top-tier candidate who really hasn\u2019t taken a punch yet from the rest of the field. Trump\u2019s spent four months swinging at Jeb Bush, then Ben Carson, and now Marco Rubio, and in return has taken shots from Bush and Rubio (and Jindal, Carly Fiorina, Rick Perry, Lindsey Graham, etc). Only Cruz among the big boys remains unscathed, partly because he\u2019s studiously avoided conflict with Trump and partly because he\u2019s not polling well enough yet to force Rubio or Bush to worry about him. A one-on-one with Jindal would leave him open to the sort of attack he\u2019s going to hear endlessly once his polls tick up a bit further, that he\u2019s all hat and no cattle on policy. If you want someone to grandstand about what a weak leader Mitch McConnell is, he\u2019s your man. If you want someone with a detailed policy vision for America, a la Mike Lee or Paul Ryan \u2014 or Bobby Jindal \u2014 then not so much. That\u2019ll be the core attack on Cruz once the attacks begin. Why would he invite that attack to happen any sooner than it needs to by doing Jindal a favor and letting him share the spotlight for an evening? Cruz doesn\u2019t need to prove his debate skills now; anyone who\u2019s still unconvinced need only wait a month or two, when he\u2019s inevitably onstage as one of the final two or three candidates and will have much more speaking time to do his thing.\n\nIf/when Cruz turns down the offer, Jindal should challenge Christie to debate \u2014 twice, maybe, with one in Jindal\u2019s key state of Iowa and the other in Christie\u2019s key state of New Hampshire. They\u2019re the two most formidable lower-polling candidates and they\u2019ve each showed some strength in their key state, with Jindal hitting six percent in one poll of IA and Christie hitting eight percent in a poll of NH. They\u2019d both benefit from the extra attention. And if the debates turn out to be a draw locally, it might convince the networks to change their criteria going forward to get the two of them onstage for the national debates. What do they have to lose?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cYou get Ted Cruz who wants to shut down the government, but he\u2019s never even come up with his own plan.\u201d", "title": "Oh yes: Bobby Jindal challenges Ted Cruz to one-on-one debate over ObamaCare", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/11/06/oh-yes-bobby-jindal-challenges-ted-cruz-to-one-on-one-debate-over-obamacare/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-06T22:21:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-07T15:16:06+00:00"}, "keywords": "cruz, debate, jindal, ObamaCare, one on one,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Oh yes: Bobby Jindal challenges Ted Cruz to one-on-one debate over ObamaCareposted at 5:21 pm on November 6, 2015 by AllahpunditWho told you from the beginning that one-on-one debates were the only way to go?\nIt\u2019s a no-brainer \u2026 for everyone except Ted Cruz.\n\u201cYou get Ted Cruz who wants to shut down the government, but he\u2019s never even come up with his own plan,\u201d Jindal said.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to debate anywhere, anytime.\u201d Jindal said he\u2019d like his debate with Cruz, if it ever happened, to focus on their plans for replacing President Obama\u2019s health-care law.\n\u201cHe said he\u2019ll debate anyone, anytime, so let\u2019s do it in Milwaukee,\u201d Jindal said in an interview with The Washington Post."}
