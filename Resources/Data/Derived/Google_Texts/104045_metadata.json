On our never-ending quest to find the fountain of youth, we have spent hundreds and hundreds on facial creams and bizarre beauty treatments created by cosmetic companies. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has cracked down on one particular offender \u2014 L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA and its product lines, Lanc\u00f4me G\u00e9nifique and L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris Youth Code \u2014 that falsely claimed to fight aging by targeting consumers\u2019 genes, based on the concept of \u201cgene science.\u201d\n\nPhoto courtesy of FTC. FTC\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al agreed to settle the FTC charges of \u201cdeceptive advertising\u201d about their two products in question. The FTC complaint explained the cosmetics company made false and unsubstantiated claims that its skincare products provided anti-aging benefits. \u201cIt would be nice if cosmetics could alter our genes and turn back time,\u201d said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a FTC statement released Monday. \u201cBut L\u2019Or\u00e9al couldn\u2019t support these claims.\"\n\nPhoto courtesy of FTC. FTC\n\nIn national advertising campaigns ranging from television to social media outlets, L\u2019Or\u00e9al claimed its G\u00e9nifique products were \u201cclinically proven\u201d to \u201cboost genes\u201d activity and to stimulate the production of youth proteins that would cause \u201cvisibly younger skin in just 7 days.\u201d Similarly, for its Youth Code products, L\u2019Or\u00e9al touted in both English- and Spanish-language advertisements the \u201cnew era of skincare: gene science,\u201d and how consumers would have the ability to \u201ccrack the code to younger acting skin.\u201d\n\nUnder the administrative settlement, L\u2019Or\u00e9al is now prohibited from claiming that any Lanc\u00f4me brand or L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris brand facial skincare product targets or boosts the activity of genes to make the skin look or act younger. The cosmetic company would highlight its products could respond five times faster to aggressors like stress, fatigue, and aging. Moreover, the settlement goes on to say L\u2019Or\u00e9al is prohibited from making claims that Lanc\u00f4me brand and L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris brand products affect genes, unless the claims are supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.\n\nKristina Schake, L'Or\u00e9al USA chief communications officer, said in a separate statement on Monday: \"The claims at issue in this agreement have not been used for some time now, as the company constantly refreshes its advertising,\" The Huffington Post reported. \"The safety, quality and effectiveness of the company's products were never in question.\"\n\nThe company charged as much as $132 per container of their G\u00e9nifique product since its debut in February 2009 at Lanc\u00f4me counters in department stores and at beauty specialty stores. Youth Code costs up to $25 per container since November 2010, being sold at major retail stores across the U.S. The beauty products were an expensive lie to its consumers.\n\nDespite the recent settlement, this isn\u2019t the first time L'Or\u00e9al\u2019s products have been called into question. In 2012, U.S. regulators warned the company it had gone too far with its claims about some of its expensive antiwrinkle products, and warned sales could stop if they didn\u2019t tone down their claims, The Wall Street Journal reported. The Food and Drug Administration also criticized the company\u2019s marketing claims, acknowledging a product which claimed it \"boosts the activity of genes and stimulates the production of youth proteins.\"\n\nWhile L'Or\u00e9al isn\u2019t the only company known to tout its products benefits, possibly including false advertising, there are still beauty product aficionados who look for hope in a jar. If these facial creams could actually achieve similar effects to medical procedures, they would constitute as drugs, rather than beauty products. Rather than ruminate over what skincare products can reverse the aging process, try these three scientifically-proven foods that can boost your genes and leave your skin looking young and healthy.\n\n1. Drink Tea\n\nChoose tea, specifically white tea, to reduce your risk of cancer, rehumatoid arthritis, and even age-associated wrinkles. A 2009 study found the small amounts of enzymes in white tea could protect the body from enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin. These two work together to make sure your skin is firm and elastic.\n\n2. Eat Fruits and Veggies\n\nYes, eating fruits and vegetables is not only healthy for you but good for your skin health. To prevent signs of aging, consume antioxidant fruits, such as berries, that can also slow the growth of certain cancers, improve brain function, muscle tone, and balance. A 2009 study found a topical application of the antioxidant ellagic acid can prevent collagen destruction and inflammatory response \u2014 the major causes of wrinkles.\n\n3. Drink plenty of water\n\nDrinking water is one of the best things you can do for your skin. Staying hydrated promotes skin circulation and can help prevent skin repair from decreasing. A 2007 study found drinking 500 milliliters of water increases the blood flow through the capillaries in the skin, after being evaluated 30 minutes later. This is attributed to the fact skin contains up to 30 percent water, so consuming plenty of water can help give it a plump-like appearance.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "l\u2019or\u00e9al, cosmetics company, beauty products, l'oreal youth code, lanc\u00f4me g\u00e9nifique, anti-aging, reverse aging, skincare, skin health, genes, collagen, elasticity, wrinkles", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA reached a proposed settlement with the Federal Trade Commission on charges of \"deceptive advertising\" concerning two of its anti-aging skincare products.
