The Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, and the revamping of the Student Loan Program.\n\nBy now, it\u2019s clear that Obamacare will be an albatross on the necks of every Washington Democrat running for re-election next year.\n\nObama also wanted to take over the Student Loan Program to eliminate the \u201cmiddle man\u201d the banks. The Democratic controlled Congress passed the bill, and President Obama signed it into law promising to save billions of dollars that would go to grants for needy students.\n\nThis is an Obama scheme for a mo\u2019 money, money grab from Washington. This is no redistribution of wealth. Just more big government taking control of more of the economy, and as our private sector shrinks, the federal bureaucracy grows.\n\nThis is another scandal to add to the ever growing list to add to President Obama\u2019s legacy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama and the 2010 Democrat-controlled congress passed two boondoggles.
