Martin O\u2019Malley tried to position himself as the strongest Democratic presidential candidate on immigration during the Fair Immigration Reform Movement forum today at the Linq Hotel.\n\nThe former governor highlighted his record from his tenure in Maryland, during which the state began issuing driver\u2019s licenses to undocumented immigrants and passed a state DREAM Act, which increased college affordability for undocumented students.\n\n\u201cI have an immigrant\u2019s heart. I understand the American immigrant experience. It\u2019s something very dear to me,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cI will get it done. I am going to throw all my energy into getting it done.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley criticized former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, saying she has let politics get in the way of her support for immigration in the past. He criticized Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for his 2007 comments on Lou Dobbs\u2019 show, in which Sanders implied that immigrants take American jobs.\n\n\u201cI think one has to ask, is this a priority for the two of them because it\u2019s an election year or if it\u2019s because something they truly believe in?\u201d O\u2019Malley said at a press conference after the event.\n\nO\u2019Malley also took another dig at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s plan to build a wall at the Mexican border, saying, \u201cThe enduring symbol of our nation is not the barbed wire fence, but the Statue of Liberty.\u201d\n\nRepeatedly stating that immigration is \u201cnot a constituency issue,\u201d O\u2019Malley argued for broad support for immigration reform, saying that it is in the best economic interest of the entire country.\n\n\u201cWe need to listen to the echos of failed thinking,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cBy that, I mean the failed thinking and the falsehood that\u2019s come out that new American immigrants take our jobs or the equally self-defeating thinking that this is merely a constituency issue, over here someplace, that\u2019s a distraction from our national interest.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley reiterated his commitment to expanding on the executive actions issued by President Barack Obama almost a year ago and extending the Affordable Care Act to cover undocumented immigrants, to sustained applause from the audience.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time O\u2019Malley drummed up support for his immigration reform plan in Las Vegas. Last month, O\u2019Malley spoke at a Hispanics and Politics breakfast, in which he similarly outlined and defended his plan.\n\nAt the forum, O\u2019Malley also announced that he will be rolling out \u201ca new agenda for American cities\u201d this week that will support investments in mass transit, affordable workforce housing and a clean electrical grid, though he declined to itemize the specifics of that plan.\n\nAll Republican and Democratic presidential candidates were invited to the forum, hosted by the Fair Immigration Reform Movement and The Nation magazine, but only O\u2019Malley and Sanders confirmed attendance. Sanders will speak at 11 a.m. Monday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Maryland Gov.
