With Obamacare’s open enrollment deadline fast approaching, Covered California officials released new figures Tuesday to drive the message that having health insurance coverage means access to hospital care without worrying about big bills.

The data offer some details into how many patients who purchased health plans through Covered California were treated in 111 hospitals statewide for 18 months beginning in January 2014. Hospitals listed in the report represent a sample of the more than 450 general acute care facilities across the Golden State. The report doesn’t include urgent cares or community health centers that also offer medical services, according to Covered California, the state’s health insurance plan exchange. It’s unclear which plans patients carried, but hospitals operated by Kaiser Permanente were among those that were highly represented, the data show.

By law, hospital emergency departments have to accept all patients, but in 18 months, there were 65,040 emergency room visits made by those who were enrolled in health insurance through Covered California.

Also in the data:

·There were 10,928 incidents of cancer treatment provided, including surgery and chemotherapy.

·Covered California enrollees had 5,745 babies delivered.

·Almost 90 transplants were performed for Covered California enrollees at eight hospitals in the state, including lung, kidney, heart and liver transplants.

Open enrollment for those who want health insurance coverage this year ends January 31. Those who qualified and went without health insurance in 2015 will have to pay a penalty at tax time, which can go up to $325 per adult and $162.50 per child or 2 percent of the total household taxable income, whichever is higher. That rate will rise to $695 per single filer and 2.5 percent come next tax season.
