WKSU\u2019s M.L. Schultze spoke with the head of one of the groups trying to keep up with the claims made in those ads, as well as those made in speeches, debates and rallies.\n\nA conversation with the head of FactCheck.org\n\nFactcheck.org is a nonprofit at the University of Pennsylvania that sees itself as a consumer advocate for voters. This campaign cycle, Director Eugene Kiely and the handful of staff at Factcheck have been trying to keep up with claims made by and about many of the two dozen Democrats and Republicans who at least for some period were running for president. I talked with him about the goal and the process.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to check opinion. If someone says the stimulus is a disaster or Obamacare is a disaster, that\u2019s fine. But if someone makes a specific claim about unemployment rates, Obamacare, then we can start taking a look at that.\u201d\n\nThe look begins with the campaign itself, asking the source where they came up with their claim. And Kiely says most respond. Factcheck also goes to primary-source material, such as labor statistics, and archives of speeches, debates and other evidence.\n\nWKSU is part of the Ohio Media Project, a collaboration trying to reframe political coverage in the state this presidential year. As part of the Your Vote Ohio effort, over the next two weeks, we'll look at the power of and money behind political advertising.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s murky, if we can\u2019t determine it, we\u2019ll just move onto something else. But if we can provide some clarity, some context, some factual information that could lead us to a conclusion, then we\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nThe factchecker\u2019s article on the claim is then edited and factchecked itself by four people, including the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, which runs factcheck.org.\n\nKiely says the facts are crucial groundwork for public policy.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t as a country decide issues unless we know what the basic facts are. For example, with the Syrian refugee crisis: Donald Trump for a while repeatedly said that there were 200,000 Syrian refuges that the Obama administration wanted to bring to the United States. It was clearly wrong. ... It was 10,000.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a serious debate and discussion to have about: \u2018What do we do with Syrian refugees? How many can we accept? How (complete) is the process for vetting Syrian refugees?\u2019 ... And all that\u2019s where the discussion should be. But we shouldn\u2019t be having a discussion about how many of them there are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need some basic information that we all should agree on so then we can have that discussion of public policy.\u201d\n\nKiely acknowledges that factcheckers, as well as the mainstream media, are increasingly the target of distrust by some voters. He says he responds to the critics by being transparent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll lay out our process ... about how we go about factchecking, the fact that we are nonpartisan. They can go on our web site.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty we\u2019ve written about about Clinton\u2019s emails; there\u2019s plenty that we\u2019ve written about Donald Trump. There\u2019s a lot of material out there, and I think that any fair assessment of our work would show that it is nonpartisan and we are down the middle providing information that critiques both sides. And if they don\u2019t want to believe that, there\u2019s nothing I can do about that.\n\nHas he ever changed someone mind?\n\n\u201cWe did a piece about President Obama not going to the funerals for (Supreme Court Justice Antonin) Scalia or (former first lady) Nancy Reagan. And the caller insisted that, \u2018Well the reason he didn\u2019t go is that he doesn\u2019t go to any Christian services because he demands that they cover up the crucifix.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c... And I said, \u2019Well, what about (Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son) Beau Biden\u2019s funeral? He went to Beau Biden\u2019s funeral, he gave the eulogy. If you want I can show you a photograph of the crucifixion right there behind him. ... And he said, \u2018Oops, well you got me. That\u2019s right.\u2019\u201d\n\nKiely says campaigns are most likely to fire back if a core message is being challenged, and he expects that will increase.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Government & Politics", "description": "Political ad spending has been growing exponentially in Ohio and nationwide -- especially among the outside groups airing more than 80 percent of the ads", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wksu.org/post/figuring-out-facts-behind-political-ads-speeches-debates-and-folklore", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wksu/files/styles/medium/public/201605/your_vote_ohio_sig.png", "type": "article", "description": "Political ad spending has been growing exponentially in Ohio and nationwide -- especially among the outside groups airing more than 80 percent of the ads", "title": "Figuring Out the Facts Behind Political Ads, Speeches, Debates -- and Folklore"}, "story_id": 477302343, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "author": "M.L.
