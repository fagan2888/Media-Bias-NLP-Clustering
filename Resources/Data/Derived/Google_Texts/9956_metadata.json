(Samantha Sais/Reuters)\n\n\u2014 Former president Bill Clinton made no mention of his wife, but in his rallying cry to some 1,200 college students here Saturday one could hear a succinct rationale for her to run for president.\n\nThe country faces long-term debt problems that threaten its global competitiveness, Clinton said, and the solutions are not mind-numbingly difficult. But, he told the crowd, addressing them will require political will.\n\n\u201cWho will stand up and say: \u2018Send me. I\u2019ll fight for that\u2019?\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place for any of us in the peanut gallery. We have to be on the field and playing.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s remarks were about motivating young leaders to become more involved in politics and policy. \u201cThe Age of Participation\u201d is the theme of this weekend\u2019s Clinton Global Initiative University conference held on the Tempe campus of Arizona State University. But as with everything the Clintons say and do these days, the former president\u2019s comments will be interpreted vis-a-vis Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s deliberations about running for president in 2016.\n\nFor the past two days, Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton have held forth on a campus stage using their star power to motivate some 1,200 millennials to foster change in their communities and the world. In one session, Hillary Clinton looked out on a sea of young people and said they were \u201copen-minded and tolerant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to make sure the millennial generation really is the participation generation,\u201d she said Friday night.\n\nAlthough the three-day conference centers on altruism \u2014 on Sunday morning, the Clintons will join former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, in a community service project to beautify a part of nearby downtown Phoenix \u2014 current events entered into the discussions.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging family interview Saturday night with late-night talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel, Hillary Clinton said she hoped the millennial generation commits to making climate change \u201ca voting issue\u201d as powerful as other issues.\n\n\u201cThis is not just some ancillary issue,\u201d Hillary Clinton said. \u201cThis will determine in large measure the quality of life in so many places around the world. I\u2019m hoping that there will be this mass movement that demands political change.\u201d\n\nWhen Vrinda Agarwal, a student at the University of California at Berkeley, asked Clinton to represent women by running for president, Clinton said, \u201cI\u2019m obviously thinking about all kinds of decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d she added, \u201cI am very much concerned about the direction of our country \u2014 and it\u2019s not just who runs for office but what they do when they get there, and how we bring people together and particularly empower young people so that we can tackle these hard decisions we\u2019ve just been talking about.\u201d\n\nEarlier Saturday, Bill Clinton went on an extemporaneous riff about deficit issues. He blamed debt problems on Republicans, who he said have campaigned irresponsibly since the 1980s on promises never to raise taxes. He said they were \u201cjust like a child who likes to eat candy every day and never go to the dentist.\u201d\n\nClinton also condemned the state of U.S. politics and the growing power of super PACs to negatively define candidates.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t always depend on a billionaire spending a fortune to run television ads against you to tell everybody how un-American you are,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis is a new thing in American history.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn a bipartisan basis,\u201d Clinton added, \u201cwe need to reject it.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier session, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) joined Clinton for a panel discussion. Fifteen years ago, McCain voted twice to impeach Clinton after he lied about his extramarital affair with a White House intern. But on Friday night, all that seemed far in the past as the two men hammed it up like old buddies. They talked about the serious (Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine) and the silly (tweets from reality star Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi), and they showered each other with high praise.\n\nIntroducing McCain, Clinton called the senator \u201ca good friend of Hillary\u2019s and mine, although we permit him to deny it at election time.\u201d McCain in turn congratulated Clinton on two terms in office and credited him with intervening in Bosnia to end ethnic strife there. \u201cI think you made the right decisions,\u201d McCain told Clinton.\n\nThe bipartisan geniality underscored the close relationship McCain and Hillary Clinton developed when she was a senator, as well as the narrow daylight between the two on foreign policy.\n\nThe warmth also illustrated McCain\u2019s own recent political journey. Four years ago, McCain was running for reelection as an embattled incumbent struggling to prove his conservative bona fides and beat back a tea party challenger. The McCain of 2010 may not have so warmly welcomed the Clintons to Arizona.\n\nYet here was the senator, explaining to Clinton his experiences with Twitter \u2014 a medium the former president called \u201ca staggering instrument of potential.\u201d When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, McCain recalled, he received a tweet from someone named Snooki. \u201cI don\u2019t know how familiar you are with Snooki, Mr. President,\u201d McCain said, eliciting knowing laughter from Clinton.\n\nMcCain said the very bronzed star of MTV\u2019s \u201cJersey Shore\u201d sent him a tweet complaining that the health-care law included a tax on tanning beds, to which McCain replied that he would never tax her tanning bed.\n\nClinton and McCain also discussed the situation in Ukraine. Referring to a conversation he had backstage earlier with Clinton about Russia\u2019s president, McCain said: \u201cVladimir Putin is not a democrat. He\u2019s an old KGB colonel, and Vladi\u00admir Putin wants to restore what was once the Russian empire.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former president takes the stage in Arizona for the Clinton Global Initiative event.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PhilipRuckerWP", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The former president takes the stage in Arizona for the Clinton Global Initiative event.", "title": "Bill Clinton urges students at CGIU: \u2018We have to be on the field and playing\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bill-clinton-urges-college-students-we-have-to-be-on-the-field-and-playing/2014/03/22/90ba4912-b217-11e3-a49e-76adc9210f19_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/03/23/National-Politics/Images/2014-03-23T034155Z_01_CGI613_RTRIDSP_3_USA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PhilipRucker"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bill-clinton-urges-college-students-we-have-to-be-on-the-field-and-playing/2014/03/22/90ba4912-b217-11e3-a49e-76adc9210f19_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "clinton global initiative, cgi, cgiu, clinton global initiative university, bill clinton, hillary clinton, hillary 2016, hillary clinton 2016, bill clinton john mccain, john mccain cgi, john mccain, john mccain snooki, cgiu, hillary clinton, will hillary run", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PhilipRuckerWP"}, "eomportal-uuid": "90ba4912-b217-11e3-a49e-76adc9210f19", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "clinton global initiative, cgi, cgiu, clinton global initiative university, bill clinton, hillary clinton, hillary 2016, hillary clinton 2016, bill clinton john mccain, john mccain cgi, john mccain, john mccain snooki, cgiu, hillary clinton, will hillary run"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9bef\"", "article_summary": "Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton discuss how they first were involved in politics during the 2014 meeting of Clinton Global Initiative University at Arizona State University in Tempe on March 22, 2014.\n(Samantha Sais/Reuters)\u2014 Former president Bill Clinton made no mention of his wife, but in his rallying cry to some 1,200 college students here Saturday one could hear a succinct rationale for her to run for president.\nReferring to a conversation he had backstage earlier with Clinton about Russia\u2019s president, McCain said: \u201cVladimir Putin is not a democrat.\n\u201cThe Age of Participation\u201d is the theme of this weekend\u2019s Clinton Global Initiative University conference held on the Tempe campus of Arizona State University.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how familiar you are with Snooki, Mr. President,\u201d McCain said, eliciting knowing laughter from Clinton."}
