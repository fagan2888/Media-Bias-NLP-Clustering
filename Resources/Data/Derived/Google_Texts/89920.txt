There are a lot of great burritos to be had throughout San Diego alone, much less in the very competitive state of California and across the nation.

But Thrillist.com tackled the nearly impossible task of identifying the very best in tortilla-wrapped cuisine, and JV’s Mexican Food in Linda Vista made the cut!

How? With its surf-and-turf burrito, of course, which was counted among Thrillist’s “16 best burritos in America.”

The critic called the Morena Boulevard eatery’s burrito “a haul of shrimp and carne asada that’s so gigantic it takes two tortillas to contain it.”

The photo speaks for itself, no?

In case you’re wondering, California dominated the list; in addition to San Diego’s winner, Los Angeles had three entries and San Francisco, two.

Do you agree? Is there a San Diego burrito that’s better or should at least be on the list with JV’s?

JV’s Mexican Food is at 1112 Morena Blvd., San Diego.
