Terms of the transaction, which includes all assets and trademark rights to The American Worker Plans, were not disclosed.\n\nThe American Worker Plans (TAWP) was founded in 1992 to provide affordable supplemental health and benefits programs to uninsured working Americans. Since then, the company has established a national reputation for providing employers with innovative products featuring highly effective promotional materials and enrollment tools. TAWP offers a variety of both employer and employee-paid benefits products underwritten by many of the country's leading insurers. As part of Fringe Benefit Group, TAWP\u2019s existing products and customer programs will remain unchanged and there will be no disruption to TAWP clients and their valued employees, or their health insurance advisers or insurance broker representatives.\n\n\u201cThe American Worker Plans has collaborated effectively with Fringe Benefit Group since 1997. I am extremely pleased that this relationship will now be able to provide us with a one-stop solution for benefit program marketing, service and support,\u201d said George Duczak, president of TAWP. \u201cThis purchase creates the largest independent wholesaler of products for the hourly and part-time marketplace, enabling us to provide brokers and advisers with the best advice and products. Through consolidation of our marketing and administrative resources, we are confident that we are going to continue our leadership role in this market as part of Fringe Benefit Group.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known and worked alongside George and Jon Duczak and The American Worker Plans team for many years. Like us, they have been very successful working with brokers to support employers with part-time and hourly workers,\u201d said Travis West, CEO of Fringe Benefit Group. \u201cWe believe the hourly and part-time worker marketplace will expand significantly in the coming years as a result of ACA and this acquisition will position us well to serve their needs.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) has greatly changed the benefits landscape. Companies with hourly and part-time employees face the constant challenge of attracting and retaining quality workers. Fringe Benefit Group\u2019s Framework voluntary benefit offering is specifically designed for employers looking for a plan for part-time employees that is affordable, flexible, and easily administered. The Framework team works closely with brokers to customize plan design, pricing, communication, implementation, and enrollment to meet their customers\u2019 individual needs. Framework provides employers with a best-in-class benefits package, communication and enrollment services, and unique billing and premium payment options. Framework benefits include MEC, fixed indemnity, inpatient and outpatient supplemental, dental, vision, critical illness, short-term disability, life insurance, and accident plans. Framework customers include many of the nation\u2019s leading restaurant, retail, hospitality and staffing companies.\n\n\u201cThis acquisition benefits our mutual clients, employees and their families because it\u2019s a combination of two great companies who excel at servicing the part-time employee benefits arena,\u201d said Jon Duczak, senior vice president of TAWP. \u201cThe strength of TAWP\u2019s communication, benefit strategies and experience with the outstanding administrative services provided by Fringe Benefit Group will result in a superior experience for everyone we serve.\u201d\n\nAbout Fringe Benefit Group\n\nAustin, Texas-based Fringe Benefit Group and its affiliate companies have helped employers design and administer fringe benefit programs since 1983.
