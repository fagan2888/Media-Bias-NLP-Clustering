WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (WLFI) – A National Science Federation grant is giving some Indiana teachers the means to get students excited about being active and learning about technology.

The $1.2 million grant goes toward the Teaching Engineering Concepts to Harness Future Innovators and Technologists program, otherwise known as TECHFIT.

The weeklong program brings teachers from four Indiana schools to Purdue University. They each learn how to assemble circuits and wires for active games they developed.

Matt Moyer, from Bremen Elementary and Middle School, helped create the game “Light Speed.” The game kept people on their toes, jumping between flashing lights and hitting a sensor button.

Moyer said the program can engage students and show them how they can apply what they learn now to life in the real world.

“If you’re teaching, you should care about students. And part of caring about students is preparing them for the real world, and that’s what this program does,” said Moyer.

The teachers will take their knowledge to students who will participate in a 10-week after-school program this fall. The students will make their own games, eventually taking them to a competition against others Indiana schools at the end of the program.
