Last year, 1 in 5 taxpayers claimed the credit and earned an average of nearly $2,400.\n\n\n\nThis tax season, some of those eligible for the EITC may also be able to claim, for the first time, a new credit created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to offset the cost of purchasing health insurance for lower-income Americans. It\u2019s called the ACA premium tax credit.\n\n\n\nTo qualify for the ACA premium tax credit, filers need first to have an annual income that falls between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty line (between $11,670 and $46,680 for a single-person household in 2014). Beyond the income requirements, however, filers must also be ineligible for other public or private insurance options like Medicaid or an employer-provided plan.\n\nWhy the tax credit overlap matters\n\nIdentifying the Americans eligible for both credits is important because it sheds light on how many still need help paying for health insurance even after the ACA extended coverage options.\n\n\n\nIn a recent study of the EITC-eligible population, Elizabeth Kneebone, Jane R. Williams, and Natalie Holmes estimated what share of EITC-eligible filers might also qualify for the ACA premium tax credit this year.\n\n\n\nBelow, see a list of the top 10 states with the largest overlap between filers eligible for the EITC and those estimated to qualify for the ACA premium tax credit.* Notably, none of these states has expanded Medicaid coverage to low-income families after the passage of the ACA.\n\n\n\nNationally, an estimated 7.5 million people (4.2 million \u201ctax units\u201d) are likely eligible for both the ACA premium tax credit and the EITC. Nearly 1.3 million of those tax units are from the following ten states.\n\n1. Florida\n\nOverlap: 22.5 percent / 405,924 tax units\n\nState-based exchange? No Expanded Medicaid coverage? No\n\n2. Texas\n\nOverlap: 21.4 percent / 513,061 tax units\n\nState-based exchange? No Expanded Medicaid coverage? No\n\n3. South Dakota\n\nOverlap: 20.5 percent / 15,124 tax units\n\nState-based exchange? No Expanded Medicaid coverage? No\n\n4. Georgia\n\nOverlap: 19.8 percent / 186,020 tax units\n\nState-based exchange? No Expanded Medicaid coverage? No\n\n5. Louisiana\n\nOverlap: 19.6 percent / 86,512 tax units\n\nState-based exchange? No Expanded Medicaid coverage? No\n\n6. Idaho\n\nOverlap: 19.3 percent / 28,855 tax units\n\nState-based exchange? Yes Expanded Medicaid coverage? No\n\n7. Montana\n\nOverlap: 18.9 percent / 18,138 tax units\n\nState-based exchange? No Expanded Medicaid coverage? No\n\n8. Wyoming\n\nOverlap: 18.4 percent / 7,276 tax units\n\nState-based exchange? No Expanded Medicaid coverage? No\n\n9. Utah\n\nOverlap: 18.1 percent / 42,284\n\nState-based exchange? No (Utah runs a small businesses marketplace, but it relies on the federal government for an individual marketplace) Expanded Medicaid coverage? No\n\n10. Oklahoma\n\nOverlap: 18.0% / 63,045 tax units\n\nState-based exchange? No Expanded Medicaid coverage? No\n\n\n\n* For the purposes of this list, we measured the overlap in \u201ctax units,\u201d not people. One tax unit equals a single tax return. If a family of four together qualifies for the ACA premium tax credit, they would be counted as one tax unit, not four, since they filed jointly with one tax return.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research from Elizabeth Kneebone, Jane R.
