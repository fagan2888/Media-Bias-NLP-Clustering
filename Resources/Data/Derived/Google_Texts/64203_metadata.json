Although healthcare cost increases have slowed and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office again reduced the projected price tag on the Affordable Care Act earlier this month, the federal debt is expected to increase by another $6 trillion by 2025, to $24 trillion.\n\nDiscretionary spending, the levels for which are set by Congress and approved by the president through the appropriations process and tax law, is on a downward trend. Federal agencies have mostly been spared the worst of the sequester, thanks to a deal that was part of the 2013 budget, but it would go into full effect starting Oct. 1.\n\nCalls to end those across-the-board cuts, particularly on the Pentagon\u2019s budget, have increased as the military has repeatedly told Congress it will not be able to maintain preparedness if it is restricted to the sequester-mandated $523 billion for the next fiscal year.\n\nThanks to a tactic unique to the budget process called reconciliation, only a simple majority is needed to pass the budget resolution in both houses. But Senate Democrats will be able to have their say in a rapid series of votes, dubbed a \u201cvote-o-rama,\u201d where each side will attempt to force the other to take uncomfortable votes that they will then try to use to score political points come election season.\n\n\u201cBudgets by their nature are very political documents,\u201d says Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cLess important is what\u2019s in the budget than if this is just the first step in the process, kicking off a real discussion.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, who broadly oppose the sequester cuts, say they will insist on linking lifting the caps on defense spending with equal relief to nondefense programs. Not only does nondefense spending include programs such as Head Start and food stamps, it supports homeland security tasks like the Coast Guard\u2019s efforts to prevent drug smuggling.\n\n\u201cWe cannot just fix one side of the ledger but not the other because they both support our national defense and economic security,\u201d Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said at a press conference last week with Office of Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan.\n\nDonovan said the president \u201cwill not accept a budget that locks in the sequester \u2026 [or] severs that vital link between defense and nondefense spending,\u201d but in fact, the budget does not require the president\u2019s signature, nor will it need the support of anyone in the minority.\n\n\n\nIn his budget, sent to Congress last month, President Barack Obama would do away with the $523 billion sequester cap for defense spending as well as nondefense spending, which would otherwise be restricted to $493.5 billion. According to the analysis released by the CBO last week, eliminating the sequester would add another $42 billion to discretionary spending.\n\nObama\u2019s budget, according to CBO analysis, would shave $1.2 trillion off the growth of the federal debt in the next decade, primarily through increasing tax revenue. Congressional Republicans said his proposal was a nonstarter.\n\nBut their own internal disagreements over whether to keep sequester caps for defense spending will make it difficult for Republicans to cobble together the majority of votes they need to pass their own budget.\n\nOne proposal, floated by moderate Republicans, will be to pay for increases in the Pentagon\u2019s funding without rewriting the 2011 Budget Control Act that governs the sequester by closing loopholes in the tax code.\n\n\u201cBoth [budget committee] chairs have publicly committed to balancing in 10 years and they\u2019re not going to raise taxes,\u201d says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the CBO who is now the president of the conservative American Action Forum. \u201cYou fill in the blanks: Everything is now an issue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Defense Spending Divides GOP Ahead of Budget Battle", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Sure, Congress will probably pass a budget this year.
