How many coupon inserts will we have in the Sunday paper on December 27?

There should be 1 P&G insert with approximately 56 coupons including Bounty, Charmin, Crest, Always, Tampax, Luvs, Pampers, Olay, Scope, Secret, Tide & more!

To see the coupon preview for Sunday, 12/27 head to www.couponpreviews.info. We won't get all the same coupons as the ones that are listed here, but most will be the same.

If you buy the paper at a store on Sunday (instead of getting a subscription delivered to your home), make sure you look inside the paper before you buy it so you can see that the coupons are in there. You will find that sometimes, the papers at the stores and in the paper boxes do not have coupons. Sometimes the newspaper runs out of coupon inserts and because the home delivery papers are the first to get the coupons, the papers that go to the stores do not always have all the coupons.

Happy shopping everyone!
