Professional and business services, health care and retail trade added 139,000 jobs.\n\n\n\nAnd while wage growth in certain professions isn't necessarily spilling over to the workforce as a whole, that could happen if the recovery continues long enough to get more Michigan residents into jobs.\n\n\n\nBuckley, who co-authors a regular \"Geography of Jobs\" report for Deloitte that charts wage growth against employment growth on a state-by-state basis to analyze changes in real wage environments, said even though Michigan shows slightly below-average professional services growth, the kind of jobs it is adding fall on the higher end of that sector's wage scale.\n\n\n\nMichigan showed about 3.8 percent total employment growth as well as 3.8 percent total wage growth between July 2012 and three months ago, according to the report and BLS data.\n\n\n\nThat about tracks with the nation as a whole, which saw 4 percent jobs growth and 4 percent wage growth in the same period \u2014 but also 4 percent inflation, for about zero growth in real wages, she said.\n\n\n\nHowever, the state's growth appears to be stronger among architectural or engineering professions, that pay an equivalent of $36 or more per hour, than among administrative or support services jobs that pay under $20 an hour.\n\n\n\n\"From this data you can't be sure, but the fact that manufacturing employment in Michigan ... is also up 30,000 jobs over the (same period), suggests that some of that wage growth in professional services is the comeback of the auto industry,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering, IT jobs\n\n\"I can vouch for the fact that, in Michigan, we know engineering and IT job openings have been topping the charts for employer demand,\" said Lisa Katz, executive director of the Workforce Intelligence Network for Southeast Michigan.\n\n\n\n\"But as a secondary factor, we have more 1099 workers (self-employed or independent non-employee) contractual workers in technical professions and those spaces in Michigan, which could be affecting how some (jobs) figures get counted.\"\n\n\n\nKatz said the WIN's own analysis shows a 50 percent higher concentration of professional and technical service jobs in Michigan than the nation as a whole, with a majority of those jobs in a local nine-county region, and the growth rate among those positions is outpacing the nation in the timeframe that Deloitte's report tracks.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michigan has lagged slightly behind the national average in jobs growth and wage increases over the past two years \u2014 but some jobs it's adding have above average appeal, according to a Deloitte LLP economist.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "Michigan has lagged slightly behind the national average in jobs growth and wage increases over the past two years \u2014 but some jobs it's adding have above average appeal, according to a Deloitte LLP economist.", "title": "Bright spots in soft job growth: Upward trend in higher-wage services", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20141005/NEWS/310059979/bright-spots-in-soft-job-growth-upward-trend-in-higher-wage-services", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CD/20141005/NEWS/310059979/AR/0/AR-310059979.jpg&MaxW=1400&MaxH=1400", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "theme-color": "#b51218", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "tag": "Talent", "published_time": "2014-10-05T08:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-08T04:24:00-04:00", "author": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/staff/chahol"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui"}, "article_summary": "Michigan showed about 3.8 percent total employment growth as well as 3.8 percent total wage growth between July 2012 and three months ago, according to the report and BLS data.\nThat about tracks with the nation as a whole, which saw 4 percent jobs growth and 4 percent wage growth in the same period \u2014 but also 4 percent inflation, for about zero growth in real wages, she said.\nHowever, the state's growth appears to be stronger among architectural or engineering professions, that pay an equivalent of $36 or more per hour, than among administrative or support services jobs that pay under $20 an hour.\nProfessional and business services, health care and retail trade added 139,000 jobs.\nAnd while wage growth in certain professions isn't necessarily spilling over to the workforce as a whole, that could happen if the recovery continues long enough to get more Michigan residents into jobs."}
