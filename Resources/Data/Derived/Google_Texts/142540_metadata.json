According to the USGS, the region experiences \"moderately damaging earthquakes\" every few decades, and smaller earthquakes about two times a year.\n\nThe USGS provides seismic hazard maps for areas across the country. The maps show probability levels for earthquake ground motion, which informs building codes and insurance risk assessments. Connecticut's latest map shows a slightly greater hazard toward New York City.\n\nLast December, a 2.1-magnitude quake was recorded in Groton in southeastern Connecticut.\n\nThe most recent quake in New England to cause some moderate damage was in 1940, when a 5.6-magnitude quake shook central New Hampshire.\n\nThis report includes information from The Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Environment", "description": "Some residents in southern Connecticut say they were awoken by their homes shaking, and the U.S. Geological Survey confirmed a minor earthquake.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/good-morning-small-earthquake-hits-connecticut", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201408/Seismograph.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Some residents in southern Connecticut say they were awoken by their homes shaking, and the U.S. Geological Survey confirmed a minor earthquake.", "title": "Good Morning!
