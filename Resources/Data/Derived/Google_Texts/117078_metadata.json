If so, you probably didn\u2019t get very far.\n\nInstead, try telling them that a lack of sleep can hurt their GPA and SAT scores, along with their performance on the school athletic team \u2014 right now. It can also make you more likely to have skin problems, make you sick so you miss school and increase a young driver\u2019s risk of having a car accident.\n\nBoth sets of warnings are based on data, but the more immediate one probably resonates more with teens, who tend to be chronically sleep-deprived, says Mary Carskadon, a sleep expert and professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University.\n\nTeens need around nine hours of sleep, but studies have found that as many as two-thirds of them regularly get less than seven hours as changes in their circadian rhythm push them toward later sleep times, while many high schools start very early.\n\nStudies suggest this later sleep cycle for adolescents is common for mammals generally.\n\nExperts say getting teens to manage their sleep better would help them in many ways that are particularly important to them at this time of life.\n\nAthletics\n\n\"If you\u2019re running track and your reaction time slows by even 10 milliseconds, it\u2019s huge,\u201d says Carskadon.\n\nThe \u201cpsychomotor vigilance test\u201d \u2014 designed to show links between insufficient sleep and reaction time \u2014 shows that lack of sleep can lead to completely missed cues (you don\u2019t see the pitcher releasing the baseball, for example) and slowed reaction time (you do see the pitch, but you react a blink too slowly).\n\nPart of the issue here is that sleep \u2014 REM (rapid eye movement) sleep in particular \u2014 is when the brain learns or puts information into context (as opposed to just gathering it, which is a daytime function), says Helene Emsellem, medical director at the Center for Sleep and Wake Disorders in Chevy Chase, Md.\n\n\u201cSo if you are playing baseball and your coach has given you pointers about your swing, the brain replays those sequences at night and learns them to the point of knowing them reflexively,\u201d Emsellem says.\n\nLearning\n\nSo we gather information while awake and we learn it while sleeping. This is true for academic work, too.\n\n\u201cThe brain restores the synapses \u2014 taking the information worth keeping and learning it,\u201d Emsellem says. As for the information not worth keeping, the brain flushes it out, she says: \u201cIt\u2019s as though it cleans up the excess riffraff.\u201d\n\nHealthy bodies\n\nThe link between lack of sleep and weight gain can be a concern for teens sensitive about how they look.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t metabolize fat well at night, and we see an increase in lipid levels and blood glucose,\u201d says Michael Twery, director of the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nIn other words, the body doesn\u2019t process and store nutrients the same way at night as during the day.\n\n\u201cNighttime eating is linked to the body\u2019s storing more calories for the same amount of food,\u201d Emsellem says.\n\nSkin can suffer, too.\n\n\u201cYou look better after good sleep. There is a reason it\u2019s called beauty sleep,\u201d Carskadon says.\n\nCarskadon also studies the link between sleep and illness in teens. She and fellow researchers found that adolescents \u2014 particularly males \u2014 are more likely to get a cold when sleep is lacking.\n\nAnother study found that adolescents who slept six hours or less were at an increased risk of automobile accidents.\n\nCarskadon and others say it is important to help teenagers embrace helpful techniques.\n\n\u201cOne of the ways to help teens control sleep patterns is to educate them about the importance of limiting screens before bed and turning off lights,\u201d Carskadon says.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/02/hfyouth03-1.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3480\"", "article_summary": "Teens need around nine hours of sleep, but studies have found that as many as two-thirds of them regularly get less than seven hours as changes in their circadian rhythm push them toward later sleep times, while many high schools start very early.\nAnother study found that adolescents who slept six hours or less were at an increased risk of automobile accidents.\nInstead, try telling them that a lack of sleep can hurt their GPA and SAT scores, along with their performance on the school athletic team \u2014 right now.\nHave you ever told your teens to get enough sleep now because in 10 years they\u2019ll run the risk of being depressed and overweight?\nShe and fellow researchers found that adolescents \u2014 particularly males \u2014 are more likely to get a cold when sleep is lacking."}
