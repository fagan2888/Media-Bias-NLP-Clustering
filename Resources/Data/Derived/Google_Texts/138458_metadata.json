Donald Trump couldn't put down an aggressive Jeb Bush. And Ted Cruz had to issue a public apology to Ben Carson.\n\nChristie was the relentless prosecutor. Bush was knowledgeable and, in contrast to some earlier performances, tough and direct. Ohio Gov. John Kasich carved out space as a candidate ready and willing to work across party lines.\n\nGiven the timing and the state of the Republican nomination contest, few debates have had the potential to shape the order of finish in a primary campaign more than Saturday night's forum at Saint Anselm College. Trump holds a big lead. But the competition underneath him is fierce, and the outcome Tuesday likely to be consequential. Those with the most to lose were the ones who tried to make the most out of their time on stage.\n\nNo one had a rockier night than Rubio, the senator from Florida whose strong third-place finish in Iowa made him the candidate on the rise in the Republican presidential race. But under a blistering attack from Christie, who characterized him as a politician with no notable accomplishments who had run away from the immigration reform bill he had co-sponsored, Rubio faltered.\n\nRubio knew the attacks were coming, but instead of answering them directly, he sought to change the subject. Once, twice, three times he offered a quick counterpunch and then slid off the criticisms to turn to an attack on President Obama, repeating his language almost word for word and drawing boos from the audience.\n\nWhen he accused Christie of having to be shamed into going back to New Jersey to deal with the recent snowstorm, Christie came roaring back. \"That's what Washington, D.C., does,\" Christie said. \"The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him.\"\n\nWhat was most striking was the fact that Rubio played directly into the criticism that, while he is a gifted and natural communicator, he is overly scripted and returns to his standard stump speech as quickly as he can.\n\nThe strategy has worked for him in past debates, but repetition got the better of him on Saturday. Rubio wanted to debate Obama and Hillary Clinton, warning time and again that the president has deliberately led the country in the wrong direction and that Clinton would extend those policies. Those kinds of attacks bring cheers at his campaign rallies but were far less effective during Saturday's debate.\n\nIn the later stages of the debate, Rubio seemed to regain his footing both on foreign policy and on a question about abortion in which he talked about the balance between a woman's right to make her own decisions and the right of an unborn child to live.\n\nEven when Bush drew a distinction with Rubio over whether there should be an exception for rape, incest and life of the woman, which Bush favors, Rubio said he would sign a bill as president that included those exceptions but that he still stood by his personal convictions. Rubio said he would rather lose an election than be wrong on the issue.\n\nTrump struggled when the subject of eminent domain, a hot-button issue for many conservatives who dislike government, was introduced. The billionaire builder initially offered a ringing defense of the practice of government taking private property for such projects as roads and bridges.\n\nBush countered, initially agreeing that eminent domain is necessary for the public good but then attacking Trump for attempting to use the practice to take property from an elderly woman in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for the purpose of a parking lot for one of his casinos.\n\nTrump reverted to attacks he has long leveled at Bush - that he lacks strength or energy. \"He wants to be a tough guy,\" Trump said dismissively.\n\nBut Bush came right back at him: \"How tough is it to take away a property from an elderly woman?\" he said sarcastically.\n\nWhen Trump told Bush to keep quiet, the audience let out another round of boos, to which Trump said, \"That's all his donors and special interests.\"\n\nCruz, who won the Iowa caucuses, had two difficult moments at the start of the evening. The first came over criticism Cruz leveled at Trump earlier in the week, saying, \"I don't know anyone who would be comfortable with someone who behaves this way having his finger on the button.\"\n\nTrump was given the first word and defended himself. He reminded everyone that he had opposed the war in Iraq, adding, \"I'm not the one with the trigger.\"\n\n\"Other people up here, believe me, would be a lot faster,\" he said.\n\nWhen Cruz was asked to explain why he thought Trump lacked the temperament to be president, he ducked. \"The assessment the voters are making here in New Hampshire and across the country is they are evaluating each and every one of us,\" he said.\n\nReminded by ABC News anchor David Muir that he had not explained why he had made the earlier comment, Cruz ducked again.\n\nTrump responded: \"He didn't answer your question. And that's what's going to happen with our enemies and the people we compete against. . . . People back down with Trump. And that's what I like, and that's what the country is going to like.\"\n\nThat didn't end the early hazing for Cruz. He was asked why his advisers had called Iowa volunteers on the night of the caucuses to say that Carson might be quitting the race and to encourage voters to back the senator from Texas.\n\nCruz blamed the problem on what he said was a misleading news report on CNN that he said was not corrected for several hours. But he also apologized to Carson and said he had done so the day after the caucuses.\n\nCarson, in his typically quiet way, accepted the apology but not the explanation. \"In fact, the timeline indicates that initial tweet from CNN was followed by another one within one minute that clarified that I was not dropping out,\" he said.\n\nMore than in other previous debates, this one turned into governors against the others. The three share common experiences, and when they talk about one another, it's clear there is mutual respect, though they are in a battle in which they cannot all survive. And whether by design or accident, the three seemed to reinforce one another in taking down the candidates who finished first, second and third in Iowa.\n\nChristie delivered one of the strongest performances of the campaign, clearly determined to knock down Rubio, whom he described this past week as \"a boy in the bubble.\" Fighting for his political life, he was merciless in attacking Rubio for lacking the courage to fight for the immigration reform legislation that passed the Senate but faltered in the House.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "In GOP debate, a tough night for front-runners but a good night for governors", "Description": "It was a tough night for front-runners in New Hampshire and a good night for governors.
