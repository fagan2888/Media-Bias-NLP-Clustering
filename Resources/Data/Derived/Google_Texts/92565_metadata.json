Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys represent a Christian college and four Christian universities that asked the high court to review appeals court decisions that upheld the mandate in Geneva College v. Burwell and Southern Nazarene University v. Burwell, two of seven cases that the Supreme Court agreed in November of last year to take up.\n\nADF says the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services mandate forces employers, regardless of their religious or moral convictions, to provide abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception through their health plans under threat of heavy penalties. Geneva College in Pennsylvania and the four universities in Oklahoma \u2013 Southern Nazarene University, Oklahoma Wesleyan University, Oklahoma Baptist University, and Mid-America Christian University \u2013 specifically object to providing abortifacients.\n\nKeep up with the latest pro-life news and information on Twitter.

Baylor. \u201cThe Obama administration is forcing the schools to choose between following their faith and following the government\u2019s rule. This is utterly inconsistent with legal protections for religious liberty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe administration continues to impose the same unacceptable choice: obey and abandon your freedom, or resist and be punished,\u201d added ADF Senior Counsel David Cortman. \u201cThe Supreme Court should reverse the appeals courts\u2019 rulings and ensure that people of faith are not punished for making decisions consistent with that faith.\u201d\n\nADF attorneys and allied attorneys represented Conestoga Wood Specialties and its owners in their victory against the abortion-pill mandate at the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014. While that case addressed the mandate as it applies to for-profit family-run businesses, these cases pertain to the mandate as applied to non-profit organizations. Although the administration argues that executing and submitting a so-called \u201caccommodation\u201d form insulates religious nonprofits from providing abortifacients, ADF attorneys explain that is not the case.\n\nThe form directly involves the Christian colleges in providing abortifacients in multiple ways by, for example, (1) altering their health plans to allow for the provision of such drugs or devices, (2) requiring them to notify or identify to the government who their insurers or third-party administrators are so that they can provide the drugs or devices on the colleges\u2019 behalf, (3) officially authorizing their TPA as a plan and claims administrator solely for the purpose of providing the items, and (4) requiring them to identify and contract with a TPA that is willing to provide the drugs and devices to which they religiously object.\n\nAs the brief filed Monday explains, the government\u2019s coercion of the non-profits \u201ccan be explained only by its refusal to credit their sincere religious beliefs that the role the government wants them to play would be a sin. The government is certainly free to disagree with that belief, but it is not free to disregard it. Yet that is precisely what its regulatory scheme does \u2013 and precisely what RFRA [the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act] forbids.\u201d\n\nIn September, the Obama administration renewed its attempt to force a Catholic religious order, the Little Sisters of the Poor, to comply with the HHS abortion mandate. The government is still trying to force the nuns to either violate their deeply held religious convictions or pay crippling fines to the IRS.\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Christian-run Hobby Lobby doesn\u2019t have to obey the HHS mandate that is a part of Obamacare that requires businesses to pay for abortion causing drugs in their employee health care plans.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "A group of Christian colleges based in Oklahoma are asking the Supreme Court to help them in their battle to stop the Obama administration from forcing them to", "title": "Christian Colleges Ask Supreme Court to Stop Obama From Forcing Them to Obey HHS Mandate", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2016/01/05/christian-colleges-ask-supreme-court-to-stop-obama-from-forcing-them-to-obey-hhs-mandate-2/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/barackobama10.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw=="}, "article_summary": "Geneva College in Pennsylvania and the four universities in Oklahoma \u2013 Southern Nazarene University, Oklahoma Wesleyan University, Oklahoma Baptist University, and Mid-America Christian University \u2013 specifically object to providing abortifacients.\nSeveral religious non-profit organizations filed an opening brief Monday with the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court should reverse the appeals courts\u2019 rulings and ensure that people of faith are not punished for making decisions consistent with that faith.\u201dADF attorneys and allied attorneys represented Conestoga Wood Specialties and its owners in their victory against the abortion-pill mandate at the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014.\nA group of Christian colleges based in Oklahoma are asking the Supreme Court to help them in their battle to stop the Obama administration from forcing them to obey the HHS mandate, which compels them to pay for abortion-causing drugs in their health care plans in violation of their conscience.\n\u201cThe Obama administration is forcing the schools to choose between following their faith and following the government\u2019s rule."}
