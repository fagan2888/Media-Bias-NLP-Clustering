It\u2019s a business \u2014 and a big one at that,\u201d he continued. \u201cBusinesses must and should be required to comply with neutrally crafted laws of general applicability. Your boss should not have a say over your healthcare. Once the law starts permitting exceptions based on \u2018sincerely held religious beliefs\u2019 there\u2019s no end to the mischief and discrimination that will ensue.Indeed, this is the same logic that certain restaurants and hotels have been trying to deploy to allow proprietors to refuse service to gay couples.\u201d\n\nTakei pointed out what many have noted, that Hobby Lobby has invested in multiple companies that manufacture abortion drugs and birth control. The company receives most of its merchandise from China, a country where overpopulation has led to mandatory abortions and sterilizations for women who try to have more than one child.\n\n\u201cWhile we work to overturn this decision by legislation, people of good conscience should BOYCOTT any for-profit business, including Hobby Lobby, which chooses to impose its religious beliefs on its employees,\u201d said Takei. \u201cThe only way such companies ever learn to treat people with decency and tolerance is to hit them where it counts \u2014 in their pocketbooks.\u201d\n\n[image of George Takei via Facebook.com]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/George-Takei-via-Facebook-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "George Takei: What if Hobby Lobby was run by Muslims imposing Sharia law on workers?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecd8\"", "article_summary": "George Takei (Facebook)Former Star Trek actor George Takei blasted Monday\u2019s decision by the Supreme Court allowing the craft store Hobby Lobby to opt out of the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cThe only way such companies ever learn to treat people with decency and tolerance is to hit them where it counts \u2014 in their pocketbooks.\u201d[image of George Takei via Facebook.com]\n\u201cWhile we work to overturn this decision by legislation, people of good conscience should BOYCOTT any for-profit business, including Hobby Lobby, which chooses to impose its religious beliefs on its employees,\u201d said Takei.\n\u201cBusinesses must and should be required to comply with neutrally crafted laws of general applicability.\nIt\u2019s a business \u2014 and a big one at that,\u201d he continued."}
