Is anyone surprised, at this point, by yet another story about health insurance premium costs increasing under Obamacare?

According to projections from Healthcare.gov, Obamacare premiums will increase next year by an average of 18 percent for those who purchase the least-expensive (and least robust) tier of coverage through the federal healthcare exchange. That estimate was calculated using the largest market in each of the 34 states that use Healthcare.gov — instead of a state-run exchange — as a customer portal for Obamacare.

Investor’s Business Daily offers this helpful graph to illustrate the changes in each of those markets:

Only nine of the Healthcare.gov states can expect to see average premium prices fall or remain level next year, with the largest savings — 38.6 percent — in the Sioux Falls, South Dakota, market. Contrast that with the five states that will see premiums increase by more than 38.6 percent, as well as with the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, market — which is expected to see average premium costs double.

In some markets, catastrophic coverage plans are beginning to cannibalize the bronze tier, Obamacare’s next-highest level of coverage, according to IBD.

“In 17 of these markets, the lowest-priced catastrophic plan in 2015 won’t be even 10% cheaper than the lowest-cost unsubsidized bronze option and will offer limited savings — at best,” IBD reported.

“In seven cities, there’s effectively no catastrophic option because the cheapest one costs more than the low-cost bronze plan.”
