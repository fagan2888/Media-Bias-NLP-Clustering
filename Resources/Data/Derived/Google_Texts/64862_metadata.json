The Philippines has signed such visiting forces accords with the United States and Japan.\n\nJapan's Emperor Akihito paid his respects last month at war memorials in the Philippines, where the largest number of Japanese invasion troops perished outside their homeland in World War II.\n\nLast year, Japan's parliament approved contentious legislation that enhances the role of the country's military by loosening post-World War II constraints, reinterpreting the Japanese constitution and fundamentally changing the way it uses its military.\n\nFor the first time since the end of the World War II, Japan's military can now defend its allies even when the country isn't under attack and work more closely with the United States and other nations.\n\nThe legislation has sparked protests and debate about whether Japan should shift away from its pacifist ways to face growing security challenges.\n\nGazmin said there has been no discussion on what defense equipment Japan can provide, but added that the Philippine military currently needs to upgrade its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.\n\n\"They haven't offered what we can buy,\" Gazmin said. \"There needs to be a wish list.\"\n\nA senior Philippine security official said the new pact will pave the way for Japan to sell new military hardware, transfer defense technology, donate used military equipment or provide defense training to Filipino forces.\n\nIt \"opens the door to a lot of opportunities beyond the confines of mere equipment transfer or sale,\" the official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.\n\nThe Philippines, however, is restricted from reselling or transferring any Japanese-supplied military equipment to a third country, the official said.\n\nJapan has forged similar pacts with the U.S. and Australia, but the Philippines is the first Southeast Asian country to have such a defense deal with Tokyo, Gazmin said.\n\nAside from China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have conflicting claims in the South China Sea, a major conduit for world trade. The U.S. lays no claims to the disputed territories, but began bold attempts to promote freedom of navigation and overflight after China turned several disputed shoals into islands that rival claimants fear could be used as a springboard to project its military might and intimidate rival claimants.\n\nBeijing has said it harbors no hegemonic intent, insisting that it has the right to build in what it says has been Chinese territory since ancient times.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Japan will sign an accord with the Philippines to allow Tokyo to supply military equipment to Manila, the first such Japanese defense pact in a region where both have expressed alarm over China's island-building and other aggressive acts in disputed waters.", "title": "Japan to supply Philippines with military equipment", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/japan-to-supply-philippines-with-military-equipment/370362441/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Japan will sign an accord with the Philippines to allow Tokyo to supply military equipment to Manila, the first such Japanese defense pact in a region where both have expressed alarm over China's island-building and other aggressive acts in disputed waters.", "title": "Japan to supply Philippines with military equipment", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/japan-to-supply-philippines-with-military-equipment/370362441/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Japan will sign an accord with the Philippines to allow Tokyo to supply military equipment to Manila, the first such Japanese defense pact in a region where both have expressed alarm over China's island-building and other aggressive acts in disputed waters."}, "article_summary": "The Philippines, however, is restricted from reselling or transferring any Japanese-supplied military equipment to a third country, the official said.\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Japan will sign an accord with the Philippines to allow Tokyo to supply military equipment to Manila, the first such Japanese defense pact in a region where both have expressed alarm over China's island-building and other aggressive acts in disputed waters.\nA senior Philippine security official said the new pact will pave the way for Japan to sell new military hardware, transfer defense technology, donate used military equipment or provide defense training to Filipino forces.\nGazmin said there has been no discussion on what defense equipment Japan can provide, but added that the Philippine military currently needs to upgrade its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.\nThe Philippines has signed such visiting forces accords with the United States and Japan."}
