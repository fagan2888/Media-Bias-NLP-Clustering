Early on, Josef is summoned to a judicial examination, only to find that the courtroom is hidden, located inside a random apartment in a housing tenement.

The trial is carried out in secret by the higher courts that neither Josef, his lawyer, nor the judges they interact with will ever see. Ultimately, his conviction is something of an anticlimax, having been preordained long ago by the impenetrable bureaucracy and the arbitrary arrest. (Spoiler Alert!)

It\u2019s not just one side of the aisle, either: It was, after all, the Bush administration that first extended a bailout to GM and Chrysler. And who could forget the Republican-led government shutdown in 2013?\n\nThese decisions produce real-world effects. When politicians choose discretionary policies, investors withhold capital, consumers delay purchasing decisions, and managers prepare to fight litigation stemming from new regulations. According to some estimates, uncertainty cost the U.S. economy roughly $150 billion in 2011 alone.\n\nAt the beginning of The Trial, Josef K. tries to reason with his arresting officers by telling them, \u201cI don\u2019t know [the] Law.\u201d One imagines that in the current era of discretion-driven government, nobody really does, and, even if someone did, it wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference.\n\n\u2014 Alex Entz is a recent graduate of Northwestern University.
