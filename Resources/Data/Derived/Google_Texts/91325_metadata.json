If you\u2019re like most of us, lots of perks and benefits \u2014 pricey treatments you may not know you qualify for. But it\u2019s actually mandated by your state or federal coverage laws.\n\nOne woman figured out how to squeeze the most out of her health insurance.\n\nMegan Maddox can make the perfect pastry at Aux Merveilleux in the West Village, but like most of us, probably doesn\u2019t know all the ingredients in her healthcare plan. \u201cIt\u2019s like a foreign language because it\u2019s the first year I\u2019m off my parents plan. It\u2019s like a nightmare!\u201d\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act rolled out, lots of changes have come to health insurance plans, and you may not even know all the benefits of your plan. I asked Maddox about her coverage: can you get chiropractic care? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d responded Maddox. Next: acupuncture? Again the same answer from Maddox, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d What about massage therapy? Still the same refrain, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nBut there is someone who does know. Ginalisa Monterosso, with the Medicaid Advisory Group weighed in. \u201cWe really need to be as a consumer to be inquisitive about the type of health care coverage we have.\u201d For 25 years, Monterroso has been guiding consumers through the often maddening maze that health coverage can be. She advises that we may have a whole lot more coming our way than we thought, like \u201cChiropractic services, infertility, weight loss, acupuncture.\u201d\n\nBariatric surgery, which can cost upwards of $20,000, although an elective procedure, is covered in both New York and New Jersey. Infertility treatment? That\u2019s covered, too. Looking to reap the benefits of acupuncture or chiropractic? Chances are there\u2019s money for that in your plan as well. Any state licensed physician has their services covered, which is how all these \u201cnewer\u201d treatments now get benefits, too.\n\nMaddox lamented the constantly changing landscape of health plans. \u201cEvery year my co-pay would change, half the time my doctors wouldn\u2019t know what it was. It\u2019s complicated!\u201d And Monterosso says while it\u2019s not one size fits all, you can crack the code to your plan\u2019s secret benefits by hitting the \u201cSummary of Benefits\u201d pages, where the plans are mandated to lay out all the coverage you\u2019re entitled to in the fine print.\n\nA few quirks include that female contraception gets covered, while male contraception like condoms and vasectomies generally does not. And Monterosso reminds us that sometimes we have to be a bit of a detective, perhaps calling the doctor\u2019s office and asking them if a procedure is covered before booking an appointment. But it pays off especially when we\u2019re talking about procedures that cost tens of thousands of dollars.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What is your health insurance company hiding from you?\u00a0 If you\u2019re like most of us, lots of perks and benefits \u2014 pricey treatments you may not know you qualify for.\u00a0 But it\u2019s actually mandated by your state or federal coverage laws.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "New York's PIX11 / WPIX-TV", "description": "What is your health insurance company hiding from you?\u00a0 If you\u2019re like most of us, lots of perks and benefits \u2014 pricey treatments you may not know you qualify for.\u00a0 But it\u2019s actually mandated by yo\u2026", "title": "How to get the most out of your health plan coverage", "url": "http://pix11.com/2016/03/09/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-health-plan-coverage/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/promo281801815.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/promo281801815.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@PIX11News", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PIX11News"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "New York News, Weather, Entertainment, Transit and More", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=587593522", "fb": {"pages": 76073377041}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://pix11.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1ed18cbab7a076bdb92e6a7ec0bae5ab?s=16", "application-name": "New York's PIX11 / WPIX-TV", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/pix11news", "published_time": "2016-03-09T14:28:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-09T14:28:29+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/pix11news"}, "keywords": "morning,", "google-site-verification": "NwkxplaUCiSUM7fwyF8LprcUZJryQRaTVtXjbjzon-4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, NY, NJ, healthcare"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe really need to be as a consumer to be inquisitive about the type of health care coverage we have.\u201d For 25 years, Monterroso has been guiding consumers through the often maddening maze that health coverage can be.\nIt\u2019s like a nightmare!\u201dSince the Affordable Care Act rolled out, lots of changes have come to health insurance plans, and you may not even know all the benefits of your plan.\nMaddox lamented the constantly changing landscape of health plans.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d responded Maddox.\nAgain the same answer from Maddox, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d What about massage therapy?"}
