Betsy McCaughey has the scoop:\n\nClaiming women aren\u2019t getting paid enough, President Obama wants to make it easier to accuse employers of gender discrimination and hit them with class-action lawsuits. A new regulation proposed on Friday will require all employers with 100 or more workers to report how much their workforce is paid, broken down by race and gender.\n\nThe rule, slated to go into effect in September 2017, will cause headaches for employers and anyone \u2014 man or woman \u2014 who works hard and expects to get ahead based on merit. The winners are federal bean counters, class-action lawyers and the Democratic Party, which is playing up the gender \u201cwage gap\u201d as usual during this election year.\n\nNever mind that the gap is largely fiction. Or that Uncle Sam\u2019s social engineers are foisting their cookie-cutter vision of a politically correct workplace on employers, denying them the freedom to hire and promote based on merit. Race and gender discrimination is already against the law. As it should be. But seniority, education and merit often explain salary differences.\n\nThat won\u2019t be good enough in the future. Employers will have to change their policies to avoid these differences \u2014 for example, not preferring the job applicant who has a college degree over the applicant who doesn\u2019t, unless the job can be shown to require college skills. The burden is on employers. It\u2019s assumed they\u2019re discriminating, in other words, and they have to prove they\u2019re not.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "New Obama employment rules heading our way", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "Trending", "description": "Keep telling yourself: our diversity is our strength...", "title": "Obama's Parting Shot to America: Dismantling Meritocracy", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/trending/2016/02/03/obamas-parting-shot-to-america-dismantling-meritocracy/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/trending/user-content/51/files/2016/02/AP_691276320280.sized-770x415xt.jpg", "updated_time": 1464309337, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Keep telling yourself: our diversity is our strength...", "title": "Obama's Parting Shot to America: Dismantling Meritocracy", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/trending/2016/02/03/obamas-parting-shot-to-america-dismantling-meritocracy/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/trending/user-content/51/files/2016/02/AP_691276320280.sized-770x415xt.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "New Obama employment rules heading our way", "pinterestDescription": "Obama's Parting Shot to America: Dismantling Meritocracy", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "keywords": "Obama, Betsy McCaughey, work, employment, diversity", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Remember: nothing is more important to the success of America than diversity in the workplace.\nThe winners are federal bean counters, class-action lawyers and the Democratic Party, which is playing up the gender \u201cwage gap\u201d as usual during this election year.\nBetsy McCaughey has the scoop:Claiming women aren\u2019t getting paid enough, President Obama wants to make it easier to accuse employers of gender discrimination and hit them with class-action lawsuits.\nIt\u2019s assumed they\u2019re discriminating, in other words, and they have to prove they\u2019re not.\nA new regulation proposed on Friday will require all employers with 100 or more workers to report how much their workforce is paid, broken down by race and gender."}
