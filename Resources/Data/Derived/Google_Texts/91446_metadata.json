The research was published in the March issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences with the goal of figuring out how people reacted when one group was given a more negative feed compared to a group given a more positive feed.\n\n\u201cThis was part of ongoing research companies do to test different products, and that was what it was; it was poorly communicated,\u201d Facebook\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said while in New Delhi promoting Lean In, her new book. \u201cAnd for that communication we apologize. We never meant to upset you.\u201d\n\nThey suppressed certain people\u2019s newsfeed from seeing their friends\u2019 happy news, statuses, and photos; while others were limited in how much negativity they experienced. The psychological experiment observed users for one-week in 2012, and the data that was collected was interpreted using an algorithm to determine whether decreasing or increasing negativity could prompt or discourage positivity in users.\n\n\u201cWe felt that it was important to investigate the common worry that seeing friends post positive content leads to people feeling negative or left out. At the same time, we were concerned that exposure to friends' negativity might lead people to avoid visiting Facebook,\u201d lead researcher and Facebook data scientist Adam Kramar wrote.\n\nSandberg is a technology executive and activist for women in business. In 2012, she was named in the TIME 100, and after her book released in 2013, she became viewed as one of the strongest rising women in the world. She previously served as vice president of global online sales at Google Inc. until she joined Facebook in 2008. As Facebook\u2019s number two in charge, she apologizes for the lack of communication, although many are still unhappy about it.\n\n\u201cWe take privacy and security at Facebook really seriously because that is something that allows people to share,\u201d Sandberg said.\n\nFacebook\u2019s secretive study was just \u201ca glimpse into a wide-ranging practice,\u201d Kate Crawford, a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Center for Civic Media and a principal researcher at Microsoft Research told The Washington Journal. Companies \u201creally do see users as a willing experimental test bed.\u201d\n\nMany users weren\u2019t happy to find out they were used as unwilling mice in a large maze of experiments going above their heads. However, \u201clike\u201d it or not, there\u2019s nothing users can do about it because anyone who\u2019s a member of Facebook already signed their name off on the agreement.\n\n\u201cAs such, it was consistent with Facebook\u2019s Data Use Policy, to which all users agree prior to creating an account on Facebook, constituting informed consent for this research,\u201d read the study.\n\nOnly those who took the time to decipher the jargon could understand that meant their private information and newsfeed could be manipulated and used freely without their knowledge or permission at any given point.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "facebooks, sheryl, sandberg, apologizes, studying, users, without, their, permission", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Facebook manipulated its users' newsfeeds in order to perform sociological testing without their prior knowledge.", "title": "Facebook (Finally) Apologizes For Using You As A Guinea Pig Without Your Consent", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/facebooks-sheryl-sandberg-apologizes-studying-users-without-their-permission-291372", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/03/facebook-experiments-users-without-telling-them.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Facebook manipulated its users' newsfeeds in order to perform sociological testing without their prior knowledge.", "title": "Facebook (Finally) Apologizes For Using You As A Guinea Pig Without Your Consent", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/facebooks-sheryl-sandberg-apologizes-studying-users-without-their-permission-291372", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/03/facebook-experiments-users-without-telling-them.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/03/facebook-experiments-users-without-telling-them.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-07-03T14:23:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-03T14:23:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Facebook manipulated its users' newsfeeds in order to perform sociological testing without their prior knowledge."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09ed\"", "article_summary": "As Facebook\u2019s number two in charge, she apologizes for the lack of communication, although many are still unhappy about it.\nAt the same time, we were concerned that exposure to friends' negativity might lead people to avoid visiting Facebook,\u201d lead researcher and Facebook data scientist Adam Kramar wrote.\n\u201cAs such, it was consistent with Facebook\u2019s Data Use Policy, to which all users agree prior to creating an account on Facebook, constituting informed consent for this research,\u201d read the study.\nFacebook apologizes for using its members and changing around their newsfeed for experiments without them knowing.\n\u201cWe take privacy and security at Facebook really seriously because that is something that allows people to share,\u201d Sandberg said."}
