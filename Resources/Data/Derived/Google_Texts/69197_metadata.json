(Photo: AP File)\n\nThe first debate among the Democrats vying for their party\u2019s nomination for president was held Tuesday night (Oct. 13) in Las Vegas. Just as much of the evening focused on just two of the five candidates \u2014 former Secretary of State, New York senator, and First Lady Hillary Clinton and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders \u2014 when it came to health policy, the conversation was focused around two primary health issues: Expanding the Affordable Care Act to undocumented immigrants and their children and adopting a federally mandated paid family leave.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about both key issues:\n\nPaid Family Leave\n\nClinton brought paid leave to the forefront of the conversation immediately, making the issue a key point during the two-minutes she was given to introduce herself.\n\n\u201cAnd I want to do more to help us balance family and work,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cI believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but I also believe it\u2019s about time we had paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nSanders also made mention of paid leave. Both times he discussed the issue he explicitly tied it to the need for leave for new mothers.\n\nIn explaining his adherence to what he refers to as \u201cdemocratic socialism,\u201d Sanders mentioned \u201cYou see every other major country saying to moms that, when you have a baby, we\u2019re not gonna separate you from your newborn baby, because we are going to have \u2014 we are gonna have medical and family paid leave, like every other country on Earth.\u201d\n\nLater in the debate when the question of paid leave was again raised among the candidates, Sanders said, \u201cEvery other major country on Earth, every one, including some small countries, say that when a mother has a baby, she should stay home with that baby. \u2026 That is an international embarrassment that we do not provide family \u2014 paid family and medical leave.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 latter remark was triggered by a question posed to Clinton by CNN debate moderator Dana Bash, who mentioned that \u201cCarly Fiorina, the first female CEO of a Fortune 50 company, argues, if the government requires paid leave, it will force small businesses to, quote, \u2018hire fewer people and create fewer jobs.\u2019 What do you say not only to Carly Fiorina, but also a small-business owner out there who says, you know, I like this idea, but I just can\u2019t afford it?\u201d\n\nRelated: Doctors \u2018Horrified\u2019 by Republican Candidates\u2019 Outlook on Vaccines\n\nClinton went on to mention California\u2019s paid leave program and \u201cthe incredible challenges that so many parents face, particularly working moms,\u201d ultimately culminating in perhaps her most electric moment of the night, in which she told Bash, \u201cIt\u2019s always the Republicans or their sympathizers who say, \u201cYou can\u2019t have paid leave, you can\u2019t provide health care.\u201d They don\u2019t mind having big government to interfere with a woman\u2019s right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood. They\u2019re fine with big government when it comes to that. I\u2019m sick of it. \u2026 I know we can afford it, because we\u2019re going to make the wealthy pay for it. That is the way to get it done.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow the question always gets framed is, How can we possibly afford to do this? Everyone will lose their jobs! No one will want to hire women! It\u2019s always very fatalistic,\u201d Sarah Jane Glynn, the Director of Women\u2019s Economic Policy at the Center for American Progress, tells Yahoo Health.\n\nAnd yet, she notes, \u201cthe United States is the only advanced economy that doesn\u2019t have a paid family leave program. We are an outlier among very wealthy countries. So, a lot of other folks have figured out how to do this and it hasn\u2019t destroyed their economies. To say it would be a death knell to businesses \u2014 well, just look north to Canada. This hasn\u2019t been the case. It\u2019s ridiculous on its face [to claim that] given how widespread these policies are across the globe.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s paid family program \u2014 which provides workers with partial wage replacement and benefits when they take time off work to care for a child, spouse, parent or close family member and has been in place in the state for over a decade \u2014 is a perfect domestic case study on the efficacy of such measures, says Glynn. \u201cPrior to implementation of the program in California, the business community was very nervous. They were especially concerned that workers would constantly be out on leave and that businesses would be forced out of state because of the toll that a paid leave mandate would have on their bottom lines.\u201d\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton during Tuesday evening\u2019s debate.\u00a0(Photo: AP File)\u00a0 The first debate among the Democrats vying for their party\u2019s nomination for president was held Tuesday night (Oct. 13) in Las Vegas.
