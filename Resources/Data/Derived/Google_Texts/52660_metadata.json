He had two pieces of good news: The number of Americans who lack health insurance is dropping, and health care and health insurance isn\u2019t costing as much as we expected. He\u2019s right about the first part, and it can probably be attributed to the Affordable Care Act: The uninsured rate is dropping, thanks in large part to the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion, though how much, we\u2019re not sure. (And, of course, the economy is improving, and the drop in uninusred looks to be noticeably less than the Congressional Budget Office predicted the law\u2019s effects to be.)\n\nThe much more problematic claim is that Obamacare is holding down the cost of health insurance. Here\u2019s his first claim:\n\nIf your family gets your health care through your employer, premiums are rising at a rate tied for the lowest on record. What this means for the economy is staggering. If we hadn\u2019t taken this on, and premiums had kept growing at the rate they did in the last decade, the average premium for family coverage today would be $1,800 higher than they are. That\u2019s $1,800 you don\u2019t have to pay out of our pocket or see vanish from your paycheck. That\u2019s like a $1,800 tax cut.\n\nFirst, this is only like an $1,800 tax cut if you expect your taxes to rise, say, 8 to 10 percent a year, as health insurance premiums often do \u2014 Americans are not seeing premiums drop for comparable employer health plans. Premiums have risen relatively slowly for employer plans over the past couple years, but there\u2019s almost no way the president can possibly claim credit for this. The Affordable Care Act didn\u2019t \u201ctake on\u201d employer health insurance at all, really \u2014 it only made small, relatively inexpensive tweaks to that market (such as the HHS mandate). Employer premiums are rising slowly for a couple reasons: the overall health-cost slowdown and the continued shift to high-deductible, health-savings-account plans. The latter is due in large part to President Bush\u2019s Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, which made such savings accounts much more feasible. (Obamacare\u2019s \u201dCadillac tax\u201d will also drive the growth of these plans in the future \u2014 he does deserve credit for that.)\n\nWhat about that overall cost slowdown? It\u2019s also almost impossible to attribute it to Obamacare, and other factors are probably driving it, not least the bad economy. Obamacare could slow down costs in the future, but the law has barely been implemented. Meanwhile, health-care-cost growth has slowed across the entire wealthy world, mostly because of the recession, and growth started slowing in the United States in the mid 2000s. This has shown up most obviously in Medicare, which makes up a huge part of our health-care system. In a column on \u201cthe Medicare miralce,\u201d Paul Krugman was eager to attribute some of the slowdown to Obamacare, but Vox\u2019s Sarah Kliff, writing for an outlet not exactly hostile to the president, explains that there are other factors going on, and any connection to Obamacare is quite speculative.\n\nPresident Obama was careful in his discussion of Medicare, though he\u2019s still putting it next to unjustified claims about his law and the cost slowdown:\n\nPartly because health-care prices have been growing at the slowest rate in nearly half a century, the growth in what health care costs the government is down, too. The independent, nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently reported that in 2020, Medicare and Medicaid will cost us $188 billion less than projected just four years ago. Here\u2019s what that means in layman\u2019s terms. Health care has long been the single biggest driver of America\u2019s future deficits. Health care is now the single biggest factor driving those deficits down.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a very good layman\u2019s explanation. Health-care is still the single biggest factor driving America\u2019s future deficits \u2014 ignoring interest, it\u2019s not even close. What\u2019s really happening: When you look at what we projected for future deficits several years ago, and what we\u2019re projecting now, the single biggest improvement in that picture is due to slower health-cost growth. But it\u2019s still health-cost growth that\u2019s expected to generate the deficits, and we don\u2019t know whether Obamacare is going to help in that regard. Few listeners of the president\u2019s speech would understand that.\n\nThe president also noted that rates for Obamacare insurance in some places are actually falling next year: This is based on on report, from the Kaiser Family Foundation, that premiums for \u201csilver plans\u201d are on average falling in the 16 cities where they could get data. Kaiser VP Larry Levitt, as Obama noted, really did say it\u2019s \u201clike defying the laws of physics.\u201d I\u2019m not quite as surprised: Premiums shot up across the individual market in 2013, and insurers are now eager to keep people on their plans, since they\u2019re protected from significant losses for the next couple years by the way Obamacare is designed. If putting American taxpayers on the hook to hold premiums down for a small number of insurance enrollees and to protect insurance-company profits, and canceling tens of thousands of more insurance plans, is \u201cprogress\u201d the president \u201ccan be proud of,\u201d well, okay.\n\nAnd apparently the president couldn\u2019t resist one more slippery reference to Obamacare. Describing the sharp reduction in current annual deficits over the past few years, he said:\n\nBetween a growing economy, spending cuts, health reform, and asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more, over the past five years, we have cut our deficits by more than half. When I took office, the deficit was nearly 10% of our economy. Today, it\u2019s approaching 3%. In other words, we can shore up America\u2019s long-term finances without falling back into the mindless austerity or manufactured crises that dominated Washington budget debates for too long.\n\nHe\u2019s right about the numbers, and all the causes except one: \u201cHealth reform\u201d is an interesting way to describe how the ACA has affected the deficit so far. The Congressional Budget Office projected that it would cut the deficit by billions in 2012, 2013, and 2014 (estimates have not changed dramatically since then), but that\u2019s not because of the reforms it made. The deficit reduction in the ACA during that time was entirely tax increases \u2014 which have not, by the way, fallen only on \u201cthe wealthiest Americans.\u201d A couple of the tax hikes were targeted at the wealthy, but an excise tax on medical devices, multiple kinds of taxes on heath insurance, and the individual mandate are not targeted at the wealthy.\n\nAnd his conclusion from this is simply illogical: The dropping deficit, he says, shows how we can improve our long-term finances without \u201cmindless austerity or manufactured crises.\u201d I\u2019d like to think so, too, but the factors he identified \u2014 besides the growing economy \u2014 were all the product of (more or less) mindless austerity or congressional crises. I don\u2019t like that any more than the president, but it\u2019s nonsense for him to claim that the improving budget picture shows a way forward. (Unless he just wants to cut the deficit by focusing on growth exclusively \u2014 I don\u2019t expect him to propose that anytime soon.)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Thu, 2014-10-02 16:01", "sailthru.author": "Patrick Brennan", "description": "In today\u2019s speech on the economy, President Obama devoted an extended section to Obamacare and health care, a topic he generally hasn\u2019t been eager to discuss since the law took effect.

Kaiser VP Larry Levitt, as Obama noted, really did say it\u2019s \u201clike defying the laws of physics.\u201d I\u2019m not quite as surprised: Premiums shot up across the individual market in 2013, and insurers are now eager to keep people on their plans, since they\u2019re protected from significant losses for the next couple years by the way Obamacare is designed. If\u00a0putting American taxpayers on the hook\u00a0 to hold premiums down for a small number of insurance enrollees and to protect insurance-company profits, and canceling tens of thousands of more insurance plans, is \u201cprogress\u201d the president \u201ccan be proud of,\u201d well, okay.\n\nAnd apparently the president couldn\u2019t resist one more slippery reference to Obamacare.\u00a0Describing the sharp reduction in current annual deficits over the past few years, he said:\u00a0\n\n\nBetween a growing economy, spending cuts, health reform, and asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more, over the past five years, we have cut our deficits by more than half.\u00a0 When I took office, the deficit was nearly 10% of our economy.\u00a0 Today, it\u2019s approaching 3%.\u00a0 In other words, we can shore up America\u2019s long-term finances without falling back into the mindless austerity or manufactured crises that dominated Washington budget debates for too long.\n\n\nHe\u2019s right about the numbers, and all the causes except one: \u201cHealth reform\u201d is an interesting way to describe how the ACA has affected the deficit so far. The Congressional Budget Office projected that it would cut the deficit by billions in 2012, 2013, and 2014 (estimates have not changed dramatically since then), but that\u2019s not because of the reforms it made.\u00a0The deficit reduction in the ACA during that time was entirely tax increases \u2014 which have not, by the way, fallen only on \u201cthe wealthiest Americans.\u201d A couple of the tax hikes were targeted at the wealthy, but an excise tax on medical devices, multiple kinds of taxes on heath insurance, and the individual mandate are not targeted at the wealthy.\n\nAnd his conclusion from this is simply illogical: The dropping deficit, he says, shows how we can improve our long-term finances without \u201cmindless austerity or manufactured crises.\u201d I\u2019d like to think so, too, but the factors he identified \u2014 besides the growing economy \u2014 were all the product of (more or less) mindless austerity or congressional crises. I don\u2019t like that any more than the president, but it\u2019s nonsense for him to claim that the improving budget picture shows a way forward. (Unless he just wants to cut the deficit by focusing on growth exclusively \u2014 I don\u2019t expect him to propose that anytime soon.)", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama Takes Credit for the Health-Cost Slowdown.
