That\u2019s when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issues new MA plan rates and policies for the next year.\n\nFormer Rep. Allyson Schwartz (D-Pa.) is trying to change that. She believes Medicare Advantage should be in the healthcare conversation year-round. As head of the relatively new nonpartisan MA advocacy group, Better Medicare Alliance, she intends to make that happen.\n\nThe annual MA dance ended this week, when CMS released its final notice for 2017. It followed weeks of lobbying, congressional letters, and studies on how the proposed changes could impact beneficiaries. Now, as the only advocacy organization dedicated solely to MA, BMA will continue working to publicize the benefits of the a private-sector health program for seniors.\n\n\u201cIt really is about all the rest of the year, when we throughout the year will continue to fund research projects, to collect the evidence, to share the innovations that are happening in Medicare Advantage, to be able to speak to what is working and what we should do more of, what are the best practices,\u201d Schwartz said in an interview with Morning Consult.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely a full-time, around-the-clock kind of activity, and we hope that that will build the kind of relationship with policymakers on the Hill, in the administration, in the new administration, with people who look at health policy. Medicare matters a lot to Americans,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Better Medicare Alliance is only a little over a year old. It was founded by a group of stakeholders that includes insurance plans, providers, business groups, and associations. They approached Schwartz to become BMA\u2019s first president and CEO.\n\nDuring her decade-long tenure in Congress, Schwartz worked on healthcare issues relating to affordability and access. It\u2019s no secret in Washington that the financial trajectory of Medicare is rocky at best, and there\u2019s widespread interest in being able to find the sweet spot of policy that promotes quality care for seniors while also controlling costs.\n\nThe establishment of a coalition with the sole mission of advocating for MA \u2014 led by a Democrat \u2014 is perhaps the most tangible expression of the program\u2019s growing popularity. Medicare Advantage was a Republican idea at the beginning, but now it\u2019s hard to find anyone in either party who says anything bad about it. BMA as an organization is definitively nonpartisan.\n\n\u201cIt works. It\u2019s working for providers, it\u2019s working for beneficiaries. And I think members of Congress see their constituents, who are Medicare beneficiaries, getting the kind of care they need and liking it, appreciating it. They appreciate the affordability, the care coordination, and the simplicity of a single premium, a single benefit,\u201d Schwartz said.\n\nMedicare Advantage is offered to seniors as an alternative to traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Plans are offered through private insurers, who receive a set amount of money from the government per beneficiary to cover all hospital and medical expenses.\n\nIt\u2019s different from traditional Medicare, which separates the two kinds of services into Part A (hospital services) and Part B (doctor\u2019s visits). Traditional Medicare also pays providers and hospitals for each service rendered, rather than a set amount per beneficiary. Because they get paid by the person rather than each service, MA insurers function as virtual petri dish for innovations on how to provide better care at lower costs.\n\nEven though MA was historically a Republican-supported idea, this year, congressional support is coming from both parties. That\u2019s in part because it\u2019s growing in Democratic districts as well as Republican ones. More than 30 percent of Medicare enrollees have chosen MA plans. But, as Schwartz said, support also comes because people can see it\u2019s transforming the healthcare system.\n\nMedicare Advantage\u2019s growth in enrollment and support is remarkable given the cuts made to it under the Affordable Care Act, suggesting the program is stronger than its original naysayers had suggested. Some plans have been able to accomplish the difficult task of doing more with less dollars. (That efficiency may not necessarily help when the plans are lobbying for more money from CMS, but at least it is a productive conversation.)\n\n\u201cThere were definitely many \u2013 including [the Congressional Budget Office] \u2013 who thought the ACA\u2019s MA cuts would lower enrollment in that market. But people underestimated both the additional efficiencies that were possible and the growing comfort of younger seniors with managed care, leading to more 65-year-olds choosing MA when they signed up for Medicare,\u201d said Loren Adler, an associate director at the Brookings Institution.\n\nSchwartz says MA\u2019s value-based practices impact all of healthcare. \u201cWe believe they really are transforming what is happening in Medicare. And when you transform what is happening in Medicare, it has a real effect on the way healthcare is provided in this country to the benefit of a lot of people who are not even in Medicare Advantage,\u201d she said.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of what she is talking about. BMA commissioned a study that found that the likelihood of an avoidable hospitalization is 10 percent lower for MA beneficiaries than fee-for-service enrollees. That is exactly what health wonks want to see happen in a system where insurers are paid a set fee for each beneficiary. The increased incentive for keeping enrollees healthy and out of the hospital pays off.\n\nThose innovations can impact the rest of the healthcare system. \u201cWhat they also found is there is a spillover effect for their patients, whether they\u2019re in Medicare Advantage or not,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cBecause once you start to practice that way, you practice it for all of your patients, and certainly throughout the Medicare patients as well.\u201d\n\nSchwartz is comfortable in the healthcare world. She uses wonky healthcare buzzwords that mean specific things to the industry, like \u201ccare coordination\u201d and \u201chealthcare delivery.\u201d\n\nShe may not have asked for this, but her job in promoting a program that, by necessity, must find new ways to deliver healthcare makes her voice a contrast to the heated rhetoric surrounding Obamacare in Congress. Hers is the kind of conversation that health professionals say matters the most when it comes to the sustainability of the system. If patients are kept healthier by a system incentivized to work well, that cuts down costs to both the government and patients.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find anyone who disagrees with Schwartz that MA is successful, no matter what they think about Obamacare. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of interest,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is true on the Hill, but it\u2019s certainly true with CMS, that they see Medicare Advantage as, in many ways, leading the way on some of these innovations in care delivery. And they want to know more about it. We do too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "Medicare Advantage, a private insurer alternative to Medicare, typically makes it onto Washington\u2019s policymaking radar for about two months in the spring each year.
