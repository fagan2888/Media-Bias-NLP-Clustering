Related Coverage State responds to HMSA’s request to raise ACA premiums by 49 percent

A week after HMSA announced its asking for its largest rate increase ever, the Dept. of Commerce and Consumer Affairs took up the issue.

The provider said it wants to increase individual health plans under the Affordable Care Act by 49 percent. It would cover about three percent of HMSA’s members and the rate hike would cover the higher-than-expected medical costs.

The DCCA said while it can’t comment specifically on the hike because it’s still under review, it did admit it took them by surprise.

The state insurance commissioner will decide what kind of premium hike HMSA will get, and has 60 days to make that decision. But there is the possibility that the deadline could be extended.
