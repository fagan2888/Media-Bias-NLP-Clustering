Endocannabinoids are involved in appetite, memory, mood, and pain sensations. They\u2019re also involved in the psychoactive effects that cannabis has on us, as well as brain functions like cognition, behavior, and emotions.\n\nThe researchers found that in animal models, chronic stress reduced the production of endocannabinoids, which in turn led to depressive symptoms. \u201cChronic stress is one of the major causes of depression,\u201d said Samir Haj-Dahmane, a senior research scientist at RIA, in the press release. \u201cUsing compounds derived from cannabis \u2014 marijuana \u2014 to restore normal endocannabinoid function could potentially help stabilize moods and ease depression.\u201d\n\nBut the authors are quick to note that the research is preliminary, and more evidence will be needed to back up their claims \u2014 not to mention they\u2019d have to test this in humans for it to really be seen as effective.\n\nMarijuana And Mental Health\n\nThe marijuana and depression debate has been going on for years now, and this study may add to the discussion but it doesn\u2019t end it. It\u2019s complicated. Every individual is different, and the matter is made even more complex due to the wide variety of marijuana strains available, each one affecting individuals uniquely. Depression treatments must be tailored to fit each person; one depressed patient might benefit from cannabis, while another might find their anxiety is heightened from the drug.\n\nHowever, the limited research that does exist involving marijuana\u2019s beneficial health effects has found that it might assist in battling post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, stress, and even chronic pain. A team of researchers from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) completed a study on weed and anxiety, finding that relief from stress was one of the main reasons why people use it.\n\n\u201cCannabis and its derivatives have profound effects on a wide variety of behavioral and neural functions, ranging from feeding and metabolism to pain and cognition,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cHowever, epidemiological studies have indicated that the most common self-reported reason for using cannabis is rooted in its ability to reduce feelings of stress, tension, and anxiety.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s true. Cannabis can target the endocannabinoid system, which is responsible for anxiety and fear in the human brain. But is cannabis the best way to get there and keep things in order? That\u2019s a question that still hasn\u2019t been answered. No one is saying marijuana is a cure for depression, but it\u2019s certainly an area of research that should be further explored.\n\nSource: Haj-Dahmane S, Shen R.
