Rand Paul (R-Ky.) want all federal employees to suffer under Obamacare, he especially wants Chief Justice John Roberts to suffer under it.\n\nThe potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate plans on pushing for a Constitutional amendment that would outlaw any special exemptions to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for government employees, meaning that all federal workers would have to buy insurance through the new Obamacare health insurance exchanges that open next week.\n\n\u201cMy amendment says basically that everybody including Justice Roberts \u2014 who seems to be such a fan of Obamacare \u2014 gets it too,\u201d Paul told The Daily Caller Saturday from Mackinac Island in Michigan. Paul was in the Wolverine state for the Mackinac Conference this past weekend, winning the 2016 presidential straw poll with 36 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cSee, right now, Justice Roberts is still continuing to have federal employee health insurance subsidized by the taxpayer. And if he likes Obamacare so much, I\u2019m going to give him an amendment that gives Obamacare to Justice Roberts,\u201d he added.\n\nPaul specifically pointed fingers at Roberts as he was the swing vote in the 2012 U.S. Supreme Court case National Federation of Independent Business et. al. v. Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services, et. al. The 5-4 decision, which stated that the Affordable Care Act was a tax under the Commerce Clause, upheld the Constitutionality of Obamacare.\n\nPaul\u2019s proposal comes in light of a proposal by Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) which would make sure that the legislative and executive branches of the federal government are required to opt-in to Obamacare. Democrats have pushed against the proposal as it means their healthcare costs would increase. According to TheDC, the Office of Personnel Management agreed to offer a subsidy of about 75 percent of the cost of healthcare for members and staff under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe difference between Paul\u2019s and Vitter\u2019s proposals \u2013 according to Paul \u2013 is that his would cover all federal employees, not just Congress and the White House.\n\n\u201cI think mine is a little more inclusive,\u201d Paul told TheDC. \u201cMine \u2014 compared to Vitter\u2019s \u2014 would include all federal employees, and save billions of dollars. Why don\u2019t we do it for all federal employees? And mine would save quite a bit more money.\u201d\n\nAlthough he is pushing for the Constitutional amendment, Paul acknowledged Monday that Republicans have an uphill battle to climb if they are to defund Obamacare by failing to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government running by September 30, and that \u201cthere could be a compromise in the middle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president wants 100 percent of Obamacare, we want zero. Maybe we make it less bad through a compromise. So if the Republicans in the House pass defund, Democrats in the Senate continue to fund, maybe there could be a compromise in the middle where we get some rid of the taxes, and get rid of some of the bad parts of Obamacare,\u201d he said on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox and Friends\u201d Monday morning.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Not only does Kentucky Sen.
