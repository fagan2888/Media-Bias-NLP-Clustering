A suspect was fatally shot by a Colorado State Patrol trooper Friday afternoon in the 4800 block of Bannock Street.

Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson said the plainclothes trooper was part of an auto theft task force.

Jackson said the trooper was attempting to make an arrest when the suspect became combative, then attempted to flee and finally pulled a handgun, at which point the trooper fired.

The suspect was transported to a hospital in critical condition and pronuonced dead there.

The incident happened near the Ramada Inn at the junction of Interstate 25 and Interstate 70.

After the shooting, Denver police swarmed the area, questioning witnesses and detaining some possible suspects.

Footage taken by a television helicopter showed three people being detained by officers, sitting handcuffed on the parking lot.

All three were later released.

The trooper has been placed on administrative leave in accordance with patrol policy.
