Welcome to our feature highlighting the numerous Colorado tech companies that make cool stuff. These little snippets are intended for readers to explore the technology being made right here. One company at a time, of course.

Brackitz

If you think there’s nothing techie about construction toys that work without batteries, you probably think STEM has something to do with vegetation. Inspired by his children’s struggle to move from blocks to more complex engineering toys, Chris Cochella developed Brackitz, which encourages kids to turn wood planks into 3-D contraptions that don’t collapse when touched. It’s like Tinkertoys but without the pokey sticks. While it’s up to the child and parent to discuss and explore the STEM of the toy (the science, technology, engineering and math applications), just by building stuff a child learns about physics, architecture and other abstract math. Guess that saying is true: If you leave it in the playroom, they will build.1685 South Colorado Blvd., Suite S-133 in Denver2014Chris CochellaMade it to several 2015 toy award lists, including Academics’ Choice Dr. Toy’s Best Classics and Kidscreen’s Best of Toy Fair.720-446-5558 or sales@brackitz.com
