We selected 10 major political issues that have been part of the national conversation over the course of the midterm campaign and sought to rank their prominence nationally, state by state, and within each state.\n\nFor each of the three types of media, the issue with the highest national number received a score of 100, while the issue with the lowest number received a score of 0. All other issues were scored proportionally between 0 and 100. Each issue's three scores were then averaged for a final overall score. The issue with the score closest to 100 was ranked #1, and the issue closest to 0 was ranked #10. For the most recent week, Obamacare/Affordable Care Act was the issue most talked about nationwide; gay marriage was talked about least.\n\nWe also looked at how the states stacked up against one another for each issue. To do this, we show tweets, news stories, and political ads per 100,000 people, so states with large populations, like California and Texas, don\u2019t dominate the map. Finally, we looked at which issues were most talked about within each state, scoring each issue 0 to 100, and ranking them 1 to 10, using the same method as we did for the nationwide figures.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg Politics", "description": "With a week to go before Election Day, here are the issues people are tweeting about, politicians are making ads about, and the media is writing about.", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2014-issue-tracker", "image": "bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2014-issue-tracker/img/resonator-share.gif", "longTitle": "What people are tweeting, politicians are advertising, and the media is writing about.", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Bloomberg Graphics, politics, issues, twitter, tweets, politicians, ads, media", "twitter": {"site": "@bbgvisualdata", "card": "summary"}, "description": "With a week to go before Election Day, here are the issues people are tweeting about, politicians are making ads about, and the media is writing about.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8221\"", "article_summary": "The issue with the score closest to 100 was ranked #1, and the issue closest to 0 was ranked #10.\nFor the most recent week, Obamacare/Affordable Care Act was the issue most talked about nationwide; gay marriage was talked about least.\nFor each of the three types of media, the issue with the highest national number received a score of 100, while the issue with the lowest number received a score of 0.\nTo do this, we show tweets, news stories, and political ads per 100,000 people, so states with large populations, like California and Texas, don\u2019t dominate the map.\nWe selected 10 major political issues that have been part of the national conversation over the course of the midterm campaign and sought to rank their prominence nationally, state by state, and within each state."}
