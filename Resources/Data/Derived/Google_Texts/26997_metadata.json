Are they are saying what they think \u2013 or what they think we want to hear?\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump has rocketed to to the top of the sixteen-candidate heap \u2013 in large part because of his anti-illegal immigration stance. Which is from all appearances a relatively new position for him. Here\u2019s November 2012 Trump:\n\n\u201c(Mitt Romney) had a crazy policy of self deportation which was maniacal,\u201d Trump says. \u201cIt sounded as bad as it was, and he lost all of the Latino vote,\u201d Trump notes. \u201cHe lost the Asian vote. He lost everybody who is inspired to come into this country.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s current illegal immigration stance is\u2026slightly more staunch. And it appears to be working for him.\n\n(Of course, Trump is by no means the only 2016 candidate to radically reconfigure his immigration position \u2013 Hello, Senator Marco \u201cGang of Eight\u201d Rubio.)\n\nIf a pol flip-flops to the right side of an issue \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t mindlessly attack. Because we can not with any certitude know why they did it. What we can do is hail their correction \u2013 and hold them to it.\n\nSo it is with the awful Innovation Act.\n\nThe Innovation Act is fundamental transformation of the Constitutionally-protected patent process \u2013 without benefit of the Constitutional amendment process. All under the (intentional or accidental) false flags of \u201clitigation reform\u201d \u2013 to deal with \u201cpatent trolls.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cpatent trolls\u201d are almost always nothing more than people with patents \u2013 defending them against patent thieves. The patent holders usually have to sue to do that \u2013 this \u201clitigation reform\u201d makes it exponentially more difficult for them to do so.\n\nAn Innovation Act House vote is expected after the August recess. Except:\n\nPatent Reform Defectors Emerge in House\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee\u2019s lopsided approval of patent reform legislation last month would not have looked as overwhelming if every member showed up.\n\nSix of the seven members of the committee who were absent told The Hill they are leaning toward opposing the measure in its current form. Five of those opponents supported a similar bill last Congress\u2026.\n\nFlip-floppers all, potentially. Hopefully.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) 62% (R-Calif.) had put it on the July schedule and it appeared to be heading toward quick approval after a similar bill passed the full House last Congress 325-91.\n\nBut after a series of meetings, which opponents say did not go well, the bill was taken off the July calendar. McCarthy said last week that \u201cthere is more work to be done on it.\u201d\n\nBut why waste any more lipstick on this pig? When there are actual attractive bills to be had?\n\nTROL Act\n\nThis is not fundamental transformation. It specifically reforms demand letter abuse \u2013 without total system disruption.\n\nIt gives the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) the authority to deal with bad demand letter writers \u2013 on an a la carte basis. The FTC examines each case as it comes \u2013 rather then preemptive, all-encompassing legislation where every single patent holder trying to protect their intellectual property is assumed to be acting in bad faith.\n\nAnd that\u2019s about it. With DC \u2013 less is almost always more\u2026.\n\n\u2014\n\nStrong Act\n\nThis isn\u2019t fundamental transformation either. It reforms demand letter abuse \u2013 and cleans up some previous DC mistakes.\n\nThe last patent reform bill \u2013 the America Invents Act \u2013 established overly broad standards for when and how patents can be challenged at the patent office. This bill tightens them.\n\nAnd it uses the TROL Act language that ends abusive demand letters.\n\nAs Ronald Reagan said of his treaty dealings with the Soviet Union \u2013 \u201cTrust, but verify.\u201d\n\nWe should (almost always) give flip-floppers to correct positions the benefit of the doubt \u2013 and thereafter the totality of our scrutiny.\n\nIf actually elected, Trump should absolutely be held to his new anti-illegal immigration stance \u2013 which will have helped deliver him to the White House.\n\nAnd to these new tentatively anti-Innovation Act Republicans and Democrats \u2013 we say \u201cWelcome (almost) home. Do the right thing \u2013 and vote No.\u201d\n\nBetter still, House Leadership should take further note \u2013 and not waste any more makeup on this swine.\n\nLet\u2019s permanently leave it in the legislative pen. And move on to much better looking bills.\n\n[Originally published at RedState]", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe177a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt sounded as bad as it was, and he lost all of the Latino vote,\u201d Trump notes.\nAn Innovation Act House vote is expected after the August recess.\nThe last patent reform bill \u2013 the America Invents Act \u2013 established overly broad standards for when and how patents can be challenged at the patent office.\nDo the right thing \u2013 and vote No.\u201dBetter still, House Leadership should take further note \u2013 and not waste any more makeup on this swine.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump has rocketed to to the top of the sixteen-candidate heap \u2013 in large part because of his anti-illegal immigration stance."}
