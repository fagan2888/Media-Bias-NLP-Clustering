Washington (CNN) Vice President Joe Biden will meet with AFL-CIO Richard Trumka later Thursday, further fueling talk that he may enter the White House race.

A Democratic official confirmed the meeting to CNN on condition of anonymity because the meeting is private. The meeting comes as Democratic Party leaders are meeting in Minneapolis.

The AFL-CIO has yet to endorse a candidate.
