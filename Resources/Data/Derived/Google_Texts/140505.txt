Left-wing radio host Bill Press on Monday ripped participants in this weekend’s “Million Vet March,” along with their Republican leaders, particularly Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

“Absolutely drives me crazy,” Press said regarding Sunday’s protest activities. “The dumbest ones there are the idiots who were protesting … they call them ‘vets.’ I wonder how many were really veterans. I don’t care if they were veterans, they don’t know what they hell they were doing.”

“I think they were organized by Heritage Action — so that’s Jim DeMint. They were organized by Americans for Prosperity — that’s the Koch Brothers. These people, again, don’t know what the hell they’re doing, don’t know what they’re saying, don’t realize they’re being used by these right-wing organizations,” Press continued, “and they’re being used by them to argue against something that’s in their own best interest.”

“How dumb can they be?” he asked, expressing shock that the marchers actually support Cruz:

“Don’t they realize that the guy that they were cheering yesterday, Ted Cruz, is the guy behind the shutdown? … Doesn’t everybody know that? Not those idiots. He’s the guy that came up with this idea that has proven to be a colossal failure. That the way to destroy and kill and get rid of Obamacare — the Affordable Care Act — is to shut down the government. That was his idea adopted by the House Republicans, and it’s a total failure. Total failure.”

Press concluded by suggesting how the marchers should have responded to Cruz: “They should have been hanging him in effigy at the memorial. They should have been booing him.”
