I think other candidates plans have similar growth numbers, but ours differentiates in a couple of significant ways. Number one, it is the most fiscally responsible. in other words if you look at the fact we are going to peel pretty much all of the deductions, all of the exemptions, everything goes away.\n\nWe lower rates, which is what everyone always talks about doing, lower rates, get rid of the complexity, stimulate growth, and do it in a way that doesn\u2019t explode the budget deficit. Which is really a big concern to many Republicans, including me. By getting rid of Obamacare taxes and Obamacare in conjunction with this actually over a ten-year period of time according to the Tax Foundation actually is revenue positive. It actually generates more revenue because of the tremendous growth it creates. It generates positive revenue so it is fiscally responsible, none of the other plans are even close. I mean Trump, Jindal explode the deficit right from the start like a trillion dollars a year in increased deficits.\n\nThe big differentiators \u2013 ours is really strongly pro-manufacturing.\n\nVander Hart: Ok\n\nSantorum: Our corporate provisions allow for full expensing which is very important for manufacturing. We have a repatriation provision which allows previously untaxed money which is sitting overseas into this country to be invested primarily by manufacturers in manufacturing, and we provide a two-year transition for all manufacturers where the first year there is a zero corporate tax, the 2nd year ten percent, the third year up to 20 percent like everybody else.\n\nSo we provide a great incentive for taking that money from overseas and taking that money back here and investing it so they can use it profitably here in America.\n\nFinally, it is very pro-family. We take the tax code which has over time has reduced the amount of support that the code provided for children and ramped it right back up to a very strong level. We have a 20% flat rate, but instead of the standard deduction we have a per-person tax credit. So every person in the family gets a $2750 tax credit so a family of four would have an $11,000 tax credit.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you what that means, that means the first $11,000 you owe in taxes you don\u2019t have to pay. So if you are a $50,000 wage earner, your tax is 20 percent which is $10,000, but your tax credit is $11,000. So you would get the $10,000 that you paid in your withholding back and you get a $1000 check from the government. It is a refundable tax credit.\n\nSo that is number one, so we treat, unlike the previous tax code, we treat adults the same as children. Children get the same $2750 tax credit as adults do. In addition, we have the child credit. So we keep the child credit and the per person credit. So it is a very, very strong pro-family approach.\n\nThe other two things we have done, the other two provisions we keep\u2026 we explode the code, the current tax code and all one million words of it which is actually more than the Bible, and we replace it with these two credits and two deductions. One deduction is on charitable, unlike before where two-thirds of Americans couldn\u2019t deduct their charitable contributions now everyone can.\n\nSo it allows for deductibility of all charitable contributions and second it allows for deductibility of home interest so that\u2019s\u2026\n\nVander Hart: Is there any cap on that? I\u2019ve seen some other plans\u2026\n\nSantorum: A $25,000 cap so I\u2019ll give you an idea. If you went out and bought an $800,000 home you would be fine. If you bought something over $800,000 you are going to be limited to only $25,000 in interest so just giving you an idea of what that would be.\n\nVander Hart: Does your plan touch payroll taxes at all?\n\nSantorum: We don\u2019t touch payroll taxes, we get rid of Alternative Minimum Tax, we get rid of, again, all of the special provisions in the income tax code. We get rid of deductibility of state and local taxes. Because we think that is\u2026 I think that is a subsidy for the high tax states.\n\nVander Hart: Right\u2026\n\nSantorum: \u2026on low tax states. With the corporate tax we get rid of every special tax provision. I know a lot of folks here in Iowa say, \u201coh the oil industry gets the oil depletion allowance.\u201d No more. No depreciation schedules, no amortization schedules, everything is expensed. So whether you are a corn grower or an ethanol producer or an oil producer you expense everything you spend producing that inventory. So it is a very powerful tool for production and it treats all industries the same.\n\nVander Hart: Ok, 20 percent, how did you get to that number?\n\nSantorum: We came to that number looking at the fact that America, historically, has spent, historically since World War, has spent between 18 and 22 percent of GDP on government. The sweet spot that most Republicans focus on is that 18 percent because that is the lowest level we have been at during the post-war time. In thinking about how am I going to get to 18 percent of the GDP because most people think that is what is going to constrain government well if you have the tax below 18 percent you are not going to get to 18 percent if you have any deductions or any credits or anything like that. If we have 19 percent well, again, if we are going to make sure that lower income families are not going to be paying more taxes than they pay now. It is the combination of finding the low-enough rate to make sure we weren\u2019t going to increase taxes on folks today who are not paying, who are not paying federal taxes or are not paying much in federal taxes. So it was a combination of looking at what we needed to fund the government and, at the same time, not increase taxes on poorer folks.\n\nVander Hart: There is a certain campaign, that should go nameless, but I\u2019ll actually name it \u2013 the Huckabee campaign they are pushing the Fair Tax. Why not the Fair Tax?\n\nSantorum: If I were starting all over in 1916 and say before the income tax was around and say we needed a tax system that was the most efficient way to collect revenue and didn\u2019t incentivize spending and incentivized earnings and investment then a sales tax, a national sales tax, a value-added tax, Fair Tax, whatever you want to call it \u2013 all of those things would be on the table. The problem is we have an income tax and we have a 16th Amendment that allows for an income tax. If we get rid of the income tax and replace it with a sales tax the income tax is still there to come back. I have absolutely no doubt, zero doubt, that if we do a sales tax the argument is going to be made at some point, \u201cwell the rich are not paying there fair share\u201d because the sales tax is on everybody.\n\nVander Hart: You don\u2019t have faith in Congress that they will do the right thing and not bring it back?\n\nSantorum: I have faith that the next Democratic administration will say we only need an income tax on the wealthiest to make sure that it is being treated fairly. That they are paying their fair share. Which is exactly how the income tax was sold back in the 19-teens \u2013 that it was only going to be on the wealthiest Americans, well we now know how that turned out.\n\nSo what I think would happen with the Fair Tax \u2013 we would have a Fair Tax and an income tax, and I know a lot of the Fair Tax people say, \u201cWell, we are going to repeal the 16th Amendment.\n\nVander Hart: Easier said than done?\n\nSantorum: Repealing the income tax is going to be a very, very difficult thing to do. There are a lot of states that simply will not go along with it, and the process would be a long one. I am looking for a tax plan that approximates the idea of the Fair Tax, and that is a flat tax \u2013 a flat tax with very limited deductions is in a sense almost the same thing as a Fair Tax sales tax except it taxes all income including the wealthy.\n\nIf you go with a sales tax, the wealthy do not use as much of their money on spending, they invest it.\n\nVander Hart: Right.\n\nSantorum: So they are going to spend a lot, lot less under a sales tax than they would under the income tax. So this is in a sense a fair tax, but taxing higher-income people more than what a sales tax would.\n\nVander Hart: This campaign you\u2019ve focused on working-class Americans, blue collar conservatives, you\u2019ve put forth, you look at a minimum wage increase that\u2019s not necessarily a popular idea with people I have talked with\u2026 Why not leave that to the states?\n\nSantorum: Well this is what I would say\u2026 one of the things that I have learned in the process of working in Washington is if you want to get big ideas passed you are going to have to work together to get those passed. You are going to have to find some people on the other side of the aisle that will join you in getting your big ideas done, whether it is welfare reform where we got a whole bunch of Democrats to join us, whether it is on some of our national security measures where I got a whole bunch of Democrats to join us. These are things that conservatives now say are some of the greatest victories we have ever had, but they had things in there that conservatives if they knew were in there would say \u201cwhy would you support that?\u201d Well, that was necessarily in order to get the things that you really like, and you know what that word is called?\n\nVander Hart: Compromise\n\nSantorum: Compromise, and here is what I learned \u2013 there are good compromises and bad compromises. Good compromises is getting less of a good thing. Bad compromises is negotiating away less of a bad thing. It\u2019s still a bad thing, you don\u2019t do it, but if you can get a good thing done by doing some things that maybe make it less good, but still good you do it.\n\nSo part of the whole idea of going out and talking about a pro-worker, pro-manufacturing plan is you have to look at things that will help bring people who agree with that idea and there are many Democrats who are from manufacturing states who would love to support something that would increase wages, create opportunities for people to make things here in America \u2013 Senators from Ohio and Michigan and Indiana and places like that. You need to look at things like the minimum wage, and you say well \u201cthat\u2019s not a conservative principle,\u201d well neither is tax credits for businesses.\n\nVander Hart: Right\n\nSantorum: But we do that, and I don\u2019t know too many Republicans who have a problem with that. We have an R&D tax credit and every Republican I know, \u201coh we support the R&D tax credit!\u201d Wait a minute? That isn\u2019t conservative economics.\n\n\u201cBut it helps businesses, it helps growth!\u201d Oh it\u2019s ok for the federal government to get involved to help a business, but it\u2019s not ok for them to provide some minimum standard for workers, and that\u2019s the tone deaf. That\u2019s why, and again, Republicans don\u2019t even understand this. It doesn\u2019t penetrate. That is why they think you care more about business than you care about workers because when it comes to anything that provides some sort of help and assistance for workers \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s bad for the economy, it\u2019s going to hurt this, it\u2019s going to hurt that.\u201d If it is for a business \u2013 \u201coh it\u2019s good for the economy because it is going to help business.\u201d We\u2019ve seen bailouts, we have seen Republicans involved in a whole bunch of things, a lot of them, bailouts certainly, I was not involved in.\n\nBut then they do something like increase the minimum wage by 15% then suddenly we become Adam Smith we say, \u201cWell no, the invisible hand we shouldn\u2019t be involved in any of this.\u201d If you do that it just proves the point to folks who are working Americans that you care more about these folks than you do about me.\n\nWhat I\u2019m proposing is not like a minimum wage like what Obama is proposing. I would absolutely vote against something like that I\u2019d never sign something like that, but less than one percent of Americans make the minimum wage.\n\nVander Hart: Right\n\nSantorum: So in a sense we really don\u2019t have a minimum wage here in America.\n\nVander Hart: So for our readers who may not be aware of what your minimum wage plan is.\n\nSantorum: It is 50 cents an hour per year for three years.\n\nVander Hart: Ok\n\nSantorum: So it is taking the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.75 a hour over a three year period of time.\n\nVander Hart: So states can obviously do more if they want.\n\nSantorum: States have done more, that is one of the reasons that no one is making the minimum wage anymore. Most states have already raised the minimum wage. So the idea to have a federal minimum wage that is truly a minimum wage if less than one percent of workers are making minimum wage, it is not a minimum wage anymore. I mean it\u2019s hitting the floor, and so historically the federal minimum wage has ranged between 5 and 9 percent of all wage earners. My increase would put it to about 4 to 5 percent so it would still be below the historical average, but it is something to put in your plan, to put in a vision that says we understand that the workers need to have protections just like businesses need to have opportunities. So that\u2019s number one.\n\nHere is another controversy \u2013 the Export-Import Bank. I am a supporter of the Export-Import Bank, and the reason I am is because I believe the role of the federal government is create a level playing field for our businesses to be able to compete with other businesses around the world, particularly when it comes to manufacturing which is a globally competitive marketplace. Ok, 62 other countries have export financing. The United States is one of the smallest, is the smallest of the major exporters, yet it is absolutely critical for some of our major projects to get that export financing.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen since the ExIm bank has been shut down that we\u2019ve lost thousands of jobs already. Here is the interesting thing, those jobs went overseas. They were actually moved. The company that was bidding on those projects for workers here in America are still getting the bid, but they are using workers from other countries. So the idea that this is corporate welfare, well if it were corporate welfare GE would be hurt, but GE isn\u2019t hurt. Who is hurt are the workers in South Carolina who lost their jobs, the workers in Texas who lost their jobs.\n\nThat is what people don\u2019t understand, if you don\u2019t have the same tools in the shed, particularly since Dodd-Frank banks aren\u2019t lending because of the liability that Dodd-Frank imposes on them. Banks aren\u2019t lending for this type of financing for export products. So it is going to hurt American workers, and according to, I guess it depends on who you believe I guess, some say it costs a little money, most of the folks who look at this say the Export-Import Bank actually makes money. So it is not adding to the deficit. It is providing a necessary tool, and again it is consistent with the message. I want to make America the number one manufacturer in the world. I want to make sure we have jobs here in this country that employe people, and if you put things like that in a package that says we are going to be the number one manufacturer all of a sudden you have got folks on the other side of the aisle that says, \u201cYou know what? He\u2019s trying to actually reach out and pull people together to get something done to move this country forward.\n\nVander Hart: Have you seen any movement among those who may not be friends to a Republican or respond to your message?\n\nSantorum: Obviously I just introduced this a couple of days ago.\n\nLaughter\n\nVander Hart: Well you have been talking about Blue Collar Conservatives\u2026\n\nSantorum: I can tell you this that when I go on shows like MSNBC, I constantly get \u201clook you are for the American worker.\u201d They concede it. \u201cLook, I understand you are not like the other guys you actually care about American workers.\u201d You start to get that concession then you start to open up opportunities. So that answer is, look I wrote a book called Blue Collar Conservatives, I had a very famous Democratic politician, who will go nameless because it wouldn\u2019t help me if you knew who he was, call me after the book came out said he read an article that said \u201cthis is the smartest thing a Republican has written in 35 years.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cif you do this, if you run your campaign on this,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is exactly what America needs.\u201d\n\nVander Hart: I know several people who are members of unions who hold 2nd Amendment rights, they are prolife, but consistently\u2026\n\nSantorum: Vote against Republicans\n\nVander Hart: \u2026vote against Republicans.\n\nSantorum: I was doing this book tour last year and I was in New York, and I was in the waiting room at Fox waiting to do the Hannity Show, and a guy was sitting there and said, \u201chey saw your book and heard you talking on the radio earlier today. I really love what you are doing.\u201d He said his best friend is a Crane operator in New York and he is in a union right. I\u2019m talking about cranes, the big high-rise cranes\u2026\n\nVander Hart: Yeah, yeah\u2026\n\nSantorum: Not a job I\u2019d want, let me put it that way. Do you know how much he makes in a year? I don\u2019t know\u2026 $150,000, New York \u2013 $200,000. $350,000 a year.\n\nVander Hart: Wow.\n\nSantorum: I said \u201ca crane operator?\u201d He said, \u201cyeah with overtime and everything.\u201d\n\nVander Hart: I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s enough for me to get on a crane.\n\nSantorum: He said, \u201cHe makes $350,000 and you know what? He\u2019ll never vote Republican.\u201d I said, \u201cwhy?\u201d He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t care about guys like him.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cReally?\u201d He said, \u201cYep he would say you want to take his job away.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cwell, ok.\u201d I said, \u201c Well, show him this book.\u201d He said, \u201cNo that is why I want to show him this book. It would be great if we have Republicans who were for working men and women.\u201d\n\nVander Hart: Right, shifting gears a little bit, still looking at economics obviously tax policy is part of the package, but what are you going to do to rein in government spending?\n\nSantorum: First we are going to get rid of Obamacare.\n\nVander Hart: Ok\n\nSantorum: That is the number one entitlement that goes away. Number two we need to apply the principles I have talked about with welfare reform to all other entitlement programs \u2013 food stamps, housing programs, Medicaid and the like. There needs to be an idea that government assistance programs are there for two reasons: number one to support you when you fall. Look, we all have problems, whether it is divorce, whether it is a child unexpected out of wedlock, whether it is an accident. There are all sorts of reasons people may end up needing some sort of government help. I think most Americans are very, very open to that and want to be kind and I think, hopefully, most Republicans feel that way too that there needs to be a safety net. That\u2019s a good thing in America, that is not a bad thing. Republicans don\u2019t see safety nets as a bad thing.\n\nVander Hart: Right.\n\nSantorum: The second purpose is to help transition you back to earned success. Arthur Brooks wrote a book about the key to happiness in America. The key to happiness in our human psyche is earned success \u2013 the idea you can provide for yourself and your family and have satisfaction of accomplishment that leads to true happiness in that. Not having success that is earned whether you are a trust fund kid or whether you are someone who has grown up on welfare that doesn\u2019t give you the satisfaction that leads to true happiness.\n\nWhether you have lots of money that you didn\u2019t make or you have very little money where someone basically helps you to survive. Neither leads to happiness, and it is actually accomplishing something, working hard, doing what is necessary to be successful that leads to that happiness. That has to be the focus of these entitlement programs, and that is why I believe you can put work requirements and time limits on all of these entitlement programs. Obviously if you have a disability and can\u2019t work that is a different story, but once you get past that we have to have these programs not be places that insulate people from what the real key to happiness is.\n\nI don\u2019t look at it like this is a punishment, it is a privilege to be able to work. To be able to work and do \u2013 use your hands, use your head to do something \u2013 to have the opportunity to take whatever experience you have and turn that into a better job all of that is what America is all about. It is the opportunity to climb that ladder to earn success and to pursue your dreams. We are not helping people by not putting them on that path. So that is number one with those programs as we saw with welfare if you can take say food stamps \u2013 block grant it and cap the money.\n\nWhat we did with welfare, it was it was an all-time high. We took the welfare money, block granted it to the states. We cut it by 10 percent because it was already high. Food stamps should be at the same situation where we can cut them by at least 10 percent, block grant it to the states, make them have a work requirement and a time limit on the program and let them deal with it.\n\nWhat happened with welfare reform? The rolls were cut by 50 percent in three years. Poverty level went down. Employment among the most hard to employ went up. All of those things work and we have to believe in those things as Republicans and point to the success that previous programs have done. That\u2019s one.\n\nThe other big knots as you know are Medicare and Social Security.\n\nVander Hart: Right\n\nSantorum: You have probably heard me talk about this many, many times.\n\nVander Hart: I have yes.\n\nSantorum: We need to move to a defined amount of money we are going to spend on Medicare, as opposed to the current system which is indefinite. I always ask people, how much money are we going to spend on Medicare? People look at me like\u2026\n\nVander Hart: They have no idea.\n\nSantorum: They have no idea. You know what? Nobody else does either. They can guess, but they don\u2019t know. Why? Because it is an uncapped entitlement program. In other words whatever the medical bills are that seniors purchase that is how much Medicare costs. That is no way to run a healthcare system it is just an unlimited amount of however much people spend.\n\nVander Hart: So in a perfect world, if you could do whatever you wanted\u2026\n\nSantorum: We\u2019d take the amount of money we spend on Medicare and divide it up per person and give them a subsidy. Say, \u201cHere is the amount of money we are going to give you, go out and we\u2019ll have the insurance market offer a variety of different insurance products to you. You pick the product that serves you best, and you know what? If it is a really expensive product then you are going to have to pay more for it. If it is a less expensive product you may even save money, you may take some money home, you may not use it all on that.\u201d It says to seniors we are going to put the power in your hands, we are going to give you choices and plans that you want, and we are going to have a private market where competition will drive down costs and increase efficiency.\n\nSo that is called a premium support model which is something that I have supported for a dozen or more years.\n\nVander Hart: What would the transition to that look like?\n\nSantorum: I would say to seniors, particularly seniors who are older seniors we would say you don\u2019t have to move into that system, you could stay with the system you have right now. I don\u2019t know of anybody under 70-years-of-age who hasn\u2019t had to deal with making health care choices and health insurance decisions. I mean we all have. You do. Everybody does now. Twenty years ago that wasn\u2019t the case, but today, particularly under Obamacare everybody has to make these healthcare decisions.\n\nI remember when we talked about this premium support model the Democrats would say, \u201cpeople can\u2019t make these decisions on their own government knows best to make these decision. They can\u2019t make these decisions.\u201d Well now we see that they can and they will. That\u2019s not to say too many elderly seniors because not all seniors are elderly in my mind. You are on social security at 62, you are not elderly.\n\nMy mom is going to be 97 this month, she\u2019s elderly, and I\u2019m not going to tell her she has to change her Medicare policy right?\n\nVander Hart: Right.\n\nSantorum: For younger seniors we are going to transition them over to that new system, and of course, everyone coming in after that.\n\nSocial Security is another issue I could go over all the details with you too\u2026\n\nVander Hart: Yes basically you are talking about raising the eligibility age.\n\nSantorum: The eligibility age will go up with life expectancy. The life expectancy of Americans goes up about a month every two years. So raise the eligibility age consistent with life expectancy so every future generation of seniors will have the same amount of time on Social Security as the previous generation. That is what makes it fair. If you don\u2019t do it that way then future generations are on longer we don\u2019t see more money which means younger generations are going to have to pay more for when they get there. They are going to be on longer then receive more money. Then every generation is going to have to pay more for when they get there. Every generation is going to end up paying more and more and more that\u2019s just not a sustainable system.\n\nVander Hart: One last question along the lines of economic policy. I rarely hear anybody talk about monetary policy, but the Fed is really screwing things up. What do you think we can do to fix this?\n\nSantorum: Here is the problem with monetary policy and the Fed is really screwing things up is that most people don\u2019t see it because.. I was going to say because something hasn\u2019t hit the fan.\n\nVander Hart: (Laughter)\n\nSantorum: The water hasn\u2019t hit the dam. Ok? We don\u2019t really know how this policy is going to work as it unwinds. I think what we\u2019ve seen is that Fed policy has been to the great benefit of asset holders, stock purchasers\u2026 Markets are up and everything from the stock market to the real estate market because we\u2019ve had this robust quantitative easing burst and now the low interest rate policies of the Fed, but savers have not done well. Folks who are just ordinary consumers, if you will, you see food prices and other prices higher than they really need to be because the Fed is fixated on making sure we have a stable rate of inflation, and we have these extraordinary low interest rates.\n\nVander Hart: What about the state of our dollar, it\u2019s\u2026\n\nSantorum: Well again if you look at the dollar today, the dollar is actually relatively strong and it is not because of anything the Fed has done. It is how bad everything else is\u2026 It is the land of the blind and the blindman is king. All of that, to my point, can come crumbling \u2013 the dollar, inflation, and a whole host of other things. When economic growth reaches a point where you start to put pressure on wages, pressure on prices, all of a sudden then interest rates come up, the cost of borrowing of the federal government comes up which means it will explode. All of a sudden you have an economic crisis simply because the economy is growing the way it should grow. So in a sense what the Fed has done is artificially clamped down the economy, and here is the problem\u2026 I went to a.. well now he is a former Fed governor\u2026 a couple of years ago who is sort of a noted contrarian. You probably know who I am talking about. I asked him, \u201cLook, I just need to talk to you, how do you guys unwind this? I mean you wound this thing pretty tight, how are you going to unwind?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nVander Hart: Oh gosh.\n\nSantorum: \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, there are lots of theories, but it has never been done before, and so we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nWhich is one of the reasons he was so much against winding it this tight and as high as it went. So the answer is they can say, \u201cwell, we\u2019ve been greatly successful and haven\u2019t had nearly the recession and really this\u2026 ,\u201d but we haven\u2019t paid the price yet and we don\u2019t know when that price is going to be paid, and so it is sort of a scary thought to think about what robust growth would mean to this country when it comes to our monetary policy.\n\nVander Hart: Thank you so much.\n\nSantorum: You bet.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/10/interview-rick-santorum-discusses-his-new-tax-plan/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Rick-Santorum-interview-smokey-row-1024x617.png", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2015-10-20T05:00:20+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-25T11:32:47+00:00", "keywords": "entitlement reform, iowa caucus, monetary policy, rick santorum, shane vander hart, spending cuts, tax policy, election central", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum in an exclusive interview with Caffeinated Thoughts discusses his new tax plan and his focus on the American worker.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum in an exclusive interview with Caffeinated Thoughts discusses his new tax plan and his focus on the American worker.", "title": "Interview: Rick Santorum Discusses His New Tax Plan | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Rick-Santorum-interview-smokey-row-1024x617.png", "updated_time": "2015-10-19T21:20:25-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/10/interview-rick-santorum-discusses-his-new-tax-plan/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum in an exclusive interview with Caffeinated Thoughts discusses his new tax plan and his focus on the American worker.", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Rick-Santorum-interview-smokey-row.png", "title": "Interview: Rick Santorum Discusses His New Tax Plan | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2015-10-20T00:00:20-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "Election Central", "modified_time": "2015-10-19T21:20:25-05:00", "tag": "Tax Policy"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef2a\"", "article_summary": "So the idea to have a federal minimum wage that is truly a minimum wage if less than one percent of workers are making minimum wage, it is not a minimum wage anymore.\nSantorum: We don\u2019t touch payroll taxes, we get rid of Alternative Minimum Tax, we get rid of, again, all of the special provisions in the income tax code.\nSantorum: States have done more, that is one of the reasons that no one is making the minimum wage anymore.\nI am looking for a tax plan that approximates the idea of the Fair Tax, and that is a flat tax \u2013 a flat tax with very limited deductions is in a sense almost the same thing as a Fair Tax sales tax except it taxes all income including the wealthy.\nIf we get rid of the income tax and replace it with a sales tax the income tax is still there to come back."}
