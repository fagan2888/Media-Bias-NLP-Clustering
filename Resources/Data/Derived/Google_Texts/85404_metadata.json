Nearly a quarter of all snack foods consumed last year were consumed at mealtime.\n\n\u201cSmaller household sizes and eating alone are among the growing factors with snacking,\u201d NPD food and beverage industry analyst Darren Seifer said in a statement. \u201cFood manufacturers should think about the unique needs of the solo consumer when developing products and packaging, and marketing messages should be crafted to be relevant to them and their snacking behaviors.\u201d\n\nRelated: The 12 Hottest Food Trends for 2015\n\nA separate report released by Nielsen last year found that more than half of global diners had selected snacks in the past 30 days to replace a lunch, 48 percent had snacked for breakfast and 41 percent had snacked for dinner.\n\nWhen making their selection, single diners prefer single-serve packages and are increasingly turning to \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d snacks, like fresh fruit, breakfast bars, and yogurt, NPD found.\n\nFood manufacturers are starting to adapt to the demand for healthier options. In June, General Mills said it would stop using artificial colors and flavors by 2016, and Kellogg Co. has vowed to do so by 2018.\n\nEven as demand grows for healthier snacks, the most popular snacks in North Americans might make a nutritionist cringe. Nielsen found that the most popular snacks were chips, followed by chocolate and cheese.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Americans are increasingly dining alone, and they\u2019re opting for snacks rather than full meals, according to a new report from NPD group.
