Washington, D.C.

Greg Anthony has been suspended indefinitely by CBS following his arrest on solicitation charges.



A CBS spokeswoman says "Greg Anthony will not be working again for CBS this season." Turner Sports also suspended the TV commentator and says it "will have no further comment."



District of Columbia police say the CBS basketball analyst and former NBA player has been arrested and charged with soliciting a prostitute.



Lt. Kelvin Cusick tells The Associated Press that Anthony was arrested at 5:46 p.m. on Friday. He said Saturday that Anthony faces a misdemeanor solicitation charge that's punishable by up to 180 days in jail.



Cusick says the 47-year-old Anthony was released Friday evening.



Anthony had been scheduled to announce the Michigan State-Maryland men's basketball game Saturday in nearby College Park, Maryland.



In the NBA, Anthony played 11 seasons with six teams from 1991-92 to 2001-02, including the New York Knicks and Portland Trail Blazers. The guard and defensive specialist averaged 7.3 points per game.



In college he was on the UNLV team that won the 1990 NCAA tournament, with teammates Larry Johnson and Stacey Augmon.
