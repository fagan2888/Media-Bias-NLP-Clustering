We'll talk with reporter Kristen Schorsch about why there are so many extra beds and what hospitals can do about the problem.\n\nRead an interview with Schorsch.\n\nWhat did you find that most surprised you?\n\nWhat I thought was interesting were these clusters of hospitals I found that were half empty and located within a handful of miles of each other. In Chicago, I found three different clusters: one each on the south side, the west side, and the north side, in which the hospitals are roughly half empty, some a little more or less than half, that are all sitting within two to five miles or so, all independently owned. And I thought that was pretty startling, when you look at all the various reasons for what\u2019s happened to these hospitals and the drastic transformation in health care, especially with the Affordable Care Act. There\u2019s a huge push toward outpatient care and keeping people healthy, so they\u2019re not getting sick and ending up with an expensive hospital stay. So I thought those clusters are interesting \u2013 is there anyone talking about merging hospitals or sharing services? For example, one hospital can specialize in ICU or difficult surgical procedures, one can be an outpatient center. And that\u2019s happened in other states.\n\n-- Graphic courtesy of Crain's\n\nWhy are there so many empty hospital beds?\n\nThere\u2019s a host of reasons. Among the biggest one is that for decades there has been a decline in patients using hospitals across country. Particularly in the last few years with the ACA and the big push to keep people healthy with preventative care, to keep health care costs down and to prevent costly inpatient stays. Both government insurers and private insurers want to incentivize doctors and hospitals to keep people healthy, to coordinate their care of chronic things like diabetes. In the past, providers paid per service and there was no penalty for racking up the bill. Now, payers really want to pay to keep people healthy.\n\nThere are also advances in technology. You no longer need to go to a hospital for every surgery and stay for five days. There are outpatient surgical centers where you can go home the next day, or even the same day.\n\nAnother reason is that, in Chicago specifically, hundreds of thousands of people have left the city. It\u2019s gutted minority neighborhoods near hospitals, which are typically among the largest employers in a neighborhood. They\u2019ve lost patients when people moved.\n\nAlso, patients have more choice now. You see things like retail clinics at Walgreens and CVS popping up, where you can go to get a flu shot. You can go to immediate care if you\u2019re sick, you no longer have to go to the ER if you need treatment right away. This has all led to a drastic transformation in how people are seeking care. Hospitals need to find a new identity. They may no longer be a hospital in the traditional sense; they might be transforming into something that\u2019s adapted to today\u2019s environment where people have more choices and doctors are getting paid to keep you out of the hospital.\n\nHow do these hospitals stay afloat with so many empty beds?\n\nIt\u2019s really tough, especially in small independent hospitals that treat a large portion of low-income and uninsured patients. A lot of hospitals are becoming focused on outpatient care across the board. Whether it\u2019s a huge hospital system or a small struggling system, they know that patients have more choice and that insurance payers want you to keep patients out of the hospital. To survive, you must change your focus to outpatient care by hiring more physicians, putting pharmacies in hospitals so patients can pick up prescriptions there, renting out space to bring in a primary care clinic network \u2013 becoming a one-stop shop focused on outpatient care because that\u2019s where the industry is headed. But it\u2019s really expensive to retrofit hospitals to follow the trend of outpatient care. I\u2019ve been talking to a lot of hospital consultants, and \u201crepurposing\u201d is the main theme I kept hearing, but it\u2019s hard, especially for smaller, independent hospitals that depend on Medicaid or Medicare for money. They can\u2019t spend millions retrofitting. Big hospitals do have money to repurpose space.\n\nWhat is the state\u2019s role in solving this problem?\n\nThe facilities board decides which health care projects can go forward in the state, but their hands are pretty much tied. They have a lot of oversight power if you bring them a new project. If you want to add or cut beds or add a new wing, you have to ask them for permission. But after that, they don\u2019t have the manpower or legal authority to say to a hospital, \u201cyou\u2019re not using this service enough so close this wing or cut this service, transfer it to a hospital in a neighborhood that needs it more.\u201d\n\nThe state legislature passed a law to establish a comprehensive health planner, in Illinois. That person would have been charged with figuring out where exactly we need health care services across the state, but that person was never hired. The law went into effect in 2009, but we've never had a health care planner. There was also a task force the Quinn administration put together that had applied to the federal government asking permission to use Medicaid dollars differently. It wanted to provide hospitals and nursing homes with a $25 million pot of money to close or convert their facilities, and help transform the industry. But now, we have a new governor and it's unclear if the federal government is going to negotiate with the new administration for a waiver. That could be a solution to provide money to help hospitals close or convert. It happened in New York, where they saved struggling hospitals from closing, and others they forced to close for various reasons.\n\nWhat are hospitals trying to do?\n\nThey're trying to bring in traditional outpatient care amenities to hospitals, like having a pharmacy and adding primary care doctors. Most people think of primary care doctors as being out in the community, but now hospitals are partnering with doctors or giving them space in hospitals so you might actually go to the hospital to see your primary care doctor. Some of the hospital CEOs I talked to didn't want to give specifics on what they plan to do to change, but the broad idea about hospitals going forward is that they'll be more like wellness centers where you can go to work out, get a healthy lunch, take classes to learn how to manage chronic conditions. They'll be more of a wellness hub rather than a place you go just when you get sick or need emergency care. They'll be focused more on the needs of patients going forward.\n\nWhat are the problems associated with closing hospitals?\n\nOne of the obstacles is that they are typically one of the largest employers in their neighborhood. They're part of the fabric of the communities where people live. It's also not just hundreds of jobs at stake, but people also have the perception that they won\u2019t have access to care if a hospital closes. It can be an emotional and political battle, there's civic pride involved. There are lots of reasons why it\u2019s tough to change.\n\nWhy should people care about this?\n\nPeople talk a lot about all the waste in the health care system. If you operated a business, would you let half of it sit empty and unused? Wouldn't you, maybe, lease out some space or transform your business so that you use more of space you have? Health care is really, really expensive, and a lot of the hospitals that are the emptiest are also heavily dependent on taxpayer-funded programs, so there's a lot of money at stake. Also, everyone's talking about making health care more efficient and less expensive by keeping people healthy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chicago Tonight | WTTW", "description": "A new report from Crain's Chicago Business found in 2013 nearly four out of every 10 hospital beds in Illinois were vacant.
