The site appropriately titled \u201cNot Alone\u201d was founded only a year ago to form a support system for women, and it has since taken the Internet by storm along with its tagline: \u201cNot afraid. Not ashamed. Not alone.\u201d\n\nThe controversial tensions on abortion are hard to ignore, especially when state jurisdictions create hurdles for women trying to schedule an abortion by either arguing health care coverage or shutting down abortion clinics. Women then turn down unsafe roads, resulting in 68,000 deaths of women worldwide from unsafe abortions. There have been thousands of stories slowly and in some cases reluctantly told of women traveling to questionable doctors placed in dangerous situations.\n\n\"We are here to let women who have had abortions know that they are part of a community,\" the website reads. \"We are not ashamed of our experiences; we are not anonymous; and we are not alone.\"\n\nOnce the pinnacle Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruled for the legalization of abortion in 1973, women were unilaterally given rights back to their bodies, though lingering stigma and shame still lingers from decades ago. \"When we learn that those who terminate \u2014 one in three women in this country \u2014 are our mothers, sisters, grandmothers, partners, daughters and friends, this issue gets a human face,\" Website co-founder Beth Matusoff Merfish told The Huffington Post.\n\nIt\u2019s incredible to think how far civil rights movements have gone, yet just yesterday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry defended a law he signed that would close the majority of abortion facilities and leave only seven left in the state of Texas, the second-most populous state in the country. Perry, also a potential 2016 presidential candidate said the law will make his state safer, according to the NY Daily News.\n\nIn order to compete with the lime light of a presidential hopeful, such as the likes of Perry, women have been called by the website to share their story and give one another hope. Once women have full right to their bodies and the decisions they make despite legislative pushback, only then will there be fundamental progress for women equality. Currently, there are 99 females out of the 535 members in Congress and 20 females out of the 100 Senate members, making the entire female representation roughly 19 percent. That\u2019s a small percentage of women with a voice in politics. Until the numbers shift, \u201cNot Alone\u201d will stand in to provide the female-to-female support system that\u2019s so desperately in demand.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "abortion, website, not, alone, provides, platform, many, faces, abortion, family, and, friends", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "This abortion website will provide an interwoven support system of YouTube videos for women to share their personal stories.", "title": "Women On Abortion Website 'Not Alone' Testify Their Experiences [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/abortion-website-not-alone-provides-platform-many-faces-abortion-family-and-friends-alike-304394", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/22/abortion-videos-help-support-women-their-experience.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This abortion website will provide an interwoven support system of YouTube videos for women to share their personal stories.", "title": "Women On Abortion Website 'Not Alone' Testify Their Experiences [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/abortion-website-not-alone-provides-platform-many-faces-abortion-family-and-friends-alike-304394", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/22/abortion-videos-help-support-women-their-experience.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/22/abortion-videos-help-support-women-their-experience.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-09-22T17:12:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-22T17:12:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This abortion website will provide an interwoven support system of YouTube videos for women to share their personal stories."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd71e\"", "article_summary": "Until the numbers shift, \u201cNot Alone\u201d will stand in to provide the female-to-female support system that\u2019s so desperately in demand.\nA website has provided an unprecedented platform for women to share their abortion story experiences through video submissions in order to show other women they\u2019re not alone.\nWomen then turn down unsafe roads, resulting in 68,000 deaths of women worldwide from unsafe abortions.\n\"We are here to let women who have had abortions know that they are part of a community,\" the website reads.\nThere have been thousands of stories slowly and in some cases reluctantly told of women traveling to questionable doctors placed in dangerous situations."}
