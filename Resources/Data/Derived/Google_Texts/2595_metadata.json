He is at the doctor, but this is no ordinary vet visit. He\u2019s being fitted with a heart monitoring device in the UC Davis Veterinary School\u2019s cardiology room.\n\n\u201cLucky\u2019s owner isn\u2019t sure if there\u2019s something wrong or not. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s a diagnostic test for a heart problem,\u201d said.\n\nDr. Jane Sykes is a professor of small animal internal medicine at UC Davis.\n\n\u201cCurrently we have a caseload of 45,000 cases a year. We have the highest case load of any veterinary teaching hospital in the country,\u201d said Sykes.\n\nSykes says even with those numbers, most pet owners don\u2019t carry pet health insurance. Only one percent of pet owners in the US use it \u2014 far fewer than other countries around the world.\n\n\u201cAbout 40 percent of people in the UK have pet health insurance, and it\u2019s been a puzzle to me why that hasn\u2019t happened in this country to the same extent,\u201d said Sykes.\n\nConsumer Reports in the US found pet insurance monthly premiums range from less than $10 to more than $90. Its analysis found that pet insurance only makes sense for owners of chronically ill animals.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s my main family member,\u201d said dog owner Aaron Portolos.\n\nPortolos is in the UC Davis waiting room while his dog, Kuma, undergoes a $700 surgery.\n\nMy intentions were to go ahead with this procedure almost a year ago. And we\u2019re just now getting around to it because of financial reasons,\u201d he said.\n\nPet insurance might have helped Portolos with his dog\u2019s surgery earlier, eliminating the concern about the costs.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know much about insurance for pets,\u201d said Portolos.\n\nSykes says she sees the difference between pet owners who aren\u2019t covered by insurance and those who are.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re way less stressed about their bill and they\u2019re way less stressed about the diagnostic tests they\u2019re going to pick and choose from,\u201d she said.\n\nWith pet insurance, owners can find the best way to cover medical costs, so all the Luckys out there can live long, healthy lives.\n\nSykes says it\u2019s important to remember you can\u2019t get pet insurance to pay for bills after your pet is sick, because coverage won\u2019t cover a pre-existing condition.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Americans begin enrolling in health insurance to comply with the Affordable Care Act, what about those four-legged family members?", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2013/12/22/pet-medical-insurance-becoming-more-attractive-as-more-pets-getting-procedures-done/", "image": {"width": 640, "secure_url": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/9661278_vk1.jpg?w=640", "identifier": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/9661278_vk1.jpg?w=640", "height": 360}, "type": "article", "description": "As Americans begin enrolling in health insurance to comply with the Affordable Care Act, what about those four-legged family members?", "title": "Pet Medical Insurance Becoming More Attractive To Pet Owners As They Opt For Procedures"}, "twitter": {"site": "/social/", "image": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/9661278_vk1.jpg?w=640", "description": "As Americans begin enrolling in health insurance to comply with the Affordable Care Act, what about those four-legged family members?", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pet Medical Insurance Becoming More Attractive To Pet Owners As They Opt For Procedures"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Sacramento", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Sacramento", "article": {"publisher": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/social/", "author": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/social/"}, "keywords": "healthwatch, local, news, seen on, syndicated local, dogs, health, insurance, pets, uc davis veterinary school", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e592dab1a834e9f02fdb648f19487a6?s=16", "news_keywords": "dogs, health, insurance, pets, uc davis veterinary school"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9534\"", "article_summary": "Sykes says even with those numbers, most pet owners don\u2019t carry pet health insurance.\n\u201cThey\u2019re way less stressed about their bill and they\u2019re way less stressed about the diagnostic tests they\u2019re going to pick and choose from,\u201d she said.\nWith pet insurance, owners can find the best way to cover medical costs, so all the Luckys out there can live long, healthy lives.\nSACRAMENTO (CBS13) \u2013 As Americans begin enrolling in health insurance to comply with the Affordable Care Act, what about those four-legged family members?\nConsumer Reports in the US found pet insurance monthly premiums range from less than $10 to more than $90."}
