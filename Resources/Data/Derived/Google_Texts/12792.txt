Running Water, SD

A Nebraska woman died after falling into the Missouri River near Running Water, South Dakota Saturday. Two other people are hurt after trying to rescue her.

Twenty-three-year-old Veronica Jo Keeble of Niobrara, Nebraska fell into the water while she and four others were down near the river by Standing Bear Memorial Bridge. At least two people then jumped into the river in an attempt to save her.

Keeble died at the scene. Two others were flown to a Sioux Falls hospital, one of them with serious injuries.

Authorities believe alcohol was a factor, but have ruled the situation an accident.

Several departments assisted in the rescue, including the Bon Homme County Sheriff's Office, the Knox County Sheriff's Office, the Santee Sioux Tribe Police, Yankton Search and Rescue, South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks, and Springfield police and emergency crews.
