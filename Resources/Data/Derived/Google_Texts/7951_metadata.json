Monitoring sites reported that the density of the tiny, poisonous PM2.5 particles had reached more than 40 times the safe level set by the World Health Organization.\n\nLocal media reports of Wang's performance art went viral this week with the headline that his efforts had gathered enough dust to make a normal-size brick.\n\nWang said that his 400 hours of air-sucking had netted 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of dust, which has been added to a mixture to make a brick at a factory in the northern city of Tangshan.\n\nThe 100 grams were more than he expected when he first embarked on the project on July 24 with the $1,100 vacuum cleaner.\n\nWang said that after three days, the machine collected little dust. \"I checked again after 100 days, and the dirt was far more obvious. It was black and dirty, and it crumbled upon touch,\" he said.\n\nOnce the brick is made, it will be used in construction along with other bricks. \"It should just disappear like a drop of water going into the sea,\" Wang said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Artist sucks up Beijing air to draw attention to air quality - AP News: BEIJING (AP) \u2014 For four hours every day, for 100 .05/27/2016 3:05:09AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 For four hours every day, for 100 days, Chinese artist Wang Renzheng", "title": "AP News - Artist sucks up Beijing air to draw attention to air quality", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/12/01/artist-sucks-up-beijing-air-to-draw-attention-to-air-quality-n2087369", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\335\\41a82ef7-7015-4a20-a1f0-0bd3e25eabd2.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 For four hours every day, for 100 days, Chinese artist Wang Renzheng", "title": "AP News - Artist sucks up Beijing air to draw attention to air quality", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/12/01/artist-sucks-up-beijing-air-to-draw-attention-to-air-quality-n2087369", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/335/41a82ef7-7015-4a20-a1f0-0bd3e25eabd2.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Artist sucks up Beijing air to draw attention to air quality, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The 34-year-old artist hopes the performance art \u2014 dubbed the Dust Project \u2014 can sharpen the public's sense of China's air quality.\nAlthough the public has come to realize the severity of China's air pollution, Wang said he feels the change has been painfully slow.\n\"I checked again after 100 days, and the dirt was far more obvious.\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 For four hours every day, for 100 days, Chinese artist Wang Renzheng held up the attachment of an industrial vacuum cleaner to suck in Beijing's notoriously polluted air at various landmarks.\n\"Have you ever thought how much dust there is in the air, as Chinese cities are growing at high speeds?\""}
