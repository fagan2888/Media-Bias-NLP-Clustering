Take some growth stocks, put them in with some value stocks, and what do you get? A core mutual fund. Some growth mutual funds own a few value stocks and some value funds own some growth stocks. But some funds own too much of each type to be classified as growth or value in Morningstar’s eyes. So core makes a home for those funds.

There are times when the stock market favors each style over the others. Value mutual funds hold stocks that in aggregate have below-average price-earnings and price-to-book values.

Value investors see such stocks as having less risk and great potential for price appreciation. Their prices are already depressed, and so most of the hot money is out of them already. They could rise as investors discover the stocks’ potential.

Growth investors seek companies with above-average earnings and sales growth, and potential continued growth. The ability to grab market share or expand new markets is a hallmark of these stocks. They often have higher than average P-E and price-book values as growth investors tend to be willing to pay up for companies able to achieve rapid growth.
