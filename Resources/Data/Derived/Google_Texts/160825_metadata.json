Although it was discovered in the Zika forest in Uganda in 1947 and is common in Africa and Asia, it did not begin spreading widely in the Western Hemisphere until May 2015, when an outbreak occurred in Brazil.\n\nUntil now, almost no one on this side of the world had been infected. Few people here have immune defenses against the virus, so it is spreading rapidly. Millions of people in tropical regions of the Americas may now have been infected.\n\nYet for most, the infection causes no symptoms and leads to no lasting harm. Scientific concern is focused on women who become infected while pregnant and those who develop a temporary form of paralysis after exposure to the Zika virus.\n\nZika is spread by mosquitoes of the Aedes genus, which can breed in a pool of water as small as a bottle cap and usually bite during the day. The aggressive yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, has spread most Zika cases, but that mosquito is common in the United States only in Florida, along the Gulf Coast, and in Hawaii \u2014 although it has been found as far north as Washington, D.C., in hot weather.\n\nThe Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is also known to transmit the virus, but it is not clear how efficiently. That mosquito ranges as far north as New York and Chicago in summer.\n\nExperts believe that the vast majority of all Zika infections are transmitted by mosquitoes, not sex. There are still many unknowns.\n\nThe possibility that the Zika virus causes microcephaly \u2014 unusually small heads and often damaged brains \u2014 emerged only in October, when doctors in northern Brazil noticed a surge in babies with the condition.\n\nIt may be that other factors, such as simultaneous infection with other viruses, are contributing to the rise; investigators may even find that Zika virus is not the main cause, although right now circumstantial evidence suggests that it is.\n\nIt is not known how common microcephaly has become in Brazil\u2019s outbreak. About 3 million babies are born in Brazil each year. Normally, about 150 cases of microcephaly are reported, and Brazil says it is investigating nearly 4,000 cases. Yet reported cases usually increase when people are alerted to a potential health crisis.\n\nUntil recently, Zika was not considered a major threat because its symptoms are relatively mild. Only 1 of 5 people infected with the virus develop symptoms, which can include fever, rash, joint pain and red eyes. Those infected usually do not have to be hospitalized.\n\nThere is no widely available test for Zika infection. Because it is closely related to dengue and yellow fever, it may cross-react with antibody tests for those viruses. To detect Zika, a blood or tissue sample from the first week in the infection must be sent to an advanced laboratory so the virus can be detected through sophisticated molecular testing.\n\nWith rare exceptions, the virus does not appear to linger in the body, and people who recover from the infection are immune.\n\n\u2014 Donald G.
