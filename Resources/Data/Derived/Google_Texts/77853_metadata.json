But under the Affordable Care Act, it became a mandate. Doctors will be penalized if they don\u2019t go electronic.\n\nIt\u2019s a big expense, so the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services offered incentives to doctors to help cover the cost.\n\nSo Brescia complied right away. In 2012, he hired a software company make the switch. But the company, ISuite, went bankrupt. Brescia lost four years of his records that he\u2019s still trying to recover.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a computer specialist, I\u2019m just a family doctor trying to survive out here, and give my patients excellent care,\u201d he says.\n\nHe has a new software company handling his electronic records. But he was audited for 2011, and because he doesn\u2019t have the missing records, CMS says he must pay them $18,000.\n\nBrescia says he had to pay double for the electronic switch, with the first and second company. And to pay this fee back is a hardship.\n\n\u201cI think did everything right,\u201d he says. \u201cI followed the rules. Why am I being punished, because I\u2019m a solo practice?\u201d\n\nBrescia says he believes the mandates of the Affordable Care Act will eliminate smaller practices in the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dinosaurs, we\u2019re not going to be here in 10 years,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have nurse practitioners and PAs taking care of the public. And I just think I did everything fair, and I\u2019m not getting a fair shake.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and medicaid Services refers doctors to their regional office in PA for guidance. PA REACH helps doctors make the switch to electronic records. They work with 6,000 doctors in the state with small to medium practices, and they say they will review Brescia\u2019s case.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Francis Brescia, Jr. has been seeing patients at his small practice in Dauphin for 34 years. \"Family doctors, we're a certain breed,\" he says. \"We like people.\" But high costs are closing practices like his across the country, and now he's facing his own from the government.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "WPMT FOX43", "description": "Dr. Francis Brescia, Jr. has been seeing patients at his small practice in Dauphin for 34 years. \u201cFamily doctors, we\u2019re a certain breed,\u201d he says. \u201cWe like people.\u201d Bu\u2026", "title": "Dauphin family practice struggling under ACA mandates", "url": "http://fox43.com/2014/06/25/dauphin-family-practice-struggling-under-aca-mandates/", "image": "http://tribwpmt.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/doctorbrescia.png?w=300", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://tribwpmt.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/doctorbrescia.png?w=240", "site": "@fox43", "card": "summary", "creator": "@fox43"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News in Harrisburg, York, Lancaster, Lebanon News, Weather, Sports", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=593652814", "fb": {"pages": 121742908330}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "WPMT FOX43", "google-site-verification": "ilkJ6nB6LBJwfhBgyPxbKMW1j6YSMqGS-P6sRpLIxD4", "keywords": "news,", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox43news", "published_time": "2014-06-25T21:30:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-26T13:53:55+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox43news"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox43.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/c21a62ded72703161d0a8a5845d07db8?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf94f\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Francis Brescia, Jr. has been seeing patients at his small practice in Dauphin for 34 years.\nPA REACH helps doctors make the switch to electronic records.\nBrescia says he had to pay double for the electronic switch, with the first and second company.\nHe has a new software company handling his electronic records.\nCongress pushed doctors to switch to electronic health records for years."}
