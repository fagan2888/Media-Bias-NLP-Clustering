Richard Blumenthal\u2019s \u201crefund quest.\u201d Sen. Blumenthal, D-Conn., has demanded that UPS Inc., the United States Postal Service and FedEx issue refunds to customers who ordered Christmas gifts that weren\u2019t delivered in time for the intended presentation.\n\nI asserted that Sen. Blumenthal was, once again, pathetically wasting his time and energy on a desperate attempt to quench his out-of-control thirst for publicity.\n\nWith that in mind, Sen. Blumenthal must be a happy guy today. His quest is getting a lot of attention, having been covered by Fox News, CBS New York, The Associated Press, NBC News and CNN.\n\nThe senator may have accomplished his personal mission, but he is not doing anything for the people who elected him to vouch for their interests in Washington, D.C.\n\nThree years after he took office, Sen. Blumenthal has no meaningful accomplishments under his belt and he has continued the camera-chasing he was notorious for during his 20-year tenure \u2013 1991 to 2011 \u2013 as Connecticut\u2019s attorney general. Sen. Blumenthal\u2019s narcissistic tendencies are embarrassing to the state and will hinder his ability to effectively represent his constituents.\n\nIn the minds of the American people at large, Sen. Blumenthal probably is best known for repeatedly lying about his Vietnam-era military service. With each silly publicity stunt, he brings further unwelcome attention to himself and Connecticut. His Senate tenure to date can best be described as disgraceful, and the people of Connecticut deserve better.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Sen.
