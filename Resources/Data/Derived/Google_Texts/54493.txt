On “Real Time with Bill Maher” last night, the provocative host weighed in on this week’s tragic shootings at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, suggesting that right-wing media contributed to shaping the twisted beliefs espoused by killer Dylann Roof.

“We can never know why someone snaps, but I bet you I know where he got his news,” said Maher to panelist Matt Lewis, a “Daily Caller” contributor. “I looked at your website last week, it was a lot of stories about black people. Same with Matt Drudge. I think they present a really twisted view. I’m not surprised this guy thought they’re ‘taking over the country.’ Obviously, he has a warped mind, that’s going into it, but I don’t think it was video games. And I do think the media is responsible to a degree. I wouldn’t say we should be droning Fox News, but we did drone Anwar al-Awlaki because he inspired people. He didn’t do terrorist acts, he just inspired them.”
