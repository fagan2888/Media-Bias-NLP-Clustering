This year, he will also be extolling the cementing of his presidential legacy.\n\nIn the past 10 days, through the intervention of America\u2019s top judges combined with public revulsion towards the murderous actions of a white supremacist, Obama has seen the national mood shift sharply in his direction. His signature healthcare reform, Obamacare, has been secured at least for now; gay marriage has been elevated into a constitutional right; and the Confederate flag has been torn down across the deep south.\n\nWith the winds of change behind him, a newly confident president has been visible. In contrast to the muted, cautious politician who hunkered down in the Oval Office through much of the past six years, to the dismay of many of his liberal supporters, a full-throated progressive firebrand has reemerged, reminiscent of the Barack Obama of 2008 who wowed the country during his first presidential campaign.\n\nThat new-found fire in the belly was evident when the White House was bathed in rainbow colors on the night of the supreme court ruling on gay marriage \u2013 a symbolic gesture approved by Obama less than four years after he publicly opposed same-sex marriages.\n\nLast Friday, it was again on display at the funeral of Reverend Clementa Pinckney, one of nine victims of the Charleston church shooting. Delivering the eulogy, Obama both metaphorically and literally found his voice \u2013 he memorably sang Amazing Grace to a dazzled crowd of largely black mourners.\n\nBut after an extraordinary week, one so rarely enjoyed by presidents of either political colour, what will Obama do with this unexpected boost to his political capital?\n\nAs Professor Bruce Buchanan, a specialist in presidential politics at the University of Texas at Austin, put it: \u201cI think the president has won back some credibility from the vindication of his policy stances and moral authority from his powerful statement following the Charleston killings.\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen if he can use either as leverage to press his remaining policy ambitions.\u201d\n\nObama made a rod for his own back in his Charleston eulogy, when he lamented the normal pattern of things where terrible events such as the mass shooting at the Emanuel AME church are followed by talk but no action.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need more talk,\u201d he said. \u201cTo settle for symbolic gestures without following up with the hard work of more lasting change \u2013 that\u2019s how we lose our way again.\u201d\n\nSo what kind of lasting change could Obama go for in his final 19 months in office? In Charleston he provided some clues to his ambitions, if not his policy directions.\n\nHe referred to the need to introduce new gun safety measures to address the \u201cunique mayhem that gun violence inflicts on this nation\u201d. He also name-checked reform of the criminal justice system to remove its inbuilt bias towards locking up young black men; the need for revised training to rebuild trust between the police and the communities they serve; the existence of discrimination in the workplace that meant \u201cJohnny got called back for a job interview but not Jamal\u201d; and the threat to voting rights for African American citizens from a raft of Republican-led state legislative attacks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People gather in Lafayette Park to see the White House illuminated in commemoration of the supreme court\u2019s ruling to legalize same-sex marriage.

America\u2019s historically, and globally high, rate of incarceration \u2013 with more than 2 million people behind bars \u2013 has begun to attract a level of bipartisan consensus almost unseen in any other policy area.\n\nIn January, the Koch brothers, the libertarian billionaires who have spearheaded the Republican drive to the right over the past two decades, announced that they were joining forces with progressive groups in a collective effort to combat what they called the \u201covercriminalization of America\u201d. The Obama administration, through the Department of Justice, has pushed through a number of sentencing reforms that have driven down the imposition of long mandatory prison terms for drug offenders \u2013 a trend that the new US attorney general Loretta Lynch has promised to continue.\n\nRandall Kennedy, a professor at Harvard law school who is an authority on racial conflict and civil rights, observed that Obama continued to dwell on the tragedy of gun deaths in the United States.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that the thing that got him most emotionally engaged in the past week has been gun violence,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do, but I think that this is one area he\u2019s driven to work on even though it seems pretty clear that Congress won\u2019t do anything major with it.\u201d\n\nObama has in the past expended so much political capital with so little result that he has looked like a president who had recognised he was on the losing side of the argument, and bowed out. Following the tragedy at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012, in which 20 children and six adults were shot dead, he attempted to push through new gun controls including universal FBI background checks on all firearms purchases. He was roundly defeated by a fierce campaign from the National Rifle Association.\n\nOn Sunday, Obama put out a new email to his supporters through his personal political listserv compiled during his two presidential campaigns, now called Organizing for Action. In the message, he exhorted his followers to stand against gun violence.\n\nThough he specified no practical moves that could be made by the White House, he did suggest that progress was possible at local level.\n\n\u201cAs we take the time to heal in the shadow of this most recent tragedy, we have to ask ourselves what more we can do as individuals and communities to prevent guns from getting into the hands of dangerous individuals,\u201d the message said.\n\n\u201cThe lack of movement in Congress on this issue is incredibly frustrating. But their refusal to act won\u2019t stop progress. No single reform will eliminate violence. But we can\u2019t give up, or act like this is some kind of new normal. We have to make progress where we can.\u201d\n\nSorry, your browser is unable to play this video.

In June 2013, the US supreme court stripped out a key element of the Voting Rights Act that had prevented politicians, largely in the south, from meddling with voting procedures without federal permission. The change, in Shelby County v Holder, means that the 2016 presidential election will be the first in 50 years to be held without full federal protections for African American, poor and elderly voters, vulnerable to attacks on their access to the polls.\n\nWendy Weiser, head of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said there were several critical ways in which the Obama administration could shore up fairness in voting. Obama could bypass Republican intransigence in Congress, she said, by using his executive powers to instigate a federal drive to register new voters \u2013 between a quarter and a third of all Americans of voting age are still detached from the democratic process.\n\nWeiser said Obama could also put his executive muscle behind two federal bills currently before Congress that would restore the hole punched into the Voting Rights Act by the Shelby ruling. And he could also immediately pass an executive order to inject greater accountability into political finance by ordering all government contractors to disclose their campaign donations.\n\n\u201cWe are entering the first presidential election in half a century without the protections of the Voting Rights Act at a time when the country still faces critical problems of racial discrimination,\u201d Weiser said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic that this administration, as it looks towards its legacy, will move decisively to make a difference and shore up American democracy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "After Obamacare survived and same-sex marriage was enshrined in law, White House observers sense a new determination to set the president\u2019s legacy in stone", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Ed Pilkington", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "After Obamacare survived and same-sex marriage was enshrined in law, White House observers sense a new determination to set the president\u2019s legacy in stone", "title": "Obama triumphant?
