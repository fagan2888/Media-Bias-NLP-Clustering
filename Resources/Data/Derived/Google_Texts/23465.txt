Dallas-based Epic Health Services said it is buying the parent company and pediatric division of Loving Care Agency of New Jersey, creating one of the largest skilled pediatric home health companies in the country.

Monetary terms of the deal, which should close in February, were not released.

Epic provides care to 6,000 patients and LCA’s pediatric division serves more than 1,500 patients in seven states, according to Epic spokesperson Amanda Gleason. The combined companies create a pediatric healthcare presence in 10 states, including Texas, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Missouri, Indiana, Delaware, Arizona, Illinois and Colorado, according to a statement.

“We are excited to announce this entrance into four new states as part of our long-term service expansion initiative,” said Epic Executive Chairman John Garbarino.

Epic acquired Nurses To Go in December.

After the deal closes, the current LCA adult division will be spun off into a new operating entity separate from Epic Health Services.

LCA President and CEO Glen Cavallo said LCA’s integration into Epic “takes our mission to the next level with the resources and services necessary to better serve our patients and their families.”

Epic Health Services, a portfolio company of Webster Capital, was founded in 2001, providing pediatric skilled nursing and therapy services, as well as adult home health services.
