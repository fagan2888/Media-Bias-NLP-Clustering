Donald Trump is lashing out on Twitter, again, and this time he’s set his target on Ted Cruz’s wife, Heidi. Not exactly a new low.

“Be careful, Lyin’ Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!” Trump tweeted twice Tuesday night, as the Republican frontrunner waited for elections result from Arizona and Utah. Trump was apparently upset by an image of his wife, Melania, in an anti-Trump attack. The suggestive picture of Trump’s former model wife, from a shoot for British GQ in 2000, was used by an anti-Trump group hoping to gin up Mormon voters with appeals to their morality in an effort to ramp up the anti-Trump vote:

“Lyin’ Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad,” Trump tweeted late Monday, incorrectly accusing his Republican presidential opponent of being the source of the attack:
