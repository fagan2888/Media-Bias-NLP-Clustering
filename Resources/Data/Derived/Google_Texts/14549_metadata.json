That statistic is why dozens of college students in Sioux Falls went door-to-door Saturday, making sure homeowners living around their campuses remain safe.\n\nFirefighters put four brand new smoke alarms in Helen Korcal\u2019s home. It's been 18 years since she's had her smoke alarm replaced.\n\n\u201cI was worried about how old our smoke detectors were, and so this is a great deal,\" Korcal said.\n\nKorcal also got her blood pressure checked. Something she wasn't expecting, but she sees as important.\n\nAugustana University student Erika Farr woke up bright and early to help make sure homeowners like Korcal had working smoke alarms and blood pressure checks.\n\n\"Without us they probably wouldn't be able to change it them themselves, and they didn't realize how often you needed to change them,\" Farr said.\n\nAlong with Farr, hundreds of students, firefighters and American Red Cross officials canvassed about 1,500 homes near the central Sioux Falls campuses.\n\n\"Augustana University and the University of Sioux Falls have come together in a very positive competitive rivalry, to really go out and not only effect the people in those universities but to also affect their neighbors,\" Tony Burke, American Red Cross Executive Director, said.\n\nFire-officials said it's part of their 4th annual Growing Resilient Program. This year they targeted older homes extended from 16th to 41st street between Spring Avenue and West Avenue.\n\nVolunteers knocked door-to-door here on Lake Street. Fire officials say some of the homes' smoke alarm systems were outdated.\n\nThe groups spent about 15 minutes in each home. Most of all, making sure people who live there are fire prepared and healthy.\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
