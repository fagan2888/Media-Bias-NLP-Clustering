But at Tuesday\u2019s Republican debate, Cruz displayed what must have been sincere confusion when he attacked Marco Rubio\u2019s past support for \u201camnesty\u201d by citing Ronald Reagan\u2019s decisiveness.\n\n\u201cYou know, there was a time for choosing as Reagan put it,\u201d Cruz self-assuredly intoned. \u201cWhere there was a battle over amnesty and some chose, like Senator Rubio, to stand with Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer and support a massive amnesty plan.\u201d\n\nIs it possible that Cruz, the son of a Cuban refugee, is not aware that in 1986, Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which ultimately legalized the status of 2.7 million people? That wasn\u2019t the only odd statement on immigration, which along with terrorism, and immigrant would-be terrorists, dominated much of the debate.\n\nDefending his plan to \u201cenforce the law\u201d against immigrants, Cruz cited Bill Clinton\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cDo you know how many aliens Bill Clinton deported?\u201d he asked. \u201c12 million. Do you know how many illegal aliens, George W. Bush deported? 10 million.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Bill Clinton forcefully deported, or removed, just about 681,000 immigrants. Another 9.7 million in the fiscal years covering his presidency were subject to \u201cvoluntary returns,\u201d meaning by and large that they were turned back at the border. Cruz\u2019s misleading statement, however, is a reminder of a greater truth that both Republicans and Hillary Clinton are doing their best to obscure: Both parties, in recent decades, have often had a pretty horrible record on immigrant rights.\n\nIn 1996, President Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), which, among other things, allowed for the automatic removal of many undocumented immigrants without judicial review, mandated further increases in the size of the Border Patrol, and authorized the use of local police to enforce immigration law.\n\n\u201cThe simple fact is that we must not and we will not surrender our borders to those who wish to exploit our history of compassion and justice,\u201d Clinton proclaimed in 1993\u2014at the very moment he was preparing to open the border wide to business under NAFTA.\n\nThe militarization of the border under Clinton\u2014including major Border Patrol deployments to the El Paso and San Diego areas in Operations Hold the Line and Gatekeeper\u2014wreaked havoc in binational communities from Texas to California and caused a huge number of migrants forced to cross through dangerous desert climes to die.\n\nDeaths along the Southwest Border rose from 263 in 1998 to 380 in 2000, 454 in 2006 and 471 in 2012, according to Border Patrol. Their number of agents grew from 4,139 agents in fiscal year 1992 to 9,212 in 2000 and 21,444 in 2011.\n\nIt \u201ccreated,\u201d as Asian Americans Advancing Justice \u2013 Asian Law Caucus attorney Anoop Prasad emailed, \u201cthe enormous immigration detention system that we have today and expanded deportation grounds for Lawful Permanent Residents with criminal convictions.\u201d\n\nDemocratic support for border militarization, says University of California, San Diego sociologist David FitzGerald, was a \u201cresponse to prop 187 in California,\u201d a measure that would have denied public services, including education, to undocumented immigrants if it hadn\u2019t been blocked by the judiciary. Clinton was worried \u201cthat the unauthorized immigrant issue was just getting out of control and would come back and reflect poorly on the Democrats.\u201d\n\nIt was Reagan\u2019s IRCA, however, that first laid the foundations for future border militarization and mass deportation. The measure increased the size of the Border Patrol by 50 percent. It also created sanctions for employers who knowingly hired unauthorized workers. Rather than dissuading employers from hiring the undocumented, the measure, according to the Migration Policy Institute, gave bosses leverage to use their employees\u2019 legal status against them.\n\nReagan\u2019s successors from both major parties doubled down.\n\nOn immigration, George W. Bush was an ally of the Republican business class. He favored legalizing the status of big business\u2019 undocumented workers and creating a guest worker program to provide them with a flow of second-class noncitizen labor. And he dramatically stepped up deportations to placate immigration critics on the right.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz meant to credit Bill Clinton for being tough on immigration.
