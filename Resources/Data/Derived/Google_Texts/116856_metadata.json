(WTAP)-It's a budget package both political parties, and the president, agree on.\n\nBut that doesn't mean everyone agrees with the spending package Congress approved Friday.\n\nThe \"omnibus\" budget bill is a spending package totalling more than a trillion dollars, with 680 billion dollars in tax cuts during the next ten years.\n\nIt passed the Senate overwhelmingly, but the vote in the House was closer.\n\nOhio Congressman Bill Johnson says the package isn't perfect, but has what he called conservative victories.\n\n\" It increases military spending in this time of increased terror threats, and it reforms the visa waiver program to put more security into who is being allowed in our country.\"\n\nThey include no new funding for the EPA and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut West Virginia's David McKinley was concerned funding benefiting coal miners wasn't included.\n\n\"There had been some hope, a promise, a 'we'll work with you' concept. I don't know that many of our families have time to wait two or three years for things to come into play.\"\n\nOhio Senator Rob Portman also voted against the bill, saying it included too much spending in a time of high defecits and record debt.\n\nThe loudest criticism came from West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, who also stated the bill should have included protection for miners benefits.\n\nManchin said it also included what he called Christmas presents for wealthy people, without addressing long-term spending and debt problems.\n\nManchin's West Virginia colleague, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, who voted for the bill, stated it included significant funding to enhance national security, combat the drug epidemic and expand access to affordable broadband.\n\nPresident Obama, who is expected to sign the legislation, says the budget invests in the U.S. military and the middle class.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some members of Congress agree, and some disagree, with what's in a more than $1 trillion spending bill approved Friday.", "language": "english", "author": "Todd Baucher, The Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewscenter.tv/content/news/Omnibus-spending-bill-approved-some-in-Congress-disagree-with-it-362980711.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/600*619/Congress+Generic1.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Some members of Congress agree, and some disagree, with what's in a more than $1 trillion spending bill approved Friday.", "title": "\"Omnibus\" spending bill approved; some in Congress disagree with it"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some members of Congress agree, and some disagree, with what's in a more than $1 trillion spending bill approved Friday.", "creator": "@wtaptelevision", "url": "http://www.thenewscenter.tv/content/news/Omnibus-spending-bill-approved-some-in-Congress-disagree-with-it-362980711.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/600*619/Congress+Generic1.JPG", "site": "@wtaptelevision", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100962244529, "pages": 119556181388677}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "_4QzOO_S07K6sq7hO9J8cbaTcM7nnuPGgOU7su9OdmQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Omnibus spending bill approved some, in Congress disagree with it"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd341d\"", "article_summary": "But that doesn't mean everyone agrees with the spending package Congress approved Friday.\nThe \"omnibus\" budget bill is a spending package totalling more than a trillion dollars, with 680 billion dollars in tax cuts during the next ten years.\nWASHINGTON, D.C.
