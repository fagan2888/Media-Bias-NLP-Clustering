Last year, the company launched a new genomics business, the Inova Center for Personalized Health , and hiring for the new endeavor added to the system's fast-growing operating expenses.The added employment for the Center for Personalized Health and hiring to meet patient demand contributed to the system's 13.6% increase in salaries and benefits in 2015 compared with the prior year, the system said to bond investors in a comment that accompanied Inova's 2015 financial results. Overall expenses increased 10.9% to $2.75 billion for the year.Growth in operating costs outpaced the increase in revenue, which grew 10.1% to $2.97 billion for the year. After accounting for bad debt, or unpaid medical bills, the system's revenue from patients was up 11%. Inova reported a sharp drop in bad debt of 23%, which officials attributed to new accounting for low-income patients who qualify for financial aid.Virginia did not expand eligibility for Medicaid, one of the primary avenues under the Affordable Care Act to increase insurance coverage.
