REUTERS/Larry Downing (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS) - RTR2DGAY\n\n4123585\n\nOne of President Barack Obama\u2019s favorite new Obamacare sign-up pitches is that young enrollees, which the law banks on for sustainability, can get health insurance for the price of a monthly cellphone bill. But in reality, premiums are more than a little pricier.\n\n\u201cHealthCare.gov works great now,\u201d Obama told Zack Galifianakis Tuesday in a Funny or Die \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d video. \u201cAnd millions of Americans have already gotten health insurance plans, and what we want is for people to know that you can get affordable health care \u2014 and most young Americans right now, they\u2019re not covered.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the truth is that they can get coverage all for what it costs you to pay your cell phone bill,\u201d Obama said.\n\nAs competition heats up in the wireless war between the nation\u2019s biggest carriers, prices and options for cellphone plans are spread across a wide range, depending on phone type, data limits, upgrade terms, etc. For comparison\u2019s sake, we\u2019ll define an average middle-of-the-road plan as consisting of a smartphone, two-year upgrade, unlimited calls, unlimited texts and an average of two gigs of downloadable Internet data per month.\n\nDiscounting taxes nationwide, that plan costs about $90 on Verizon, $80 on AT&T, $70 on Sprint, and $60 on T-Mobile every month. Both Sprint and T-Mobile offer the same plans with unlimited monthly data for $80. All pricing is relevant as of January 2014.\n\nVerizon Wireless and AT&T, with 96.2 and 72.6 million respective wireless subscribers, make up the vast majority of cellphone users in the U.S.\n\nOf the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cbronze,\u201d \u201csilver\u201d and \u201cgold\u201d coverage plans offered on the Washington, D.C. health insurance exchange marketplace, the cheapest middle-of-the-road equivalent silver plan is $181.01 per month, after subsidies, for the lowest age bracket, which covers 27-year-olds and under that make about $25,000 annually. Silver plans must cover 70 percent of all medical costs, according to the law.\n\nFor the same age group in Pennsylvania, which is one of the 10 cheapest states in which to purchase health insurance on the federal exchange run in 36 states, a silver plan with the same coverage still costs $145 per month. A similar plan under Covered California, the largest state-run exchange with the highest number of enrollees, costs an average of $175. California had the highest number of uninsured Americans nationwide prior to the implementation of the law last October.\n\nAltogether, that makes the average monthly cost of health care for young people under the Affordable Care Act a little more than twice as expensive as the average cellphone bill.\n\nThe only instance in which the president\u2019s math is slightly more correct is in terms of the lowest tier bronze plan, which covers 60 percent of all annual health care expenses included in the plan. The cheapest bronze plan on the D.C. health insurance exchange has a $124.05 monthly premium \u2014 still almost 70 percent more expensive than the average wireless service bill.\n\nFollow Giuseppe on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Giuseppe Macri", "description": "One of President Obama's favorite new Obamacare sign-up pitches is that young enrollees, which the law literally banks on for sustainability, can get health", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "One of President Barack Obama's favorite new Obamacare sign-up pitches is that young enrollees, which the law banks on for sustainability, can get health insurance for the price of a monthly cellphone", "title": "Obamacare is definitely NOT as cheap as your cellphone bill", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/12/obamacare-is-definitely-not-as-cheap-as-your-cellphone-bill/", "image": {"width": 639, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RTR2DGAY_opt-e1394653727846.jpg", "height": 274}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No, Obamacare is not cheaper than a cellphone bill", "title": "Obamacare is definitely NOT as cheap as your cellphone bill Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/12/obamacare-is-definitely-not-as-cheap-as-your-cellphone-bill/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RTR2DGAY_opt-e1394653727846.jpg"}, "creator": "@@gdmacri", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-12 22:07:19", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare is definitely NOT as cheap as your cellphone bill", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,giuseppe-macri", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare", "sailthru.description": "One of President Barack Obama's favorite new Obamacare sign-up pitches is that young enrollees, which the law banks on for sustainability, can get health insurance for the price of a monthly cellphone", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RTR2DGAY_opt-e1394653727846.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd079a\"", "article_summary": "Altogether, that makes the average monthly cost of health care for young people under the Affordable Care Act a little more than twice as expensive as the average cellphone bill.\nDiscounting taxes nationwide, that plan costs about $90 on Verizon, $80 on AT&T, $70 on Sprint, and $60 on T-Mobile every month.\nREUTERS/Larry Downing (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS) - RTR2DGAY4123585One of President Barack Obama\u2019s favorite new Obamacare sign-up pitches is that young enrollees, which the law banks on for sustainability, can get health insurance for the price of a monthly cellphone bill.\nThe cheapest bronze plan on the D.C. health insurance exchange has a $124.05 monthly premium \u2014 still almost 70 percent more expensive than the average wireless service bill.\nSilver plans must cover 70 percent of all medical costs, according to the law."}
