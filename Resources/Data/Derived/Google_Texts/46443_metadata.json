A near superhuman activity,\u201d Jim Gates, a professor of physics at the University of Maryland, told The New York Times.\n\nYet for all of Beckham\u2019s acrobatics, the most telling thing that happened in the NFL in Week 12 was not the league\u2019s high-flying circus, but the return to the running game. It was not limited only to the 167 yards ground out by C.J. Anderson in the Broncos\u2019 critical 39-36, come-from-behind victory against the Miami Dolphins.\n\nThe Ravens\u2019 Justin Forsett ran for 182 yards and two touchdowns in Baltimore\u2019s win over New Orleans on Monday night. Green Bay\u2019s Eddie Lacy had 25 carries for 125 yards against the Vikings on Sunday.\n\nA balancing act, not a high-wire act, is the key to winning football late in the season in the NFL when the wind howls and the air chills. The Broncos, with Peyton Manning directing traffic and throwing passes, had 35 runs and 35 passes Sunday. The Packers, with Aaron Rodgers under center, ran the ball 32 times and passed 30 times.\n\nNew England coach Bill Belichick \u2014 Mr. Grinch in a hoodie \u2014 knows the value of the running game. Even though the Patriots called 53 pass attempts for Tom Brady in a 34-9 win over the Lions, Belichick knows he needs to throw some body shots, too. That\u2019s why he signed 250-pound LeGarrette Blount after Blount was cut by Pittsburgh last week. Blount pounded out 78 yards on just 12 carries.\n\nBeing something of an old-school football fan (or is it just old?), I enjoy watching a mix of running and passing. That\u2019s what made the 1997-98 Broncos so fun to watch. With John Elway passing and Terrell Davis running, Denver had a two-fisted attack. In Super Bowl XXXII, Davis pounded the Packers for 157 yards on 30 carries en route to winning MVP. Elway was just 12-for-22 passing for 123 yards and an interception, but the Broncos won 31-24.\n\nIn Super Bowl XXXIII, Dan Reeves\u2019 Atlanta Falcons were intent on stuffing Davis. They did \u2014 sort of, kind of \u2014 \u201climiting\u201d Davis to 102 yards. That game gave T.D. his seventh consecutive postseason game of 100 yards rushing.\n\nReeves essentially dared Elway to beat him. And Elway did. At age 38, Elway became the oldest player ever to be named Super Bowl MVP. In the final game of his career, he completed 18-of-29 passes for 336 yards with one touchdown and one interception.\n\nBalance, as Mr. Miyagi told Daniel-san in \u201cThe Karate Kid,\u201d is the key.\n\nChew on this\n\n\u2022 76 losses for Sixers? Another historic chapter of futility could be written in Philly this season. The 76ers lost 114-104 to the Blazers on Monday night to drop to 0-14 on the young season. Philadelphia\u2019s worst start in franchise history was 0-15, set during the 1972-73 season when they also finished with the worst, 82-game record in league history at 9-73.\n\nFYI: The Sixers have have held a fourth-quarter lead this season for a grand total of five minutes over their 14 games.\n\n\u2022 Happy birthday. On this day in 1914, \u201cJoltin\u201d Joe DiMaggio, The Yankee Clipper, was born in Martinez, Calif. We all know him for his 56-game hitting streak \u2014 a record that I don\u2019t think will ever be broken.\n\nWant a great stat? Consider this: DiMaggio struck out only 369 times across his entire career, which included 6,821 times at bat. Only 5.4 percent of his at-bats resulted in a strikeout, one strikeout for every 18.5 times at bat.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\n\n\nVisit denverpost.com each weekday near noontime for a serving of dish concerning Colorado\u2019s sporting landscape from a Denver Post sports writer.
