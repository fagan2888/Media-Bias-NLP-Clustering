Lately, however, it\u2019s actually gotten worse.\n\nStates that refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act are now paying the price, literally,\u201d TPM reported yesterday. \u201cA new Kaiser Family Foundation report released last week suggests that the Republican-controlled non-expansion states are seeing their share of Medicaid costs rise more sharply than expansion states.\u201d\n\nIn other words, we\u2019re looking at Republican-run states paying more for less, on purpose, spiting themselves to satisfy partisan goals that only they care about.\n\nEven Alabama is rethinking its obstinacy on the issue. The Alabama Media Group reported yesterday on Gov. Robert Bentley (R) possibly \u201cnudging closer\u201d to accepting Medicaid expansion through the ACA (thanks to my colleague Laura Conaway for the heads-up).\n\nListen to what the governor said Tuesday when asked the question. \u201cYou know I wouldn\u2019t say nudging toward it,\u201d said Bentley. \u201cBut we are certainly looking at that; not right now. We are not at that stage right now.\u201d But then the governor added this when asked about remarks he had just made to a group of seniors about the need to improve healthcare in rural areas and how Medicaid expansion might come into play: \u201cBut you know we do have to realistically look at whether we have adequate funding for rural doctors, primary care doctors. They cannot treat a third of their patients and stay in business. It is a business they run,\u201d said the governor.\n\nWell, yes, that\u2019s kind of the point. Alabama is facing a serious budget problem, and at the same time, rural medical facilities in the state are facing financial pressures that could close their doors. Medicaid expansion could go a long way in helping address both problems, all while extending coverage to thousands of low-income families.\n\nThe question, then, is whether Alabama wants to deal with its real-world challenges or prefers to hate \u201cObamacare\u201d on principle.\n\nThe state\u2019s Republican governor added yesterday, \u201cYou know for the last few years we\u2019ve been dealing with the Affordable Care Act. I was personally against the Affordable Care Act. I never called it Obamacare because it\u2019s not a person, it was a philosophy. But we lost folks. We lost. And we lost in court. So what we have to do now is move past that, take the resources we have available and try to improve the quality of life for the people of Alabama and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an explicit endorsement of accepting Medicaid expansion, but to my ear, it was close.\n\nAs for the bigger picture, 30 states have already adopted the Medicaid policy through the Affordable Care Act, though that list is likely to continue to grow. South Dakota is moving forward with a policy that would make it the 31st state on the list, and if John Bel Edwards wins his gubernatorial race this year, he intends to make Louisiana #32.\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed before, conservatives should prepare for more defeats soon. There will no doubt be some holdouts and dead-enders, but the arithmetic and common sense can only be denied for so long.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "We're looking at Republican-run states paying more for Medicare, on purpose, spiting themselves to satisfy partisan goals that only they care about.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-acas-opponents-can-only-deny-arithmetic-so-long", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "We're looking at Republican-run states paying more for Medicare, on purpose, spiting themselves to satisfy partisan goals that only they care about.", "title": "The ACA's opponents can only deny arithmetic for so long", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-acas-opponents-can-only-deny-arithmetic-so-long", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/ap_928563846031.jpg?itok=tRQzblEr", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-acas-opponents-can-only-deny-arithmetic-so-long", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/ap_928563846031.jpg?itok=XX8FQsfj", "height": 553}, "title": "The ACA's opponents can only deny arithmetic for so long", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "We're looking at Republican-run states paying more for Medicare, on purpose, spiting themselves to satisfy partisan goals that only they care about."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-21T10:40:12-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "affordable-care-act,alabama,health,health-care,health-care-policy,health-care-reform,medicaid,obamacare,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "The ACA's opponents can only deny arithmetic for so long", "published": 1, "date": "10/21/2015 10:40:12 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-acas-opponents-can-only-deny-arithmetic-so-long"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "We're looking at Republican-run states paying more for Medicare, on purpose, spiting themselves to satisfy partisan goals that only they care about.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Affordable Care Act, Alabama, Health Care, Health Care Policy, Medicaid, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7edb\"", "article_summary": "Medicaid expansion could go a long way in helping address both problems, all while extending coverage to thousands of low-income families.\nRobert Bentley (R) possibly \u201cnudging closer\u201d to accepting Medicaid expansion through the ACA (thanks to my colleague Laura Conaway for the heads-up).\nState officials opposed to Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act have always had a tough time rationalizing their ridiculous position.\nStates that refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act are now paying the price, literally,\u201d TPM reported yesterday.\nI was personally against the Affordable Care Act."}
