DADE CITY — Runners risked life and limb at Little Everglades Ranch in Dade City as The Great Bull Run — an event modeled after the Spanish tradition of the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona — made its debut in the Tampa area for those brave enough to be chased by stampeding cattle.

Great Bull Run founder and director Rob Dickens said an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 spectators and runners came out to run or witness one of seven bull runs on the quarter-mile-long straightaway track.

Injuries were minimal, however, there were at least some bumps, bruises and a bloody nose or two.

Many participants wore costumes, while some donned the traditional Running of the Bulls garment of white top and bottoms with a red scarf. Others wore GoPro cameras to capture the bucket-list experience.

Additionally, hundreds also dove into nearly 30,000 tomatoes during the Tomato Royale, a giant food fight to simulate the La Tomatina event in Spain.
