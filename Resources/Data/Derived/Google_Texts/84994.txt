The May 11 commentary by the Freedom Partners (“The road to tax freedom”) lacked some important background on the authors.

Freedom Partners promotes the “benefits of free markets in a free society.” It is partially funded by the Koch brothers and acts as a major distribution outlet for their funds and ideas. Membership dues are at least $100,000 a year, and it has approximately 200 anonymous members. A majority of its board of directors is made up of long-time Koch employees. It has given more than $200 million to conservative organizations, including the Tea Party Patriots, which opposes the Affordable Care Act.

Freedom Partners is also against the Import/Export Bank, subsidies for clean energy (it strongly supports coal and oil – Koch industries), and it opposes present-day Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

Certainly Freedom Partners should be allowed to take whatever positions it may wish on these important issues, and to publish its views in a newspaper of general circulation such as the Times Union. But readers should be fully aware of the source of those positions. The authors’ argument on taxation must be taken into consideration in the context of the group’s overall political positions and history.
