Monta Ellis was one of the Nuggets\u2019 biggest problems.\n\nNuggets Mailbag: Pose a question for Christopher Dempsey\n\nHe hit five of his seven jump shots, two from 3-point range, and scored 15 first half points.\n\nTurnovers put the Nuggets in bad situations.\n\nThe Pacers are the NBA\u2019s best team at converting turnovers into points, and they held true to that form, forcing 10 Nuggets\u2019 turnovers and cashing those in for 18 points in the first half.\n\nWild swings defined the third quarter. The Nuggets started on a 26-12 tear to take a two-point lead.\n\nThe Pacers answered with an 11-2 run to snatch the lead back and push it to seven points. That became a 13-4 run to end the quarter.\n\nDefending was an issue throughout for the Nuggets.\n\nThe Pacers\u2019 shooting percentage never dipped below 60 percent at any point in the first three quarters.\n\nBut the Nuggets figured things out in the fourth, scoring 45 points.\n\nDanilo Gallinari scored 23 points before fouling out late in the fourth. With Gallinari on the bench, other players came through.\n\nWill Barton hit a 3-pointer.\n\nMudiay\u2019s monster dunk with 1:21 tied the game at 121. But George answered to give the Pacers the lead. A goaltending call on a Barton floater tied the game at 123.\n\nThe Nuggets got a stop and then Randy Foye knocked down a 3-point shot with 20.9 seconds to play, giving the Nuggets a 126-123 lead.\n\nBarton scored 15 of his 21 points in the fourth and the Nuggets sizzled, making 15-of-22 in the final frame.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets outshoot Pacers, move to 3-1 on homestand", "title": "Nuggets outshoot Pacers, move to 3-1 on homestand", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/17/nuggets-outshoot-pacers-move-to-3-1-on-homestand/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117__nuggets-mudiayp1.jpg", "height": 534}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117__nuggets-mudiayp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-17T20:58:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T01:10:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "DENVER \u2014 Their homestand goals still firmly attainable, the Nuggets went about the work of putting Friday\u2019s disappointment behind them and focusing on the Indiana Pacers.\nThe victory moved the Nuggets to 3-1 on this homestand, the only loss to Miami on Friday.\nBarton scored 15 of his 21 points in the fourth and the Nuggets sizzled, making 15-of-22 in the final frame.\nThe Nuggets got a stop and then Randy Foye knocked down a 3-point shot with 20.9 seconds to play, giving the Nuggets a 126-123 lead.\nThe Nuggets won a shootout Sunday night at the Pepsi Center, 129-126 over the Pacers."}
