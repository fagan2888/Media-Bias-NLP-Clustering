But we picked up two e-book readers. Should reading on those count as screen time? \u2014 Frank G., Alpine, New Jersey\n\nA: Parents everywhere are trying to figure out how to manage their kids\u2019 use of digital devices. And it\u2019s tricky.\n\nMost make location the issue: No texting at the table; no TVs in the bedroom. You\u2019re trying to enforce time limits; that\u2019s harder to keep track of or enforce. If your kids cooperate, great, but a recent survey found that children 8 to 18 spend around 7 1/2 hours a day with their faces glued to a screen of one kind or another. No wonder the recent national report card on kids and physical activity gave U.S. children Ds or Fs in every measure! Every excess hour spent staring at a screen means kids are not doing what they need to do to develop physically, mentally and socially.\n\nSo, what about time spent using e-readers? Well, the facts aren\u2019t all in yet.\n\nWhat is known: Some kids read more when they have a tablet to use \u2014 and more reading is good. Reading on an e-reader as opposed to other digital environments seems better for focused learning; reading on a computer, a phone or in the context of a website provides too many visual distractions and opportunities to interrupt yourself to get email, look at a video or view an ad. And the e-reader screens don\u2019t have the flicker of a computer screen, so they may not cause eye strain if type size and screen illumination are set correctly.\n\nSo we bet e-book reading is a good habit to let your kids develop \u2014 just take the time to supervise what they read, make sure they stay active and don\u2019t let the device keep them from getting the full night\u2019s sleep they need.\n\nQ: I\u2019ve been taking oral diabetes medications for five years. I\u2019ve never gotten my A1c below 9 percent, and I can\u2019t lose and keep weight off. The doctor says I have a couple of alternatives: Start taking insulin and become more conscientious about testing and nutrition, or consider getting a kind of gastric surgery called sleeve gastrectomy. Is one choice better than the other? \u2014 Lauren B., Birmingham, Alabama\n\nA: It\u2019s never too late to make a difference in your blood-sugar readings, your weight and your future. But you\u2019ll need to get more physical activity, eat healthful foods, reduce stress and sleep seven to eight hours a night, no matter if you\u2019re taking insulin or opting for gastric surgery. That said, new info from the STAMPEDE study, supported in part by the Cleveland Clinic, shows that gastric surgery is an effective way to control weight and blood sugar. Both Rouxen- Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy (in combination with Advanced Medical Therapy \u2014 diet, exercise and medication), promote substantial weight loss and can bring A1c levels down to 7 percent or lower and keep them there.\n\nThey also help people get off insulin and other meds BETTER than Advanced Medical Therapy alone.\n\nPeople who had gastric bypass lost 24 percent of total body weight after three years; sleeve gastrectomy, 21 percent weight loss; medical therapy around 4 percent to 5 percent. And, three years in, 90 percent of surgical participants stopped using insulin and took far fewer cholesterol and high blood pressure meds.\n\nBut gastric surgery can have complications (infection and blood clots) and sometimes needs revision. And you\u2019ll need to make sure you\u2019re getting the right amount of vitamins and odd omegas. One other point: This study was done on people with a BMI of 27 or higher; most insurance covers surgery only for those with a BMI of 35 (30-plus if you have diabetes). So you and your doctor need to carefully consider what will work best for you.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz is host of \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d and Dr. Mike Roizen is chief medical officer at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute.
