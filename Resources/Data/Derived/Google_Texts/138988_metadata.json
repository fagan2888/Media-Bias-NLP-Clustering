We just live in it.\n\nEverywhere at the Texas Republican convention are examples of an unalloyed, take-no-prisoners conservatism where pursuing moderation is no virtue and resisting compromise is no vice.\n\nGone is the establishment wing of the GOP, at least from public view.\n\nEvery speech, sticker and display booth reflects a Cruzified party, defiant abroad and triumphant at home. Ban gay marriage. Embrace home schooling. Abolish the IRS. Repeal Obamacare. Quit \u201cplaying footsy with the mullahs in Iran.\u201d\n\nAt one Senate district caucus, a delegate wore a T-shirt expressing discontent with the old status quo. There was a picture on the back of Cruz in tattoos, a cigarette hanging provocatively from his lower lip and a slogan that read: \u201cBlacklisted and Loving It.\u201d\n\nWhen Cruz himself took the stage Friday under the huge dome of the Fort Worth Convention Center, the crowd of more than 8,000 leaped to its feet in rapturous applause.\n\nHe recalled the landing on D-Day and the siege of the Alamo. He declared: \u201cToday, liberty is under assault like never before. And again today, Texans will stand up and lead the fight for freedom.\u201d\n\nFour years ago, Cruz was not even a footnote at the state GOP convention.\n\nTwo years ago, when Republicans gathered in Fort Worth, Cruz described his once-Quixotic challenge of the party hierarchy as \u201cground zero in the battle between the moderate establishment and the conservative tea party tidal wave.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, he owned the party.\n\n\u201cHe was born for this,\u201d said Kandace Dusek, a delegate from Katy who stood in line more than an hour to get her picture taken with the U.S. senator. \u201cHe\u2019s doing something bigger than himself.\u201d\n\nThe line snaked its way through the exhibit hall, at one point crossing a separate line queued up for a photo with Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael, an evangelical pastor with his own conservative following.\n\nThe party of Cruz found itself this week in some exotic places in pursuit of freedom: a platform debate over \u201creparative therapy\u201d to turn gay people straight and the rights of open-carry advocates to visit Target with AR-15s over their shoulders.\n\nCritics of Houston\u2019s new anti-discrimination ordinance denounced it as \u201cthe sexual predator protection act.\u201d Lieutenant governor nominee Dan Patrick offered evidence that the GOP is not anti-women.\n\n\u201cWe will, I will, do everything we can to protect women from a man in a dress going into a woman\u2019s bathroom,\u201d he told an anti-gay marriage rally Thursday night. \u201cSo, which party wants to protect women?\u201d\n\nWhen the time came to introduce Cruz at the rally, Houston conservative activist Steve Hotze said, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, I give you the next president of the United States.\u201d\n\nCruz extolled the virtues of heterosexual marriage and trumpeted his fights against the Obama administration. He praised the party\u2019s candidates for reflecting the values he said are close to his heart.\n\n\u201cAs good as 2014 is going to be, 2016 is going to be even better,\u201d he promised. \u201cIt is up to the people to turn this country around and up to Texas to lead the fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou the man!\u201d someone shouted. And as Cruz left the stage, the crowd chanted, \u201cRun, Ted, Run!\u201d\n\nFollow Wayne Slater on Twitter at @wayneslater.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rock-star reception is remarkable for someone who wasn\u2019t even mentioned four years ago.", "og": {"description": "The rock-star reception is remarkable for someone who wasn\u2019t even mentioned four years ago.", "title": "Texas GOP convention proves it\u2019s Ted Cruz\u2019s party", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/wayne-slater/20140606-texas-gop-convention-proves-its-ted-cruzs-party.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-06-07T04:21:58Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-06-07T04:21:58Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Texas GOP convention proves it\\u2019s Ted Cruz\\u2019s party\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/wayne-slater/20140606-texas-gop-convention-proves-its-ted-cruzs-party.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1719701\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-06-07T04:21:58Z\", \"section\": \"Wayne Slater\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-06-07T04:21:58Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "FORT WORTH \u2014 It\u2019s Ted Cruz\u2019s state now.\nTwo years ago, when Republicans gathered in Fort Worth, Cruz described his once-Quixotic challenge of the party hierarchy as \u201cground zero in the battle between the moderate establishment and the conservative tea party tidal wave.\u201dOn Friday, he owned the party.\nEverywhere at the Texas Republican convention are examples of an unalloyed, take-no-prisoners conservatism where pursuing moderation is no virtue and resisting compromise is no vice.\nAnd as Cruz left the stage, the crowd chanted, \u201cRun, Ted, Run!\u201dFollow Wayne Slater on Twitter at @wayneslater.\nEvery speech, sticker and display booth reflects a Cruzified party, defiant abroad and triumphant at home."}
