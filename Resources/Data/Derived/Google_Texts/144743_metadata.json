Steve King, R-Iowa, told WND.\n\n\u201cNow we risk millions leaving the party if the GOP does not step up on principle.\u201d\n\nKing pointed out that Obama is proceeding to implement his executive immigration actions by utilizing fees generated by the Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS. The fees come from the processing of applications under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA.\n\n\u201cWe could have fought Obama on amnesty by passing month-to-month continuing resolutions to fund the government and demanding concessions every step of the way to keep the government funded,\u201d King pointed out. \u201cBut by passing the \u2018Cromnibus\u2019 and funding the Department of Homeland Security through February, Boehner and the House allowed Obama to get in place the administrative structure needed to issue his deferred prosecution orders and work permits to the DREAMer parents.\u201d\n\nKing charged that Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are set to \u201cconspire against conservatives once again\u201d in their willingness to continue funding Obamacare and executive amnesty to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nAlready, to fulfill Obama\u2019s immigration actions, the administration has taken steps to lease space in a newly constructed office building in Crystal City, near Arlington, Virginia, at a cost of $7.8 million annually. The building will provide space for some 1,000 full-time federal and contract employees in a variety of positions and grade levels, with jobs offering salaries as high as $157,000 a year and a total salary cost of $40 million per year.\n\nThe opposition to Boehner comes two weeks after WND\u2019s Joseph Farah began the grass-roots \u201cDon\u2019t Be Yellow: Dump Boehner Now!\u201d campaign, which has already sent some 560,000 letters to House Republicans attempting to mobilize the palace coup.\n\n\u201cHow can I in good conscience vote to ratify Boehner as House speaker when I know the guy is working to undermine the conservative principles I promised voters I was returning to Washington to establish?\u201d King asked.\n\nKing rejected the narrative presented by the GOP establishment that voters want the party to work with the Obama administration in \u201cgetting something done\u201d in Washington.\n\n\u201cIt should be clear that in the midterm elections the most effective GOP advertising done was in opposition to Obamacare and to blocking Obama\u2019s amnesty by executive action,\u201d King said.\n\n\u201cWhat Boehner did at the end of the last congressional session was to fully fund Obamacare without a legitimate debate on the issues, and fund amnesty until February 27, taking away our tools to be able to leverage anything against Obama on amnesty.\u201d\n\nKing stressed that Boehner has no plans to oppose Obama\u2019s use of fees generated by USCIS to fund the implementation of his executive-action amnesty program.\n\n\u201cEven when we did shut down the government, I learned the USCIS continued to pump out the DACA permits \u2026 that built the fees the USCIS is using now to implement Obamacare,\u201d King noted.\n\n\u201cNow, if we did shut down the government, the USCIS would continue to fund the implementation of amnesty, while the Obama administration would hold back the paychecks of the Border Patrol and other government officials providing security on the border,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe USCIS is fee-for-service, so USCIS worked through the shutdown, and the USCIS officials all got paid on time.\u201d\n\nKing stressed that Boehner had no plan in place that would block Obama from continuing to implement amnesty through USCIS.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s play this out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe USCIS is prepared to turn out a lot of permits in a short period of time. Now, even if we pass an appropriations bill to fund DHS after February 27 and we put a provision in the bill that DHS is prohibited from spending to implement amnesty, Obama would just veto the bill. With no continued funding, Obama would have USCIS continue to issue amnesty permits on a fee-for-service basis, while instructing the Border Patrol to go out and do their jobs without a paycheck.\u201d\n\nKing emphasized Obama has once again outsmarted Boehner, because it\u2019s unlikely Boehner and McConnell would halt DHS appropriations to force Obama to stop implementing his executive action.\n\nWhat do you think?
