The industry standard for call centers is 30 seconds.\n\n\u201cAnybody could get it wrong up front, but what was everybody [at MNsure] doing while all of these people were on hold?\u201d said Fred Weiner, president of The Connection, a Burnsville company. \u201cWhat were they doing in October, November and December?\u201d\n\nWeiner said his company is one of three vying for an outsourcing contract with MNsure that agency officials expect to finalize within the next week. The contract is expected to allow MNsure to add up to 100 external customer service representatives to its call center, which currently has 65 operators.\n\nThe additional workers are expected to be in place just as the agency prepares for its next major test: a crush of consumers rushing to meet the March 31 deadline to buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which requires most Americans to have coverage or pay a tax penalty.\n\nAbdikarim Abdi and Josh Truax took calls and worked on training in the MNsure call center in St. Paul.\n\nMNsure officials said they are confident their call center strategy will work because other technical problems are decreasing, and more applicants are enrolling successfully. \u201cWe are reacting right,\u201d said Brian Beutner, MNsure\u2019s board chairman. \u201cWould we have liked to have done it sooner and more timely? Maybe.\u201d\n\nThe state originally expected about 135,000 consumers to use MNsure to enroll in private and government-subsidized health plans by the end of open enrollment in March. But only 27,775 people have bought coverage, according to the latest data through Jan. 22.\n\nAs of Thursday, MNsure was planning to cap its hiring at 50 additional external operators. But the agency decided to double its goal after the Star Tribune asked why it wasn\u2019t following the advice of the health care IT company Optum, which analyzed MNsure\u2019s operations.\n\nOptum, which is credited with fixing widespread problems with the federal health exchange, told MNsure in January that it should hire 100 operators to boost customer service and eliminate long wait times.\n\nIn a written statement on Sunday, MNsure told the Star Tribune that it decided to boost staffing beyond 50 operators \u201cafter looking more strategically\u201d at the call center\u2019s needs.\n\nWith the additional workers, MNsure officials said average hold times should drop to two minutes, compared to an average of 36 minutes in January. On busy days, MNsure officials acknowledge, callers could be on hold for 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cIn the call center industry, 10 minutes is considered a huge failure,\u201d said Pete Hainey, president of Customer Elation, one of the largest call center operators in Minnesota. \u201cNo business would accept a 10-minute hold as their norm.\u201d\n\nEven though MNsure more than doubled its call staff in December, it hasn\u2019t been enough. Last week, callers waited up to 40 minutes to speak to an operator.\n\n\u201cIs it taking way too long to fix? Yes,\u201d said Tom Forsythe, a MNsure board member. \u201cI have not been as aggressive as I should have been. \u2026 The response was inadequate.\u201d\n\nMissed opportunities\n\nWhen state officials started laying the groundwork for MNsure in 2011, they planned to hire a consultant to assess its call center needs. But a consultant was never hired.\n\nMNsure officials came up with their own estimates, based on information they gathered from health insurers and others. Those estimates were considerably off target.\n\nInstead of handling 900 calls per day, as initially projected, the call center was taking an average of 2,174 calls per day by December, with operators bogged down with consumers stymied over technical issues while signing up for coverage.\n\nIn fact, callers were on hold so long that half hung up before reaching a live operator. By comparison, the industry standard is 3 percent.\n\nBen Merrill estimates he has spent more than three hours on hold over the past few weeks. He gave up twice after waiting for 20 minutes. Another time while on hold, he ran an errand while staying connected. He got through after nearly an hour, only to be told the call center could not help him.\n\nMNsure call center \u2013 by the numbers \u2022 Number of call center operators in October: 27 \u2022 Average wait time : 10 minutes, 34 seconds \u2022 Number of operators in December : 54 \u2022 Average wait time : 56 minutes, 45 seconds \u2022 Number of operators in January : 65 \u2022 Average wait time : 36 minutes, 33 seconds \u2022 Number of external operators to be added by end of February: 100 \u2022 Projected wait times by March : 2 to 10 minutes\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous waste of people\u2019s time,\u201d said Merrill, 41, of St. Paul, who eventually got insurance through the system.\n\nMNsure officials defended their original projections, saying the exchange is operating in uncharted territory.\n\n\u201cThis hadn\u2019t been tried before,\u201d said MNsure interim CEO Scott Leitz, who replaced MNsure\u2019s former chief executive in mid-December. \u201cThe state exchanges have a level of complexity that is far different from checking on the status of a shipment from Nordstrom.\u201d\n\nOverconfident\n\nCall center veterans agreed that MNsure faced some unique challenges, but they said the agency made a critical mistake by not hiring professionals to design the operation. Last June, after watching MNsure leaders outline plans for the call center, a former representative of Avaya, a $5 billion telecommunications company, wrote an e-mail to several board members warning of problems ahead.\n\nMNsure \u201cis not set up to handle the pending onslaught of traffic the exchange is going to generate,\u201d wrote Johan Aasheim, then of Avaya.\n\nOther experienced call center firms said they tried to get the state to consider hiring an outside vendor to take at least some of the calls.\n\n\u201cThey made it clear they had all of the infrastructure they needed,\u201d said Hainey at Customer Elation. \u201cThe government went in with an arrogant attitude of, \u2018We know how to do this better than business.\u2019 And clearly they don\u2019t. \u2026 This is one of the worst customer service experiences I\u2019ve seen executed in my career.\u201d\n\nIndustry experts said MNsure could have fixed the call center\u2019s problems in October or November. With more than 400 call center companies in Minnesota, there was plenty of excess capacity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have a problem \u2014 it\u2019s another to not fix it,\u201d said Donna Fluss, president of DMG Consulting in New Jersey, a research firm focused on the call center industry. \u201cAnd this is very fixable. You have some great [options] in Minnesota.\u201d\n\nMNsure\u2019s chairman agrees that mistakes were made with the call center. \u201cThings will go wrong,\u201d Beutner said. \u201cThat is the nature of starting something from scratch.\u201d\n\nIn November, the agency tried to work out a deal with an outside vendor, but the deal collapsed when the parties couldn\u2019t agree on the price, said Erik Larson, MNsure\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cTheir cost numbers were quite out of line,\u201d he said.\n\nThis time, MNsure is negotiating with three companies, including Optum.\n\nA new vendor will enable MNsure to offer a service that is standard at other call centers dealing with high volume \u2014 callers will be allowed to schedule a return phone call. MNsure has been equipped to do that since Oct. 1, but the agency hasn\u2019t had enough workers to make those calls, Larson said.\n\nForsythe, the MNsure board member and General Mills executive, said he remains critical of the state\u2019s decision to create a primary call center for MNsure instead of directing most calls to an experienced operator. That decision was made before MNsure\u2019s board took over in August.\n\n\u201cI think the strategy was upside down,\u201d Forsythe said. \u201cAs a result, we were not positioned to outsource volume to a vendor and reduce these call wait times.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A major boost in manpower is still weeks away at MNsure's overwhelmed call center, which continues to keep customers on hold for 30 minutes or more.", "title": "MNsure scolded for waiting too long to fix call center", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/feb-3-mnsure-scolded-for-delays-in-fixing-call-center/243431681/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_13914842411275.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_13914842411275.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "A major boost in manpower is still weeks away at MNsure's overwhelmed call center, which continues to keep customers on hold for 30 minutes or more.", "title": "MNsure scolded for waiting too long to fix call center", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/feb-3-mnsure-scolded-for-delays-in-fixing-call-center/243431681/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_13914842411275.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_13914842411275.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A major boost in manpower is still weeks away at MNsure's overwhelmed call center, which continues to keep customers on hold for 30 minutes or more."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce02b\"", "article_summary": "MNsure officials came up with their own estimates, based on information they gathered from health insurers and others.\nMNsure officials said they are confident their call center strategy will work because other technical problems are decreasing, and more applicants are enrolling successfully.\nMNsure officials defended their original projections, saying the exchange is operating in uncharted territory.\nAbdikarim Abdi and Josh Truax took calls and worked on training in the MNsure call center in St. Paul.\n\u201cIn the call center industry, 10 minutes is considered a huge failure,\u201d said Pete Hainey, president of Customer Elation, one of the largest call center operators in Minnesota."}
