The 2016 health insurance rates filed by carriers under the Affordable Care Act will be available for public viewing Monday on the Colorado Division of Insurance website.

Carriers filed their rates and plans with the division May 29. Officials are reviewing them to ensure plans meet ACA requirements and proposed rates are neither excessive or inadequate.

DOI will complete the review in early September, officials said, and will notify carriers and Connect for Health Colorado which plans have been approved for the next open enrollment, which runs Nov. 1 to Jan. 31, 2016.

Rate can be seen Monday at www.dora.colorado.gov/insurance.
