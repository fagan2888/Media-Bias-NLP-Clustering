The Texas politician reaffirmed his stance against gay marriage and defended his father in his late-night debut

J. Scott Applewhite / AP Senator Ted Cruz emerges from the Senate Chamber after his overnight crusade railing against the nation's new health care law at the Capitol in Washington, Sept. 25, 2013.

Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz made his late-night debut on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno on Friday, reaffirming his stance against President Obama’s Affordable Care Act and gay marriage.

Cruz said Obamacare is hurting residents in Texas — despite the fact that 25% of the state’s residents don’t have health insurance — killing jobs and forcing insured individuals to drop their health insurance programs.

Leno also pressed Cruz on gay marriage, asking the Texas politician why he was against it.

“I support marriage between one man and one woman, but I also think it’s a question for the states. Some states have made decisions one way on gay marriage; some states have made decisions the other way,” Cruz said. “And that’s the great thing about our Constitution, is different states can make decisions depending on the values of their citizens.”

Leno also asked about Cruz’s father, Pastor Rafael Cruz, who was recently in the news for making anti-gay comments.

Cruz called his father “a man of deep integrity,” adding, “Some folks have decided to try to go after him because they want to take some shots at me. But I think the critics are better off attacking me.”
