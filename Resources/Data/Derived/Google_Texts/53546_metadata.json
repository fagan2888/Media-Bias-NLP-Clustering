The Salvation Army will \u201cgo out and take care of the products.\u201d\n\nWalmart donated $20,000 a day after the break-in to help the Salvation Army replace gifts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge help. Their gift is a very good start,\u201d Reckline said.\n\n\u201cThe Salvation Army plans to use Walmart\u2019s donation, and others that may come in from the community, to replace the stolen products and pay for extra security at the facility,\u201d according to a press release.\n\nIn response to the theft, the Washington Nationals encouraged fans to bring \u201cMP3 players, Kindles, tablets and other electronic items,\u201d or cash donations, to the baseball team\u2019s annual Winterfest fan festival to help replenish the stolen gifts, according to a Washington Nationals press release.\n\nAbout 300 bags filled with Christmas toys and necessities\u2014and ready for distribution to families in need\u2014were torn open and ransacked in Southeast Washington at the temporary headquarters for the Angel Tree program.\n\n\u201cFriday night it appears as though someone was able to somehow get past the security system that\u2019s in place at our distribution center,\u201d Reckline said.\n\nThe rented space had been monitored by a security guard during operational hours and had motion sensors. During the time of the break-in, no security guards were on duty.\n\n\u201cIt became apparent that they were only interested in certain items,\u201d Reckline said.\n\nThe items stolen were more \u201chigh-end\u201d items that would have belonged to the older children assisted through Angel Tree, he said.\n\nBikes, clothes, and electronics\u2014including iPads\u2014were among the gifts stolen.\n\nA suitcase filled with Kindles had been dropped and left behind by the burglars, NBC-TV Washington\u2019s Mark Segraves reported from the Angel Tree warehouse. The items were found damaged and with cracked screens.\n\nTwo teenagers were arrested and charged with burglary after being spotted in the building Saturday morning. Police are seeking three other teens in connection with the crime, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThis particular Angel Tree warehouse is designated to help nearly 2,500 families and 6,000 needy children in the Washington area.\n\n\u201cThe program is fairly simple: A Christmas tree is set up in a public location, and, for a specified amount of time, willing participants can visit the tree, sign up with a volunteer, and take a name-tag ornament off the tree,\u201d wrote The Daily Signal\u2019s Madaline Donnelly, who recently visited and reported on an Angel Tree location in Virginia.\n\n\u201cOn the tag is the first name of a child along with his wish list, which includes items requested by the child\u2019s parents (usually necessities like clothing) as well as a \u2018bonus\u2019 wish list item such as a video game or stuffed animal.\u201d\n\nThis piece has been updated to reflect the amount of money donated since the theft.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Teenagers ransacked about 300 bags filled with Christmas gifts in Southeast Washington at the temporary headquarters for the Angel Tree program.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Teenagers ransacked about 300 bags filled with Christmas gifts in Southeast Washington at the temporary headquarters for the Angel Tree program.", "title": "Salvation Army Works Overtime to Replace Stolen Gifts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151215_ChristmasGrinch_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-16T20:55:22+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1O6HlYT"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Teenagers ransacked about 300 bags filled with Christmas gifts in Southeast Washington at the temporary headquarters for the Angel Tree program.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151215_ChristmasGrinch_Jessen.jpg"}, "title": "Salvation Army Works Overtime to Replace Stolen Gifts", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "civil society", "published_time": "2015-12-16T14:58:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-16T20:55:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Salvation Army, Washington, Angel Tree, Theft, robbery, Grinch, DC, gifts, Walmart, Washington Nationals,"}, "article_summary": "The Salvation Army will \u201cgo out and take care of the products.\u201dWalmart donated $20,000 a day after the break-in to help the Salvation Army replace gifts.\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, $45,000 has been donated to the Salvation Army.\nThe items stolen were more \u201chigh-end\u201d items that would have belonged to the older children assisted through Angel Tree, he said.\nA suitcase filled with Kindles had been dropped and left behind by the burglars, NBC-TV Washington\u2019s Mark Segraves reported from the Angel Tree warehouse.\nThis particular Angel Tree warehouse is designated to help nearly 2,500 families and 6,000 needy children in the Washington area."}
