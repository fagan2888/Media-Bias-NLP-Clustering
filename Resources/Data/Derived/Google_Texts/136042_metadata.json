( Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer )\n\nElementary students at Boulder's Jarrow Montessori School recently designed a pavilion for the school's front entrance using toilet paper rolls, construction paper, various other bits and pieces, and lots of glue.\n\nThe elementary students participated in a design workshop led by 13 college students in the University of Colorado's environmental design program. The CU students, all juniors, are designing and building the pavilion as a class project.\n\n\"We had a blast with the kids,\" CU junior Preston Reed said. \"It was really eye-opening. They had some really great ideas.\"\n\nHe said designing and building a project in a semester has been \"a long road, but a lot of fun.\"\n\n\"To design something from scratch and see it being built has been really cool,\" he said.\n\nA model of the new Jarrow Montessori School entrance designed by a University of Colorado environmental design class that worked with students at the Boulder private school.

The school paid for the materials, while the students handled all the design and labor.\n\n\"We got a wonderful structure,\" he said.\n\nJarrow students said they liked sharing their ideas. There were practical ones, like a slanted roof for rain and wide benches so they could sit together with their friends. And more imaginative, like slides and a backpack shooter so students wouldn't have to carry their packs to their cars.\n\nSecond-grader Owen Stanzel came up with the backpack shooter idea \u2014 which remains just that, an idea. He also used foam blocks, straws and paper to create a canopy.\n\n\"I used my imagination,\" he said. \"It was really fun.\"\n\nClassmate Julia Peterson went with a big roof and a little cave as the entrance, adding \"a bunch of little buildings you could rush into if it rained.\"\n\nShe said she liked that the designers asked the students' opinions.\n\n\"It's our school, and they wanted more ideas of how we would like it,\" she said.\n\nAmy Bounds: 303-473-1341, boundsa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/boundsa", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_28123391/cu-boulder-class-designs-builds-entrance-pavilion-jarrow", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28123391:view"}, "startDate": "2015-05-16T10:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Elementary students at Boulder's Jarrow Montessori  School recently  designed a pavilion for the school's front entrance using toilet paper rolls, construction paper, various other bits and pieces, and lots of glue.", "title": "CU-Boulder class designs, builds entrance pavilion for Jarrow Montessori", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_28123391/cu-boulder-class-designs-builds-entrance-pavilion-jarrow", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0515/20150515__16DCAMONw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder Education & Schools", "modificationDate": "2015-05-15T11:37:05-0600", "endDate": "2025-05-15T11:23:22-0600", "news_keywords": "news information  boulder county schools elementary middle high preps", "byline": "By Amy BoundsStaff", "pubDate": "2015-05-15T11:38:37-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-05-16T10:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "CU-Boulder class designs, builds entrance pavilion for Jarrow Montessori", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0515/20150515__16DCAMONw~2_300.jpg", "description": "Elementary students at Boulder's Jarrow Montessori  School recently  designed a pavilion for the school's front entrance using toilet paper rolls, construction paper, various other bits and pieces, and lots of glue.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_28123391/cu-boulder-class-designs-builds-entrance-pavilion-jarrow", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Elementary students at Boulder's Jarrow Montessori  School recently  designed a pavilion for the school's front entrance using toilet paper rolls, construction paper, various other bits and pieces, and lots of glue.", "title": "CU-Boulder class designs, builds entrance pavilion for Jarrow Montessori"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0515/20150515__16DCAMONw~2.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Finn Rollings, left, joins his classmates in the new entrance at Boulder's Jarrow Montessori School on Thursday.\nA University of Colorado environmental design class worked with students at Jarrow to design a new entrance for the private school.\nA model of the new Jarrow Montessori School entrance designed by a University of Colorado environmental design class that worked with students at the Boulder private school.\n( Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer )Elementary students at Boulder's Jarrow Montessori School recently designed a pavilion for the school's front entrance using toilet paper rolls, construction paper, various other bits and pieces, and lots of glue.\nJarrow students said they liked sharing their ideas."}
