A U.S. hospital has blood on its hands after charging a New Jersey teacher $8,775 to bandage a cut finger.\n\nThat\u2019s the bill Baer Hanusz-Rajkowski got after he left the Bayonne Medical Center emergency room earlier this year with a tetanus shot and a bandage on his right digit finger.\n\nNo one has to tell Hanusz-Rajowksi or the likely collaborators \u2013 the hospitals and insurers that battle over rates or the lawmakers who throw their hands up in frustration \u2014 that the U.S. healthcare system is bleeding and in need of more than a stitch. While all shareholders are quick to point blame, they are just as slow to come up with a consensus to repair it.\n\nDespite even the best intentions of the Affordable Care Act, Americans continue to find themselves at odds with access to care that they can truly afford. But, the confusion and costs that vary widely from one hospital to the next are spawning a new breed of patient, one that is willing to look beyond state or national boundaries to destinations that offer health services that are both readily accessible and economically feasible.\n\nPassport to Savings\n\nClose to 1 million Americans will pull out their passports this year and travel overseas for medical tourism procedures and treatments, most of which are elective, but wide ranging from dentistry and comprehensive health checkups to hip replacements and organ transplants.\n\nFor the most part, the quality of care is comparable to what they will receive in the United States. Beside the top-notch care from accredited international hospitals and doctors, medical tourism also boasts substantial savings \u2013 in some cases, as much as 70 percent. That distinction is beyond compare.\n\nJoy Guion, of North Carolina, was lured by a sun-soaked destination, four-star hotel and, most provocatively, a surgery that would reverse her \u201csevere chronic obesity\u201d at a price her company, HSM, could afford. Her medical tourism experience was chronicled on ABC\u2019s \u201cNightline.\u201d\n\nRen\u00e9e-Marie Stephano, President of the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae, said lower labor costs, fewer third-party payments, price transparency, limited malpractice liability and streamlined regulations are among the reasons foreign hospitals have become more appealing to U.S. patients.\n\nCount patients like Joy Guion among them. Even though the North Carolina native and employee at HSM wasn\u2019t accustomed to traveling overseas \u2014 let alone for medical care \u2014 she was lured by a sun-soaked destination, four-star hotel with a personal concierge and a local driver and, most provocatively, a surgery that would reverse her \u201csevere chronic obesity.\u201d\n\nTo keep her company on her first plane trip, HSM even sent Gary Harwell, a retired manager and former colleague who needed knee replacement surgery, along with her. Here\u2019s the kicker: both employees didn\u2019t have to pay a dime for their surgeries \u2013 not even travel expenses or post-op recovery. HSM, a self-funded employer of 2,500 U.S.-based employees and member of the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae, picked up the tab.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Tim Isenhower, director of benefits at HSM, says as an incentive for employees to get onboard with medical tourism, his company even waives copays and deductibles, and covers travel expenses for both the employee and a companion.\n\nDollars and Sense\n\nTo employers like HSM, the math makes perfect sense. In the United States, the same knee replacement would have cost more than $59,000. In Costa Rica, the procedure costs half that amount, at $23,531. In North Carolina, Guion\u2019s gastric sleeve surgery would have cost about $30,000, but in Costa Rica, the procedure comes to $17,386. So, when the bandages came off, both Guion and Harwell received a bonus check for at least $2,500 from HSM, or up to 20 percent of the savings the company enjoyed in insurance costs \u2014 healthy and happy employees indeed.\n\n\u201cAsk a Patient\u201d will connect healthcare consumers to the doctors, insurance executives, medical tourism facilitators and travel and hospitality interests that can provide answers to their health travel questions.\n\nWhat\u2019s the catch? There isn\u2019t one. HSM saves money, about $10 million in healthcare costs in the past five years. Close to 250 of HSM\u2019s employees have traveled abroad for medical tourism procedures, and Isenhower, who conceded there was fear in the eyes of those he first approached with traveling to other areas of the world for medical care some six years ago, says more are scheduled to go. (Their case study was featured on segments of \u201cABC\u2019s World News Tonight with Diane Sawyer,\u201d and later on \u201cNightline\u201d following a consolidated effort of the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae and the employer and healthcare provider, both MTA members, to bring the story to international recognition.

Other accounts yet to be designed, but eager to be conceived will be crafted at a live interactive patient-dedicated webcast during the 7th World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress, Sept. 20-24, 2014, in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cAsk a Patient: Making Dollars and Sense Out of the Medical Tourism Experience,\u201d will connect real and active healthcare consumers who know best about what they want and deserve from health travel to the hospital administrators, doctors and clinicians, facilitators, insurance executive and hospitality and travel interests that make medical tourism happen.\n\nThe interactive webcast, a partnership of the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae and EscapeArtist, Sept, 23, 2014, at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center, will stream questions and answers from all over the world. Healthcare providers will see them, hear them, and talk to the patients in an open forum that is bound to personally touch the lives of all, both profoundly and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 immediately.\n\n\u201cPatients can compare treatments and providers can bounce ideas about their peers to solve health and travel complications most on the minds of international healthcare seekers,\u201d said Stephano. \u201cThis is an opportunity to distinguish destinations, to ask the questions that matter and make the medical tourism experience better \u2014 for both patients and providers \u2013 through sharing, support, and research.\u201d\n\nTo register for the webcast, visit: http://www.medicaltourismcongress.com/ask-patient/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans are turning to medical tourism to avoid a healthcare system mired in hidden costs and excessive red tape that Obamacare has not been able to cure,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Tourism Magazine | Blog", "description": "A U.S. hospital has blood on its hands after charging a New Jersey T ...", "title": "Ask a Patient: Americans Turn to Medical Tourism for Healthcare Relief", "url": "http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/blog/2014/09/ask-patient-americans-turn-medical-tourism-relief-bleeding-healthcare-system/", "image": "http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bleeding.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Americans are turning to medical tourism to avoid a healthcare system mired in hidden costs and excessive red tape that Obamacare has not been able to cure,", "creator": "@Medtour", "image": "http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bleeding.jpg", "title": "Ask a Patient: Americans Turn to Medical Tourism for Healthcare Relief", "site": "@MedTourMagazine", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 578485882245508}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a9c\"", "article_summary": "Beside the top-notch care from accredited international hospitals and doctors, medical tourism also boasts substantial savings \u2013 in some cases, as much as 70 percent.\n\u201cAsk a Patient\u201d will connect healthcare consumers to the doctors, insurance executives, medical tourism facilitators and travel and hospitality interests that can provide answers to their health travel questions.\nHSM, a self-funded employer of 2,500 U.S.-based employees and member of the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae, picked up the tab.\nHer medical tourism experience was chronicled on ABC\u2019s \u201cNightline.\u201dRen\u00e9e-Marie Stephano, President of the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae, said lower labor costs, fewer third-party payments, price transparency, limited malpractice liability and streamlined regulations are among the reasons foreign hospitals have become more appealing to U.S. patients.\n\u201cThis is an opportunity to distinguish destinations, to ask the questions that matter and make the medical tourism experience better \u2014 for both patients and providers \u2013 through sharing, support, and research.\u201dTo register for the webcast, visit: http://www.medicaltourismcongress.com/ask-patient/"}
