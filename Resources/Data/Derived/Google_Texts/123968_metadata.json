A recent report on the global market states: \u201cWorld oil demand growth appears to have peaked in 1Q15 at 1.8 million barrels per day and will continue to ease throughout the rest of this year and into next as temporary support fades.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t have great faith in forecasts but the data shows declining demand growth from late 2010 to the 2nd quarter of this year (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Year-over-year demand growth, 2010-2015. Source: IEA and Labyrinth Consulting Services, Inc.\n\nThe weak global economy is the cause of low demand growth. The current debt crisis in Greece and collapsing stock markets in China are the latest alarm signals.\n\nRelated: China\u2019s Stock Meltdown: How Far Will the Ripples Go?\n\nLast week, the IMF lowered its world economic growth outlook because of these problems. \u201cWe have entered a period of low growth,\u201d said Olivier Blanchard, the IMF\u2019s chief economist.\n\nIEA data shows that world liquids production increased 1.1 million barrels per day compared with the 1st quarter of 2015, and demand fell by 410 thousand barrels per day (Figure 2). Half of the production increase occurred in June 2015.\n\nFigure 2.

This surplus consists of two components: over-production and weakening demand growth. Of the two, over-production is the easier problem to solve.\n\nUnconventional production has not declined meaningfully so far and OPEC seems determined to maintain or increase its production. The standoff will be resolved by lower prices. Clearly, the few months of lower oil prices in late 2014 and early 2015 were insufficient to force unconventional production lower. A longer period of much lower prices may be needed.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The news from the International Energy Agency is not good.", "title": "Are Low Oil Prices Here to Stay?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/13/Are-Low-Oil-Prices-Here-Stay", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/oil-khurias_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/13/Are-Low-Oil-Prices-Here-Stay", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/oil-khurias_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The news from the International Energy Agency is not good.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb24c\"", "article_summary": "Clearly, the few months of lower oil prices in late 2014 and early 2015 were insufficient to force unconventional production lower.\nThe production surplus (supply minus demand) that is responsible for low oil prices continues to increase (Figure 3).\nThe weak global economy is the cause of low demand growth.\nA longer period of much lower prices may be needed.\nThe standoff will be resolved by lower prices."}
