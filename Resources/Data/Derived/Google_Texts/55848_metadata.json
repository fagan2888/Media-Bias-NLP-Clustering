As China\u2019s largest trading partner, Brazil has suffered amid a slowdown in the world\u2019s second biggest economy. Reuters/ Paulo Whitaker\n\nDespite a strong first half for private equity investments and fundraising in Latin America, the Latin American Private Equity & Venture Capital Association warned of tough times ahead on concerns of a knock-on effect of a slowdown in China.\n\n\u201cWe expect to see the worst before it gets better,\u201d said Lavca President and Executive Director Cate Ambrose . \u201cWhat the world is facing is a lot of uncertainties with recalibrating China\u2019s growth and the price of oil and commodities. It is just going to be a more challenging time for emerging markets this year and next year.\u201d\n\nExpectations that China\u2019s economic growth is slowing\u2013some economists have predicted rates around 4% this year, well below the official target of 7% \u2013have wreaked havoc in the global equities markets over the past weeks.\n\nAlthough some investors\u2019 worries are psychological, the pain is real for countries like Brazil. China is Brazil\u2019s largest trading partner and has been, over the past few years, driving much of Brazil\u2019s economic growth and asset inflation with its hunt for commodities.\n\nThe Brazilian real has lost more than 40% of its value against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year, and economists expect Brazil\u2019s gross domestic product, which shrank 1.9% in the second quarter , to record a contraction of 2.1% this year.\n\nMs. Ambrose said that while the general sentiment is for investors to shun Brazil in the near term, some with a medium-to-long-term view of the market, like sovereign funds and family offices, are taking the opportunity to look at Brazilian assets.\n\n\u201cIf you are taking a mid- or long-term view of the region, now is a very attractive time to buy,\u201d she said.\n\nGiven the significant devaluation of currencies in Brazil and other Latin American countries, \u201cbusiness owners are more willing to negotiate on valuations,\u201d she said.\n\nEven though uncertainties surrounding China will likely cast a shadow over investments in Latin America countries, private equity enjoyed a good first half of the year. Lavca said $3.58 billion was deployed among Latin American buyouts in the six months ended June 30, compared with $2.57 billion for the same period last year.\n\nBrazil led investment activities with 69 transactions, worth a combined $2.28 billion, Lavca said, compared with $1.89 billion from 50 deals in the year-earlier period.\n\nMexican deals more than doubled in value, to $978 million, in the six months ended June 30, up from $403 million a year ago. The Andean region of Colombia, Chile and Peru also attracted $304 million of investments, up from $265 million during the same period last year.\n\nLatin American-focused funds raised $4.27 billion during the first six months of the year, marking the strongest start since 2011, when $4.9 billion was amassed.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t expect that by the end of the year, we will have as strong a year as 2014, when a record $10.4 billion was raised,\u201d Ms. Ambrose said.\n\nLast year, Advent International raised the largest private equity fund for the region, collecting $2.1 billion. Patria Investimentos\u2013 Blackstone Group \u2018s investment partner in Latin America\u2013closed on a $1.8 billion fund while Gavea Investimentos pulled in $1.1 billion.\n\nFor more on the Latin American deal landscape, including some of the largest transactions of the first half, check out the full story in LBO Wire.\n\n[Correction: The record amount raised for Latin American private equity funds was $10.4 billion.
