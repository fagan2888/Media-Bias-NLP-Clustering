Now the administration is concerned, too.\n\nTreasury Department officials are preparing to reverse course on an official calculator that permits plans without hospital coverage to pass the health-care law\u2019s strictest standard for large employers, said industry lawyers who have spoken to them. These lawyers expect the administration to disallow such coverage by the end of the year.\n\nThe politically sensitive shift reflects senior officials\u2019 growing concern about insurance that consumer advocates call substandard but that effectively bars workers from subsidies to buy fuller coverage outside the workplace, the lawyers said.\n\nThe calculator is an online spreadsheet developed by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nSuccessfully completing it is one way for large companies to certify that their plans meet a \u201cminimum value\u201d of benefits, the health-care law\u2019s toughest requirement for large employers \u2014 generally those with 50 or more workers. Offering minimum-value insurance at an affordable price would spare companies from fines of as much as $3,120 per worker next year.\n\nAs previously reported by Kaiser Health News and The Washington Post, industry executives were surprised to see consultants selling calculator-approved plans that lack hospital insurance and cost half as much as similar coverage with hospitalization.\n\nEmployees who are offered minimum-value coverage at work, even if it lacks hospital benefits, are barred from receiving federal subsidies to buy policies in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s online marketplaces.\n\nThe administration has not made a final decision on blocking the plans, the industry lawyers emphasized.\n\n\u201cMy best guess is that they will kill them,\u201d said Frasier Ives, a benefits lawyer for Wells Fargo Insurance who has talked to Treasury officials about the matter. \u201cThe only question is when they are going to make it effective.\u201d\n\nHHS designed the calculator, but the Treasury is charged with enforcing the minimum-value standard. The agencies have stayed silent on the matter despite repeated queries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually going to decline comment on this,\u201d Treasury spokeswoman Erin Donar said when asked about the agency\u2019s review.\n\n\u201cNot familiar with this one,\u201d HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said last week.\n\nDisqualifying calculator-approved plans without inpatient benefits could disrupt preparations by hundreds of companies, employing tens of thousands of workers, that are watching them for 2015, brokers and benefits lawyers said.\n\n\u201cThese are cost decisions impacting employers,\u201d said Anne Lennan, president of the Society of Professional Benefit Administrators, some of whose members administer the plans under scrutiny. \u201cWe\u2019re getting close to January 1. If you\u2019re going to change this, you have got to let people know.\u201d\n\nPreliminary results from a member survey by the American Staffing Association show that 46 percent of the temporary and recruiting firms that responded are considering such coverage for next year, said Edward Lenz, senior counsel for the trade group. The association\u2019s 1,600 members employ about 3 million workers.\n\n\u201cA number of significant firms have signed up for it,\u201d Lenz said. Some companies have implemented it as of Oct. 1, he added. He declined to identify them.\n\nHigher-paying employers that have traditionally provided major medical coverage aren\u2019t expected to sponsor insurance without hospitalization next year. But retailers, light manufacturers, restaurants, hotel chains and other low-wage employers also are keen on calculator-tested coverage without hospitalization, consultants said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many people are still interested,\u201d said Bruce Flunker, president of Wisconsin-based EBSO, a benefits firm. \u201cWe have two [plans] that are officially in place effective October 1. We have, I think, 26 proposals out right now for January 1 effective dates.\u201d\n\nAlthough the health-care law doesn\u2019t compel large employers to offer hospitalization and other \u201cessential health benefits\u201d required of plans sold to individuals and small employers, few expected the calculator to approve insurance without it. But it does, certifying plans that lack inpatient coverage but include outpatient benefits, such as doctor visits and emergency-room care.\n\nMany argue that the software is flawed, that Congress never intended for large companies to avoid the health-care law\u2019s \u201cemployer mandate\u201d penalties by offering insurance that doesn\u2019t pay for hospital care.\n\nOthers, especially consultants working with lower-wage employers, contend that the administration wanted to grant leeway to such companies that haven\u2019t historically offered major medical insurance.\n\nAlan Tawshunsky, a senior Treasury lawyer, told a legal conference that the calculator is under \u201cactive review,\u201d said Mark Holloway, a benefits lawyer for Lockton, a broker.\n\nAlthough Tawshunsky didn\u2019t elaborate, \u201cit seems pretty clear to me that the calculator will be changed\u201d to require hospital coverage, said Holloway, who was at the American Bar Association meeting where Tawshunsky spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of when\u201d \u2014 and whether \u201cany protection is given to employers who used the old calculator\u201d to design coverage for 2015, he said.\n\nLenz of the American Staffing Association has met with senior Treasury officials whom he declined to identify.\n\nAlthough the officials didn\u2019t spell out their next move, \u201cour strong sense is that they will issue guidance before the end of the year [that] will say that plans that don\u2019t offer hospitalization don\u2019t qualify as minimum value,\u201d Lenz said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ll be telling our members.\u201d\n\nIf that happens, industry officials will ask the administration to allow such insurance next year for employers that have committed to it \u2014 even if it is banned in subsequent years.\n\nBecause plan years typically begin in January, the Treasury is \u201cacutely aware of the timing issue,\u201d said Ives of Wells Fargo Insurance. \u201cThey know if they don\u2019t come out with something pretty damn quick, it\u2019s going to be more unfair to employers that have already implemented them.\u201d\n\nLynn Quincy, associate director of health reform policy for Consumers Union, called administration scrutiny of the calculator \u201cvery welcome news.\u201d But if policymakers temporarily let employers offer hospital-free coverage next year, she urged them to allow workers at those companies to obtain exchange subsidies to buy alternative insurance.\n\n\u201cThey should not be giving these employers any transitional relief if there is not also something to help their employees,\u201d she said.\n\nRevisiting the calculator would summon protests from the industry and could open the administration to new criticism about the health-care law\u2019s rollout right before an election.\n\n\u201cThe people from Treasury aren\u2019t stupid,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cThey realize this is a political hot potato. I think they\u2019re being deliberately tight-lipped about it. That kind of leaves everybody twisting in the wind.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "business, health care, health insurance, health care law, affordable care act, hospital insurance, obama administration", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Industry officials say the Obama administration is preparing to close loophole in the Affordable Care Act", "title": "Government close to closing loophole that lets employers offer substandard insurance", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/government-close-to-closing-loophole-that-lets-employers-offer-substandard-insurance/2014/10/16/b3dd3118-5549-11e4-809b-8cc0a295c773_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/government-close-to-closing-loophole-that-lets-employers-offer-substandard-insurance/2014/10/16/b3dd3118-5549-11e4-809b-8cc0a295c773_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "business, health care, health insurance, health care law, affordable care act, hospital insurance, obama administration", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "b3dd3118-5549-11e4-809b-8cc0a295c773", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Industry officials say the Obama administration is preparing to close loophole in the Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd799f\"", "article_summary": "Lenz of the American Staffing Association has met with senior Treasury officials whom he declined to identify.\nHigher-paying employers that have traditionally provided major medical coverage aren\u2019t expected to sponsor insurance without hospitalization next year.\nOffering minimum-value insurance at an affordable price would spare companies from fines of as much as $3,120 per worker next year.\nInsurance consultants were surprised recently to learn that Obama administration rules allow large companies to offer their employees 2015 health plans that don\u2019t include hospital benefits.\n\u201cMy best guess is that they will kill them,\u201d said Frasier Ives, a benefits lawyer for Wells Fargo Insurance who has talked to Treasury officials about the matter."}
