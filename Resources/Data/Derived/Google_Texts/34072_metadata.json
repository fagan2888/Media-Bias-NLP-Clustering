Tim Huelskamp says.\n\nThe pontiff will address a joint session of Congress on Sept. 24 as part of a three-day trip to the nation\u2019s capital before visiting New York and Philadelphia later that week.\n\n\u201cPeople across the country, including my constituents, are concerned,\u201d Huelskamp said. \u201cWe have almost unlimited abortion, attacks against the institution of marriage, destruction of the family structure. This is an important time for the Holy Father to make his first address to Congress.\u201d\n\nHuelskamp is a former altar boy and seminary student who ends his town hall meetings with a prayer request and leans heavily on his religious beliefs when citing his socially conservative political positions. The western Kansas congressman anticipates Pope Francis will speak about the Catholic Church\u2019s opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage during his visit.\n\n\u201cI hope the pope will talk about these unchanging eternal truths in our church,\u201d said Huelskamp, a Republican.\n\nSince beginning his papacy in March 2013, Pope Francis hasn\u2019t shied away from broadening his rhetorical horizons to weigh in on issues such as climate change and foreign policy. When asked if he expects Pope Francis to discuss the politically sensitive matters, Huelskamp said, \u201cHe is the Holy Father, that is up to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are folks like Nancy Pelosi, who does not qualify as Catholic but claims she is, who are hoping he talks about things like the environment,\u201d Huelskamp added. A request for comment from House Minority Leader Pelosi, D-Calif., wasn\u2019t answered last week.\n\nPope Francis\u2019 visit comes mere months before Dec. 8, the start of the Holy Year of Mercy, a jubilee year meant to bring attention to the mercy of God. The pope announced Tuesday that priests will be allowed to absolve of sin women who have had an abortion during the year, which ends in November 2016.\n\n\u201cI am well aware of the pressure that has led them to this decision,\u201d Pope Francis wrote in a letter announcing the change. \u201cI know that it is an existential and moral ordeal. \u201d\n\nThe Catholic Church considers abortion a grave sin that currently can only be absolved by senior church officials, not priests. While the pope\u2019s order raised eyebrows, Huelskamp said he understands it.\n\n\u201cThis is the Year of Mercy and there have been plenty of those,\u201d the congressman said. \u201cWe grieve for the unborn children and the damage it does, not only to the child, but to the mother, as well.\u201d\n\nThe day before his speech on Capitol Hill, Pope Francis will meet privately with President Barack Obama. Huelskamp predicts Obama \u201cwill get an earful\u201d from the pope about what Huelskamp claims are attacks on religious liberty, such as a contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI presume the president wants a photo op and will use the visit as he sees fit,\u201d Huelskamp said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to be Christian and yet supports unlimited abortion and the destruction of marriage.\u201d\n\nIn preparation for the pope\u2019s visit, Huelskamp read three papal documents this summer: Pope Francis\u2019 2015 encyclical on climate change, Pope Francis\u2019 2013 apostolic exhortation on church reform and a 1968 encyclical, \u201cHumanae Vitae,\u201d which affirms the church\u2019s opposition to contraception.\n\n\u201cThe common thread in them, the eternal thread, is the ultimate value of the individual,\u201d Huelskamp said.\n\nIn Pope Francis\u2019 encyclical on the environment, Huelskamp said he read of the responsibility Catholics have to care for the environment and people.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say you approve of one and not the other,\u201d the congressman said.\n\nPope Francis will become the fourth pope to visit the United States and the third to meet a U.S. president, but the first to speak before Congress. Recalling the discrimination Catholics have faced dating back centuries, Huelskamp said a papal address to Congress would have been unheard of just a few decades ago.\n\n\u201cIt will be a pretty exciting day,\u201d Huelskamp said. \u201cIt is a great time for him to come and address Congress.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, State, Justin Wingerter", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage and in the midst of a national debate over Planned Parenthood funding, Pope Francis has chosen an auspicious time to address Congress, U.S. Rep.
