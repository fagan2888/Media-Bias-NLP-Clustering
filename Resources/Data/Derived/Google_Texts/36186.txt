NEW CASTLE, Pa., Nov. 26 (UPI) â€” Pennsylvania environmental officials are trying to determine why an odor resembling cat urine has been lingering in a neighborhood for more than three weeks.

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection opened an investigation after residents said the odor first showed up strongly in the Mahoningtown area Oct. 31 and has lingered ever since with frequent spikes in potency.

Amanda Witman, information specialist for the DEP, said crews used a mobile analytical unit to take atmospheric samples Nov. 5 and 6 during odor events in two heavily affected areas, but the test results typically take several weeks to process.

Witman said officials are also waiting on test results from samples taken from the wastewater collection system.

Some residents said they are anxious to get answers from officials as they are concerned the odor or its cause could be a health hazard.
