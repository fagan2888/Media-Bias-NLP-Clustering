The percentage of Americans who say they have a ‘great deal’ of trust in the media’s ability to report the news “fully, accurately, and fairly” has dropped, now matching an all-time low of 40 percent.

Given the media’s liberal bias, it’s not surprising that trust among Republicans stands at just 27 percent; while among Democrats it’s at 54 percent.

Interestingly, though, the percentage of people who think the media is actually “too conservative” is up. Nineteen percent believe the news leans too far right, which is six points higher than in 2013.
