(Republican Eagle photos by Michael Brun)\n\nCANNON FALLS \u2014 As he reached the stairs leading down to Valley View Caf\u00e9 inside Mayo Clinic Health System in Cannon Falls last week, Dr. Tom Witt knew something was awry.\n\nWitt thought he would be meeting with the press to discuss health care, but to his surprise found a small crowd of friends and colleagues smiling up at him.\n\nThe family medicine physician and CEO of Mayo Clinic Health System in Cannon Falls, Lake City and Red Wing was presented the Goodhue County Editorial Association\u2019s 2014 Citizen of the Year award, the third time a doctor has been honored with the title in 50 years.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I worry about with things like this is they\u2019re usually an indication that you\u2019re getting older or at the end of your career,\u201d Witt said after accepting the award certificate, \u201cand I don\u2019t have any intention of slowing down any time soon.\u201d\n\nAlong with his work as a health provider and executive, Witt serves on the Mayo Clinic Health System in Menomonie Board of Trustees, chairs the Minnesota Hospital Association Physician Leadership Council and sits on the Minnesota Medical Association Policy Council.\n\nHis community involvement includes Rotary Club of Lake City and serving on the boards of the United Way of Goodhue, Wabasha and Pierce Counties and Red Wing Family YMCA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of him, he\u2019s worked hard,\u201d said Betsy Witt, Tom\u2019s wife. \u201cUnfortunately he\u2019ll probably just set the bar a little higher now. That\u2019s kind of how he operates.\u201d\n\nAlso there to celebrate the occasion were Witt\u2019s three adult children, Luke, Adam and Carolyn, who said they were told about the award about a week in advance.\n\n\u201cWe definitely wanted to be part of the surprise,\u201d Luke Witt said.\n\nHealth care vision\n\nWith several area journalists in attendance, talk soon turned to the health care discussion Witt originally expected, including comments on the impact of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe needed to do something about health care and paying for health care,\u201d Witt said. Though imperfect, he called the Affordable Care Act a \u201cstarting point\u201d to a national conversation on the subject.\n\nWitt said the future of the local health system will see a trend away from \u201cone patient, one physician relationships,\u201d and a return to making house calls.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to be the house calls with a doctor showing up in a buggy with a black bag,\u201d he added, but would instead involve a team of home care nurses and electronic tools to provide care outside of the traditional hospital setting.\n\nWitt studied medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School and completed his residency in North Dakota. Before joining Mayo Clinic Health System in 1997, he practiced in North Dakota, Washington and then Red Wing, where he was an Interstate Medical Center partner.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate to have him here, and I just hope he doesn\u2019t get a big head now that he\u2019s Citizen of the Year,\u201d said Bill Priest, chief administrative officer at Mayo Clinic Health System in Cannon Falls.\n\nAlong with being a good doctor, Priest said Witt has been a good guy to be around and personable in the five years they\u2019ve worked together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great journey in Cannon Falls and the rest of Goodhue County,\u201d Witt said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure to work with everyone here, and I look forward to all we can accomplish.\u201d\n\nPrevious citizens of the year\n\nThe Goodhue County Editorial Association honored Tom Witt as the 2014 citizen of the year.\n\nHe succeeded 2013 citizen Char Henn of Red Wing.
