A person was injured when a car smashed into a B-cycle station in the Five Points neighborhood early Saturday morning, authorities say.

The name of the driver, who was hospitalized with unknown injuries, was not released. The cycle station will be out of action indefinitely.

The accident happened near the corner of Welton and 27th streets at about 5 a.m. Eight bicycles and an eight-dock station were destroyed, a loss worth about $40,000, according to a news release by Denver B-cycle executive director Nick Bohnenkamp.

Denver Police are investigating the cause of the accident, Bohnenkamp said.

Denver B-cycle will work with the adjacent property owners and the city to restore service to the location as soon as possible, Bohnenkamp said.

B-cycle users are encouraged to access nearby B-station locations including 370 Park Ave. West, 3310 Arapahoe St., 2751 Larimer St., and 2501 Lawrence St.

“We are very grateful that nobody was checking out or returning a bicycle at the time or this could have been much worse,” Bohnenkamp said in a statement.

Denver B-cycle is presented by Founding Funder Kaiser Permanente in association with a variety of community sponsors. Denver B-cycle is owned and operated by Denver Bike Sharing, a charitable, non-profit organization.
