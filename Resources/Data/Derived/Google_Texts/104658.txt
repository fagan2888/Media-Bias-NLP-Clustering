Iman Crosson, the Obama impersonator who has produced hip-hop parodies on the life and times of the 44th president, is back to promote that which cannot be easily promoted: Obamacare.

Spoofing the artist formerly known as Snoop Dogg’s “Drop It Like It’s Hot,” Crosson, also known by his YouTube handle Alphacat, encourages the uninsured to take a look at the new health care law and “sign up ’cause it’s hot.” (As one YouTube user commented, “Yeah obamacare is hot……a hot mess!!!”)

Other lyrical flourishes in the video include:

So don’t stand and diddle, my healthcare’s the ‘shizzle’

It’s chock full of top notch healthcare ‘provizzles!’

We’ll cover all your ‘vizzles,’ your ‘dizzles’ AND your ‘tizzles’

Now while you figure that out, it’s back to that ‘chorizzle.’

Contrary to what you may think, these lyrics were not part of Warren Beatty’s “Big Money Rap” in the movie Bulworth. Also, careful with the izzle or your promo may just fizzle.

Plenty of YouTube commenters agreed, writing such things as, “what healthcare? mine is getting cancelled next year thanks to obamacare;” “This is hilarious, and I definitely enjoyed watching it! But no, I’m not signing up for Obamacare;” and “Lol its entertaining and funny but I’m not signing up for that high garbage.”

The video is part of the “Get Covered” campaign that has tapped numerous figures in the entertainment industry to help push sign-ups through the Obamacare exchanges.
