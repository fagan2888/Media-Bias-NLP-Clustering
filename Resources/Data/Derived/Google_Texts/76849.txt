Five weeks after retooling its primetime lineup, Fox News Channel continues to see growth. No doubt buoyed by off-year election coverage and the ongoing debate over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the cable network posted year highs last week.



Up from the previous week, the five-night run between Nov. 4 and Nov. 10 averaged 2.098 million viewers and 376,000 adults 25-54. Both numbers mark highs for the year, with the exception of April's massive surge during coverage of the bombings at the Boston Marathon.

It also marked the third week in a row that FNC ranked second in all of cable in primetime, shy of ESPN but ahead of USA Network.



MSNBC also saw a lift last week. The second-place cable news net averaged 716,000 viewers and 202,000 adults 25-54.



And coming off of a week of 14-month lows, CNN was also up a tick. The network averaged 433,000 viewers and 146,000 adults 25-54.
