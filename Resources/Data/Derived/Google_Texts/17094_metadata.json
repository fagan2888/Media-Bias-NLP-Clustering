To rise to this challenge, revenue cycle innovators are engaging patients as financial partners from hospital registration to bill collection, and every point in between.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s healthcare environment, everybody owes something for their healthcare, and this is a cultural shift,\u201d says Jane Berkebile, system vice president of revenue cycle for OhioHealth in Columbus. In the fiscal year ending June 2013, OhioHealth posted total revenue at $2.1 billion, with net income pegged at $348.7 million.\n\nThis cultural shift includes a patient learning curve laden with risk for healthcare providers, she says. \u201cVery few people budget for healthcare expenses. It usually comes as a surprise for them. \u2026 If someone has a health incident and they have a $10,000 deductible, that\u2019s a big shock to them.\u201d\n\nAs patients adapt to their heightened financial responsibilities, health systems and hospitals must reach out early and often to help make sure patients pay for as much of their bills as possible, Berkebile says. \u201cWe\u2019re more likely to get paid if there is at least an expectation that there is an out-of-pocket expense and we expect the patient to pay it.\u201d\n\nWhile rising to this bill-collection challenge, healthcare providers must avoid pressing their patients too hard, she says. \u201cWe walk a very fine line. \u2026 We don\u2019t want to be seen as having heavy-handed tactics. It\u2019s more a conversation.\u201d\n\nPoint-of-service collections\n\nA robust effort to engage patients as financial partners can generate impressive revenue cycle results, including higher point-of-service collections, lower bad debt, and less spending on financial assistance, Berkebile says.\n\nOhioHealth posted $22 million in POS cash collections at the health system\u2019s four central Ohio hospitals in 2015, she says. \u201cWe stress the need for communication with patients. We set targets. We track the dollars we collect.\u201d\n\nPOS cash collections have increased every year at OhioHealth since 2009, when the figure was $9 million, according to health system records.\n\nBerkebile says POS cash collection is a key focus for the training and education unit within OhioHealth\u2019s revenue cycle team. The training and education unit has about nine full-time staffers, and it provides instruction to revenue cycle team members and many employees outside the department who work with patients. \u201cIt is critical that all of our physician practices know the policies for registration, point-of-service collection, and messaging to the patient. The last thing you want someone to do is say, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about paying for that.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFinancial partnering with patients helps minimize bill-collection bad debt at OhioHealth, which tracks bad debt on a monthly basis. Bad debt accounts for less than 2% of gross patient revenue \u201cacross the whole organization,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cBad debt as a percentage of gross patient revenue is considered excellent if at or below 2% of gross patient revenue. Starting at a target of 2% of GPR, we have continued to whittle that down as we have made progress. As we bring on new facilities, our initial target is always 2% GPR.\u201d\n\nAssessing the propensity of patients to pay also helps to contain the budget line for financial assistance at OhioHealth, Berkebile says, noting many low-income patients benefit from the financial counseling services offered at the health system, such as Medicaid enrollment facilitation.\n\nIn Ohio, the expansion of Medi-caid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has been a boost for OhioHealth and the health system\u2019s low-income patients. \u201cThat\u2019s a benefit to the patient,\u201d she says of the access to medical services that comes with Medicaid enrollment, adding that the health system\u2019s \u201ccharity care has been cut roughly in half\u201d since Ohio expanded Medicaid to provide coverage to more low-income adults in January 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As patients adapt to their heightened financial responsibilities, health systems and hospitals must help make sure patients pay for as much of their bills as possible.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "keywords": "payers, cost, business, quality", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBad debt as a percentage of gross patient revenue is considered excellent if at or below 2% of gross patient revenue.\nPatient Engagement of the Financial KindAs patients adapt to their heightened financial responsibilities, health systems and hospitals must help make sure patients pay for as much of their bills as possible.\nBerkebile says POS cash collection is a key focus for the training and education unit within OhioHealth\u2019s revenue cycle team.\nBad debt accounts for less than 2% of gross patient revenue \u201cacross the whole organization,\u201d she says.\nTo rise to this challenge, revenue cycle innovators are engaging patients as financial partners from hospital registration to bill collection, and every point in between."}
