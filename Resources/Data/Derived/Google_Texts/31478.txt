NEW YORK — The happiest places on Earth are about to get a galactic upgrade.

Walt Disney said it would build two new Star Wars theme parks at both Disneyland and Walt Disney World.

The announcement was made Saturday at the company’s D23 Expo.

The themed-land expansion, at 14 acres each, will be Disney’s largest ever.

Star Wars fans will be treated to two main attractions: the chance to participate in an epic battle and control the Millennium Falcon on a special secret mission.

More information will be released on Saturday afternoon, Iger said.
