Kelly Ayotte supports shutting down the government in order to defund Planned Parenthood. She doesn\u2019t. The ad also exaggerates the potential impact of a shutdown.\n\nAyotte did vote in favor of a failed bill to defund Planned Parenthood, as the ad says. But she is on record saying that she does not support allowing a government shutdown to attempt to force that defunding.\n\nPlanned Parenthood launched the ad against Ayotte on Aug. 18 as part of a campaign that targets three other Republican senators who also voted for the bill to prohibit federal funding of Planned Parenthood \u2013 Sens. Ron Johnson, Rob Portman and Pat Toomey. They have not publicly taken a position on a shutdown.\n\nThe ad features several people raising questions about the effects of a shutdown on services such as veterans benefits, Social Security, Medicare, Head Start and small-business loans. While it\u2019s true that a government shutdown would likely affect some people who access or are trying to access these programs \u2014 at least based on the last shutdown in 2013 \u2014 most of the programs listed would largely continue to operate as they do now.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare payments, for example, would continue to be made, and veterans hospitals would remain open.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has been under increased scrutiny recently due to undercover videos that showed Planned Parenthood officials talking about the procedures for collecting fetal tissue for research and the fees they charge tissue procurement companies. That has led to a renewed push by some Republicans to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe ads all have the same script, but are personalized for the candidate being targeted. Here\u2019s the opening of the one targeting Ayotte in New Hampshire:\n\nPlanned Parenthood ad: First Kelly Ayotte voted to defund Planned Parenthood, risking health care for millions of women. Now Republicans want to shut down the government to block funding for Planned Parenthood. What would a shutdown mean for New Hampshire?\n\nThe ad then cuts to an elderly man in a wheelchair who asks, \u201cWill anyone be there to process my veterans benefits?\u201d An elderly woman then asks, \u201cWhat will that do to Social Security and Medicare?\u201d A woman holding a toddler asks, \u201cWill I be able to get my daughter into Head Start?\u201d And finally, a woman asks, \u201cWhat about small-business loans?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that all four senators voted on Aug. 3 in favor of a bill that sought to prohibit federal funding of Planned Parenthood. Johnson, Portman and Toomey were also cosponsors of the bill, which failed to get the 60 votes needed to move forward (the vote was 53-46).\n\nAs for whether that vote risked \u201chealth care for millions of women,\u201d that is a matter of political debate. Ayotte\u2019s office says any federal funds taken from Planned Parenthood would be \u201credirected to local community health centers that provide services such as cancer screenings, mammograms and contraceptives.\u201d Planned Parenthood officials say its clinics serve many rural and under-served areas where there are no other health center alternatives. And, they say, many alternative community health centers are not equipped to handle the influx of women now served by Planned Parenthood.\n\nRepublicans on a Shutdown\n\nAfter highlighting the failed vote to defund Planned Parenthood, the ad\u2019s narrator says Republicans are considering a new strategy. \u201cNow Republicans want to shut down the government to block funding for Planned Parenthood,\u201d the ad says. The ad against Ayotte ends with: \u201cTell Sen. Ayotte: Stand up for Planned Parenthood health care \u2014 not a government shutdown.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true there are some in the Republican Party willing to risk a government shutdown over the issue. On July 29, 18 House Republicans wrote a letter to House leadership saying they \u201ccannot and will not support any funding resolution \u2014 an appropriations bill, an omnibus package, a continuing resolution, or otherwise \u2014 that contains any funding for Planned Parenthood.\u201d There are some in the Senate who have voiced similar sentiments, including presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nSpecifically not in that camp, however, is Ayotte.\n\nFrom the New York Times on July 3o:\n\nNew York Times, July 30: \u201cI\u2019m going to want to make sure that we keep the government funded,\u201d said Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, who would like Congress to cut off Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding, but not by holding hostage appropriations that keep the government\u2019s lights on.\n\nAn Aug. 4 Bloomberg article about the possibility of a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood had this to say about Ayotte\u2019s position:\n\nBloomberg, Aug. 4: New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte called for a \u201cresponsible\u201d agreement to fund the government given that 60 votes are required in the Senate, adding: \u201cI think that we should ensure that we do not have a government shutdown.\u201d\n\nAnother target of the ads, Portman, said this:\n\nThe Hill, Aug. 3: Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), another incumbent facing reelection next year, said he\u2019s \u201cfor defunding,\u201d and then said \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody is talking about shutting down the government, but we want to defund Planned Parenthood, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nJohnson was even more noncommittal. When asked if he would shut down the government over the Planned Parenthood funding, Johnson told The Hill: \u201cThat would be a hypothetical question. I\u2019m not going to answer it.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Toomey said he \u201cthinks we should fund women\u2019s health programs through organizations that do not hold Planned Parenthood\u2019s outrageous disregard for human life.\u201d However, Toomey has not publicly taken a position on whether he would support a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nMore broadly, the ad implies there is greater consensus among Republicans about a shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding than actually exists. In fact, the very article cited in the Planned Parenthood ad \u2014 an Aug. 4 article in the Christian Science Monitor headlined, \u201cWill Republicans shut down the government over Planned Parenthood?\u201d \u2014 carries a subhead that says while the idea has been floated by some Republicans, it \u201chas few advocates.\u201d According to the article: \u201cMuch of the Republican party \u2026 has been quick to emphasize that a government shutdown is neither likely nor desirable.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, for one, has vowed that the issue would not lead to a government shutdown this fall.\n\n\n\nThe Effects of a Shutdown\n\nNonetheless, the ad hints at the possibility of disastrous problems should the government shut down. The potential problems from a shutdown are posed as vague questions, rather than declarative statements. But the consequences of a shutdown are far less dire than the questions posed by the people in the ad imply.\n\nFor example, one elderly woman asks, \u201cWhat will [a shutdown] do to Social Security and Medicare?\u201d Based on the experience of the federal government shutdown in 2013, the answer for her is, \u201cProbably nothing.\u201d\n\nThe federal shutdown in 2013 stretched from Oct. 1 through Oct. 16, largely over the issue of whether to defund implementation of parts of the Affordable Care Act. The shutdown resulted in some 800,000 federal employees being furloughed, and caused substantial disruption to many federal services.\n\nBut Social Security and Medicare are part of mandatory funding streams, funded outside the regular appropriations bills. And so Social Security payments continued to be made. In fact, during the second week of the shutdown, more than 8,000 furloughed workers were recalled to ensure the prompt payment of benefits. But there were some who were affected. For example, in an analysis of the effects of the 2013 shutdown, the White House Office of Management and Budget noted that the Social Security Administration suspended the issuance of new Social Security cards, and could not verify existing numbers, affecting thousands seeking jobs or loans.\n\nIn the ad, a man in a wheelchair asks, \u201cWill anyone be there to process my veterans benefits?\u201d During the 2013 shutdown, veterans hospitals remained open, but Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki told Congress that a discontinuance of overtime during the shutdown slowed its review of benefit claims, meaning that \u201cwe are no longer making the significant gains we have made in recent months toward eliminating the backlog in claims.\u201d\n\nAs for the woman in the ad who worries whether she will be able to get her daughter into Head Start, the OMB noted that the two-week shutdown in 2013 \u201cforced Head Start grantees serving nearly 6,300 children to close their centers for up to nine days (before re-opening with the help of private philanthropists or their state).\u201d That\u2019s a real disruption, but to put it into context, there was a funded enrollment of nearly 904,000 in Head Start that year.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of 1,600 Head Start programs continued to operate through the government shutdown, a spokesman for the Administration for Children and Families told us via email. However, of those 1,600 programs, the grants for 23 of them were due for new funding on Oct. 1, while the government was shut down. Seven of these grantees were not able to operate during the shutdown, while 16 operated through interim funds provided by private donors.\n\nIn other words, there were some disruptions to the programs highlighted in the ads, but by and large those programs continued to operate normally.\n\nPlanned Parenthood can legitimately warn of the (slim) possibility of a government shutdown by those who oppose funding the group \u2014 some Republicans indeed support such action. But not Ayotte. And the ad\u2019s images of seniors questioning what will happen to their Social Security and Medicare imply a far more dire consequence than most seniors would face.\n\n\u2014 Robert Farley", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a22\"", "article_summary": "A Planned Parenthood ad wrongly implies that New Hampshire Sen.
