World Affairs Council President James Falk moderated the forum.\n\nCarson, a retired neurosurgeon best known for his work in separating twins conjoined at the head, likened the U.S. role in foreign policy to a \u201cthird grade classroom.\u201d He criticized the White House\u2019s role overseas, specifically the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq.\n\n\u201cWe had essentially won that war, and we gave it away,\u201d Carson said of the withdrawal.\n\nCarson called the Islamic State terrorist group an \u201cincredible threat to us\u201d and noted a recent rise of cyber attacks from China and North Korea on the U.S. He said such attacks should be combated with aggressive strategy that can quickly disable opponents while also offering time to repair any damage.\n\nCarson\u2019s view toward the Affordable Care Act remained negative, and he reaffirmed his belief in the implementation of health savings accounts for every citizen from birth until death as a possible solution to his critiques of the ACA. Though his proposal did not offer specific details regarding how the accounts would function, he noted that more personal responsibility rather than dependence on the government is key to an empowered nation.\n\nAccording to a national Quinnipiac University poll released today, Carson is one of five Republican candidates leading the GOP race with polling at 10 percent. He is ranked with Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a native Texan, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNS9iZW4tY2Fyc29uLWZvY3VzZXMtb24tYWNhLWZvcmVpZ24tYWZmYWlycy1pbi1kYWxsYXMtdmlzaXQuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Danielle Grobmeier", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson addressed dozens of guests at a World Affairs Council breakfast forum at the Rosewood Crescent Hotel in Dallas on Thursday morning.
