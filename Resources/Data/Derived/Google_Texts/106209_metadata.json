At least with McCain, conservatives knew we were getting an open borders zealot and just made the calculation that he could win. Rubio has half the conservative movement thinking he\u2019s Reagan. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. He\u2019s McCain without the war record or experience.\u201d\n\nIn a 15-page memo documenting Rubio\u2019s \u201cbetrayal\u201d of conservatives, living legend and grassroots heroine Phyllis Schlafly seemed to echo Coulter\u2019s assertion. Schlafly\u2019s memo states:\n\nThere is no single major distinguishing policy difference between Marco Rubio, John McCain or Lindsey Graham. They have the same trade policy, immigration policy and foreign policy. But on immigration most especially \u2014 the issue in which all four have invested the most \u2014 there is no daylight separating them. The difference, then, is one of persona, not policy. And in the arena of immigration, this translates into a vital difference. The biggest change from McCain-Kennedy, which could not get out of the Senate, and the Gang of Eight \u2014 which was nursed along by conservative pundits despite being to the left of Kennedy\u2019s bill \u2014 was the presence of Rubio. Rubio created the conditions necessary to produce a considerably more open borders bill: conservatives who were invested in the Rubio Brand provided no early pushback but accepted Kennedy\u2019s old talking points, and Rubio gave red state Democrats the political space necessary to support it. This is how it got 68 votes in the Senate. The stakes of course are raised considerably if Rubio is President or Vice President. Rubio would have a much, much better chance than Obama of getting an open borders bill through Congress\u2026 there is likely no person in the United States of America in a better position to enact mass immigration legislation than a President Rubio\u2026 Rubio is the candidate of open borders, Obamatrade and mass immigration, making one last attempt to pull off one big con.\n\nIn her memo, Schlafly documented Rubio\u2019s history of successfully deceiving conservatives. Schlalfy notes that Rubio, without any seeming compunction, \u201crepeatedly lied\u201d to conservative media and opinion makers who trusted him: \u201cHis deceptions about his immigration bill rivaled and exceeded Obama\u2019s claims about disastrous Obamacare.\u201d\n\nSchlafly\u2019s memo continues:\n\nThe seminal moment of the media tour occurred early, on Rush Limbaugh\u2019s show. He [Rubio] declared: \u201cIf there is not language in this bill that guarantees that nothing else will happen unless these enforcement mechanisms are in place, I won\u2019t support it.\u201d Of course, we know there wasn\u2019t any such language but he voted for it anyway. But this promise \u2014 and many others \u2014 and the calculated neutralization of conservative media, helped Schumer get 68 votes. But conservatives trusted Rubio. Limbaugh declared: \u2018you are meeting everybody honestly.\u2019 Rubio told [Sean] Hannity, on his media tour that: \u201cI don\u2019t think any of that [amnesty] begins until we certify that the border security progress has been real. That a workplace enforcement mechanism is in place. That we are tracking visitors to our country, especially when they exit.\u201d This prompted Hannity to reply: \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most thoughtful bill that I have heard heretofore.\u201d At this point, it looked like the biggest mass immigration plan in history would breeze through Congress \u2014 all without Rubio saying a word about what was really in the heart of the bill: the largest immigration expansion in American history. To this day, Rubio will not answer if asked about how many green cards his bill gave out.\u201d\n\nLike Coulter, Schlafly has previously warned that if immigration is not stopped: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be America anymore.\u201d\n\nIf we don\u2019t stop immigration\u2014this torrent of immigrants coming in\u2014we\u2019re not going to be America anymore because most of the people coming in have no experience with limited government. They don\u2019t know what that is. They look to the government to solve all of their problems, and as soon as we have a high majority of people who think that, it\u2019s going to be a different country.\n\nTo this day, Rubio continues to support giving citizenship to illegal immigrants, substantially expanding visa issuances for foreign guest workers, increasing refugee resettlement, and surging immigration beyond all known historical precedent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "EXCLUSIVE -- Ann Coulter Warns 'End of America' If Marco Rubio Is Nominee", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "EXCLUSIVE -- Ann Coulter Warns 'End of America' If Marco Rubio Is Nominee", "title": "EXCLUSIVE - Ann Coulter Warns 'End of America' If Marco Rubio Is Nominee - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Rubio-and-Gang-of-Eight-AP-Photo.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/06/exclusive-ann-coulter-warns-end-of-america-if-marco-rubio-is-nominee/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "EXCLUSIVE -- Ann Coulter Warns 'End of America' If Marco Rubio Is Nominee", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Rubio-and-Gang-of-Eight-AP-Photo.jpg", "title": "EXCLUSIVE - Ann Coulter Warns 'End of America' If Marco Rubio Is Nominee - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Ann Coulter, gang of eight, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, obamacare, Phyllis Schlafly, Rush Limbaugh, Schumer, Sean Hannity,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Immigration,Marco Rubio", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Sean Hannity", "published_time": "2016-02-06T11:55:45-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b7f\"", "article_summary": "They have the same trade policy, immigration policy and foreign policy.\nBut this promise \u2014 and many others \u2014 and the calculated neutralization of conservative media, helped Schumer get 68 votes.\nAt least with McCain, conservatives knew we were getting an open borders zealot and just made the calculation that he could win.\nSchlafly\u2019s memo states:There is no single major distinguishing policy difference between Marco Rubio, John McCain or Lindsey Graham.\nRubio created the conditions necessary to produce a considerably more open borders bill: conservatives who were invested in the Rubio Brand provided no early pushback but accepted Kennedy\u2019s old talking points, and Rubio gave red state Democrats the political space necessary to support it."}
