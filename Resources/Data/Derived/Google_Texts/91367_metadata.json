The annual directory will appear in the Dec. 11 issue of Frontiers magazine and in a special section of FrontiersMedia.com.\n\nIt seeks to answer ongoing questions that our readers face. Until now, knowledge of places and providers where patients can be safe\u2014and get the best advice on health care decisions from an LGBT perspective\u2014has been a matter of word of mouth. Now Frontiers readers and health care providers alike have a way to find each other both in the published print edition and the digital version, which will be updated throughout the year.\n\nIn addition to the Gay-Friendly Doctors List and hospital assessments, we\u2019ll look into other aspects of LGBT life and health care needs, such as senior services and mental health. Special care will be paid to HIV/AIDS services, from obtaining the best care possible to the latest advice on PrEP and even the sometimes perplexing problem of finding a dentist while HIV-positive. Of course, we\u2019ll also give advice on navigating Obamacare.\n\nThe data will be authoritative, and contributions from members of the community will keep it real.\n\nPlease join us in this final phase of the special issue\u2019s creation. Suggestions and anecdotes from readers are welcome at editorial@frontiersmedia.com.\n\nPress inquiries please contact Owen Phillips at o.phillips@frontiersmedia.com\n\nAdvertising inquires should go to sales@frontiersmedia.com or call 323-304-1499.\n\nAbout Frontiers Media:\n\nFrontiers is the 21st century\u2019s LGBT media company, spanning digital, mobile, print and television.
