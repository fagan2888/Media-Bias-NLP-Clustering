Healthcare.gov has been subjected to \u201cend-to-end security testing and passed with flying colors.\u201d\n\nNot so fast, conservative media responded.\n\nThe Daily Caller , the Washington Times , Fox News, and others pointed to David Kennedy, the head of a head of computer security consulting firm, who reportedly claimed he could use a standard web browser to access 70,000 personal records belonging to consumers who enrolled through the ACA system \u2013 after just four minutes of effort.\n\nWell, that certainly sounds alarming, doesn\u2019t it? And it\u2019s not as if conservative media has ever steered anyone wrong when it comes to \u201cObamacare,\u201d right?\n\nAfter all, here\u2019s a computer security consulting expert, recently a star witness in a hearing organized by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who exposed a critical flaw in healthcare.gov.\n\nExcept, that\u2019s not quite what happened, and those reports from conservative media painted a deeply bogus picture.\n\nThe Washington Post \u2019s Brian Fung discovered , \u201c[I]t turned out the reports were nothing more than simple confusion.\u201d Washington Post\n\n\u201cWe never accessed 70,000 records nor is it directly on the Healthcare.gov website,\u201d wrote Kennedy in an update to an earlier blog post. \u201cNo dumping of data, malicious intent, hacking, or even viewing of the information was done.\u201d In short, Kennedy explained that he used basic Google tools to search the Web site, but he didn\u2019t hack it. Some media reports, however, latched onto this line in his original post: \u201cThe 70,000 mark of information disclosure being reported was through using a basic Google search terms and browsing through a web browser\u201d and assumed Kennedy had been able to access 70,000 records.\n\nOK, but if Kennedy didn\u2019t access 70,000 personal records, as conservative media claimed, what did he access? There were 70,000 results of what, exactly? As best as I can tell, he hasn\u2019t elaborated on this point, except to say , \u201cWe do not support the statements from the news organizations.\u201d\n\nIn defense of the conservative media outlets that got this story very wrong, some of their confusion is understandable. Consider this exchange between Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace and David Kennedy over the weekend:\n\nWALLACE: You say you did not hack the site and, yet, you say you could access 70,000 records of various people who have signed up for health care under \u2013 at the website within four minutes. How do you know that if you haven\u2019t hacked the site? KENNEDY: That\u2019s a great question. There is a technique called \u2013 what we call passer reconnaissance, which allows us to queering look at how the website operates and performs. And these type of attacks that, you know, I\u2019m mentioning here in the 70,000 that you\u2019re referencing is very easy to do.\n\nHearing this, it\u2019s easy to see how someone might get the impression that Kennedy was able to access 70,000 personal records, since that\u2019s what Wallace asked and Kennedy didn\u2019t correct him.\n\nThat said \u2013 and this is the point conservatives still struggle to understand \u2013 even if healthcare.gov were somehow hacked, the hackers couldn\u2019t gain access to private medical records. Why not? Because there are no private medical records stored on healthcare.gov.
