You have to make that play to give us a chance to win.\u201d\n\nThe ninth inning unfolded in ominous fashion.\n\nTrailing 5-4, San Diego\u2019s Derek Norris greeted Kahnle (0-1) with a double into the left-field corner and pinch-hitter Cory Spangenberg reached on an infield hit after a replay review showed he had beaten the throw to first. Next, Melvin Upton Jr. hit a dribbler in front of the plate that Hundley fielded, but he rushed his throw high above first baseman Ben Paulsen\u2019s head, allowing Norris to score the tying run from third.\n\nPinch-hitter Brett Wallace followed with a tiebreaking RBI single, and Yangervis Solarte added a sacrifice fly.\n\nThe loss was the Rockies\u2019 sixth straight and extended their losing streak against the Padres to seven games. It was the fifth time this season the Rockies lost when leading after eight innings.\n\n\u201cLosing games late always is frustrating,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cJohnny (Gray) gave us a nice start, but we couldn\u2019t keep the lead.\u201d\n\nThe Padres tagged Kahnle for three runs (two earned) on three hits. Is the pressure of being the closer affecting Kahnle?\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the type of makeup that he\u2019s not really affected by the situation. The last couple of games, he\u2019s had a lot of deep counts and lacked command. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s affected by the situation.\u201d\n\nMaking his third major-league start, Gray threw five impressive innings.\n\nThe 23-year-old rookie right-hander, on whom the franchise is pinning its future, allowed one run on four hits. He struck out five and didn\u2019t walk a batter.\n\nThe Padres touched him for one run in the first, combining a leadoff single by Solarte, a single by Yonder Alonso and a sacrifice fly by Matt Kemp. From that point, Gray allowed only two hits and was never in trouble.\n\nFollowing the Rockies\u2019 blueprint to the letter, Weiss took Gray out after he had thrown just 69 pitches, 50 for strikes.\n\nAsked before the game if he had much wiggle room regarding how long he keeps Gray on the mound, Weiss answered: \u201cNo, there are pretty specific parameters in place when he takes the mound. There may be a little bit of wiggle room, but we aren\u2019t going to mess a whole lot with those parameters.\u201d\n\nStill, Gray said he was surprised to be pulled so early.\n\n\u201cI was sure I would pitch one more (inning), so I was ready to go,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI understand, so I wouldn\u2019t say I am complaining or anything, but the competitive side of me wants to go out there and finish.\u201d\n\nGray wasn\u2019t quite as overpowering as he was in New York on Monday, when he allowed the Mets just one run on one hit over six innings. But Gray\u2019s versatility was impressive. Under the guidance of Hundley, he mixed and matched his fastball with an effective changeup and a killer slider.\n\nFor example, Gray ended the third by striking out Kemp with an 89 mph slider. He opened the fourth by whiffing Justin Upton with an 87 mph changeup.\n\n\u201cStarting out the game, I really didn\u2019t have that great stuff, so I went to my secondary stuff and tried to get some bad contact,\u201d Gray said\n\nGray\u2019s fastball velocity heated up as the game went on. He opened the game throwing 93 to 94 mph and then turned up the heat to 98 by his final inning.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take Rockies reliever Gonzalez Germen long to undo all the good that Gray had done. In the sixth, the Padres quickly tagged German for three runs on three hits, a walk and a wild pitch to take a 4-3 lead. Jedd Gyorko\u2019s two-run double was the key hit.\n\nColorado recaptured the lead, 5-4, in the sixth on a sacrifice fly by Ben Paulsen and a run-scoring single by Hundley, who went 3-for-4 and is now batting .448 (13-for-20) in eight games against the Padres, his former club.\n\nColorado took a short-lived 3-1 lead in the third against San Diego starter Andrew Cashner on Nolan Arenado\u2019s two-run single to score Gray and Jose Reyes.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jon Gray impressive again, but Rockies lose as Padres rally in ninth", "title": "Jon Gray impressive again, but Rockies lose as Padres rally in ninth", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/15/jon-gray-impressive-again-but-rockies-lose-as-padres-rally-in-ninth/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150815__jon-grayp1-3.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150815__jon-grayp1-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-15T21:36:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T12:33:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Following the Rockies\u2019 blueprint to the letter, Weiss took Gray out after he had thrown just 69 pitches, 50 for strikes.\nThe loss was the Rockies\u2019 sixth straight and extended their losing streak against the Padres to seven games.\nBut I don\u2019t think he\u2019s affected by the situation.\u201dMaking his third major-league start, Gray threw five impressive innings.\nYou have to make that play to give us a chance to win.\u201dThe ninth inning unfolded in ominous fashion.\nIt didn\u2019t take Rockies reliever Gonzalez Germen long to undo all the good that Gray had done."}
