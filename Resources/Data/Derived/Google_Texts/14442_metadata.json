They do many, many things.\"\n\nPelosi told Demeter she doesn't think the NSA violates Constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable search and seizure and that it performs necessary functions, but should be subjected to scrutiny.\n\n\"From 9-11 on, the Bush administration went too far on all of these things,\" said Pelosi.\n\nWebsites including Infowars and Glenn Beck's The Blaze have featured it and Fox News has requested an interview with him.\n\nDemeter - a self-described Libertarian and \"youth activist\" - said he thought Pelosi displayed hypocrisy by saying she opposed Bush administration surveillance programs but wouldn't vote to defund them now that the Democratic party has \"amped it up to a higher level than ever before.\"\n\n\"I think there are more reasonable ways to catch illusory terrorists than ubiquitously collecting the data of Americans and not targeting specific people,\" Demeter told The Plain Dealer.\n\nThe junior at Notre Dame Cathedral Latin High School in Chardon said his group of C-SPAN award winners was originally supposed to meet with House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, and he had hoped to grill Reid about Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy's dispute with the federal government. Instead the group got to meet with Pelosi. Demeter also had a 30-second meeting with Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman which he described as \"a quick PR picture\" that \"wasn't all that interesting.\"\n\nBecause the memory in his cell-phone ran out halfway through Demeter's questioning of Pelosi, Demeter sought footage from C-SPAN to complete his piece. Demeter said the network was originally reluctant to provide it because it was only supposed to record without audio during the Pelosi meeting.\n\nDemeter said he has only received about $5 in Bitcoin contributions from viewers of the video and nothing from PayPal. He said he is getting minimal revenue from the ads that YouTube is running with his video, and he does not control which ads run.\n\nThis afternoon, an ad from the conservative Club for Growth that criticizes Alaska Democratic Sen. Mark Begich for parroting President Obama's claims about the Affordable Care Act was running with Demeter's video.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "andrew-demeter,nancy-pelosi", "title": "Concord Township teen's Nancy Pelosi interview on NSA data collection goes viral (video)", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Concord Township teen\\u0027s Nancy Pelosi interview on NSA data collection goes viral (video)\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/06/concord_township_teens_nancy_p.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/open_impact/photo/15121033-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13104408\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-06-04T17:37:21Z\", \"author\": \"Sabrina Eaton, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Correspondent\", \"tags\": [\"andrew-demeter\",\"nancy-pelosi\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/open_impact/photo/15121033-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@sabrinaeaton", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Sixteen-year-old video maker Andrew Demeter of Concord Township kept his cell phone camera running when he visited the nation's Capitol a few weeks ago to collect a video making award from C-SPAN."}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, June 04, 2014,  4:30 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/open_impact/photo/demeterpelosijpg-ee66f7095ea58674.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"seaton\", \"author_nickname\": \"Sabrina Eaton, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Correspondent\", \"author_id\": \"4754\", \"source_blog_name\": \"OPEN: Ohio Politics\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "Sixteen-year-old video maker Andrew Demeter of Concord Township kept his cell phone camera running when he visited the nation's Capitol a few weeks ago to collect a video making award from C-SPAN.", "title": "Concord Township teen's Nancy Pelosi interview on NSA data collection goes viral (video)", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/06/concord_township_teens_nancy_p.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, June 04, 2014,  1:35 PM", "article_author": "Sabrina Eaton, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Correspondent", "Description": "Sixteen-year-old video maker Andrew Demeter of Concord Township kept his cell phone camera running when he visited the nation's Capitol a few weeks ago to collect a video making award from C-SPAN."}, "article_summary": "Because the memory in his cell-phone ran out halfway through Demeter's questioning of Pelosi, Demeter sought footage from C-SPAN to complete his piece.\nThe video begins with Demeter asking Pelosi why she supports the NSA's \"illegal and ubiquitous data collection.\"\nDemeter said he has only received about $5 in Bitcoin contributions from viewers of the video and nothing from PayPal.\n\"You did vote for a bill to continue funding for the NSA though,\" Demeter continued.\nHe said he is getting minimal revenue from the ads that YouTube is running with his video, and he does not control which ads run."}
