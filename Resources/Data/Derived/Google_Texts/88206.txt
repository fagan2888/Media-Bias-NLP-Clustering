Why all this circumstance?

Why does pomp fill the air,

With you in tasseled cap,

In a gown, in that chair?

Why the proud, bubbly crowds

'Ticipating? Here's why:

It's your day for hello,

Grads, your day for goodbye.

You clutch festooned parchment.

Very soon you will find

That it's much like a key;

That's just how it's designed.

Today is a finish

Where a part of you ends.

But much more than that, it's

Where tomorrow begins.

Tomorrow! Now that is

A thing worth pursuing,

A day you've prepared for,

To do things worth doing.

But first you must know

How you found this bright door,

Eyes set on horizons

And tomorrows galore.

You were ushered, of course,

By those wiser than you

Who watched all along

And thought, "Oh, what she'll do!"

They pushed and cajoled

And held just the right sway.

They wound up your spring

Then stepped out of your way.

And when those dear sages

Saw you stray from the path,

They would walk alongside

And apply mentor math.

They laid out before you

ev'ry minus and plus,

And said, "Which do you want?

"Do you want this, or thus?"

They knew that when taught

About life's complications,

When faced with the facts

You'd make wise calculations.

Oh, you ciphered quite well

And you spelled and you charted.

Then it struck you one day ...

"This is not where I started!"

That's just what they wanted,

Those parents, those teachers,

Those people who love you,

Who now fill the bleachers.

For that paper you hold

Isn't worth much, now, innit,

If you don't comprehend

All the heart that went in it?

That's what makes it a key â€”

And a door and a car

And a rocketship bound

For bright places afar.

Set your eyes on the stars

And remember: It's found

Even rocketing rockets

Have to start on the ground.
