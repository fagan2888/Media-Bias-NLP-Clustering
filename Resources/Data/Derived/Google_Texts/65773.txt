He doesn’t have the name recognition of Texas Sen. John Cornyn’s other GOP primary challenger, Rep. Steve Stockman, but if Dwayne Stovall keeps releasing ads as deliciously shoddy and amateurish as “Turtle Soup,” his recent broadside against Cornyn and Cornyn’s superior in the Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, it may not be long until Stockman is replaced as every lefty’s favorite Tea Partyer.

Stovall leads off the ad by lecturing Cornyn: “As a U.S. senator from Texas, you vote for Texans,” Stovall says, while sitting on the back of a pickup truck, dog and rifle shotgun by his side. “You don’t stab her in the back by voting for cloture on Obamacare,” Stovall continues. “You don’t enslave its children with unconstitutional laws and overwhelming debt.”

“And you certainly don’t do all this to please some guy that looks and fights like a turtle,” Stovall says, as the screen switches to a very cheap-looking side-by-side comparison of McConnell and a cartoon turtle.
