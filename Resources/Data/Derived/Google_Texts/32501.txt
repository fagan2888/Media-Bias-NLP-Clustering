Welcome to our feature highlighting the numerous Colorado tech companies that make cool stuff. These little snippets are intended for readers to explore the technology being made right here. One company at a time, of course.

System76

The hardcore geeks at System76 aren’t just building computers off Denver’s 16th Street Mall. They’re building Linux computers. More specifically, Ubuntu computers. Yup, no Windows here. Who uses this open-source operating system? Not many . But there’s enough business to keep this 14-person company kicking — it ships to 55 countries and “provides lifetime (human) support to about 25,000 customers.” In fact, customers are so appreciative, they are making fan videos to prove their dedication (Well, System76 is running an amusing Superfan contest ). Ubuntu’s appeal is that it’s open source (read: it’s free ) and simpler to use than you’d think because it’s a distribution, a.k.a. distro , of Linux. While not all consumer software works with Linux, there’s a whole realm of tools (also free), such as Libre Office and Gimp for photo editing . The appeal of System76? It just may break the myth that Linux is only for hardcore geeks.
