And advocates say the CareFirst rider will make it difficult to evaluate any future surpluses because it requires a tri-jurisdictional agreement that includes Maryland and Virginia to do so.\n\nThe District\u2019s non-voting representative to Congress, Del. Eleanor Holmes-Norton (D), said that the rider effectively renders the 2009 law \u201cgone.\u201d But she said that as far as she was concerned, it\u2019s not as bad for the city as it could have been because it will only affect future surpluses, not the $56 million that the company is already required to spend down.\n\nKeeping that on the table was a \u201creal victory for D.C.,\u201d she said.\n\nA number of members of Congress from Maryland and Virginia opposed the District\u2019s surplus spending, arguing that spending down the surplus funds would interfere with the Affordable Care Act, Holmes-Norton said. She attributed that view to lobbying efforts by CareFirst, but she would not name the specific representatives or senators who backed the rider, saying there was no single advocate for it.\n\nWalter Smith, executive director of the D.C. Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, the nonprofit that led the fight to get city access to CareFirst surplus dollars, said the $56 million has yet to be spent, but that it would be.\n\n\u201cThe excess surplus that was determined last December must still be spent down, and will be spent down, and nothing in today\u2019s rider changes that,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CareFirst rider requires Maryland, Virginia and D.C. agreement on future surplus amounts.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "CareFirst rider requires Maryland, Virginia and D.C. agreement on future surplus amounts.", "title": "Congressional spending bill curtails D.C. victory on using health surplus", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/congressional-spending-package-rolls-back-dc-health-spending-victory/2015/12/17/aff96364-a435-11e5-9c4e-be37f66848bb_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/12/17/Local-Politics/Images/13th_Amendment_Commemoration-0c09a-649.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ahauslohner"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "aff96364-a435-11e5-9c4e-be37f66848bb"}, "article_summary": "A number of members of Congress from Maryland and Virginia opposed the District\u2019s surplus spending, arguing that spending down the surplus funds would interfere with the Affordable Care Act, Holmes-Norton said.\nAnd advocates say the CareFirst rider will make it difficult to evaluate any future surpluses because it requires a tri-jurisdictional agreement that includes Maryland and Virginia to do so.\nThe $1.1 trillion spending bill approved by congressional leaders early Wednesday morning includes a rider that District advocates say marks a strike against home rule.\nThe rider, which appears on Page 603 of the bill, creates a significant obstacle to the District\u2019s ability to assess and spend excess surplus dollars collected by the Washington region\u2019s largest health insurer.\n\u201cThe excess surplus that was determined last December must still be spent down, and will be spent down, and nothing in today\u2019s rider changes that,\u201d he said."}
