While Jon Stewart always appeared to be playing some version of himself on camera, Colbert was famously a parody of the O\u2019Reilly/Hannity/Beck ego-driven talking head show that Fox made an art form in the early 2000s. The question was, who exactly had CBS hired to replace the venerable Letterman?\n\nNow, in the third week of his run, and following his most high-profile guest to date -- presidential candidate and GOP frontrunner Donald Trump -- the question still remains: Who exactly has CBS hired to host its late night institution?\n\nIn the buildup to his first episode, Colbert, in an effort to assuage nervous CBS execs that he would alienate apolitical or right-leaning viewers, issued statements about the ways in which he himself was different from his famous character. He highlighted his serious Catholic faith and the ways that his own views were probably more to the right of Jon Stewart than perhaps some of his fans suspected.\n\nRelated: Trump Walks Into an Ambush in Second GOP Presidential Debate\n\nThe early episodes showed a real effort to introduce this kinder, gentler Colbert. The archness was dialed down and the South Carolina accent allowed to peek out. His house band, more playful than hip, allowed Colbert to do his Ellen-esque dancing and highlight his impish charm.\n\nIn his first two interviews, with George Clooney and Jeb Bush, Colbert was somewhat subdued despite the political relevance of both men. Jeb was encouraged to do his Donald Trump impression, but that segment was tellingly shown only on the show\u2019s website, not on TV. And given his treatment by the GOP establishment, there is something nonpartisan about mocking Trump. Colbert seemed to be trying to mock the ridiculousness, but without the overt commentary.\n\nBut just like Michael Corleone, every time he thinks he\u2019s out \u2026 they pull him back in.\n\nThe news didn\u2019t help. After a summer in which pop cultural news has been particularly inert, the odd WWE-style Twitter fight aside, there hasn\u2019t been much to talk about. \u201cJurassic World\u201d tore up the box office, but there was little to say about it other than \u201cCool, dinosaurs!\u201d And there are only so many Jon Snow jokes you can make.\n\nRelated: Two New Polls Show Exactly Why Donald Trump Is Winning\n\nThe one thing that has dominated the news this summer, both the political and the popular, has been the 2016 presidential race and particularly the Donald Trump sideshow. Last week\u2019s GOP debate was a target too rich and too prevalent in the cultural conversation to ignore. You could almost watch the internal debate behind Colbert\u2019s glasses as he virtually announced, \u201cI\u2019m about to get political.\u201d The question is how far he could push it.\n\nHis interviews with both Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz were reminiscent of the Colbert of old. He engaged Sanders with a reminder that the American dream is about hard work being rewarded, and exceptional work being exceptionally rewarded. Though always civil with Ted Cruz, he challenged him in his treatment of non-Christian Americans and his opposition to gay marriage. His \u201cHunger Games\u201d-inspired segment, rolled out to eulogize the ends of both the Perry and Walker campaigns, has been one of the highlights of the young show. He may have dialed down attempts at \u201cgotcha\u201d moments, but this was the wily and thoughtful debater his fans remembered.\n\nSo where was that guy with Trump? Colbert\u2019s interview with Trump was almost certainly a victim of unreasonable expectations. Fans hoped to see a battle between a man long experienced at skewering loudmouthed bullies and one of history\u2019s greatest wind tunnels. Instead, the interview felt like two wary and slightly tired boxers circling one another without ever engaging. Colbert, perhaps sensing that Trump would never engage him in an honest debate, seemed to be trying to get Trump to be outrageous.\n\nTrump for his part, knowing that he was simultaneously home in New York and in front of the least friendly audience he\u2019d seen in months, was calm and polite. He refused to take the bait on Colbert\u2019s two attempts to engage him on his hot button issue of immigration (and his controversial statements about Mexicans) and his refusal to disavow some of the more outr\u00e9 theories about Obama\u2019s origins.\n\nRelated: Trump, Obama and Bush Agree: Close the Carried Interest Tax Loophole\n\nWhether it was due to pressure from CBS or an honest belief that there was no point scrapping with Trump, the prizefight never happened. It is somewhat odd that he would have real ideological and policy-based discussions with Ted Cruz but not Trump. After all, one of those people has a remote chance of becoming president, and it\u2019s not the one who engaged Colbert in a thoughtful debate.\n\nLike some sort of Incredible Hulk, Colbert seems to be keeping his wilder alter ego in check. Considering the modern television landscape, CBS could do worse than latching onto Colbert\u2019s old audience, even at the risk of politically alienating some viewers (and Letterman wasn\u2019t totally apolitical, particularly after 9/11). Perhaps it\u2019s time for Colbert to stop pretending to be Dr. Jekyll and let Mr. Hyde run the show?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Last summer, when it was announced that Stephen Colbert would replace David Letterman", "title": "Why Stephen Colbert Played It Straight with Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/23/Why-Stephen-Colbert-Played-It-Straight-Donald-Trump", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/trump_colbert.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/23/Why-Stephen-Colbert-Played-It-Straight-Donald-Trump", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/trump_colbert.jpg", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Last summer, when it was announced that Stephen Colbert would replace David Letterman", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2af7\"", "article_summary": "Jeb was encouraged to do his Donald Trump impression, but that segment was tellingly shown only on the show\u2019s website, not on TV.\nRelated: Two New Polls Show Exactly Why Donald Trump Is WinningThe one thing that has dominated the news this summer, both the political and the popular, has been the 2016 presidential race and particularly the Donald Trump sideshow.\nColbert, perhaps sensing that Trump would never engage him in an honest debate, seemed to be trying to get Trump to be outrageous.\nRelated: Trump Walks Into an Ambush in Second GOP Presidential DebateThe early episodes showed a real effort to introduce this kinder, gentler Colbert.\nLast summer, when it was announced that Stephen Colbert would replace David Letterman as host of \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d there was some chin scratching about exactly how political the new iteration of Colbert could be."}
