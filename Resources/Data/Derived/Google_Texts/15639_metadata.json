That creates an incentive to have fewer full-time workers and more part-time workers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all of our competitors are going in that direction then we\u2019ll probably have that same kind of incentive to do the same thing.\u201d\n\nMackey said that shift is already beginning in Whole Foods itself.\n\nThe formerly 75 percent full-time, 25 percent part-time employee gap will decrease to a 70/30 difference. And if costs continue to improve under health care mandates, that shift will continue as well.\n\nMackey stated that he did like some elements of Obamacare, most notably that the state exchanges helped consolidate more insurance companies to put them in direct competition. However, he rejected the notion that the U.S. health insurance field was a \u201cfree market\u201d before the drafting of the ACA. He said the system was already highly regulated, noting that insurance companies were unable to compete across state lines for health insurance.\n\nMackey said he drafted a 2009 proposal for health care reforms when President Barack Obama reached out to business leaders for suggestions.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately none of those suggestions have been implemented,\u201d he said.\n\nMackey concluded by stating his support of \u201cConscious Capitalism,\u201d also the name of his recently released book. He concluded with his support of a more \u201clibertarian,\u201d free-market approach for economic organization.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s good reason for the government to take over the entire health care system.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whole Foods CEO John Mackey criticized the Affordable Care Act, saying that the \u201cescape clause\u201d incentive to employers will only create a growing class of part-time workers \u2013 a shift his company is already making.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/12/19/whole-foods-ceo-obamacare-escape-clause-pushes-employees-down-to-part-time-work/", "image": {"width": 461, "secure_url": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/83962808.jpg?w=461", "identifier": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/83962808.jpg?w=461", "height": 594}, "type": "article", "description": "Whole Foods CEO John Mackey criticized the Affordable Care Act, saying that the \u201cescape clause\u201d incentive to employers will only create a growing class of part-time workers \u2013 a shift his company is already making.", "title": "Whole Foods CEO: Obamacare 'Escape Clause' Pushes Employees Down To Part-Time Work"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/83962808.jpg?w=461", "description": "Whole Foods CEO John Mackey criticized the Affordable Care Act, saying that the \u201cescape clause\u201d incentive to employers will only create a growing class of part-time workers \u2013 a shift his company is already making.", "site": "/cbsdc", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Whole Foods CEO: Obamacare 'Escape Clause' Pushes Employees Down To Part-Time Work"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Washington DC", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS DC", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc"}, "keywords": "aca information, affordable care act, cbs washington, politics, aca, affordable care act, conscious capitalism, escape clause, fox news, full-time workers, grocery store chain, health care incentive, health care mandate, john mackey, obamacare, part-time workers, self-insured, whole foods ceo", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://washington.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b87f6ea5e510fe3d34ffe9a8dbe8c1cf?s=16", "news_keywords": "aca, affordable care act, conscious capitalism, escape clause, fox news, full-time workers, grocery store chain, health care incentive, health care mandate, john mackey, obamacare, part-time workers, self-insured, whole foods ceo"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ead\"", "article_summary": "That creates an incentive to have fewer full-time workers and more part-time workers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s good reason for the government to take over the entire health care system.\u201d\nHowever, he rejected the notion that the U.S. health insurance field was a \u201cfree market\u201d before the drafting of the ACA.\nHe said the system was already highly regulated, noting that insurance companies were unable to compete across state lines for health insurance.\nMackey said he drafted a 2009 proposal for health care reforms when President Barack Obama reached out to business leaders for suggestions."}
