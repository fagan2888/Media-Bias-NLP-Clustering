Following several successive days with high temperatures lurking in the 20s, an above-freezing forecast of 34 degrees is in store for the Denver area on New Year’s Day Friday.

The Front Range will get progressively higher temperatures through the weekend.

The high temperatures should reach above 40 degrees on Saturday and climb to the high 40s by Tuesday, said Jim Kalina, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder.

“It’s going to be dry for the next week,” said, Kalina, referring to weather in the Denver metro area.

The low temperatures will also steadily rise from single-digit territory to the teens and to 20 degrees by Sunday, he said.

It will be sunny along the Front Range for the next several days, Kalina said.

The next chance for snow in the mountains is Tuesday through Thursday, he said.

There is a 20 percent chance of snow in Colorado’s high country Tuesday and a 40 percent chance by Thursday.
