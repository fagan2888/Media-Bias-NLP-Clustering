Michele Bachmann Accuses President Obama Of Bringing The Rapture To Your Living Room

News, Politics

Former Minnesota Republican congresswoman Michele Bachmann is continuing to make news the best way she knows how.

Controversially.

The Huffington Post got wind of a radio interview from last week where Bachmann accused President Obama of being the catalyst to the end of days as we know it.

“We need to realize how close this clock is getting to the ‘midnight hour’,” she urged to “End Times” host Jan Markell. “We in our lifetimes potentially could see Jesus Christ returning to earth and the rapture of the church,” Bachmann carried on. “We see the destruction, but this was a destruction that was foretold.”

Later on in the interview, Bachmann hit the commander-in-chief with accusations of paganism and all but painted him as a Islamic terrorist. Y’know, real crackpot material.

“If you look at the president’s rhetoric, and if you look at his actions, everything he has done has been to cut the legs out of Israel and lift up the agenda of radical Islam,” she said. “Any nation that accepts God and his principles is blessed, and those who push away are cursed. That’s what we’re seeing happen to the United States,” she said. “We will suffer the consequences as a result.”

Bachmann’s career highlights include witch hunts for the president’s birth certificate and slander towards Obamacare. And there was that time in 2013 when her presidential campaign was the target of an ethics investigation but whatever.
