The United Health Foundation recently named Kansas and Missouri among the seven states that have sunk the furthest on its list over the past 25 years. A robust Kansas was in 12th place in 1990; now it’s a middling 27th, according to the foundation’s America’s Health Rankings. Missouri used to be among the better half of states at 24th place; now it’s a dismal 36th.
