The Fort Lauderdale metro area added the most jobs of any metropolitan area in the state, adding 11,700 jobs in professional and business services.\n\nOther industries adding jobs in Broward were construction, 4,900 jobs; trade, transportation, and utilities, which includes retail, 3,900 jobs; leisure and hospitality, 2,900 jobs; other services, 2,100 jobs; financial activities, 1,800 jobs; government, 800 jobs; and information, 100 jobs.\n\nBut not all of the news was good in November: Broward also lost 900 jobs in education and health services and 300 in manufacturing over the year.\n\nSnaith said some \"hospital shakeups\" related to the Affordable Care Act may account for some job loss. But he's more concerned about the decreasing value of the Canadian currency against the U.S. dollar, which could slow South Florida's tourism.\n\n\"Maybe the frigid weather will outweight the exchange rate effect,\" he said.\n\nPalm Beach County added 12,800 jobs, an increase of 2.7 percent.\n\nThe West Palm Beach-Delray Beach metropolitan area was among the top three metro areas in the state adding professional and business service jobs: 7,400. Palm Beach County added 2,700 jobs in trade, transportation and utilities, which includes retail jobs; 2,300 in education and health services; 1,200 in leisure and hospitality; and 500 in construction.\n\nBut the county also lost 900 jobs in financial activities, 200 in manufacturing and 100 in information and government over the year.\n\nMiami-Dade County with nearby Monroe County added 18,100 jobs, an increase of 1.6 percent. The county added 6,600 jobs in leisure and hospitality; 4,600 jobs in trade, transportation and utilities, which includes retail; 3,800 in education and health services; 2,600 in business and professional services; and 1,800 in financial activities.\n\nBut the county lost 1,200 in construction, 1,000 in government and 300 in manufacturing over the year.\n\nStatewide, the number of jobs swelled by 239,900, an increase of 3 percent.\n\nmpounds@tribpub.com or 561-243-6650", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Unemployment declines again in South Florida", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "author": "South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "Sun-Sentinel.com", "description": "South Florida's unemployment rate dropped another notch in November.", "title": "Unemployment declines again in South Florida", "url": "http://www.sun-sentinel.com/business/careers/fl-unemployment-november-2015-20151218-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-567431ea/turbine/fl-unemployment-november-2015-20151218", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.17", "twitter": {"site": "@sunsentinel", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "unemployment, jobs, south florida, tourism, construction", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402230662, app-argument=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/deeplinkid/85362529", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 64829476886, "app_id": 728754867160252}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-12-18", "Description": "Unemployment declined in November to 4.5 percent in Broward, 4.6 percent in Palm Beach County and 5.5 percent in Miami-Dade County.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "unemployment, jobs, south florida, tourism, construction"}, "article_summary": "Most industries continue to add jobs, but a few lost jobs in the tri-county region in November.\nBut the county lost 1,200 in construction, 1,000 in government and 300 in manufacturing over the year.\nPalm Beach County added 12,800 jobs, an increase of 2.7 percent.\nMiami-Dade County with nearby Monroe County added 18,100 jobs, an increase of 1.6 percent.\nSouth Florida's unemployment rate dropped another notch in November."}
