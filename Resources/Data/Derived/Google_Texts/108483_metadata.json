Obama endangered us and degraded the world\u2019s view of the U.S. by embracing our enemies, by alienating, when not outright deserting, our allies and by advancing a foreign policy of haughty lectures that scold but fail to inspire, let alone instill confidence in friends or fear in foes.\n\nConsidering that the effect of his policies has been opposite what most Americans prefer, there are innumerable lessons to draw from the Obama misadventure.\n\nGoing into the new year, it is prudent to reverse each of the Obama trends: by delivering strong consequences when drawing \u201cred lines\u201d in the face of aggression, by standing by allies instead of pretending to \u201clead from behind\u201d and by standing up to threats, as opposed to enabling, funding and tacitly approving them, as Obama has with Iran.\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful how little muscle actually needs to be flexed when the other side believes you\u2019re willing to flex it. And, as history teaches, it\u2019s a horror to discover how much muscle eventually needs to be flexed after the other side assumed all along that you were unwilling to flex it.\n\nIt\u2019s true that reversing seven years of feckless foreign policy isn\u2019t likely to occur in the final year of this lame duck\u2019s tenure. But, what is New Year\u2019s if not a time of hope for change?\n\nCongress, with the power of the purse, can, and should, at least slow down Obama\u2019s runaway train in the coming year. Then the course can be reversed under a new president in 2017. The White House needs congressional appropriations, if not approval. It\u2019s time for Congress to flex its muscle to get concessions and policy changes.\n\nAs long as we are facing facts, here are a few more to face up to so we can avoid living out that definition of insanity, which is doing the same thing and expecting different results.\n\nAmericans rightly place terrorism atop their list of concerns. Among lessons to learn are that Congress and public pressure must challenge this administration to reverse its foolhardy (at best) and devious (if you doubt Obama\u2019s motives) approach to protecting the homeland.\n\nObama\u2019s approach to terrorism within the nation\u2019s borders would be ludicrous if it weren\u2019t so dangerous. Nothing illustrates Obama\u2019s counterintuitive national security folly better than his choice to head the U.S. Border Patrol, a former San Francisco police chief whose claim to fame was refusing to enforce federal immigration laws, instead, advocating a \u201csanctuary city\u201d policy.\n\nThat\u2019s on a par with Obama assurances that tens of thousands of Syrian refugees will be rigorously vetted, despite their hailing from a region where counterfeit passports and IDs are openly sold. He seems oblivious to the fact 29 individuals admitted to the U.S. from 2012-15 have been accused of terrorist plots, and that the federal government admits it can\u2019t locate 9,500 foreigners whose visas have been revoked for terrorism concerns.\n\nRepublican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz explained the obvious: \u201c[W]e can\u2019t accept refugees that we can\u2019t truly vet, and the vast majority of people coming from the Middle East are not people you can vet.\u201d\n\nThere is something Obama has done right, but for the wrong reason. He has encouraged historically high levels of gun ownership. Granted, he says his intention is diametrically opposite the results he has achieved.\n\nAmericans who cherish their constitutional, God-given rights to self-defense of life and limb actually might say \u201cthank you\u201d for the anti-gun rhetoric coming from the White House. Obama the wannabe gun controller has become the nation\u2019s leading gun salesman. We probably shouldn\u2019t be surprised, considering that, as with so much in this counterintuitive administration, what is supposed to be the goal so often turns out to achieve the reverse. Obamacare was named the Affordable Care Act, if you need a reminder.\n\nIt may be difficult to improve on Obama\u2019s positive results on gun ownership. But we should try.\n\nOne last hope for change in 2016 involves the increasing persecution and intolerance for Christianity, much of it codified in diktats like Obamacare.\n\nChristians should learn from anti-Christian zealots who use the courts and law. Courts and law cut both ways. Civil government won\u2019t bring heaven on Earth, but civil government can protect the heavenly minded.\n\nThe Apostle Paul invoked his legal rights as a citizen of Rome when threatened with unjust persecution. Contrary to many Christians\u2019 belief that there\u2019s something noble in being victimized, there is something far nobler in standing up for what\u2019s right. That was the intention of the First Amendment\u2019s freedom of religion, and 2016 is as good a year as any to invoke it.", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "commentary", "description": "Opinion: Obama's mistakes can be our lessons for 2016 | obama, year, gun, learn, policy, flex, government, congress, something, terrorism", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "MARK LANDSBAUM", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Bidding adieu to 2015 and looking ahead to 2016 and beyond, so much has gone wrong that only a fool (or a progressive) could fail to recognize the countless opportunities to learn from our mistakes.", "title": "Obama's mistakes can be our lessons for 2016", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/obama-697240-year-gun.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nztpq1-b88598500z.120151223102049000ggodsv74.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ocregister", "image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nztpq1-b88598500z.120151223102049000ggodsv74.10.jpg"}, "description": "Bidding adieu to 2015 and looking ahead to 2016 and beyond, so much has gone wrong that only a fool (or a progressive) could fail to recognize the countless opportunities to learn from our mistakes.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obama's mistakes can be our lessons for 2016"}, "content_author": "MARK LANDSBAUM", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/nztpq1-b88598500z.120151223102049000ggodsv74.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "obama, year, gun, learn, policy, flex, government, congress, something, terrorism", "publication_date": "2015-12-23", "access-type": "paid", "section": "commentary", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Obama's mistakes can be our lessons for 2016"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s wonderful how little muscle actually needs to be flexed when the other side believes you\u2019re willing to flex it.\nCongress, with the power of the purse, can, and should, at least slow down Obama\u2019s runaway train in the coming year.\nConsidering that the effect of his policies has been opposite what most Americans prefer, there are innumerable lessons to draw from the Obama misadventure.\nObama\u2019s approach to terrorism within the nation\u2019s borders would be ludicrous if it weren\u2019t so dangerous.\nThat was the intention of the First Amendment\u2019s freedom of religion, and 2016 is as good a year as any to invoke it."}
