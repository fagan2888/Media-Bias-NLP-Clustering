When he appeared on our 2009 MCP list, Rivkin was the president and CEO of Wildbrain, the companybehind Nickelodeon\u2019s \u00adtoddler-world \u00adpheno\u00adm\u00adenon Yo Gabba Gabba!.\n\nBut government was the family business, and Rivkin never lost interest in public service. He was a major fundraiser for Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, and in 2009 the president rewarded him with the ambassadorship to France and Monaco. \u00adAfter a successful run in Paris, he was named assistant secretary of state for economic and business \u00adaffairs in 2014, part of a push by John Kerry to bring more business leaders into the state department.\n\nRivkin\u2019s current responsibilities include managing international trade and implementing economic sanctions against the likes of Russia and Iran. (He also started the state department\u2019s first podcast.) His overall goals\u2014grow the economy, generate jobs\u2014aren\u2019t so different from a CEO\u2019s, even if the challenges are new. \"Leading large \u00adbureaucracies is fun, but different from anything I\u2019ve experienced in the private sector,\" he says. \"It\u2019s about how you engage.\"\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s leadership. \"Obamacare will be a lasting legacy.\"\n\nTerrorism, intolerance, \"ethnic and religious enmity,\" and climate change. \"We\u2019re living in a very complex world.\"\n\nAs a political appointee, his current position will likely expire with the arrival of a new \u00adadministration, a state of affairs that has proved to be freeing. \"I\u2019m not interested in getting promoted. My focus is simply on making things better.\"\n\n\"Jim Henson used to always say that media, if used properly, could be an enormous source of good in the world. I think that goes even more for government.\"\n\nCommunicate regularly\n\n\"When I was in Paris, I was the first ambassador to have town hall meetings with every member of the embassy.\"\n\nLike, really communicate\n\n\"It\u2019s amazing when you go into a meeting and explain to people that there really aren\u2019t any bad ideas. I\u2019ve been very impressed by the creativity that our foreign service officers are capable of exhibiting.\"\n\nA version of this article appeared in the April 2015 issue of Fast Company magazine.", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "How The CEO Of Yo Gabba Gabba!
