But that number dropped to 50% for those 35-64 and to 34% for people 18-34. There was also a partisan divide, with 63% of Republicans saying the U.S. was the greatest country in the world. That number dropped to 46% among Democrats and 41% among independents.\n\nIn 2011, Pew also asked Americans to agree or disagree with the statement, \"our people are not perfect, but our culture is superior to others.\" Forty-nine percent said yes, with 46% saying no. The percentage of those touting America's cultural superiority was down 11 points from 2002.\n\nOf course, the wording of a question greatly impacts the answer. A Gallup poll from 2010 asked \"because of the United States' history and its Constitution, do you think the U.S. has a unique character that makes it the greatest country in the world?\"\n\nEighty percent answered yes, with just 18% disagreeing.\n\nALSO SEE:\n\nVladimir Putin's comments on American exceptionalism, Syria cause a fuss\n\nCNN Political Editor Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report", "article_metadata": {"description": "Updated 9/12/13 11:46 a.m. ET Washington (CNN) -- It's not just President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin who don't see eye to eye over the idea of American \"exceptionalism.\" Polling suggests that the U.S. public's also divided over American exceptionalism.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Polls: Is America exceptional?", "og": {"url": "http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/12/polls-is-america-exceptional/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130418104024-immigrants-flags-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Updated 9/12/13 11:46 a.m. ET \r\nWashington (CNN) -- It's not just President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin who don't see eye to eye over the idea of American \"exceptionalism.\" Polling suggests that the U.S. public's also divided over American exceptionalism.", "title": "Polls: Is America exceptional?"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "- All politics, all the time", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Political Ticker", "keywords": "polls, cnn's political unit", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "ALSO SEE:Vladimir Putin's comments on American exceptionalism, Syria cause a fussCNN Political Editor Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report\nETWashington (CNN) - It's not just President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin who don't see eye to eye over the idea of American \"exceptionalism.\"\nPolling suggests that the U.S. public's also divided over American exceptionalism.\nThe poll indicated a wide generational divide, with 65% of those 65 and older saying the U.S was the world's greatest country.\nThere was also a partisan divide, with 63% of Republicans saying the U.S. was the greatest country in the world."}
