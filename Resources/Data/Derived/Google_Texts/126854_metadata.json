Review of Books\n\nIN THE 150 YEARS Samuel Clemens has been better known as Mark Twain, journalists, scholars, and even bartenders have offered competing theories as to where America\u2019s first signature wit acquired his nom de plume. According to Twain, his pen name once belonged to a Mississippi riverboat captain, and he merely \u201claid violent hands upon it.\u201d Newspapers at the time however claimed he earned his alias drinking at a one-bit saloon in Virginia City, Nevada. Both stories fit the author\u2019s roguish persona. Both recall his bio. But neither has stood up to scholarly investigation, and the truth has been elusive until perhaps now. In the new issue of the Mark Twain Journal, a rare book dealer presents his discovery of an 1861 magazine sketch that offers the first fact-based theory on \u201cMark Twain\u201d; it suggests Clemens found his pseudonym in a popular humor journal, then invented the riverboat story to promote his Missouri roots. A slightly unromantic, yet nonetheless redolent theory, it summons a lesser-known part of Twain\u2019s personal character: his proven cunning in respect to his brand.\n\nKevin Mac Donnell, a book dealer and scholar in Austin, Texas, found the potential source while searching Google Books for unknown pieces of Twain\u2019s writing. To his astonishment, one of the hits led to a mention of \u201cMark Twain\u201d in the humor journal Vanity Fair \u2014 one of the author\u2019s early influences \u2014 two years before he adopted it. In a burlesque titled \u201cThe North Star,\u201d the sketch reports a farcical meeting of Charleston mariners who adopt a resolution \u201cabolishing the use of the magnetic needle, because of its constancy to the north.\u201d These characters include a \u201cMr. Pine Knott,\u201d (a pun for dense wood), \u201cLee Scupper\u201d (a drain), and \u201cMark Twain,\u201d (shallow depth in shipboard jargon).\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for what I found. I stumbled across it,\u201d Mac Donnell said in a phone interview. With a flair for folksy humor that made Twain famous, he also added that \u201cyou could train a cat to do what I did. You could train a garden slug to do what I did, but the cat would be quicker.\u201d\n\nThe majority of Mac Donnell\u2019s work for the Mark Twain Journal was spent documenting Clemens access to the 1861 maritime sketch. Vanity Fair (which bears no relation to today\u2019s brand) was often cribbed by newspapers in the American West, which is where Clemens worked as a reporter in 1863, the year he adopted his pseudonym. \u201cIt\u2019s a magazine we all agree Twain read, and I can put it in Virginia City. I can put it in every newspaper in California and Nevada during his time there,\u201d Mac Donnell said.\n\nAlan Gribben, the editor of the Mark Twain Journal, wrote in an email statement that, \u201cMac Donnell appears to have found the long-hidden key to the conundrum. Moreover, his theory adds to our sense of Twain\u2019s cleverness at hiding his sources.\u201d\n\nPrior to Mac Donnell\u2019s discovery, the first known use of \u201cMark Twain\u201d as a name came in a letter Clemens sent to the editor at the Territorial Enterprise of Virginia City, Nevada. As opposed to his other pseudonyms, such as \u201cThomas Jefferson Snodgrass,\u201d it stuck. Yet when asked about his inspiration, according to one account, Clemens simply said he intended to \u201cshorten the work\u201d of the Nevada legislature; they would no longer have to call him \u201cthat disreputable, lying, characterless, character-smashing, unscrupulous fiend who reports for the Territorial Enterprise.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1873, when the travel book The Innocents Abroad and the Western romp Roughing It made Twain a celebrity, that a theory emerged on his nom de plume. According to the Nevada Sentinel, during his \u201cearly days\u201d as an Enterprise reporter, Clemens spent most nights drinking at the Old Corner saloon in Virginia City, a bar that \u201calways had an account with the balance against him\u201d tallied in chalk marks on the wall. Twain was an old-fashioned way of saying two, a usage Clemens was supposedly fond of because the article said \u201cmark twain\u201d was his order to mark two more on my tab: a request he allegedly became known for and attracted as a sobriquet.\n\nThis story appeared in several Western newspapers (often with liberal embellishments) despite the fact that its author\u2019s claim of familiarity with Clemens was always dubious. The theory even appeared in the Daily Alta California \u2014 one of Twain\u2019s former employers \u2014 at which point he responded in the following letter:\n\n\u201cMark Twain\u201d was the nom de plume of one Captain Isaiah Sellers, who used to write river news over it for the New Orleans Picayune: he died in 1863 and as he could no longer need that signature, I laid violent hands upon it without asking permission of the proprietor\u2019s remains. That is the history of the nom de plume I bear.\n\nTwain also used the pen names \u201cJosh\u201d as in just joshing and \u201cJohn Snook\u201d as in to snooker, which bears mentioning because no record of the name \u201cMark Twain\u201d exists in Times Picayune archives, nor those of any newspaper in the region. Isaiah Sellers always signed his river reports \u201cI. Sellers.\u201d And the captain died one year after Clemens adopted that pen name, not before.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Newly uncovered information about the name's origins reveals how shrewd a businessman the author really was", "title": "\u201cMark Twain\u201d was a brand", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Newly uncovered information about the name's origins reveals how shrewd a businessman the author really was", "title": "\u201cMark Twain\u201d was a brand", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/28/mark_twain_cunningly_created_his_brand_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/452px-Mark_Twain_Cigar-e1380327820461.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Newly uncovered information about the name's origins reveals how shrewd a businessman the author really was", "title": "\u201cMark Twain\u201d was a brand", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/452px-Mark_Twain_Cigar-e1380327820461.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel Hernandez", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Branding, LA Review of Books, literature, Mark Twain, name", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Pine Knott,\u201d (a pun for dense wood), \u201cLee Scupper\u201d (a drain), and \u201cMark Twain,\u201d (shallow depth in shipboard jargon).\nIn the new issue of the Mark Twain Journal, a rare book dealer presents his discovery of an 1861 magazine sketch that offers the first fact-based theory on \u201cMark Twain\u201d; it suggests Clemens found his pseudonym in a popular humor journal, then invented the riverboat story to promote his Missouri roots.\nTwain was an old-fashioned way of saying two, a usage Clemens was supposedly fond of because the article said \u201cmark twain\u201d was his order to mark two more on my tab: a request he allegedly became known for and attracted as a sobriquet.\nAlan Gribben, the editor of the Mark Twain Journal, wrote in an email statement that, \u201cMac Donnell appears to have found the long-hidden key to the conundrum.\nTwain also used the pen names \u201cJosh\u201d as in just joshing and \u201cJohn Snook\u201d as in to snooker, which bears mentioning because no record of the name \u201cMark Twain\u201d exists in Times Picayune archives, nor those of any newspaper in the region."}
