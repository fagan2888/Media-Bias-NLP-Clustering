Trump responded by saying that he has \u201csupported Democrats, and I\u2019ve supported Republicans. And as a businessman, I owed that to my company, to my family, to my workers, to everybody to get along.\u201d\n\nHis clear implication was that financial support to politicians helped him advance his business interests.\n\nCruz allowed that making campaign contributions as a way of buying influence was understandable:\n\nDonald mentioned a moment ago that he was just doing business when he was writing checks to liberal Democrats. But that\u2019s not, in fact, the checks he was writing. Listen, we could all understand if you write a check to a city commission because you\u2019re looking for a zoning waiver on building a building. That may be corrupt, but you could understand real estate developers doing that.\n\nCruz instead accused Trump of making the contributions as an expression of his political support \u2014 which, of course, is the only historically acceptable reason to give money to campaigns:\n\nThat\u2019s not what Donald Trump did. Donald Trump supported Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan. Donald supported John Kerry over George W. Bush. If you don\u2019t like Obamacare, Donald Trump funded Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi taking over Congress to pass Obamacare.\n\nTrump objected that his contributions were not political in nature, but purely transactional:\n\nActually, it was for business. It was. It was. It was for business. I pride myself, including outside of the United States. I\u2019m doing almost 120 deals outside of the \u2014 which I hope to be able to stop very soon and let my children handle it \u2014 but we\u2019re doing many, many deals outside of the United States. I support politicians. In 2008, I supported Hillary Clinton. I supported many other people, by the way. And that was because of the fact that I\u2019m in business.\n\nNeither the moderators nor the other candidates objected to this characterization of political giving. In a political campaign full of smoke and mirrors, it was a rare moment of brazen honesty about the corruption in our system.\n\nRelated:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/assets/static/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "The Intercept", "description": "In a political campaign full of smoke and mirrors, it was a rare moment of brazen honesty about the corruption in our political system.", "title": "Donald Trump and Ted Cruz Brazenly Admit That Campaign Money Buys Influence", "url": "https://theintercept.com/2016/03/04/donald-trump-and-ted-cruz-brazenly-admit-that-campaign-money-buys-influence/", "image": "https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/03/cruz-trump-feature-hero.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Intercept", "description": "In a political campaign full of smoke and mirrors, it was a rare moment of brazen honesty about the corruption in our political system.", "creator": "@the_intercept", "image": "https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/03/cruz-trump-feature-hero.jpg", "title": "Donald Trump and Ted Cruz Brazenly Admit That Campaign Money Buys Influence", "site": "@the_intercept", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"pages": 619459291436461}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/assets/static/mstile-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "There were many disagreements during Thursday night\u2019s GOP presidential debate in Detroit, but frontrunners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz agreed on one thing: Money buys influence in politics.\nIf you don\u2019t like Obamacare, Donald Trump funded Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi taking over Congress to pass Obamacare.\nDonald Trump supported Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan.\nCruz instead accused Trump of making the contributions as an expression of his political support \u2014 which, of course, is the only historically acceptable reason to give money to campaigns:That\u2019s not what Donald Trump did.\nDonald supported John Kerry over George W.
