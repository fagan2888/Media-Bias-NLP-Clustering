The government-funded research was found to have fabricated data and flaws, which leaves the medical community and public questioning how it was even published in the first place.\n\nWhen the study conducted at Riken research institute in Japan was published Jan. 30, it made worldwide headlines and provided optimism to those with Parkinson\u2019s Disease and diabetes, offering promising results it could help. But by Feb. 13, no one was able to successfully reproduce the experiment under surveillance and the institute admitted there were some serious errors throughout the study.\n\n\u201cWe at Nature have examined the reports about the two papers from our referees and our own editorial records. Before publishing, we had checked that the results had been independently replicated in the laboratories of the co-authors, and we regret that we did not capture the authors\u2019 assurances in the author-contributions statements,\u201d Nature said in an editorial statement released on Tuesday.\n\nThe study gave false promise for major advances in the field of stem cells that are said to have a wealth of potential for developing a variety of cell types in the body during early life and growth. It could act as an internal repair system and divide without limitations to repair and replenish other cells as long as the person or animal is alive. They could become new, healthier tissues or organs when others are damaged or fail.\n\nThe research allegedly showed surprising results of stem cells that could be made quickly by dripping blood cells into acid, known as STAP, or stimulus-triggered acquisition on pluripotency. Obokata will have to replicate her once thought to be trailblazing research in a government-affiliated Riken laboratory to find out if there is any substantiality to her study. She was scheduled to start research on Tuesday but skipped due to poor health, according to Riken. The experiments are expected to continue through April 2015, and an interim report will be released by late July.\n\nIf young lead scientist Obokata\u2019s findings were untampered and peer reviewed properly, it would\u2019ve been considered the top three greatest findings in stem cell research. Unfortunately, disappointment availed and the retracted papers stand as a testament to a failed peer-review system. Obokata\u2019s co-author Teruhiko Wakayama even abated to the truth when he called for a retraction back in March.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that it was a careless mistake,\u201d Wakayama wrote the Wall Street Journal in an email. \u201cThere is no more credibility when there are such crucial mistakes.\u201d\n\nCurrently all co-authors of both papers have finally concluded they cannot stand behind the papers' findings and concede to the retractions made by Nature on Thursday. The journal concluded in the editorial release that \u201ceditors and referees could not have detected the fatal faults in this work.\u201d\n\nWhen The Peer-Review Process Fails:\n\nPeer-reviewed studies are crucial in moving forward accurate and thoroughly double-checked facts from the researchers\u2019 methods down to their conclusions. Researchers in outside laboratories must replicate the findings in order for them to be considered reliable. It is at the heart of the processes in not just medical journals but in all of science exploration in order to confidentially build upon stable blocks of confirmed and reliable scientific discoveries.\n\nIf one of those blocks or individual studies is riddled with false and manipulated information, those that follow could be erroneously publishing findings based on falsehoods. It\u2019s the blind leading the blind. However, in this instance, many, including Obokata\u2019s co-authors and Riken\u2019s institute director, believe it was purposeful deception at play.\n\nRiken\u2019s Institute Director Ryoji Noyori plans to \u201crigorously punish relevant people after procedures in a disciplinary committee.\u201d He concludes the paper \u201camounts to phony research or fabrication. The manipulation was used to improve the appearance of the results.\u201d\n\nNature originally believed the paper was peer-reviewed by fellow authors and published without checking with them on its reliability. They apologized in their editorial several times and felt the need to retract the study\u2019s two papers \u201cgiven the extensive nature of the errors currently found.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor confidentiality reasons, we cannot discuss the specifics of the review process or history of any Nature paper with anyone other than the authors,\u201d Alice Henchley, the head of press at Nature Publishing Group, told Medical Daily.\n\nHowever, it seems that many, including Nature\u2019s own independent news team, don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the review process.\n\n\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, we were trying to get at the answers to same sorts of questions in our own reporting,\u201d Nature News Features Editor Brendan Maher told Medical Daily.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "groundbreaking, stem, cell, findings, retracted, glaring, flaws, why, did, peer, review, fail", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Deceptively groundbreaking stem cell research was retracted by the journal Nature Wednesday because of ample errors and manipulations.", "title": "Heralded Stem Cell Research Gets Retracted For Flaws: When Peer Review Fails", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/groundbreaking-stem-cell-findings-retracted-glaring-flaws-why-did-peer-review-fail-291336", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/03/major-stem-cell-research-study-retracted-falsifying-data.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Deceptively groundbreaking stem cell research was retracted by the journal Nature Wednesday because of ample errors and manipulations.", "title": "Heralded Stem Cell Research Gets Retracted For Flaws: When Peer Review Fails", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/groundbreaking-stem-cell-findings-retracted-glaring-flaws-why-did-peer-review-fail-291336", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/03/major-stem-cell-research-study-retracted-falsifying-data.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/03/major-stem-cell-research-study-retracted-falsifying-data.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-07-03T13:01:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-03T13:48:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Deceptively groundbreaking stem cell research was retracted by the journal Nature Wednesday because of ample errors and manipulations."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde1b5\"", "article_summary": "If young lead scientist Obokata\u2019s findings were untampered and peer reviewed properly, it would\u2019ve been considered the top three greatest findings in stem cell research.\nMore than six months after 30-year-old lead researcher Haruko Obokata released seemingly ground-breaking stem cell research, published in Nature and later retracted for its questionably manipulated findings, the study was attempted again on Wednesday.\n\u201cWe at Nature have examined the reports about the two papers from our referees and our own editorial records.\nHowever, it seems that many, including Nature\u2019s own independent news team, don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the review process.\nResearchers in outside laboratories must replicate the findings in order for them to be considered reliable."}
