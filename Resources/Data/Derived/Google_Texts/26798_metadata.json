Problems? What Problems?\n\n\u2018The stories about difficulties enrolling in Obamacare are exaggerated. For most people who made a genuine effort, it worked. The media are pointing out minor flaws so they can have something to talk about.\u2019\n\nExcept that the administration refuses to tell us how many people have enrolled, and the scant details trickling in from insurance companies suggest that the number of enrollees at the outset is \u2026 a trickle.\n\n2. This Is a Republican Distraction\n\n\u2018Republicans are claiming the Obamacare rollout was a failure to distract attention from the government shutdown, the debt ceiling, and their general unpopularity. They\u2019re also harping on Obamacare\u2019s technical problems to conceal the fact that the rate increases they predicted aren\u2019t materializing.\u2019\n\nExcept that Republicans have been vociferously criticizing Obamacare for four-and-a-half years, long before any of the Democrat-induced government funding and debt ceiling crises; and rates for young people are projected to go up in 45 states. Democrats are the ones who are secretly grateful for the shutdown distraction.\n\n3. Republicans Are Racist\n\n\u2018Conservatives are pointing out problems with Obamacare because they hate the fact that we have a black President. They\u2019re willing to let the poor suffer and go without health care just to make Obama look bad.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s true \u2014 racist Republicans like Allen West, Tim Scott, and Herman Cain just can\u2019t stand the fact that Obamacare was authored by such African-American legislators as Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, and Max Baucus. You caught us, libs!\n\n4. Republicans Are Naysayers\n\n\u2018Republicans are being their typical pessimistic selves about government being able to help people. They\u2019re nitpicking instead of helping find solutions.\u2019\n\nExcept that IT professionals who know how a site like healthcare.gov should have been implemented are making ominous predictions about how the site will take months and possibly years to fix.\n\n5. The Rocky Rollout Shows How Much Americans Love Obamacare\n\n\u2018The administration didn\u2019t foresee how wildly popular Obamacare would be. The groundswell of visitors to healthcare.gov overburdened the site\u2019s servers.\u2019\n\nAccording to backwards liberal logic, healthcare.gov was a massive failure; ergo, tons of people tried to sign up for it. But IT specialists who have studied the site\u2019s poor configuration suggest that the problem was not too many people getting on the site \u2014 that even a few people trying to get on would have experienced the same problems.\n\nBy the time December 31 rolls around, and the administration is either delaying the individual mandate for a year or suffering enormous public disapproval over its refusal to do so, Republicans\u2019 government shutdown strategy might look positively prescient. Then Democrats will have no one to blame but themselves.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Three weeks later, the left is still blaming the disastrous launch of healthcare.gov and the state health exchange websites on anything and everything except the incompetence and shortsightedness of the current Democratic administration and the contractors it hired.
