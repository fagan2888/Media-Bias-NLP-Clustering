Obama reportedly pretended to be Colbert\u2019s alter-ego and called himself \u201carrogant\u201d before proceeding to read Colbert\u2019s critique of Obamacare.\n\nObama reportedly arrived at the presenter\u2019s desk before his schedule and engaged in some self-mockery. \u201cStephen, you\u2019ve been taking a lot of shots at my job, so I\u2019m taking a shot at yours,\u201d Obama reportedly said during the opening moments of the show. \u201cHow hard can this be? I\u2019m just going to say whatever you say.\u201d\n\nHe also renamed the show\u2019s popular segment, \u201cThe Word\u201d to \u201cThe Decree\u201d because it sounded more \"presidential.\" He also launched into a monologue about Republicans in Congress and his last two years in office.\n\n\"Nation,\" Obama said, imitating Colbert. \"As you know, I, Stephen Colbert, have never cared for our President. That guy is so arrogant. I bet he talks about himself in the third person.\"\n\nObama, as Colbert, stated that there are aspects of Obamacare that people like, but, \u201cHow do you stop something that more and more people are starting to like?\u201d following which a message flashed, saying: \u201cMove it to CBS.\u201d This was a reference to the fact that \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d is ending its run in two weeks as the host is leaving his Comedy Central show to take over David Letterman\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show\u201d on CBS.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nObama also reportedly spoke about how Republicans could stop Obamacare.\n\n\"They could pass a bill repealing Obamacare. But the President still has the veto and if I know that guy, he is willing to use it,\" Obama said. \"And let's face it, even if Republicans somehow did repeal it, they would have to replace it with their own health care plan. Once they touch it, they own it, and then if anything goes wrong, suddenly everybody will be complaining about Mitch McConnell-care.\"\n\nIn closing the segment, Obama also joked about the Obamacare website. \"Remember the original HealthCare.gov website? I think that's where Disney got the idea for Frozen,\" Obama said.\n\nLater, Colbert took aim at Obama recently nominating his fourth top civilian at the Pentagon.\n\n\"I'll give it to you. You've employed a lot of people,\" Colbert said. \"Mostly as Secretary of Defense,\u201d to which Obama replied that its \u201cboosted our numbers a little bit.\u201d\n\nColbert also accused Obama of exceeding his authority on immigration. \"When did you decide to burn the Constitution and become emperor?\" he asked, to which Obama replied: \u201cEverything that we have done is scrupulously within the law, and has been done by previous Democratic and Republican presidents.\u201d\n\nWhile ending the show, Colbert asked: \"Barack Obama -- great president or the greatest president?\"\n\nObama replied: \u201cI'm going to let someone else decide -- not you, but someone who knows what they're talking about.\u201d\n\nColbert then turned the question on its head to ask Obama if the president thought of him as a \u201cgreat pundit or the greatest pundit.\" Obama replied, saying: \"The greatest pundit.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "president obama, president obama on the colbert report, obama as stephen colbert, obama pokes fun at himself, obama colbert show, colbert show ends, obama talks about obamacare, obamacare website joke, stephen colbert mocks obama, obama as colbert,", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "During an appearance on \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d President Barack Obama pretended to be the host and mocked himself.", "title": "Obama Becomes Stephen Colbert, Pokes Fun At Himself, Obamacare; Calls Host 'The Greatest Pundit'", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/obama-becomes-stephen-colbert-pokes-fun-himself-obamacare-calls-host-greatest-pundit-1744581", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/12/09/obama-colbert-report.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "During an appearance on \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d President Barack Obama pretended to be the host and mocked himself.", "title": "Obama Becomes Stephen Colbert, Pokes Fun At Himself, Obamacare; Calls Host 'The Greatest Pundit'", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/obama-becomes-stephen-colbert-pokes-fun-himself-obamacare-calls-host-greatest-pundit-1744581", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/12/09/obama-colbert-report.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/12/09/obama-colbert-report.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "People", "published_time": "2014-12-09T04:44:05-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-09T06:45:25-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "During an appearance on \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d President Barack Obama pretended to be the host and mocked himself."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc046\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama appeared on \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d Monday and took over the role of the talk-show host Stephen Colbert.\nObama reportedly arrived at the presenter\u2019s desk before his schedule and engaged in some self-mockery.\nObama reportedly pretended to be Colbert\u2019s alter-ego and called himself \u201carrogant\u201d before proceeding to read Colbert\u2019s critique of Obamacare.\n\"Mostly as Secretary of Defense,\u201d to which Obama replied that its \u201cboosted our numbers a little bit.\u201dColbert also accused Obama of exceeding his authority on immigration.\nObama replied, saying: \"The greatest pundit.\""}
