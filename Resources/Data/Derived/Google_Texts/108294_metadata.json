Periyakoil, MD , who directs Stanford Medical School\u2019s Palliative Care Education and Training program.The study, titled \u201cDo Unto Others,\u201d reveals that even though an overwhelming majority of physicians Stanford surveyed (88.3 percent) would reject unnecessarily invasive treatment for themselves and opt instead for comfort care, patients in the United States continue to spend their last days receiving high-intensity care that is often ineffective and sometimes ordered contrary to patients\u2019 wishes.The nearly 1,100 doctors who participated\u2014over half of them women physicians and nearly half of them from immigrant and minority communities\u2014were also highly supportive of patients filling out advance directives that state whether they\u2019d prefer intensive treatment or palliative comfort care, if they become incapacitated at life\u2019s end.The Stanford study, published last week in the respected journal PLOS One , cites research showing that most Americans want the same care doctors do for themselves: \u201cMore than 80 percent of patients say that they wish to avoid hospitalizations and high-intensity care at the end-of-life, but their wishes are often overridden.\u201dDespite that knowledge, says the Stanford report, high-tech treatments have increased dramatically in recent years. Medical data show a 12 percent jump just from 2003 to 2007, in the number of Medicare patients who saw 10 or more doctors in their last six months of life\u2014mainly medical specialists\u2014and spent more days in intensive care units.Not only is most high-tech care unwanted, says the Stanford study; it\u2019s enormously costly. Medicare spends a quarter of its budget on services in the last year of life. And 40 percent of that expense is on patients within the last 30 days of life.In fact, said Periyakoil, those receiving high-intensity care in the last six months of life do not survive longer on average than people who get lower-intensity care. Instead, her study reports, starting palliative care sooner after a diagnosis of serious or terminal illness helps patients get control of their pain and their families to reduce unpredictable emergencies.Stanford\u2019s study, the largest of its kind, included physicians at two California academic medical centers. Unlike a similar smaller 1989 study that surveyed mostly white physicians, it included enough women doctors and physicians from different backgrounds for the researchers to be able to compare results across racial and ethnic demographics.Periyakoil said in an interview, \u201cEthnic doctors are in a unique position to be able to advocate for excellent palliative care and early access to it for their patients. And also to be able to explain within their community that high-intensity treatments can become ineffective.\u201dThere were significant, but modest differences among those in the Stanford sample. African-American and white physicians expressed equal strong support for their patients\u2019 use of written advance directives stating their treatment preferences.Somewhat less supportive of advance care planning documents were Asian medical practitioners, followed by Latino doctors\u2019 stronger resistance to such documents.Periyakoil emphasized, though, that \u201calmost everyone was positive towards advance directives.\u201dAlso, women tended to be more favorable toward use of advance directives than men. And doctors in more general or primary care areas, such as pediatrics or gynecology, were more positive toward the written plans than surgeons and other medical specialists.The study adds that doctors who were less supportive of advance directives were more likely to opt for \u201cfull-code\u201d intensive treatment for themselves and were less likely to opt for organ donation.Although patients and family members may worry they won\u2019t receive every treatment that might restore their health, Periyakoil, a geriatric doctor, said, \u201cThe truth is completely the opposite. Doctors tend to do too much.\u201d A primary reason doctors forge ahead too far is that they are trained \u201cto be optimistic\u201d about finding a cure.Severe disease, she explained, often reaches \u201ca tipping point where the treatment becomes more burdensome than the illness itself.\u201d Medical education needs to train doctors to recognize such tipping points and coach patients and improve patients\u2019 understanding \u201cthat we are not withholding helpful treatments \u2013 but harmful, burdensome treatments.\u201dThat physicians select do-not-prolong-life orders for themselves is unsurprising, says the Stanford study, because so may medical practitioners \u201crecurrently witness the tremendous suffering their terminally ill patients experience as they undergo ineffective, high-intensity treatments at the end of life.\u201dYet, says the study, a key factor causing many doctors to override their patients\u2019 stated preference\u2014a factor that can overtake a physician\u2019s own ethnic or cultural values\u2014is the culture of \u201cbiomedicine with its default set to maximal interventions for all patients, irrespective of the effectiveness of doing so.\u201dPeriyakoil noted, \u201cThe culture of medicine is so intense and powerful that it mutes the effect that your own ethnicity might have. The more you\u2019re in training, the more acculturated you are to biomedicine, you may stop thinking [of other things], because the culture is so automated, you react to numbers.\u201dAnother major factor perpetuating the disparity between what doctors wish for themselves and chose for their patients, says the study, is that the \u201ccurrent fiscal system rewards hospitals and doctors for medical procedures and providing high-intensity care to terminally ill persons.\u201d\u201cThis is a big puzzle to me,\u201d stated Periyakoil. \u201cWe don\u2019t train doctors to talk to patients and we don\u2019t reward them for doing so, meaning there\u2019s no reimbursement. We train them to do treatments that are high intensity, and we reward doctors for doing procedures. But we say we want them to talk to patients?\u201dShe went on, \u201cThere are all kinds of studies showing that doctors don\u2019t let patients talk, that they are not good listeners. We didn\u2019t train them to do any of that.\u201dOne provision of the 2009 Affordable Care Act would have reimbursed physicians for discussing a patient\u2019s end-of-life treatment preferences every five years, if the person chose to have that conversation. But that provision was excised from the bill when critics labeled it a pathway to \u201cdeath panels.\u201dThe Stanford findings highlight the need for educational and policy changes to improve doctors\u2019 attitudes towards advance directives. Periyakoil stressed, \u201cI\u2019d like there to be more self-reflection and awareness about how we\u2019ve been raised, who we are, and how that influences how we think.\u201dAs a palliative care physician dedicated to easing pain in severely ill patients, Periyakoil asserted that while doctors are famously taught, \u201cFirst, do no harm, to her \u201cthe most important thing is: First, do not abandon.\u201dShe explained that physicians need to stay with the process of healing, \u201ceven if it\u2019s suboptimal, even if you don\u2019t agree with your patient, or your patient doesn\u2019t agree with you.\u201dPeriyakoil said, she always begins by discussing every possible treatment option a patient or family members could consider, but then separately states her opinion of the better choice.\u201cSo if the patient [or family] opts for high-intensity treatment anyway, I don\u2019t try to impose my will on them,\u201d she said. Instead she will tell them that she doesn\u2019t think they\u2019ve made the best choice, but make it clear that, \u201cI\u2019m still here and I will still support you.\u201dPeriyakoil tells her medical students, \u201cWhat matters to patients is an important question. So ask people to think about what matters to them, what makes life meaningful to them at any given point.\u201d That talk can guide both doctors and patients to the best outcome at life\u2019s most difficult moment.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "stanford study, end of life care, vj periyakoil, do unto others, doctor patient, dying patient", "description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
