Winter has finally passed, and you\u2019re out for a long walk. You decide to try that new Italian place up the street. As you look over the menu, you receive a text message from your doctor. This can\u2019t be good. She congratulates you on the healthy exercise, but warns you about adding too many carbs to your meal. She notes that your blood pressure is not looking good over the last week and suggests a slight uptick in medication.\n\nSound intrusive? Instead, it could be the future of medicine. Nurses and doctors will one day serve as \u201ccare traffic controllers,\u201d similar to how an airport keeps track of planes from a central command center. The idea is to monitor your health and, ultimately, keep you out of the emergency room, lower healthcare costs in the US, and save lives.\n\nThe term \u201ccare traffic control\u201d was coined by Dr. John Halamka, a Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and the CIO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a rise in readmissions for congestive heart failure exacerbations,\u201d Halamka told FoxNews.com. \u201cYou go to the football game and have the chile con queso with nachos, but the hot sauce creates fluid retention and you wind up in the Emergency Room.\u201d\n\nCare traffic control is one answer to offer a quick and efficient response. A caregiver monitors your vitals and warns you about potential problems or even adjusts your medication. Currently, it\u2019s already possible to have hospitals and clinics closely monitor patients from a central command center. Wearable gadgets can track our activity, our weight, and our blood pressure and report this data already.\n\nHalamka said there are two hurdles to making it happen. One is that the medical field is designed around a \u201cpay as you go\u201d model. We visit the doctor only when we get sick. It\u2019s better to monitor people and keep them out of the ER altogether. He added that this fits nicely with Affordable Care Act incentives and what President Obama called \u201cprecision medicine.\u201d One caveat \u2013 hospitals and clinics get paid more as part of an Accountable Care Organization when people stay healthy.\n\nThe second hurdle is technical. Most of the gadgets we use today are islands unto themselves. The Fitbit Aria Wi-Fi Smart Scale doesn\u2019t share data with the Samsung Gear Fit smartwatch. Fortunately, Apple HealthKit and Google Fit are two emerging development platforms that can feed data into one repository in the cloud. As a result, hospitals only have to track one set of data.\n\nAs a bonus, this personal health data is \u201copt-in\u201d and controlled by the patient, so it does not fall under strict healthcare regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), said Alex Moazed, the CEO of Applico, a mobile app platform. According to Moazed, this framework is what makes care traffic control even possible.\n\nOther medical institutions are experimenting with patient monitoring, Moazed told FoxNews.com. Right now, the Hackensack University Medical Center is tracking heart attack patients, Stanford Healthcare uses an app that works with HealthKit, the Lucille Packard Children\u2019s Hospital tracks diabetes patients using blood sugar monitoring, and the Mayo Clinic University of Pennsylvania Health System is looking at ways to collect data from patients on an ongoing basis.\n\nHalamka is already putting his theories about patient monitoring to the test. Members of his own staff have volunteered to use a smart scale to record their weight with a custom iPhone app developed at the hospital. This data is then fed to a computer using Apple HealthKit.\n\nWith this data, Halamka can monitor weight changes and even predict health problems. Eventually, the app could capture blood pressure and blood sugar data, which are two additional predictors of serious health issues.\n\nThat means the next time you order that chile con queso at the game, be aware \u2014 your doctor or nurse might be watching your every move.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "gadgets", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/TECH/TECHNOLOGIES/Smartphones,/FOX NEWS/TECH/TECHNOLOGIES/Wearable Tech,/FOX NEWS/TECH/TECHNOLOGIES/Apps", "dcterms.modified": "2015-03-30 01:31:32 EDT", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"description": "Imagine it\u2019s a beautiful spring day.
