More than half of all episodes, however, fall into just 10 groups that are divided into five categories based on the amount of therapy provided and the episode's timing in a sequence of episodes, according to Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.\n\nFour of the categories are based on a combination of whether the episode is an early episode - first or second - or late episode - third and subsequent - and whether the episode has zero to 13 therapy visits or 14 to 19 visits, according to MedPac. A fifth separate category exists for episodes that have 20 or more therapy visits.\n\nThe system is calibrated to provide higher payments for later episodes in a sequence of consecutive episodes and raises payment as therapy visits increase.\n\nThe Home Health Resource Group with the largest number of episodes is 1 CGK, with 490,124 episodes and Medicare payments totaling $1.2 million, according to CMS.\n\nNationally, the average payment for all home health agencies was $3,037. The highest average per episode rates were in the Southwest and Mountain states, while those with the lowest were in the Southwest, Midwest and West coast, according to CMS.\n\nHere is the full list of HHRG claims, ranked by total cost to Medicare.\n\n\n\n\n\nHHRG Total Episodes Average Charge Average Medicare Payment Total Payments HHRG Description HHRG Total Episodes Average Charge Average
