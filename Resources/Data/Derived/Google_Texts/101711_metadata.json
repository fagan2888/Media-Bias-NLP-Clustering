She's the legislator who called out Wayne Hoffman's IFF/A. She told the Idaho State Journal: \u201cIt bothers me that a few individuals think they can tell legislators how they should vote,\u201d said Packer. \u201cI was elected, not Wayne Hoffman.

Kelley Packer\u2019s recent unprovoked attack on the conservative Idaho Freedom Foundation shocked many. More disturbing, however, has been her decision to continue misleading her constituents about IFF \u2014 and her voting record. Packer is entitled to her opinions, but she owes it to the people in her district to be straight with the facts. Let\u2019s start with a recent message I delivered via phone to Packer\u2019s constituents. My message said, Packer \u201cvoted to increase your taxes. Kelley Packer voted for corporate cronyism. She voted to regulate bake sales. She even sponsored a bill to license sign language interpreters. Rep. Kelley Packer voted to implement Obamacare in Idaho and says she\u2019d do it again if she could.\u201d More here.\n\nPacker won 56% of the vote Tuesday night to win her party's nomination and re-election. She has no Democratic opponent this fall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "State Sen. Shawn Keough and state Rep.
