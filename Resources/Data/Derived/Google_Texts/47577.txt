The Bay State’s former Obamacare czar is taking an executive job at the company that was awarded a no-bid state contract to fix the disastrous website, the Herald has learned.

Sarah Iselin — hired by the Patrick Administration in February to rescue the malfunctioning website — will become an executive-in-residence at Optum, which currently holds a lucrative state contract to re-launch the Health Connector on Nov. 15.
