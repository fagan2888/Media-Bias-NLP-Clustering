Boehner sided with conservatives seeking to use a stopgap budget bill to undermine President Obama\u2019s signature health-care overhaul.\n\nBut here, among the people the Ohio Republican represents, the clash over the looming fiscal crisis sounds like distant, if familiar, noise.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll work it out \u2014 they always do,\u201d Robert Mahaffey, 34, said as he climbed the steps up to his storefront mortgage brokerage firm in West Chester on a recent warm fall afternoon.\n\nIn Butler County, a swath of rolling deep-green countryside rapidly giving way to office parks and big box stores, the latest round of Washington brinkmanship did not preoccupy the vast majority of residents interviewed by The Washington Post this week.\n\nIn that way, they resemble the rest of America. Only about a quarter of the public is following the fiscal standoff very closely, according to a Pew Research Center poll taken last week. That\u2019s comparable to the public\u2019s interest in a potential government shutdown in 2011, when about 30 percent were following the issue very closely about a week before the deadline.\n\nView Graphic Countdown to the (possible) shutdown\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know we were having a government shutdown,\u201d said Walter Herd, 46, as he browsed a used-car lot across the street from Boehner\u2019s district office on a busy stretch of the Cincinnati-Dayton Road. Herd, a construction worker under contract at the VA in Cincinnati, pondered the implications: \u201cThat might mean my job.\u201d\n\nDennis Bradbury, a 56-year-old truck driver, admitted that he has not followed the drama in Washington \u201cas well as I should have.\u201d\n\nBut Bradbury, sitting on the porch of his West Chester home, where he was holding a yard sale, said he had faith the crisis would be averted. \u201cI don\u2019t think that John Boehner would let the federal government come to a complete halt,\u201d he said.\n\nTom Temple, owner of The Jug, an 81-year-old burger drive-in in nearby Middletown, is worried about the impact of Obamacare on local businesses, but he was not sure how it is tied to the current fiscal fight. \u201cI heard something about that on the radio, but I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Temple said as he took a break from flipping burgers.\n\nJoseph Hinson, president of the West Chester-Liberty Chamber Alliance, said there is little consternation among the group\u2019s more than 700 members about the Sept. 30 budget deadline.\n\n\u201cWhen you hear about the government shutdown, it\u2019s like, \u2018Here we go again,\u2019 \u201d said Hinson, seated in his office next to a map highlighting the areas of commercial growth along Interstate 75, which runs north from Cincinnati to Dayton. \u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing more of is the uncertainty of what\u2019s going to happen with health-care reform.\u201d\n\nAt the Middletown Area Republican Club\u2019s monthly meeting Monday, the two dozen members in attendance voted to donate $250 to a boys\u2019 soccer team, got reports from the local auditor and county clerk on new cost savings, and listened to a talk by the guest speaker, a local prosecutor. No one brought up the shutdown threat.\n\n\u201cNo one talks about it, because it\u2019s like the boy who cried wolf,\u201d said Carla Baker, who serves on the executive committee of the Butler County Republican Party.\n\nBaker is not happy about Obamacare, but she calls the current situation in Congress \u201ca train wreck.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s ridiculous they\u2019re using the shutdown of the government and government employees as leverage,\u201d she said.\n\nBaker doesn\u2019t blame Boehner, however. \u201cI think he wants to do what\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he can\u2019t make people vote the way he wants them to vote.\u201d\n\nMike Scorti, past president of the Middletown club, praised Boehner for \u201cstanding up\u201d and said there was little risk it would lead to a freeze in federal funding. \u201cIt would be foolish to shut the government,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019d be stupid.\u201d\n\nIn this deeply red district, wedged in the southwest corner of the state, Boehner is viewed by many as trapped by his circumstances, a victim of Washington\u2019s deeply polarized political culture. The 12-term congressman \u2014 who got his start in public office in his early 30s as trustee of West Chester Township, then called Union \u2014 is given the benefit of the doubt by longtime constituents and friends, who doubt that a funding freeze will come to pass.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of confidence that John makes decisions that he thinks are the right ones to make at the time,\u201d said Gary Cates, a former state senator who has known Boehner for 30 years. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a tougher job than trying to corral 434 other people in one body. I think it\u2019s got to be a thankless job.\u201d\n\nCates, a senior vice chancellor for the Ohio Board of Regents, is not too worried that the federal government is actually going to come to a halt.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been down this path before, where we go right up to the edge,\u201d he said as he left the meeting of the Middletown Area Republican Club. \u201cAnd I anticipate with the way things are in D.C., we\u2019ll have some more high drama, but it will get worked out.\u201d\n\nAnd if it doesn\u2019t \u2014 well, that\u2019s just fine by many in Boehner\u2019s district, one of the most staunchly conservative in the state, a largely rural area anchored by swelling suburbs north of Cincinnati. In November, nearly 62 percent of the 8th Congressional District vote went for Republican Mitt Romney and 99.22 percent went for Boehner, who ran unopposed in the general election.\n\nBoehner is a familiar face in Butler County, the most populous area of the district, where he has a home in an upscale development of stately homes set around a pristine golf course. Political conservatives are a dominant force here: Nearly three-quarters of voters in the county supported a 2011 state measure that attempted to block the individual mandate requirement of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThere is a very strong contingent of tea party conservatives in his district who have been the most vocal about him giving no ground and letting the government shut down if it means defunding Obamacare,\u201d said Chris Kelley, a lecturer in political science at Miami University who lives down the street from Boehner in West Chester. \u201cMy guess is he\u2019s not getting many calls from constituents telling him to negotiate this quickly with Obama.\u201d\n\nDavid Kern, executive chairman of the Butler County Republican Party and a supporter of the tea party movement, said his sense is \u201cthat people are glad that we\u2019re standing up to the liberals and the danger and the harm of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nWhile political pundits may deride Boehner as a weak speaker, Kern said his approach wins him points back at home: \u201cHe listens to his caucus and respects the members\u2019 thoughts. And he\u2019s not a bully, as some leaders have been.\u201d\n\nIf anything, folks such as Ann Becker, president of the West Chester and Cincinnati Tea Party, want Boehner to go further to the right.\n\n\u201cI wish he was in front, leading this issue, instead of a junior senator from Texas,\u201d said Becker, referring to GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, who has been driving the effort to defund Obamacare. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from several people that Boehner isn\u2019t really interested in shutting down the government, and I wish he could reconsider taking that full step. Because Obamacare is the defining issue of his speakership.\u201d\n\nBut Ann Munafo, executive director of the Middletown Area Senior Center, fears where the current showdown is headed. Her center relies on grants through the Older Americans Act to provide lunch every day at a reduced rate for dozens of seniors, as well to transport hundreds of elderly people to doctor visits every month \u2014 programs that could be hurt if federal funding is cut off.\n\n\u201cThere has to be some kind of compromise,\u201d she said, seated behind the reception desk at the colorfully decorated center. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to put all these federal programs in jeopardy. Because what\u2019s going to happen to people? We\u2019re not going to feed our seniors? We\u2019re not going to take them to dialysis?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Republican, but we need to be able to compromise,\u201d Munafo said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, okay, we\u2019re adults. We need to act like adults. What are these games we\u2019re playing? These are people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nAlice Crites in Washington contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clash over federal budget seems familiar to most, who say that the parties will work something out.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/mateagoldwashpost", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Clash over federal budget seems familiar to most, who say that the parties will work something out.", "title": "In John Boehner\u2019s district, little fretting over looming government shutdown", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-john-boehners-district-little-fretting-over-looming-government-shutdown/2013/09/26/d23117ec-2534-11e3-ad0d-b7c8d2a594b9_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/09/19/Others/Images/2013-09-19/b%2061379617032.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mateagold"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-john-boehners-district-little-fretting-over-looming-government-shutdown/2013/09/26/d23117ec-2534-11e3-ad0d-b7c8d2a594b9_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "John Boehner, Affordable Care Act, government shutdown, tea party, Ohio, obamacare, fiscal crisis, federal budget", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/mateagoldwashpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "d23117ec-2534-11e3-ad0d-b7c8d2a594b9", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "John Boehner, Affordable Care Act, government shutdown, tea party, Ohio, obamacare, fiscal crisis, federal budget"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNo one talks about it, because it\u2019s like the boy who cried wolf,\u201d said Carla Baker, who serves on the executive committee of the Butler County Republican Party.\nBut here, among the people the Ohio Republican represents, the clash over the looming fiscal crisis sounds like distant, if familiar, noise.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that John Boehner would let the federal government come to a complete halt,\u201d he said.\nJoseph Hinson, president of the West Chester-Liberty Chamber Alliance, said there is little consternation among the group\u2019s more than 700 members about the Sept. 30 budget deadline.\n\u201cThere has to be some kind of compromise,\u201d she said, seated behind the reception desk at the colorfully decorated center."}
