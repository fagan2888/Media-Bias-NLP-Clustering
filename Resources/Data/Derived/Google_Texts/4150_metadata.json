The Islamic State extremist group claimed on Sunday it killed Mr. Kassig, a Muslim convert who had worked to provide medical care for victims of Syria\u2019s civil war.\n\nIt is still really hard to believe all of this is really happening\u2026 as I am sure you know by now, things have been getting pretty intense. We have been held together, us foreigners \u2026 and now about half the people have gone home. \u2026 I hope that this all has a happy ending but it may very well be coming down to the wire here, and if in fact that is the case then I figured it was time to say a few things that need saying before I have to go.\n\nThe first thing I want to say is thank you. Both to you and mom for everything you have both done for me as parents; for everything you have taught me, shown me, and experienced with me. I cannot imagine the strength and commitment it has taken to raise a son like me but your love and patience are things I am so deeply grateful for.\n\nSecondly, I want you to know about things here and what I\u2019ve been through straight from me so you don\u2019t have to wonder, guess, or imagine (often this is worse than the reality). All in all I am alright. Physically I am pretty underweight but I\u2019m not starved, & I have no physical injuries, I\u2019m a tough kid and still young so that helps.\n\nMentally I am pretty sure this is the hardest thing a man can go through, the stress and fear are incredible but I am coping as best I can. I am not alone. I have friends, we laugh, we play chess, we play trivia to stay sharp, and we share stories and dreams of home and loved ones. I can be hard to deal with, you know me. My mind is quick and my patience thinner than most. But all in all I am holding my own. I cried a lot in the first few months but a little less now. I worry a lot about you and mom and my friends.\n\nThey tell us you have abandoned us and/or don\u2019t care but of course we know you are doing everything you can and more. Don\u2019t worry Dad, if I do go down, I won\u2019t go thinking anything but what I know to be true. That you and mom love me more than the moon & the stars.\n\nI am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing, wondering, hoping, and wondering if I should even hope at all. I am very sad that all this has happened and for what all of you back home are going through. If I do die, I figure that at least you and I can seek refuge and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying to alleviate suffering and helping those in need.\n\nIn terms of my faith, I pray everyday and I am not angry about my situation in that sense. I am in a dogmatically complicated situation here, but I am at peace with my belief.\n\nI wish this paper would go on forever and never run out and I could just keep talking to you. Just know I\u2019m with you. Every stream, every lake, every field and river. In the woods and in the hills, in all the places you showed me. I love you.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The family of American aid worker Peter Kassig released the following letter that he wrote while in captivity.
