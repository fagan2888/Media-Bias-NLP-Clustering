SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – Millions of your tax dollars, gone. The state auditor’s office found nearly $14 million in public assistance benefits fraud in 2015. It included people and groups defrauding the state of food stamp benefits, EBT cards, childcare services and health care.

That $14 million lost marks a 44% increase from the $9.5 million the state lost to fraud in 2014. State Auditor Suzanne Bump says that this doesn’t necessarily mean that more people are filing fraudulent claims. What she says, though, is that it reflects a more effectiveness of her office identifying fraudulent behavior.

22News called the state auditor’s office to find out if the state can get that money back, or if criminal charges will be brought. We were told that if examiners identify a fraud suspect, the office will attempt to get that money back. The state determines whether to pursue criminal charges on a case by case basis. Auditor’s Office Spokesman Mike Wessler told 22News charging someone with a felony could get them fired, and force them to go back on benefits.

“I think everybody has to follow the law and I think fraud is against all moral codes,” says West Springfield resident Ilie Cojocrau, “so everyone should be punished according to the law. But they should pay a price, you know? At least return the money that they scammed.”

The Bureau of Special Investigations is now working with other state agencies to find instances of welfare fraud.
