And I am for completely untangling that guarantee, and a lot of Republicans are.\u201d\n\nStiglitz agreed with Senor.\n\nHost Bill Maher said that when President Obama tried to help the economy after the recession, Republicans blocked funds for infrastructure investments.\n\nSenor corrected Maher.\n\n\u201cBill, he had control of the Congress in the first two years of his administration,\u201d said Senor. \u201cHe had majorities in the House and the Senate. And he got his stimulus passed. He got Dodd-Frank passed, which has the too-big-to-fail guarantee built in to protect investment banks. He got Obamacare passed. He got a bunch of things passed. So why didn\u2019t he push exactly what you are saying?\u201d\n\nMaher objected that Democrats didn\u2019t have control of Congress.\n\nA Free Beacon analysis found that Bill Maher was wrong. Democrats did control both chambers of Congress during President Obama\u2019s first two years in his administration.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Mitt Romney adviser Dan Senor fact-checked Bill Maher and his guests several times on Real Time with Bill Maher Friday.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Former Mitt Romney adviser Dan Senor fact-checked Bill Maher and his guests several times on Real Time with Bill Maher Friday.
