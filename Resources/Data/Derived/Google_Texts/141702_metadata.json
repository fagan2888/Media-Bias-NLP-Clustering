( Matthew Jonas / Staff Photographer )\n\nAttempted-murder suspect Dynel Lane is scheduled to appear in Boulder District Court on Tuesday for her preliminary hearing \u2014 but whether the hearing happens or not remains unclear.\n\nThe Boulder County Public Defender's Office hasn't responded to requests for comment on the case, and Boulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett said on Friday he didn't know whether the hearing would go forward.\n\nGarnett said that generally a motion to postpone would already have been filed with the court, and if the defense intends to waive the hearing, it likely will walk into court on Tuesday and do so without any advance notice.\n\nThe defense had not filed any motions to continue as of Friday afternoon, but could possibly do so on Tuesday at the start of the hearing.\n\nMichelle Wilkins (Courtesy Photo)\n\nDuring the past two years, about 55 percent of defendants in Boulder County have waived their preliminary hearings, according to the district attorney's office.\n\nProsecutors allege that Lane, 34, bludgeoned and stabbed Michelle Wilkins \u2014 who was seven months pregnant with a daughter \u2014 with a lava lamp before cutting her baby from her womb on March 18. Wilkins, 26, survived the attack, but her baby did not.\n\nWilkins had come to Lane's residence after responding to a Craigslist post that advertised baby clothes. Prosecutors said Lane and Wilkins talked for about an hour on a variety of subjects \u2014 including Lane's pregnancy \u2014 before Lane lured Wilkins into a basement and attacked her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors said that Lane, who is currently in custody at the Boulder County Jail, admitted to cutting the baby out of Wilkins.\n\nUniversity of Colorado clinical law professor Ann England, who has also worked as a public defender, said that in a high profile case, prosecutors are more inclined to put on more evidence at a preliminary hearing, because they know the public and media are watching.\n\n\"They are much more likely to have victims and victims' families watching,\" she said. \"They want to show the public how strong their case is.\"\n\nShe said prosecutors will often set aside more time for a preliminary hearing on high profile cases and call more than one witness. In lesser cases, the lead investigator will often be the state's sole witness.\n\nThe district attorney's office said in a brief filed in advance of Tuesday's hearing that it intends to call one Longmont detective to testify.\n\nA defense attorney, England said, can use a preliminary hearing to determine the strength of the case and cross examine witnesses who's statements might only constitute a paragraph or two in a police report.\n\n\"There is a huge difference in how people seem on paper and how they are in real life,\" she said. \"It is an advantage to be able to cross examine witnesses before trial.\"\n\nDenver attorney Craig Silverman, who is a former Denver prosecutor, said the defense can use preliminary hearings as an opportunity to gain discovery and \"perhaps get a police officer to say something that might be regretted later.\"\n\n\"The defense might want to hear what the police officer has to say,\" he said. \"They are not going to get an opportunity to cross examine the victim. I would be very surprised if the victim testifies at preliminary hearing like this.\"\n\nLane, 34, is charged with attempted first-degree murder, unlawful termination of a pregnancy and multiple counts of felony assault. She faces more than 100 years in prison if she is convicted on all counts, some of which carry sentencing enhancements.\n\nProsecutors allege that after Lane beat, stabbed, choked and attempted to smother Wilkins with a pillow, she left Wilkins unconscious and bleeding in a downstairs bedroom and placed the baby in an upstairs bathtub.\n\nLongmont police said that Lane's husband David Ridley \u2014 who was not charged in the case \u2014 came home and found the baby lying in a tub. He took Lane and the baby to Longmont United Hospital.\n\nWilkins eventually regained consciousness and was able to call 911.\n\nThe case has garnered a significant amount of controversy, not only because of the gruesome nature of the attack but also because prosecutors could not legally charge Lane with murder for the death of the baby.\n\nColorado's Republican Senate approved a bill last week that would create a new crime of fetal homicide, but it is not expected to pass in the House of Representatives.\n\nEngland said that it is possible the defense could postpone the preliminary hearing in a high profile case like Lane's if they are fairly certain that it will be heading to trial. She added that defense attorneys won't have all the discovery in the case this early.\n\n\"In a case like this, I can't imagine that the prosecution is going to offer anything but lots and lots of prison time, if they offer anything at all,\" she said. \"It looks like that case is going to trial.\"\n\nSilverman said prosecutors don't lose preliminary hearings because the probable cause standard is easy to meet in most cases; hearsay is admissible, and victims don't have to testify.\n\nHe said the probable cause standard prosecutors will have to meet in the Lane case is even easier because the \"evidence seems overwhelming.\"\n\n\"I would not be surprised if the defense waives or seeks to continue the preliminary hearing,\" he said. \"The less people think about this crime, the better for Dynel Lane. But people aren't soon going to forget what she did.\"\n\nJohn Bear: 303-684-5212, bearj@timescall.com or twitter.com/johnbearwithme", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/news/crime/ci_28031719/dynel-lane-preliminary-hearing-scheduled-tuesday", "modificationDate": "2015-05-03T09:09:30-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0501/20150501__03TCADYNw~3_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By John Bear \n  Staff Writer", "description": "Attempted-murder suspect Dynel Lane is scheduled to appear in Boulder District Court on Tuesday for her preliminary hearing \u2014 but whether the hearing happens or not remains unclear.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:28031719:view"}, "startDate": "2015-05-03T11:00:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/news/crime/ci_28031719/dynel-lane-preliminary-hearing-scheduled-tuesday", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0501/20150501__03TCADYNw~3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Attempted-murder suspect Dynel Lane is scheduled to appear in Boulder District Court on Tuesday for her preliminary hearing \u2014 but whether the hearing happens or not remains unclear.", "title": "Dynel Lane due for hearing this week in Longmont fetal-abduction case"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Attempted-murder suspect Dynel Lane is scheduled to appear in Boulder District Court on Tuesday for her preliminary hearing \u2014 but whether the hearing happens or not remains unclear.", "title": "Dynel Lane due for hearing this week in Longmont fetal-abduction case", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/news/crime/ci_28031719/dynel-lane-preliminary-hearing-scheduled-tuesday", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0501/20150501__03TCADYNw~3.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-03T11:00:00-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-05-01T19:08:54-0600", "sailthru.title": "Dynel Lane due for hearing this week in Longmont fetal-abduction case", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Crime", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By John BearStaff", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0501/20150501__03TCADYNw~3.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-05-01T19:12:32-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado, Mead, Weld, County, Boulder, Lafayette, Firestone, Fredrick, Dacono, Loveland, crime, map, police, courts"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5dc6\"", "article_summary": "He said the probable cause standard prosecutors will have to meet in the Lane case is even easier because the \"evidence seems overwhelming.\"\n( Matthew Jonas / Staff Photographer )Attempted-murder suspect Dynel Lane is scheduled to appear in Boulder District Court on Tuesday for her preliminary hearing \u2014 but whether the hearing happens or not remains unclear.\nI would be very surprised if the victim testifies at preliminary hearing like this.\"\n\"I would not be surprised if the defense waives or seeks to continue the preliminary hearing,\" he said.\nLongmont Police are seen in the driveway of an apartment where police allege Dynel Lane attacked Michelle Wilkins on Green Place in Longmont on March 18."}
