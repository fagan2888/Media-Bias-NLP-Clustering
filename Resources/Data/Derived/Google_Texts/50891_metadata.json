On Monday, prices shed 1.5% to settle at $41.87, the lowest settlement level for a front-month contract since March 2009.\n\n\u201cFears of a sustained slowdown in China is oil\u2019s biggest hurdle,\u201d said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group. But \u201cChina is throwing a lot of money and stimulus which could keep oil demand strong,\u201d and that\u2019s likely providing some support to oil prices, he said.\n\nAnd \u201cwe should see a drawdown in crude supply reminding us that despite the glut, U.S. refining demand is at record highs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly report on inventories late Tuesday, while the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues its own data Wednesday morning. Citi Futures forecasts a decline of 1.5 million to 2.5 million barrels in crude stockpiles.\n\nOn the ICE Futures exchange in London, October Brent crude UK:LCOV5 settled higher after a three-session losing streak, up 7 cents, or 0.1%, at $48.81 a barrel.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is off WTI as it has retested its lows from earlier in the year,\u201d said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. \u201cBrent still needs to apparently meet its destiny with a retest too. The spread between Brent and WTI has widened recently ... and we are seeing some narrowing of that for now.\u201d\n\nStill, Richard Hastings, macro strategist at Global Hunter Securities, said that the bias for oil is lower.\n\nHe said $39 a barrel is \u201ceasily achievable for WTI crude oil in the coming week.\u201d\n\n\u201cFundamentals like China demand and OPEC production are tiny incremental effects\u201d for oil prices, he said. \u201cThe dominant element at this time is sentiment.\u201d\n\nRead: Carnage in commodities, emerging markets may be over: BofA\n\nBack on Nymex, September gasoline US:RBU5 ended at $1.647 a gallon, down less than a penny, or 0.5%, while September heating oil US:HOU5 added less than half a cent to $1.559 a gallon. September natural gas US:NGU15 edged down by 2.4 cents, or 0.9%, to $2.704 per million British thermal units.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "U.S. oil futures settle higher, but analysts warn that a global supply glut and a potential slowdown in Chinese demand could help pull prices below $40 a barrel.", "creator": "@MktwSaefong", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CV899_crude__ZG_20141008072936.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Victor Reklaitis", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Markets", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "U.S. oil futures settle higher, but analysts warn that a global supply glut and a potential slowdown in Chinese demand could help pull prices below $40 a barrel.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/oil-drops-again-as-oversupply-fears-persist-2015-08-18", "author": "Myra P.
