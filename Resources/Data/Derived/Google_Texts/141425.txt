The monthly jobs report came out on Friday, and things are pretty good overall.

The big headline numbers were great: The economy added 242,000 jobs in February, much higher than the 195,000 that economists estimated, and the unemployment rate remained at 4.9 percent, which is nice and low.

But if you drill down into the data, the picture is a little murkier.

Here are four things we know about the economy from the details in this report:

1) Wages aren't growing much, and it's hard to say why.

Average hourly earnings were down by 3 cents in February, to $25.35. Year-over-year, wages are up about 2.2 percent. That's not great -- although, thanks to very low oil prices and low inflation, it's not terrible either. But it's worth asking why wage growth since 2010 hasn't been as robust as growth in previous recoveries.
