That also proved to be the final result, with the final match between Gael Monfils and Stan Wawrinka not played.\n\nIt took 15 years for the former top-ranked Federer to achieve Davis Cup success after making his debut in the event in 1999. No wonder he looked so emotional after converting his first match point, falling to his knees and lying face down on the court before hugging team captain Severin Luthi and his teammates.\n\n\u201cAt the end, it\u2019s a tennis match, you feel great emotions. You\u2019re unbelievably happy and relieved,\u201d said a joyful Federer. \u201cWe wanted this clearly very badly, especially being up 2-1. You inch yourself closer and closer. Clearly seeing Stan out there, the rest of the team supporting you, gives you an extra push. It was definitely one of the better feelings in my career, no doubt about it. So much nicer to celebrate it all together.\u201d\n\nAfter pulling out of the final of the ATP World Tour Finals in London last Sunday, Federer\u2019s participation against the French looked in doubt. He hit a ball for the first time on the indoor clay court on Wednesday evening and was a shadow of his former self when he was thrashed by Monfils in Friday\u2019s singles.\n\nHis form rapidly improved, though, and he was back to his best during Saturday\u2019s doubles win with Wawrinka that gave the Swiss a 2-1 lead.\n\nFederer, who adopted a low profile all week, was full of praise for Wawrinka.\n\nHis teammate stepped out of Federer\u2019s formidable shadow earlier this year with victory at the Australian Open. He has also been a dedicated Davis Cup player in recent years, while Federer often focused on his personal career.\n\nIn 2013, Wawrinka led Switzerland to victory in a World Group playoff in the absence of Federer, giving his country a shot at the trophy this year. He also won Switzerland\u2019s first point this weekend by beating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.\n\n\u201cStan has put in so much effort over the years and played an unbelievable weekend that gave me the opportunity today,\u201d Federer said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very much aware of that. This one is for the boys. It\u2019s not for me. I\u2019ve won enough in my career and did not need to tick any empty boxes. I\u2019m just happy for everybody else. I\u2019m happy we could live a great tennis historic moment in our country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Federer leads Swiss past France for Davis Cup", "title": "Federer leads Swiss past France for Davis Cup", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Federer leads Swiss past France for Davis Cup", "title": "Federer leads Swiss past France for Davis Cup", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/23/federer_leads_swiss_past_france_for_davis_cup/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/aptopix-france-tennis-davis-cup.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Federer leads Swiss past France for Davis Cup", "title": "Federer leads Swiss past France for Davis Cup", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/aptopix-france-tennis-davis-cup.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Samuel Petrequin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5d0\"", "article_summary": "That also proved to be the final result, with the final match between Gael Monfils and Stan Wawrinka not played.\nIt took 15 years for the former top-ranked Federer to achieve Davis Cup success after making his debut in the event in 1999.\nHe has also been a dedicated Davis Cup player in recent years, while Federer often focused on his personal career.\nFederer ended a week of uncertainty about his aging back with a vintage performance to give Switzerland an emphatic victory over France and its first Davis Cup.\n\u201cAt the end, it\u2019s a tennis match, you feel great emotions."}
