In just the past year, the Dallas-Fort Worth area had hundreds of layoffs.\n\nFor those affected \u2014 and any who fear their jobs might be in jeopardy \u2014 there\u2019s no time like the present to consider other career opportunities. And while there\u2019s no such thing as true job security, the medical field can offer better security and stability than many other fields, as well as higher salaries.\n\nIf you\u2019re living in Dallas or thinking about moving to the area, a career as a physician assistant or physical therapist is worth considering. Not only are these career choices rewarding and fulfilling, but you can also potentially earn more money working for a Dallas-based company than a company in another U.S. city, according to GOBankingRates\u2019 study of the best- and worst-paying cities for America\u2019s 20 hottest jobs.\n\nAccording to the job study, Dallas ranked as one of the best-paying places for physician assistants and physical therapists. The city employs 2,630 physical therapists and 1,220 physician assistants.\n\nPhysical therapists work in medical facilities to help decrease pain or improve mobility in patients after an injury or surgery. Physician assistants aren\u2019t full-fledged doctors, but they\u2019re licensed to practice medicine under the direction of a doctor.\n\nGiven the complex nature of both occupations, it\u2019s not surprising that compensation in both fields is higher than other fields. The national median wages for a physical therapist and physician assistant are $81,853 and $96,732, respectively.\n\nBut if you feel you can do better or that your skills command a higher salary, there\u2019s good news if you\u2019re thinking about moving to or working in Dallas: Physical therapists in this city earn a median annual salary of $93,840, and physician assistants earn $101,910.\n\nNot only is Dallas one of the best-paying cities for physician assistants and physical therapists, but it\u2019s also one of the best-paying cities for occupational therapists ($93,780) and occupational therapy assistants ($73,820). And it looks like more and more jobs in these two professions will become available every year.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the job outlook for occupational therapists will grow 29 percent from 2012 to 2022. For occupational therapy assistants, that growth will be even higher at 41 percent from 2012 to 2022.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to predict the future with 100-percent accuracy, nor can you control whether employers decide to shut their doors or lay off dedicated workers. So if you feel it\u2019s time for a career change, you question the stability of your job or you want to earn more money, now\u2019s the time to explore a new career in the medical field.\n\nDaniel Cross,\n\nGOBankingRates.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to a recent study, Dallas ranked as one of the best-paying places for physician assistants and physical therapists.", "og": {"description": "According to a recent study, Dallas ranked as one of the best-paying places for physician assistants and physical therapists.", "title": "Dallas pays best physician assistant, physical therapist wages", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150426-dallas-pays-best-physician-assistant-physical-therapist-wages.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-04-28T01:44:35Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-04-27T00:45:56Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Dallas pays best physician assistant, physical therapist wages\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150426-dallas-pays-best-physician-assistant-physical-therapist-wages.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2272377\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-04-27T00:45:56Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-04-27T00:45:56Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf97a\"", "article_summary": "According to the job study, Dallas ranked as one of the best-paying places for physician assistants and physical therapists.\nPhysical therapists work in medical facilities to help decrease pain or improve mobility in patients after an injury or surgery.\nIf you\u2019re living in Dallas or thinking about moving to the area, a career as a physician assistant or physical therapist is worth considering.\nThe city employs 2,630 physical therapists and 1,220 physician assistants.\nPhysician assistants aren\u2019t full-fledged doctors, but they\u2019re licensed to practice medicine under the direction of a doctor."}
