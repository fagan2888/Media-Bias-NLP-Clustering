Ironically, it was dad who sold the company in order to save jobs. \u2026 and now look what\u2019s happened.\u201d\n\nHer father, L.D. Hancock, founded what was Hancock Textile Co. in 1957. He sold the company in 1972 to Lucky Stores. The company acquired Minnesota Fabrics and in 1987, it was spun off to shareholders and listed on the New York Stock Exchange as Hancock Fabrics.\n\nBy the time it filed for Chapter 11 in February \u2013 its second filing since 2007 \u2013 Hancock shares were trading over the counter and worth about a penny each.\n\nDeas said even though no family member has ties to the company anymore, the family name is still associated with the company.\n\nShe said bad management over the years contributed to its demise, not the plan her father had envisioned.\n\nWhen L.D. Hancock sold the company to Lucky Star, he was trying to ensure the future of the company and its workers, Deas said.\n\n\u201cHe knew that a lot of people and a lot of families depended on their jobs with the company,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was worried what would happen to them if something happened to him. He wanted to make sure the company was financially solid in order to protect them.\u201d\n\nForty-four years after that sale, Hancock Fabrics \u2013 or rather the company that bought its assets in a bankruptcy auction last week \u2013 has begun a liquidation of the company. Within weeks, 255 stores will be closed forever.\n\nGreat American Group of California had already been tasked with closing 70 under-performing stores Hancock had identified during its Chapter 11 filing in February. It had a back-up bid for the remaining 185 stores, and since no other bids were submitted, Great American\u2019s bid was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.\n\n\u201cOur team has worked closed with Hancock Fabrics in a range of capacities over the years,\u201d said Scott Carpenter, president of Great American\u2019s Retail Solutions division. \u201cNow our task will be discounting all of the merchandise in the stores unit it is completely liquidated. \u2026 We expect the going-out-of-business sales to last several weeks before all of the merchandise is sold in the remaining locations.\u201d\n\nHancock\u2019s liquidation also means its massive facility in the Harry A. Martin North Lee Industrial Park in Baldwyn will be shuttered.\n\nThe Community Development Foundation, which oversees economic development efforts in Lee County, will be looking for somebody to fill that void.\n\nThe facility includes 650,000 square feet of warehouse space, a 28,000-square-foot fixtures manufacturing space and an 80,000-square-foot, two-story office building that served as the company\u2019s headquarters.\n\nDavid Rumbarger, the CDF\u2019s president and CEO, said it is an opportunity as well as a challenge to market a dual facility that size. Some companies are merely looking for warehouse space, not necessarily with a large office attached.\n\n\u201cBut we faced a similar issue when Lane Furniture closed in Verona, and it was filled by United Furniture \u2026 so there\u2019s precedent,\u201d Rumbarger said. \u201cWe just have to work through the red tape that\u2019s involved.\u201d\n\nWith the fire of enthusiasm, Rumbarger added, \u201cOut of the ashes, something good will be resurrected.\u201d\n\nRising then falling\n\nL.D. Hancock sold the business in 1972 for $50 million, and the company initially did grow as he had hoped. The company began moving from mall locations to standalone locations and smaller strip centers, and it acquired other companies as well.\n\nBy the early 1990s, the company had expanded to 500 stores in 40 states.\n\nBut there were signs of stress, with competition coming for all sides \u2013 Jo-Ann Fabrics, Michael\u2019s, Kirkland\u2019s and Hobby Lobby to name a few of the retailers who were casting nets for a similar customer base.\n\nPrior to its Chapter 11 filing in 2007, Hancock Fabrics\u2019 last major restructuring involved remodeling most of its stores as well as moving some and closing others. The net result was 70 fewer stores from the company\u2019s peak of 500 in 1994 to 430 by 2002. But annual sales grew in seven of the 10 years from 1995 to 2004.\n\nCompany officials were optimistic about growing the business to 600 stores. That was one of the primary reasons Hancock moved to its new $18 million corporate headquarters, warehouse and distribution center in Baldwyn.\n\nBut trouble was brewing.\n\nAfter posting a combined $19.8 million in profit for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, Hancock lost $15.6 million in FY2005. The next year, the company went deeper in the red, posting a $32.7 million loss.\n\nIn January 2006, Hancock said it would close 50 stores; eventually 42 were shuttered. A year later, the company said it would close 30 stores, then on March 21, 2007, it said it would close another 104 stores. A day later, the company filed for Chapter 11. That fiscal year, it lost another $24.3 million.\n\nThere was hope that Hancock would emerge a leaner and more competitive company after it exited Chapter 11 in August 2008. It had shed 140 stores \u2013 with Great American handling the liquidation of those locations.\n\nWhile sales remained flat at about $276 million during FY2008, Hancock posted a narrower loss \u2013 $12.4 million. The next year looked promising as it turned a profit of $1.8 million \u2013 it\u2019s first profit in five years. But that momentum was fleeting, as the lingering effects of the Great Recession continued to pressure the company\u2019s tenuous financial position.\n\nThe craft and sewing business had changed, and Hancock expanded its home decor selection, even adding some furniture.\n\nSales held relatively stable around the $275 million mark, but profit margins fell as merchandise was sold at deeply discounted prices.\n\nAnd losses continued to mount. The company lost about $35 million from FY2010-FY2014.\n\nThe company began a store renovation program in late 2012/early 2013, with two formats in mind: A fabrics-centered store simply called Hancock Fabrics, and another format that included the expanded assortment of merchandise. Those stores were branded Hancock Fabrics Crafts & More.\n\nIt was deemed a \u201cback-to-basics\u201d move by company officials.\n\nBut Hancock was able to renovate only a handful of stores at a time, not enough to push the needle in its favor as far as sales and profitability.\n\nCrushing debt\n\nThen last December, in an SEC filing, Hancock warned of an impending cash crunch.\n\nThe company had posted another quarterly net loss of $3.6 million, compared to a loss of $800,000 a year earlier.\n\nFor the first three quarters of its fiscal year, Hancock accumulated a net loss of $12.7 million. For the same period a year earlier, Hancock\u2019s net losses totaled $4.6 million.\n\nAs of the end of October, Hancock had long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $101.6 million. That figure was $52.3 million on Jan. 28, 2012.\n\nSaid Hancock at the time, \u201cAs a consequence of our significant amount of indebtedness as of Oct. 31, 2015, a significant portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures or other growth initiatives and other general corporate requirements.\u201d\n\nHaving to rely on bank borrowings since 2011 and with its debt load growing, its pension under-funded by more than $40 million and creditors adding pressure, Hancock filed for Chapter 11 on Feb. 2 of this year.\n\nCompany leaders said Hancock had some $183 million in liabilities and only $151 million in assets.\n\nAfter the filing, company President and CEO Steve Morgan, who had been in those positions since October 2011, said the restructuring was a positive step for the future of Hancock Fabrics.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to providing our customers quality fabrics and crafting essentials, both online and in stores,\u201d he said. \u201cWe value our relationships with our vendors and appreciate their support throughout this process. We will continue to offer the same unparalleled service for which the company has been known since its founding in 1957.\u201d\n\nBut Hancock will not survive to see a 60th year.\n\nWithout another bidder from which to choose, the bankruptcy court had little choice but to select Great American\u2019s offer.\n\nIt should be noted that a sister company of Great American has provided financing to Hancock prior to its Chapter 11 filing, but the court dismissed any concerns over improper behavior of any party involved in the bidding process.\n\nThat brings little solace to the 4,500 full- and part-time workers who were employed by Hancock before the filing.\n\nFor some, Hancock has been the only company where they\u2019ve worked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for a great company,\u201d said David Jensen, a former vice president of human resources for Hancock, who joined the company in 1985 with Minnesota Fabrics. \u201cMy thoughts are with those people that worked for so long and loved working for the company.\u201d\n\ndennis.seid@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @dennisseid", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Dennis Seid Daily Journal BALDWYN \u2013 Even though Doyce Deas no longer has any financial stake in Hancock Fabrics, she is disappointed, even a bit angry that the company her father founded is liquidating. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are 4,500 jobs that will be lost.
