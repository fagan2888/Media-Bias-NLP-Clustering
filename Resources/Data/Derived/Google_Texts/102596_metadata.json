A sizable 42 percent of the film\u2019s domestic sales came from 3-D and premium-format screens.\n\n\u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d is just the latest of Disney\u2019s string of live-action remakes of classic cartoons (\u201cCinderella,\u201d \u201dAlice in Wonderland,\u201d \u201dMaleficent\u201d), most of which have fared well at the box office. More plundering of the Disney library is in the works: \u201cCruella De Ville\u201d and \u201cPeter Pan\u201d are in development; \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d is scheduled for next March.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some consistency that\u2019s happened here in the last few years as we\u2019ve really made this a priority and a strategy from a company perspective,\u201d said Disney distribution head Dave Hollis, who credited production president Sean Bailey with overseeing the live-action adaptations. \u201cHe\u2019s been able to do it in a way that really makes them contemporary and, certainly in this case, fully utilizes available technology.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot more of these stories to tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d made for about $175 million, was propelled by glowing reviews from critics. It ranks as the second biggest April opening ever, behind only \u201cFurious 7\u2019s\u201d $147.2 million debut.\n\nIt also took in an estimated $136.1 million overseas that includes $20.1 million so far in India where it\u2019s the third-highest grossing Hollywood release after 10 days. Ahead of the film\u2019s big opening, Warner Bros. - sensing stiff competition - pushed the release of its own \u201cJungle Book\u201d a year to October 2018.\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore, said that the live-action remakes are proving to be another substantial engine for Disney, along with its franchise-building assets in Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm.\n\n\u201cTo have this incredible vault of content that they can go back to and reimagine, retool and recreate for today\u2019s audiences just gives them a depth and breadth of films that is almost unparalleled,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cDisney has this knack for taking something that\u2019s very old and making it new again.\u201d\n\nOpening in second place was Ice Cube\u2019s \u201cBarbershop: The Next Cut\u201d with $20.2 million. The fourth film in the comedy series (which included the 2005 spinoff \u201cBeauty Shop\u201d) failed to match the $24.2 million debut of the previous \u201cBarber Shop 2: Back in Business\u201d in 2004, but it still supplied a solid opening for New Line and MGM.\n\nThe Kevin Costner action thriller \u201cCriminal,\u201d however, opened with a mere $5.9 million for Lionsgate. It cost around $30 million to make.\n\nThe Melissa McCarthy comedy \u201cThe Boss,\u201d the number 1 film last weekend, dropped steeply. It slid 57 percent with $10.2 million in its second week, landing in third place.\n\nTwo well-reviewed films opened in limited release: the Weinstein Co.\u2019s musical coming-of-age tale \u201cSing Street\u201d ($69,000 in five theaters) and A24\u2019s bloody thriller \u201cGreen Room\u201d ($91,000 in three theaters).\n\n___\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore.
