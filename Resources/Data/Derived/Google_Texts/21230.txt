Health Care: ObamaCare was supposed to be a gift to the uninsured. Maybe someone should have checked with them first. A new poll finds the uninsured hate ObamaCare more than any other group.

The Economist/YouGov poll asked the public a series of questions about ObamaCare, and then broke down the findings based on their insurance status.

As with many other polls, this one finds widespread disapproval of the law. Fully 43% say it’s a failure, compared with just 25% who think it has been a success. Nearly one in five say it’s been “a complete failure.”

Almost half (48%) think the law has pushed insurance prices up, compared with 16% who say ObamaCare has reduced the rate of premium growth. (So much for “bending the cost curve down.”)

The findings get really interesting, though, when they’re broken down by whether the respondents have always had insurance, gained coverage after 2013, lost coverage after 2013, or never had coverage.

It’s not surprising that those who had continuous coverage over these years aren’t terribly enthusiastic about the law. More than half of them say it’s pushed insurance costs up, for example.

But ObamaCare isn’t even terribly popular among those who gained coverage after 2013 — those who should be singing its praises.

The poll found that an almost equal share say it’s been a failure as rate it a success (29% vs. 30%). A quarter actually want it repealed, while just over half want it kept the same or expanded.

More remarkable still is the fact that the uninsured are the most hostile to ObamaCare. The poll found that 50% of this group wants ObamaCare repealed (compared with 42% overall).

A mere 14% of the uninsured rate the law as a success, while 49% say it’s been a failure. And 60% say it’s either raised premiums or hasn’t made a difference.

These findings call into question a central premise of ObamaCare — namely that there were tens of millions of Americans who desperately wanted health insurance but were either denied coverage or couldn’t afford it, and so needed this law. Clearly that’s not the case for many uninsured.

The survey also points to a looming problem for ObamaCare. If the uninsured despise the law, they will be less likely to sign up.

Since the uninsured skew younger, those enrolling will be sicker and more expensive, setting ObamaCare premiums on an ever-upward trajectory.
