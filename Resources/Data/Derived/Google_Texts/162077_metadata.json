He's the baldheaded Ohio everyman who asked a presidential candidate named Barack Obama about his tax plan back in 2008, prompting Obama to say, \"I think when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody.\"\n\nLike most patriotic Americans, I've been a fan of Joe the Plumber ever since Fox News told me I should be a fan of Joe the Plumber.\n\nJoe Wurzelbacher, also known as \"Joe the Plumber,\" stands onstage at a campaign rally in Ohio in this file photo taken on Oct. 30, 2008. (Brian Snyder, Reuters)\n\nThat off-the-cuff comment confirmed everyone's fear of Obama as a socialist hellbent on destroying America. And it propelled Samuel \"Joe the Plumber\" Wurzelbacher to fame as an honest, straight-talking American who should be taken very seriously.\n\nHe became a fixture during the 2008 campaign, and I loved him because he was pro-America, pro-freedom and anti-union. Not only did Joe not belong to a plumbers union, he wasn't even a licensed plumber. Take that, big government!\n\nIn 2009, he barnstormed Pennsylvania in opposition to the pro-union Employee Free Choice Act, which he boldly did not read or understand, telling a blogger, \"I know a little about a lot of things; I don't know a lot about everything.\"\n\nAnd in 2011, he stood before an anti-union crowd in Madison, Wis., saying, \"Unions don't deserve anything. You work for it yourself; that's what America is about!\"\n\nI became a major Joe the Plumber fan-boy, scooping up Joe T-shirts, bumper stickers and coffee mugs and evenly distributing them among my friends and family members.\n\nSo you can imagine how crushed I was this week when I learned that my hero has taken a job at a Chrysler plant that requires workers to join \u2014 ack! \u2014 a nasty, Democrat-loving union. On his humble website, JoeForAmerica.com, Mr. the Plumber wrote: \"In order to work for Chrysler, you are required to join the Union, in this case UAW. There's no choice \u2014 it's a union shop \u2014 the employees voted to have it that way and in America that's the way it is.\"\n\nThose dastardly liberals have gotten to him.\n\nHe later writes \"It's an American worker's right to unionize for sure\" and \"Anyone who knows me would never dare disparage all members of unions because they know I'd rip into them.\" Then why didn't you rip into you back in 2011 when you were saying unions don't deserve anything?!?!\n\nOnce again, it seems a hero has fallen. Much like my favorite governor, Sarah Palin, who suddenly decided to stop governor-ing. And my favorite almost-president, Donald Trump, who decided not to run for president so he could devote more time to tweeting nasty comments from atop his solid-gold toilet.\n\nCome to think of it, even my favorite villain has been disappointing. People like Joe and Sarah and Donald promised me that Barack HUSSEIN Obama would turn America into an apocalyptic nightmare, with children sent to socialist reprogramming camps and people marrying cats and Christianity outlawed in favor of something terrorist-sounding.\n\nBut everything still looks pretty much the same. Nobody came for my guns, even though I stocked up and stored them in my official Joe the Plumber, Obama-proof gun cabinet.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-chicagotribune", "description": "Like most patriotic Americans, I've been a fan of Joe the Plumber ever since Fox News told me I should be a fan of Joe the Plumber.
