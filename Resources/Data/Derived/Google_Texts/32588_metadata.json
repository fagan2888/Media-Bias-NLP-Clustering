Though there have been no documented cases of victims who became ill from playing with asbestos-tainted crayons or toys, the EWG Action Fund said the presence of asbestos in these products was only discovered recently and decades may pass before disease symptoms develop.\n\nThe brand of crayons that tested positive \u2013 Amscan Crayons, Disney Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Nickelodeon Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Crayons and Saban\u2019s Power Rangers Super Megaforce \u2013 were purchased between February and May at Party City and Dollar Tree and were all made in China.\n\nThe EWG Action Fund also found traces of asbestos in two kid crime lab kits \u2013 EduScience Deluxe Forensics Lab Kit with black fingerprint powder and Inside Intelligence Secret Spy kit with white fingerprint powder \u2013 both of which were made in China. The kits were purchased from Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and Buy-Rite.\n\nThe EWG Action Fund said the asbestos fibers found in the tested products most likely came from contaminated talc, which is used as a binding agent in crayons and in the powder used in crime scene fingerprint kits, since asbestos is often found in mines alongside talc deposits.\n\nThe group is backing the bill Sen.
