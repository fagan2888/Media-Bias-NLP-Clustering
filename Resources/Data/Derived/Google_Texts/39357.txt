Tax season is upon us. This year, the filing deadline has been bumped to April 18, instead of the traditional April 15. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't start preparing now. 'You should be very proactive about filing your taxes,' said Tina Powell, CEO of SheCapital, an investment management platform. Whether you're working with a tax professional or filing on your own, Powell said consumers should be aware of a relatively new document which proves you have health insurance. 'The Affordable Care Act now basically mandates that almost every U.S. taxpayer has to have some form of health care [insurance],' she said. 'The 1095 form, which comes in three different flavors (A, B and C), depending on how you get your medical coverage, just tells the IRS you are covered by some sort of medical plan.'
