(Feb. 8, 2016) – Steve Harvey is apologizing, again.

A new T-Mobile ad pokes fun at Harvey’s Miss Universe gaffe in which he announced the wrong winner. The commercial begins with an announcer praising Verizon’s service, but Harvey quickly interrupts.

“I have to apologize, again,” he says.

He then shows viewers a card that says T-Mobile doubled its coverage in the last year.

“I’m not taking responsibility on this one,” Harvey says. “Uh-uh! Verizon got it wrong! Yes! Not me!”
