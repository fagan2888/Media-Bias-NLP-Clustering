And usually, the term\u2019s final cases are among the Court\u2019s biggest- and potentially landmark decisions.\n\nBut this year, after the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia in February, an eight-person Supreme Court has conducted its business in a different fashion, with several major cases returned to lower courts after a tie vote or a unanimous decision to remand a case.\n\nFor example, the Court split in the Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association case, where it was asked to decide if requiring public school teachers to pay mandatory dues for union activities violated the First Amendment.\n\nThe tie vote affirmed the rights of public unions to ask teachers to pay union dues, in a one-sentence statement, sending the case back to lower courts to consider again.\n\nAnd in Monday\u2019s Zubik vs. Burwell decision on Obamacare, all eight Justices agreed that the Court wouldn\u2019t decide this dispute over Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate and religious rights, telling lower courts and the parties involved to find a compromise solution.\n\nCourt followers have pointed to three major cases that remain outstanding, sometimes theorizing or guessing how the Court and Chief Justice Roberts will handle them with a bench consisting of four conservatives and four liberals.\n\nThe oldest-pending major case is Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, which was heard on December 9, 2015. The case is a challenge to affirmative action at Texas\u2019 flagship public university. The University of Texas was required to admit all high school seniors who rank in the top 10 percent of their high school classes. Candidates for any remaining spots underwent a \u201cholistic\u201d evaluation process in which race is among the considered factors. The Court in 2013, the Court indeed issued a decision in the case, sending it back to the lower courts to be reviewed under a tougher constitutional standard.\n\nThen there is the case of Whole Women\u2019s Health v. Cole on abortion, which was heard on March 2, 2016. It is about a Texas law enacted in 2013 that would force about 75 percent of the state\u2019s abortion services to close. The law requires that doctors at clinics have hospital admitting privileges within 30 miles of the clinics, and that clinics have facilities equal to those of an outpatient surgical center. The Court is considering is an appeals court properly handled a question about if the new restrictions would actually work to protect the health of women, and if the law imposes an undue burden on women who seek abortions. The Court last ruled on the second question in a 1992 decision, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, which reaffirmed the Roe v. Wade decision of 1973.\n\nFinally, the Court is considering a challenge to President Obama\u2019s executive orders on immigration in United States v. Texas, which was heard on April 18, 2016. The dispute between the Obama administration and 26 states and includes questions about the ability of the states to sue the administration and the alleged unwillingness of President Obama to honor the Constitution\u2019s \u201cTake Care Clause\u201d to execute laws passed by Congress.\n\nTwo lower courts that ruled on the case agreed that the state of Texas had standing to sue the Obama administration because it had been potentially injured by immigration enforcement decisions, which could defer the deportation of 5 million undocumented immigrants. In November 2015, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court\u2019s injunction that blocked President Obama\u2019s executive orders on immigration from taking effect. The Supreme Court added the Take Care Clause issue when it accepted the case.\n\nAmong the other pending cases to be decided in the next four to six weeks are the corruption case of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, a case involving Puerto Rico and double jeopardy, and a question over the discovery of evidence during a traffic stop in Utah.\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nLooking back at Romer, a key Supreme Court decision about gay rights\n\nBefore Obergefell, there was Goodridge: The birth of same-sex marriage in America\n\nWhen do Supreme Court Justices recuse themselves from cases?\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "With the Supreme Court\u2019s surprising decision in the Obamacare contraception case on Monday, the high court is down to just three major decisions in the last month or so in its current term.", "title": "Supreme Court down to three major cases this term", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2016/05/supreme-court-down-to-three-major-cases-this-term/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Inside_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Inside_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-23T10:25:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T10:59:15+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/ncc/"}, "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Recent Stories on Constitution DailyLooking back at Romer, a key Supreme Court decision about gay rightsBefore Obergefell, there was Goodridge: The birth of same-sex marriage in AmericaWhen do Supreme Court Justices recuse themselves from cases?\nShare:EmailWith the Supreme Court\u2019s surprising decision in the Obamacare contraception case on Monday, the high court is down to just three major decisions in the last month or so in its current term.\nThe Supreme Court added the Take Care Clause issue when it accepted the case.\nThe oldest-pending major case is Fisher v.
