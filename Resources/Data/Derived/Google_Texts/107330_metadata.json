The U.S. healthcare payer market has been greatly impacted by the introduction of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).\n\nThe US healthcare BPO (business process outsourcing) market has great potential for growth owing to the measures taken by the government to curb ever-increasing healthcare costs. Other factors that have led to the growth of the market include developments and innovation in information technology and regulatory changes. Approximately 75% of US healthcare companies outsource their work to external locations. This is due to the shortage of qualified staff in key positions - such as nurses and coders - and due to the new set of rules and regulations that they need to comply with. Some services that are commonly outsourced are insurance claims processing, adjudication and receivables management, billing and coding services, radiology reporting, transcription services, and clinical outsourcing, among others.\n\nImplementation of various reforms such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) as well as the conversion from the ICD-9 coding system to the ICD-10 coding system (to be implemented by October 2014) has created an upward growth trend. Furthermore, constant improvements in the quality of work from destination countries have reinforced the confidence of various healthcare payers, providers, and pharmaceutical companies in outsourcing. This is considered as the key driver of the healthcare process outsourcing market. On the other hand, data security and confidentiality concerns are the restraints for the growth of the market.\n\nScope of the Report\n\nThe US Healthcare BPO Market, by Segment:\n\n- Payer\n\n- Provider\n\n- Pharmaceutical\n\nThe US Healthcare Payer Outsourcing Market, by Services:\n\n- Claims Processing\n\n- HR Services\n\n- Member Services/Customer Care\n\n- Finance and Accounts\n\nThe US Healthcare Provider Outsourcing Market, by Services:\n\n\n\n- Medical Billing\n\n- Medical Coding\n\n- Medical Transcription\n\n- Finance and Accounts\n\nThe US Healthcare Pharmaceutical Outsourcing Market, by Services:\n\n- CRO Market\n\n-- Drug Discovery\n\n-- Pre-clinical\n\n-- Phase I\n\n-- Phase II\n\n-- Phase III\n\n-- Phase IV\n\n-- Clinical Data Management and Biostatistics\n\n-- Medical Writing\n\n-- Regulatory Services Outsourcing\n\n-- Other Services\n\nCMO Market\n\n- API Manufacturing\n\n- Formulation & Packaging\n\nNon-clinical Services Market\n\n- Supply Chain Management and Logistics\n\n- Sales and Marketing Management\n\n- Other Non-clinical Functions\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n1 Introduction\n\n2 Executive Summary\n\n3 Market Overview\n\n4 U.S. Healthcare Payer Outsourcing Market, By Services\n\n5 U.S. Healthcare Provider Outsourcing Market, By Services\n\n6 U.S. Pharmaceutical Outsourcing Market, By Type\n\n7 Geographic Analysis\n\n8 Competitive Landscape\n\n9 Company Profiles\n\n9.1 Accenture Plc\n\n9.2 Accretive Health, Inc.\n\n9.3 Anthelio Healthcare Solutions, Inc.\n\n9.4 Boehringer Ingelheim Gmbh\n\n9.5 Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc.\n\n9.6 Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\n9.7 Covance, Inc.\n\n9.8 GEBBS Healthcare Solutions, Inc.\n\n9.9 Genpact Limited\n\n9.10 IBM Corporation\n\n9.11 ICON Plc\n\n9.12 Infosys Bpo Limited\n\n9.13 LONZA Group Ltd.\n\n9.14 Parexel International Corporation\n\n9.15 Quintiles Transnational Holdings, Inc.\n\n9.16 WNS (Holdings) Limited\n\nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/kv7qkx/us_healthcare_bpo\n\nResearch and Markets\n\nLaura Wood, Senior Manager.\n\npress@researchandmarkets.com\n\nU.S. Fax: +1-646-607-1907\n\nFax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716\n\nSector: Healthcare and Medical Devices\n\nSOURCE Research and Markets", "article_metadata": {"contentUrl": "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prn/20130307/600769", "geo.region": "united states of america, united kingdom, ireland", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "http://content.prnewswire.com/designimages/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "geo.placename": "DUBLIN, October 10", "description": "DUBLIN, October 10, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- US Healthcare BPO Market Report 2013: Payers, Providers and Pharmaceuticals -
