But they smell blood. If she fails to win the nomination again, or even comes close to failing, the spectacle could be as good for ratings as Donald Trump has been. Notwithstanding their devotion to maintaining the status quo, the temptation is too strong to resist.\n\nNow that the word is finally getting out, Sanders is appealing to ever-larger swathes of the population \u2013 including African Americans and Latinos. By courting black and Hispanic leaders, the Clintons have been \u201cfeeling the pain\u201d of those constituencies for as long as they have been serving corporate America.\n\nOver the years, that nearly effortless strategy has worked well. This is why, barely a month ago, they were confident that they could count on black and Hispanic voters. They are not so confident anymore.\n\nThis sudden turn of events has been building for a while, though the Clintons and their advisors didn\u2019t see it. Now it is driving them nuts, and causing them to lash out in strange ways.\n\nThe smart money is still on Hillary, of course; the system is stacked in her favor. But she is no longer the inevitable nominee. If she were, she would be the inevitable President too, because she would be running against Donald Trump or, worse, Ted Cruz, or some similarly risible and vile Republican that no sane voter would conceivably support. In 2016, sane voters still comprise a sizeable majority, and they are distributed in ways that give Democrats an advantage in the Electoral College.\n\nWhen Hillary seemed inevitable, hardly anyone who didn\u2019t think that breaking through \u201cthe glass ceiling\u201d was priority Number One \u2013 and two, three, and four \u2014 was enthusiastic about her impending victories.\n\nThe mood everywhere, except among her diehard supporters \u2013 and on the far right, where the Clintons have always been despised for the wrong reasons \u2014 was face reality and buck up.\n\nBut now that Hillary\u2019s inevitability is in doubt, her supporters find themselves needing arguments to justify their stance. Good ones are hard to find, especially when nearly all of her supporters agree that Bernie\u2019s policies are more to their liking.\n\nEven second wave feminists who actually like Hillary are on board with that. Why else would so many of them now be calling themselves \u201csocialist feminists?\u201d\n\nOne reason for liking the fact that Sanders was in the race, even when he seemed to have no chance at all of winning, was that his advocacy of what he calls \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d might at least rehabilitate the word. Evidently, it already has.\n\nMany Hillary supporters like Bernie more than their candidate, but they think that he is unelectable. This is hardly surprising: the conventional wisdom, to which many Democrats still subscribe, is that because he calls himself a \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d Sanders has no chance at all. But the conventional wisdom is wrong, and becoming more wrong with each passing day. Meanwhile, the flimsiness of the arguments favoring Hillary is becoming more apparent.\n\nOn the merits, the case for Hillary boils down to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, her \u201cpragmatism,\u201d the idea that she is entitled to the office, and, of course, her gender.\n\nHer r\u00e9sum\u00e9 does look good: First Lady of Arkansas, then of the United States; Senator, Secretary of state. Bernie\u2019s isn\u2019t bad either: Mayor, Congressman, Senator. But surely what matters is how well the two of them did in their respective offices; not just what offices they held.\n\nThis consideration is relevant to the pragmatism argument too. When Hillary is said to be more \u201cpragmatic\u201d than Bernie, the idea, it seems, is that she is more practical, more able to get things done. The best, her defenders remind us, is the enemy of the good; and Hillary, unlike Bernie, be counted on not to set her sights too high. Therefore, they claim, she can accomplish more in the end.\n\nThat this argument is dubious, to say the least, should be evident to anyone who reflects, if only for a moment, on what Hillary has actually accomplished in all her years in \u201cpublic service.\u201d I will return to this point presently.\n\nMeanwhile, the entitlement argument is so transparently wrong-headed that merely to state it is to refute it. Indeed, it is so plainly not compelling that it hardly ever is stated; only intimated. The idea is that after sticking it out with Bill for all those years, and then after losing to an upstart Senator from Illinois, Hillary has paid her dues. Therefore, the \u201cargument\u201d goes, it is her turn now.\n\nIn a more rational world, the glass ceiling argument would not seem much more compelling than that, despite all the brouhaha it elicits in the political universe we actually inhabit.\n\nBecause policies affecting women should matter more, even to those who accord the highest priority to feminist concerns, than a President\u2019s (\u201csocially constructed\u201d) private parts, a candidate\u2019s gender should not matter all that much. Sanders\u2019 stance, over many years, has been consistently feminist; for example, on the issue of equal pay for equal work.\n\nClinton is for equal pay too; but, for her, on matters affecting women, as on everything else, opportunism trumps all. Back in her First Lady of Arkansas days, when the youthful liberalism that her defenders now boast of was still fresh, she was on the Board of Directors of (Arkansas based) Wal-Mart, one of the country\u2019s most notorious violators of the equal pay principle. If, in that capacity, she did anything at all to change the corporate culture of that gigantesque, low wage schlock emporium, she has kept news of it to herself.\n\nEven so, the glass ceiling argument resonates powerfully in some quarters. But apart from identity concerns that are of dubious relevance and, in any case, beyond anyone\u2019s power to change, the only thing it has going for it is that it has a factual basis \u2014 unlike all the other arguments adduced in Hillary\u2019s favor. If elected, she would indeed be America\u2019s first woman President. None of the other pro-Hillary arguments have even that much going for them: they all on smoke and mirrors.\n\nTake her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Yes, she was Secretary of State for Obama\u2019s first term. But she was probably the most inept Secretary of State in living memory. Think \u201cLibya\u201d or \u201cArab Spring\u201d or \u201cSyria,\u201d and, if still not convinced, read Diana Johnstone\u2019s book, Queen of Chaos. It takes talent and effort to mess up so much so thoroughly.\n\nThere is Hillary the liberal imperialist in the Middle East, the \u201chumanitarian intervener\u201d; and there is Hillary the neocon, doing mischief in Ukraine and the South China Sea, unnerving Russia and keeping those uppity Chinese in their place.\n\nCan anyone really think that it is worth resuming Cold Wars and risking nuclear wars just so that someone with lady parts can sit in the Oval Office?\n\nThere is also the anti-whistleblower Hillary; on that count, she is even worse than President Drone himself. Ask Edward Snowden or any of her other victims whose revelations she found embarrassing.\n\nAnd, yes, she has been working on thew health care issue for two and a half decades. The signal contribution of her efforts in the early nineties was to set the cause back a generation. She also set the stage for the ways that Obamacare further entrenches the power of private insurance companies, Big Pharma, and the for-profit health care industry.\n\nWhat, then, has she accomplished? One of the most remarkable features of the political scene these days is that, on this question, the conventional wisdom could not be more wrong. The know-it-alls give Hillary an A; a fairer grade would be an F.\n\nThis puts the case for \u201cpragmatism,\u201d Hillary\u2019s and everybody else\u2019s, in perspective.\n\nTo philosophers, pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that began in the United States in the late nineteenth century and that remains influential to this day. C.S. Peirce (1839-1914), William James (1842-1910), and John Dewey (1859-1952) were early and influential pragmatists. In the middle decades of the twentieth century, interest in pragmatism waned; in more recent decades, many notable philosophers rediscovered and took up pragmatist themes; above all, the idea that the way to clarify and understand a theoretical contention is to explore its practical consequences. In line with this general idea, pragmatists developed distinctive conceptions of truth, and related epistemological and ethical doctrines.\n\nWhat \u201cpragmatism\u201d means in plain English \u2013 and therefore in the bloviations of media commentators and Hillary defenders \u2013 bears little connection to any of this, except in highly attenuated ways. However, in both cases, there is an emphasis on practicality; on doing, rather than merely theorizing.\n\nThis is why I cannot resist mentioning a quip of the late Sidney Morgenbesser\u2019s about pragmatism \u2013 that applies as much to Hillary Clinton\u2019s stump speeches as to Charles Peirce\u2019s philosophical speculations.\n\nMorgenbesser was a rare intelligence, some would say a force of nature; known, perhaps unfairly, less for his ideas than for his seemingly preternatural wit and apt commentaries on other philosophers\u2019 work. Of pragmatism, he said, with complete acuity, that while it\u2019s true in theory, in practice it just doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThat\u2019s the problem with Hillary\u2019s pragmatism: it just doesn\u2019t work. One would think that \u201cprogressive\u201d politicians would get more done by not stirring the pot, by aiming always for the (barely) good enough, and that nothing good could come from rattling the cages of plutocrats and the simpletons they dupe into voting for their interests instead of their own. It\u2019s only commonsense.\n\nBut, in the real world of politics, commonsense often fails \u2014 especially, these days, in the United States. This should be obvious; an abundance of evidence suggests that Hillary-style pragmatists finish last.\n\nEven those who think, for example, that Barack Obama means well, or at least better than the facts on the ground suggest, but that Republican obstinacy blocked his good intentions at every turn, should agree that with a little more \u201caudacity\u201d (his word), he would have gotten more done.\n\nI am not one of those who think that Obama\u2019s intentions are generally laudable, but, to hear her talk, Hillary is; and so are her apologists, including the ones who call themselves socialist feminists.\n\nEven so, you\u2019d think that they wouldn\u2019t be quite so eager to repeat the mistake that they, along with most liberals, made with Obama \u2013 at least not when there is someone they can vote for as a Democrat, someone who actually could win, who would not be as inclined to concede ninety percent at the get go, as Obama does and as Hillary surely would, and then, as negotiations proceed, to give up the other ten percent without a fight.\n\nYou\u2019d think that they\u2019d be more open to the idea that a little less \u201cpragmatism\u201d might be just what is called for right now; and that it would occur to them that if they really want to prioritize practical consequences, and if their goal really is to advance \u201cprogressive\u201d outcomes, that the time is past due to scuttle Hillary\u2019s way because it has proved itself a failure, time and again.\n\nHillary\u2019s pragmatism doesn\u2019t work in practice not just because she is not, as Obama claims, \u201csmart as a whip\u201d and a veritable policy wizard, but also because, like Obama and Democrats generally, she is useless for pressing her own case. The only thing Democrats do well is implement Republican programs; sometimes in face saving ways, sometimes not.\n\nParadoxical as it might seem, it might occur to them that Bernie Sanders\u2019 more principled, less compromising way might just work better in practice than anything Hillary would be inclined to do.\n\nThis would certainly be the case if his campaign leads to a \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d another term Sanders has rehabilitated. It is not clear that he really means what those words\n\nseem to say; after all, a political revolution would require bottom-up, democratic organizing; not top-down deployment of volunteer enthusiasts seeking votes.\n\nBut Sanders\u2019 campaign could lead to that; win or lose, it could help bring it about. So far, though, there is no indication that what he has in mind is any more innovative or radical than what he has in mind by \u201cdemocratic socialism.\u201d Nevertheless, three cheers (or maybe two and a half) for getting those words in circulation. Who knows what good may come of it!\n\nHillary Unhinged\n\nBernie\u2019s rise is causing the Queen of Chaos and her minions to strike back in ways that seem a little over the top. So much l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 from so many is making them a little crazy.\n\nTheir first instinct has been to escalate the same old same old: to harp on Hillary\u2019s experience, her foreign policy savvy, even her health care reform expertise. In a more informed world, this would be laughable, and even in the actual world it would be useless if the Clintons didn\u2019t have so many pundits and journalists doing the heavy lifting for them. The liberal wing of the chattering class has been serving the Clintons faithfully for years.\n\nEven so, sometimes, the sheer preposterousness of what Clinton and her handlers are up to nevertheless shines through. Witness how in the January 17 South Carolina Democratic candidates debate, Hillary wrapped herself in the mantle of President Obama, and all but pledged her willingness to die to maintain Obamacare. Even mainstream commentators found this odd.\n\nIt was, after all, in the South Carolina primary in 2008 that Obama knocked the inevitability out of Hillary before; and it was in South Carolina that her better half had all kinds of bad things to say about the fellow who shellacked her. Memories are short in the media world, but not in Clinton-land, so why all the lovey-dovey now?\n\nThe answer is obvious: with her fortunes falling, and with all the high minded, fatuous chatter lately about Obama\u2019s glorious \u201clegacy,\u201d it seemed that there might be some percentage in latching on to Obama\u2019s (imaginary) aura. Like the Donald, a Clinton will do what a Clinton\u2019s gotta do \u2013 anything for the (self-serving) cause.\n\nThe parallel with Trump is instructive.\n\nBack in Bill\u2019s day, people used to say that the Clintons gave opportunism a bad name. By being so much better at it, Trump might almost redeem the idea. Witness, for example, his repeated excoriations of New Hampshire\u2019s \u201cbedrock conservative\u201d newspaper, The Union Leader.\n\nDoes Trump care about The Union Leader? Hardly, it\u2019s not worth caring about. But going after it titillates the Trump sector of the Republican base, the old white guys (and the women who love them) who see through and therefore despise \u201cbedrock conservatives\u201d as much as they despise namby-pamby liberals. The result is that The Union Leader is taken down a notch or two, and New Hampshire and the world are better off for it.\n\nIn fairness to Clinton, it must be said that the more outrageous Trump is, the better he does. As he put it himself, he could shoot somebody and his supporters wouldn\u2019t mind. Hillary, on the other hand, has to keep the namby-pambies on her side. She must therefore maintain a civil fa\u00e7ade.\n\nGiven her priorities and her natural inclinations, this must be hard for her.\n\nThe Clintons used to dismiss everyone to their left \u2013 in other words, the majority of Democratic voters \u2014 with barely concealed contempt. Why not? With nowhere else to go, everyone to the left of Rahm Emanuel could be taken for granted, leaving Bill and Hillary\u2019s Wall Street cronies and corporate paymasters in unfettered charge. This only began to change when Sanders started breathing down Hillary\u2019s neck.\n\nEven with her many apologists racking up overtime hours, she therefore now has to pretend that she cares \u2013 either that or she will have to contend with a \u201cSocialists for Trump\u201d movement in the months ahead.\n\nI am being facetious, of course. But if, as I believe, the latest incarnation of the Donald as an anti-Muslim, anti-Hispanic racist with authoritarian tendencies and a retrograde view of the world is driven more by his mountebank nature and his determination to win than by his feelings or convictions \u2014 if its purpose is only to con his marks so that he can get what he wants (presumably, the GOP nomination, though even that is not clear) \u2014 a Socialists for Trump movement, directed against the Clintonized Democratic Party would not be a bad idea at all. As long as there was no chance that Trump might actually win, I could even see myself signing on.\n\nWhat Democrat, after all, could have brought down the House of Bush and inflicted mortal \u2013 perhaps fatal \u2014 wounds on the Grand Old Party. Now he is going after Fox News! This doesn\u2019t cancel out all the vileness, but still: for doing all this and more, it is hard not to cry out Viva Trump! Again, I am being facetious \u2013 sort of.\n\nTrump\u2019s vileness is Hillary\u2019s greatest weapon. It helps her supporters reinvigorate lesser evil thinking in quarters where even the most obtuse liberals are finally beginning to realize how disabling lesser evil politics can be.\n\nThat Team Hillary would want to make their candidate seem the lesser evil \u2013 or not evil at all, just \u201cpragmatic\u201d \u2013 is not surprising. But for them to then go on to say that Sanders isn\u2019t radical or idealistic enough, or that a vote for him is a vote for the bad old days, defies credulity.\n\nYet this is their line these days, and it looks like they may be sticking with it for a while longer, depending on which way the wind blows.\n\nHow else to explain Hillary\u2019s recently discovered affection and respect for Obama and Obamacare? She has even gotten daughter Chelsea, the presumptive dauphine, in on the act. Chelsea was the stalking horse sent up to Connecticut, to Miss Porter\u2019s School, alma mater of the former Jacqueline Bouvier, to tell the assembled young ladies there that, on the off chance that the inevitable doesn\u2019t come to pass, Bernie is waiting in the wings \u2013 eager to scuttle Obamacare, leaving millions uninsured. When the cable news wallahs didn\u2019t ridicule this argument to oblivion, Hillary took it up herself.\n\nThat Bernie isn\u2019t radical enough goes without saying; the point has been made over and over, several times a day on this site alone. But for a Clinton to say it is grotesque.\n\nPerhaps this is why Hillary prefers to use surrogates \u2013 not just to redbait Bernie, but also to claim that he isn\u2019t red (in the pre-red/blue divide sense) enough. Consistency has never been a Clinton virtue.\n\n***\n\nThe best kind of surrogate is somebody who is clever, who has access to corporate media, and who is not expressly connected with the Clintons at all. Enter, stage left, the vaunted Atlantic columnist Ta-Nehisi Coates.\n\nIn just the past week, he has pressed an anti-Bernie and therefore implicitly pro-Hillary case \u2013 he denies the implication \u2014 in two prominent venues: an op-ed in The New York Times and in his regular column in The Atlantic.\n\nCoates is an ingenious writer, the kind that could be fun to engage with \u2014 or so it seems to me, but then I also like arguing with libertarians and theists and even Zionists, if they are not so fervent that they won\u2019t acknowledge absurdities in the positions they defend.\n\nToo bad, in Coates\u2019 case, that his ingenious side is so blatantly disingenuous; especially when he faults Sanders for not enthusing over the idea that African Americans should be paid reparations for slavery, and for trading off \u201cidealism\u201d for practicality in other key instances as well.\n\nReparations? Not only is the idea a non-starter politically; it is not even clear what it would mean \u2013 in practice. It is relevant too that, except for occasional rumblings spread out over decades, there has never been a serious political movement promoting reparations for the sake of restorative justice, or black empowerment, or for any other plausible rationale.\n\nIt also goes without saying that the idea has probably never crossed Hillary Clinton\u2019s mind.\n\nIf there ever was a time for reparations, it was a century and a half ago. It has been clear to almost everyone since then that racial oppression is better addressed in other ways, including those that involve diminishing economic inequality overall. This is Sanders\u2019 position, but that isn\u2019t good enough for Coates.\n\nOf course, Clinton fares no better on this account but, according to Coates, it doesn\u2019t matter because she is a pragmatic Democrat, not a socialist idealist. Huh? Clear away the obfuscations, and all that remains is the always-dubious pragmatism argument \u2013 as plain a non-starter as can be.\n\nCoates makes an important substantive point too; one that others have been making for at least the last sixty or seventy years. It is instructive to revisit that point, even so, because it touches indirectly on issues that the Sanders versus Clinton contest has raised.\n\nSince the late fifties, if not before, black intellectuals have argued that oppressions based on race and class, though interrelated, are logically and politically distinct, and therefore that efforts to end white supremacy and to establish full citizenship rights for persons of color require strategies different from those that address problems of economic inequality. By now, this lesson has been learned many times over.\n\nFeminists have been making a similar point about feminist concerns for nearly as long. Now that \u201csocialism\u201d is no longer a forbidden word, the issues have become clouded, so it needs to be pointed out that socialist feminism is neither a kind of feminism nor a kind of socialism. Socialist feminists are socialists and feminists. The words denote a political orientation in which socialist and feminist concerns are coherently and constructively combined.\n\nFor similar reasons, it would make sense to talk about \u201csocialist anti-racists.\u201d Nobody does talk this way because, at least in the American case, the reality that expression describes has never been in doubt; socialists, including Communists, were always in the forefront of anti-racist struggles, and while socialist movements still thrived, anti-racist militants, African American ones especially, were more likely than not to identify with them.\n\nTheir socialism took many forms \u2013 from the Bernie Sanders (New Deal- Great Society liberalism) variety to the real deal.\n\nThen, the country and the world took a neoliberal turn \u2013 to the detriment of socialism mainly, but also to efforts to improve the material condition of African Americans and other persons of color. They came to the cause late in the day, but the Clintons nevertheless played an important role in implementing this ruinous transformation.\n\nFortunately, efforts to improve the integration and social standing of a minority of African Americans and others, and to enhance their opportunities to flourish even in a neoliberal world, continued, as it were, on auto-pilot; the inertia established in better days being powerful enough to carry the project along.\n\nCoates makes the point again about the irreducibility of race to class. It is not clear why he bothers; one would be hard put to find anyone who would disagree.\n\nThis is not to say that everyone thinks that all oppressions are created equal; that there are no structural or causal priorities that must be taken into account. That unfortunate understanding has indeed taken hold \u2013 in part because, with socialist (including Marxist) ideologies out of fashion, many people no longer know better. Nevertheless, the clearest minds still accord causal priority to classes and their struggles.\n\nMaybe Coates does too. But in faulting Sanders for not taking race seriously enough, he conveys the opposite impression. In any case, Sanders is a politician running for President, not a political theorist or ideologue. Faulting him for endorsing, or failing to endorse, positions only political theorists or ideologues care about is, to say the least, wrong-headed.\n\nYet this is what Coates seems to be doing \u2013 very likely for Hillary Clinton\u2019s sake.\n\nCoates doesn\u2019t address the underlying theoretical issues directly any more than Sanders does. One wouldn\u2019t expect that from a columnist in the neoliberal Atlantic magazine, just as one shouldn\u2019t expect it from a seasoned Senator running in Democratic Party caucuses and primaries.\n\nWhat one can rightfully expect from someone in Sanders\u2019 situation are policy prescriptions that would be likely, in one way or another, to make African Americans and other persons of color better off. On that score, the Senator is doing fine; better, without a doubt, than Hillary Clinton.\n\nSo, in the end, the case for Hillary comes down to gender. It isn\u2019t much of a case at all, but as the going keeps getting tougher for her, expect her to play that card as often as she can.\n\nObama contributes to efforts to combat racism just by being there. Beyond that, his neoliberal policies and his accommodations to the demands of empire have almost certainly done more harm than good.\n\nHillary would be good for women in that way too \u2013 by the mere fact of being there. This highly defeasible point in her favor accounts for whatever plausibility the glass ceiling argument has, and therefore whatever plausibility the case for Hillary has.\n\nWould she therefore, on balance, be better for women than Sanders would? Perhaps; it is impossible to say. But, in view of her indomitable opportunism, it is fair to be skeptical; and to point out, with apologies to that nasty old Clintonite, James Carville, that \u2014 it\u2019s the policies, stupid.\n\nWhat Clinton offers is sophistry, Coates-style or worse, and, like Obama, her new Best Friend Forever, illusions grounded in identity politics. If there is a chance to do better \u2013 then why not grab it!\n\nLet\u2019s stipulate: Bernie is not much better than Hillary on foreign and military affairs \u2013 matters Presidents affect most \u2013 and his \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d amounts to little more than refurbished New Deal \u2013 Great Society liberalism. But at least, he is a straight shooter; a man of integrity whose heart is in the right place.\n\nThat this is not enough to turn the country around is clear, but it is also clear that the reasons why have little, if anything, to do with the shortcomings of his policy proposals on race or anything else (including foreign policy).\n\nOnly a mobilized and indignant citizenry taking charge of its own affairs \u2013 a real political revolution\u2013 can bring about fundamental change for the better. Can a Sanders victory, or even an honorable defeat, help with that? It is not impossible.\n\nBecause he is not a self-serving billionaire like Trump, and not \u201cpragmatic\u201d in the way that Clinton is, and because he is as unlikely as can be ever to want to garner corporate contributions to some Foundation he might someday decide to concoct, or to receive obscenely high speakers\u2019 fees from plutocrats seeking favors, or to succumb to any of the other corruptions to which the Clintons, like most politicians, are susceptible, he is the only candidate in many years, perhaps in living memory, who, win or lose, has any prospect at all of igniting the kind of people-led, people-driven insurgency that America and the world desperately need.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "www.counterpunch.org", "description": "I never thought I\u2019d see the day, I don\u2019t think anybody imagined it would happen, but, by late December, Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign had caught on to such an extent that corporate media and National Pu\u2026", "title": "Inevitability Lost: the Clintonites Strike Back", "url": "http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/01/29/inevitability-lost-the-clintonites-strike-back/", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/dropzone/2016/01/shutterstock_328825136.jpg", "height": 334}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-29T09:05:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-29T01:59:13+00:00"}, "description": "I never thought I\u2019d see the day, I don\u2019t think anybody imagined it would happen, but, by late December, Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign had caught on to such an extent that corporate media and National Public Radio, corporate media\u2019s fellow traveler, could no longer pretend that it wasn\u2019t happening.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturers of conventional wisdom still favor Hillary, and still color their reporting accordingly.
