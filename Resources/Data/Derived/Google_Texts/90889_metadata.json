Coakley ruling, the Court had previously established in Hill v. Colorado that protestors must keep an eight-foot distance from persons entering a health care facility when they were within 100-feet of a health care facility.\n\nSEE ALSO: Supreme Court poised to decide birth-control dispute\n\nThe Massachusetts law was a broader ban that said activists could not protest within 35-feet of a health care facility.\n\nAccording to Leslie Kendrick, a professor who teaches First Amendment issues at the University of Virginia School of Law, the boundaries that protect a person\u2019s personal space when they are entering a health care facility as they were established in Hill may still be valid.\n\n\u201cNothing of this opinion says that Hill is not a good law,\u201d Prof. Kendrick told The Washington Times. \u201cWhat the Court was saying in this opinion was that the Massachusetts law is the only one like it in the country, and so basically they\u2019re striking a law that\u2019s a lone wolf, a law that is out there by itself, and they also gave examples of other kinds of regulations that they said would be perfectly fine.\u201d\n\nProf. Kendrick said that nothing in the opinion also excluded Massachusetts from reverting back to its original buffer zone that kept activists 6-feet from any person who was within 18 feet of a health care clinic.\n\n\u201cMassachusetts used to have a law like the one in Colorado and they changed it,\u201d she explained. Could Massachusetts go back to that law? The Court certainly did not say they could not go back to that old law.\u201d\n\nIn Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 controlling opinion, he emphasized that the Court\u2019s rationale stemmed from the fact that sidewalks are traditional open forums that were meant to cater to the free marketplace of ideas.\n\n\u201cThe Massachusetts Act violates the First Amendment,\u201d he wrote in the majority opinion. \u201cBy its very terms, the Act restricts access to public way[s]\u201d and sidewalk[s], places that have traditionally been open for speech activities and that the Court has accordingly labeled \u201ctraditional public fora\u2026 The government\u2019s ability to limit speech in such locations is very limited\u2026 [and] the buffer zones burden substantially more speech than necessary to achieve the Commonwealth\u2019s asserted interests.\u201d\n\nWhile the Court conceded that some of the people who stand outside abortion clinics may want to express \u201ctheir moral or religious opposition to abortion through\u2026 more aggressive methods such as face to face confrontation,\u201d the Court argued that the some engage in peaceful \u201csidewalk counseling,\u201d merely offering information about alternatives to abortion.\n\nThe Court expressed concerns in that the law suppressed of free speech in that the petitioners \u201csay they have had fewer conversations and distributed many fewer leaflets since the zones went into effect.\u201d\n\nThe Act was punishable by a $500 fine and up to three months in jail while a subsequent offense was punishable up to two and a half years in prison and a fine up to $5,000.\n\nFurthermore, the law exempted only four classes of individuals: (1) \u201cpersons entering or leaving such a facility,\u201d; (2) employees or agents of such a facility acting within the scope of their employment;\u201d (3) \u201claw enforcement, ambulance firefighting, utilities, public works employees and other municipal agents,\u201d; and (4) \u201cpersons using the public sidewalk or street right-of-way adjacent to such facility solely for the purpose of reaching a destination other than such facility.\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts statute also exempted clinic \u201cescorts\u201d whose job it was to \u201cthwart the petitioner\u2019s attempts to communicate with patients by blocking petitioners from handling literature to patients, telling patients not to pay any attention or listen\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Court took issue with that since sidewalks have traditionally been considered a place for the exchange of ideas because, \u201cthere a listener often encounters speech he might otherwise tune out,\u201d and that exempting some people from the law and not others was harmful to the First Amendment.\n\nThe Court illuminated this point with a 1984 decision, FCC v. League of Women Voters, reiterating that it is the First Amendment\u2019s purpose \u201cto preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail.\u201d\n\nProf. Kendrick said that it is unclear how McCullen effect other buffer zone related regulations and future cases.\n\n\u201cWhat happens to other laws that are variations on these buffer zones? It\u2019s going to be a matter of what lower courts say because the Supreme Court can\u2019t rule on every one of them. How lower courts rule on these decisions in the future may be what sets the tone.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Jeffrey Scott Shapiro is a legal analyst for the Washington Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It started out as a hotly contested case that revived the decades old pro-choice vs. pro-life argument, but on Thursday the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously struck down a Massachusetts law that banned protestors within 35 feet of entrances, exists and driveways of abortion clinics.", "Author": "Jeffrey Scott Shapiro", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "It started out as a hotly contested case that revived the decades old pro-choice vs. pro-life argument, but on Thursday the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously struck down a Massachusetts law that banned protestors within 35 feet of entrances, exists and driveways of abortion clinics.", "title": "SHAPIRO: Supreme Court strikes down expanded abortion clinic buffer zone", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/28/supreme-court-strikes-down-expanded-abortion-clini/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/26/supreme-courtjpeg-0ee0c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/26/supreme-courtjpeg-0ee0c.jpg", "title": "SHAPIRO: Supreme Court strikes down expanded abortion clinic buffer zo", "description": "It started out as a hotly contested case that revived the decades old pro-choice vs. pro-life argument, but on Thursday the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously struck down a Massachusetts law that banned p", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, US Supreme Court, Leslie Kendrick"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf340\"", "article_summary": "The law expanded an earlier established Massachusetts buffer zone that kept activists 6-feet from any person who was within 18 feet of a health care clinic.\nBefore Thursday\u2019s unanimous 9-0 McCullen v.
