That means there is no chance that the Libyan government can fight back the advance of ISIS. Things are about to get messy, and U.S. air strikes will put only a small dent in a big problem.\n\nRelated: The Two ISIS Battles That Could Change the Face of the Middle East\n\nAccording to U.S. intelligence figures, there are an estimated 6,000 ISIS fighters now in Libya, headquartered in the town of Sirte, as Oilprice.com has reported in the past. From here, they control hundreds of miles of coastline. There is nothing in Sirte they want; this is simply a strategic base.\n\nISIS fighters have also been tracked down to Benghazi, but here they have not solidified control yet. Still, Benghazi is an important recruitment venue. More specifically, this is where it can combine forces with it radical brethren in the form of Ansar al-Sharia and other radical factions. Benghazi is where ISIS gets bigger. And its pace of recruitment is faster than anything we\u2019ve ever seen before. It absorbs new radical factions wherever it goes. The more successful its attacks and territory grabs, the more successful its recruiting becomes. In Libya, the former prowess of Ansar al-Sharia has quickly waned. ISIS is more brutal, and more decisive. It\u2019s either join or be killed.\n\nISIS\u2019 ability to launch attacks is not limited to Sirte, which is just the staging ground, or even to Benghazi. It can attack pretty much anywhere using hit-and-runs and suicide bombings.\n\nSo what is it after? There is a multipronged strategy here. The first is to get closer to Europe. The second is to get closer to Africa. The third is to get closer to more oil revenues to fill quickly depleting coffers in Syria and northern Iraq.\n\nThe ISIS Oil Picture in Libya\n\nThere is no oil in Sirte, but ISIS was able to take control of this area because no one was really paying attention. The tribes here are loyal to Gaddafi, but they took a backseat to Ansar al-Sharia, which in turn took a backseat to ISIS when it arrived.\n\nRelated: Al-Qaeda Is Taking Control of a Pivotal Middle-East Country\n\nISIS has largely been allowed to run amuck in and around Sirte because the raging civil war that pits two rival Libyan governments against each other has left the country incapable of fighting off the ISIS advance. But now ISIS is targeting Libyan oil installations\u2014and this is what invites U.S. air strikes.\n\nLast month, ISIS attacked Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, which lie east of Sirte and beyond its area of control. Es Sider is an oil port, and Libya\u2019s largest export terminal, with a capacity to export nearly 450,000 barrels per day. Ras Lanuf is a refining area. Ras Lanuf has storage tanks, and the tank attacked by ISIS was holding about 400,000 barrels of oil. The attack on Ras Lanuf was captured onvideo.\n\nBoth Es Sider and Ras Lanuf have been closed since December 2014\u2014victims of the civil war that is largely a battle for control over the country\u2019s oil wealth. They are perilously located right between ISIS-controlled Sirte and Benghazi in the east.\n\nBut ISIS has farther-reaching oil plans in Libya. It\u2019s going after the producing fields in the southern desert.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Who ISIS Would Vote for in the US Presidential Election\n\nIn a video, ISIS made it clear that it had no plans to stop at Es Sider and Ras Lanuf: \"Today Es Sider port and Ras Lanuf and tomorrow the port of Brega and after the ports of Tobruk, Es Serir, Jallo, and al-Kufra.\"\n\nWhen it gets a foothold in the southern desert\u2019s oil crescent, this will be the point of no return.\n\nISIS has already secured the route to the \u201coil crescent\u201d, which encompasses all the producing fields in the southern desert. It\u2019s done this by taking control of thedesert town of Nufaliya, which is about 50 kilometers from Es Sider.\n\nAt stake here is Libya\u2019s 48 billion barrels of estimated reserves\u2014the largest in Africa. The civil war alone has shut down over three-quarters of Libya\u2019s production, which might be good for the current oil supply glut, but it\u2019s very bad for Libya and regional stability.\n\nUS air strikes won\u2019t likely be enough. ISIS has already cleared a path to the oil crescent, and without a functioning, unified government in Libya, there is no chance of heading them off effectively. Air strikes are but a bandage on a gaping wound.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.
