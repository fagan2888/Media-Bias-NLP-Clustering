The recommendations also quantify what a moderate intake of alcohol is for adult men and women of drinking age.\n\nBut the guidelines only mention \u201cprocessed meats\u201d four times, and the term \u201cred meat\u201d doesn\u2019t appear at all.\n\nRelated: Chipotle Sued for Misleading Investors Over Food Safety\n\nThe near-omissions come after the World Health Organization in October classified processed meats as carcinogenic to people\u2014the same grouping as tobacco and asbestos\u2014and red meat as probably carcinogenic to humans.\n\nA study from WHO\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer found that a person who eats 50 grams of processed meat a day\u2014the equivalent of two slices of Oscar Mayer beef bologna\u2014increases their risk of colon and rectal cancer by 18 percent. The study also suggested\u2014though does not prove\u2014that the risk of colorectal cancer could increase by 17 percent for every 3.5-ounces of red meat eaten daily. For comparison\u2019s sake, a Burger King Whopper packs a 4-ounce patty.\n\nThese hazards are absent in the U.S. guidelines. But they weren\u2019t always.\n\nWhen the scientific report that informs the guidelines was released in February, a healthy dietary pattern included the same good foods found in Thursday\u2019s guidelines, but the report went further. It said a healthy dietary pattern is \u201clower in red and processed meats.\u201d\n\nRelated: Read This Before You Bite into Your Next Hamburger\n\nThe report also offered the following evidence:\n\n\"Diets that are higher in red/processed meats, French fries/potatoes, and sources of sugars (i.e., sodas, sweets, and dessert foods) are associated with a greater colon/rectal cancer risk.\n\n\u201cPatterns higher in red and/or processed meats were generally associated with greater age- related cognitive impairment.\n\n\u201cPatterns emphasizing red and processed meats and refined sugar were generally associated with increased risk of depression.\u201d\n\nThe scientific report concluded that \u201chigher intake of red and processed meats was identified as detrimental compared to lower intake.\u201d\n\nThe guidelines released Thursday only state that lower intakes of processed meat, among other foods, are \u201ccharacteristics of healthy eating patterns,\u201d and went so far to assure the public that eating processed meats \u201ccan be accommodated.\u201d Again, the term \u201cred meat\u201d was not included.\n\nWhat happened? In March, 71 members of Congress, including the chair of the agriculture committee Mike Conaway (R-TX), the No. 2 recipient of political donations from the livestock industry, sent a letter to the secretaries of agriculture and health and human services expressing their issues with the scientific report, which included its treatment of red meat.\n\nRelated: Love Clean Food? Here's a New Eating Disorder for You\n\n\u201cThe DGAC\u2019s recommendation on lean red meat directly contradicts years of peer reviewed scientific research on the benefits of lean red meat as a high quality source of protein in a healthy diet,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cIt is crucial for HHS and the USDA to recognize the need for flexibility in the American diet that reflects the diverse population of this country.\u201d\n\nDuring the public comment period, more than 30,000 comments were received, including those with issues on how red meat was treated in the report. At a hearing in October in front of the House agriculture committee, Agriculture Secretary Vilsack backed away from the report\u2019s harsher stance on red meat.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the issue of red meat, it is fairly clear that there is a recognition that lean meat is, and should be, part of a healthy diet,\u201d he testified. No one mentioned processed meat.\n\nIn December, Congress mandated a peer review of the dietary guidelines by the National Academy of Medicine, a step never taken before, in the 2016 Omnibus Bill.\n\nBy this week, bacon, boloney and red meat were back on the kitchen table.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Just over two months after processed meats were deemed a possible carcinogen, quashing", "title": "The Glaring Omission in the New Dietary Guidelines Is Bad for Your Health", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/08/Glaring-Omission-New-Dietary-Guidelines-Bad-Your-Health", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04252011_Steak2_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/08/Glaring-Omission-New-Dietary-Guidelines-Bad-Your-Health", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04252011_Steak2_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Just over two months after processed meats were deemed a possible carcinogen, quashing", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "But the guidelines only mention \u201cprocessed meats\u201d four times, and the term \u201cred meat\u201d doesn\u2019t appear at all.\nWhen the scientific report that informs the guidelines was released in February, a healthy dietary pattern included the same good foods found in Thursday\u2019s guidelines, but the report went further.\nBy this week, bacon, boloney and red meat were back on the kitchen table.\nAt a hearing in October in front of the House agriculture committee, Agriculture Secretary Vilsack backed away from the report\u2019s harsher stance on red meat.\nNo one mentioned processed meat."}
