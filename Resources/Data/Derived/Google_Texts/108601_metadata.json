You\u2019re mature enough to buy a house. You\u2019re mature enough to enlist in the armed forces and hoist a rifle. So the idea that you\u2019re somehow immature enough to decide whether or not to have a beer strikes me as being absurd.\u201d\n\nUnder a federal law enacted in 1984 that was sponsored by then-U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, states that have a drinking age lower than 21 lose millions in highway funds.\n\nCarroll acknowledges that the loss of federal highway funds has deterred states from lowering their drinking ages. He contends that provision might not hold up in courts today, pointing to a 2012 opinion by the Supreme Court that severed from the Affordable Care Act a provision that withheld pre-existing Medicaid funding from states that opted not to expand Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThe Obamacare case said you can\u2019t hold a state hostage. You can\u2019t say you must use or must adopt a particular program or we\u2019ll take away your Medicaid money,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cThis case actually came up in the \u201880s, I think, and they said it was legal. But I\u2019m not sure that the same case would not meet with a different fate before the Supreme Court today.\u201d\n\nCarroll also advocates that Congress pass a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Scott Garrett of New Jersey, the Surface Transportation and Taxation Equity Act. The idea, proposed for more than a decade without action, would let states could opt out of the federal transportation program and instead keep the 18.4 cents per gallon federal tax collected within their borders.\n\nNew Jersey 101.5 FM\n\nProfessor Helene White of Rutgers University\u2019s Center of Alcohol Studies said a lower drinking age would have safety and potential health impacts.\n\n\u201cThe main impact would be on traffic fatalities. Previous research has demonstrated that when it was lowered from 21 to 18, there was an increase in fatalities among younger drivers, and when it was raised back from 18 to 21 there was a decrease. So that\u2019s probably the most significant effect that research has shown,\u201d White said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s another serious problem among young people drinking heavily, and that\u2019s brain impairment. More and more research is showing that the adolescent brain continues to develop up until around age 25 and that heavy drinking through that period can have negative consequences that may last,\u201d she said.\n\nRutgers Professor Helene White (Photo: rutgers.edu)\n\n\u201cBased on the brain research, one would set the legal limit at age 25, not at age 21,\u201d White said.\n\nCarroll\u2019s bill, A3210, isn\u2019t likely to get traction in Trenton, where it\u2019s drawing no initial interest from the legislative leaders who set the agenda.\n\nPlenty of bills are introduced that have no chance of becoming law, and many never even receive a hearing. In the two-year session that expired last month, only around 400 bills and resolutions were enacted out of the more than 9,000 introduced. (In fairness, some were identical bills.)\n\n\u201cIf every bill you put in, you expected to pass, you\u2019d be an idiot. Especially when you\u2019re in the minority,\u201d said Carroll, a lawmaker since 1996. \u201cBut what I have noticed over the years is that when you put in a bill often enough, oft times an idea which people dismiss right on the upfront as being impossible, or what have you, all of a sudden becomes the law.\u201d\n\nAmong Carroll\u2019s more ambitious ideas currently pending in the Legislature are repealing all campaign-finance and lobbying laws, allowing self-service gasoline and letting guns owners carry their weapons, either openly or concealed, in most places without a permit.\n\n\u201cWho knows? The power of a good idea sometimes takes a lot of time to assert itself,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, most states set their minimum drinking age at 21, according to the 2012 book \u201cCollege Drinking and Drug Use.\u201d After 18-year-olds were being drafted to serve in the Vietnam War, and the 26th Amendment gave 18-year-olds the right to vote in 1970, half the states lowered their drinking age to 18. By 1988, with national highway funds in jeopardy, all the states had returned their drinking age to 21.\n\nNew Jersey lowered its drinking age from 21 to 18 in 1973, raised it to 19 in 1980, then returned it to 21 in 1983.\n\nAmong the countries that allow alcohol consumption, only some states in India have a higher minimum legal drinking age than the United States.\n\nAnd of course, even with the drinking age of 21, people younger than that drink alcohol.\n\nAccording to the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, around 260,000 people in New Jersey between the ages of 12 and 20 used alcohol in the past month, according to 2013 and 2014 surveys. That amounted to roughly one-in-four people in that age range.\n\nAround 161,000 people ages 12 to 20 in New Jersey had binged, meaning at least five or more drinks on a single occasion.\n\n\u201cJust because we have the 18- to 20-year-olds not being allowed to drink doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t drink,\u201d White said. \u201cThey drink, and in fact rates of drinking in this age group are higher in the United States than several European countries with an age 18 legal limit.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/nj1015.com/files/2016/02/RS10578_524368283.jpg", "sailthru.author": "michaelsymons", "description": "It's unlikely to happen soon, but a lawmaker says that if 18-year-olds can vote, buy a house or serve in the military, that teen should be able to buy beer.", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey 101.5", "description": "It's unlikely to happen soon, but a lawmaker says that if 18-year-olds can vote, buy a house or serve in the military, that teen should be able to buy beer.", "title": "Lower NJ drinking age to 18?
