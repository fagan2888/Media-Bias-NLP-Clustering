I laughed self-consciously. These days it seems we\u2019re supposed to feel sorry about saying sorry.\n\nThe verdict is indeed in: It appears that some of us \u2014 pointedly, women \u2014 are saying the word \u201ctoo much.\u201d The articles and the pretty female-empowerment ads argue that \u201csorry\u201d is tantamount to supplication and to admitting our worthlessness \u2014 that it undermines our power and denies our self-possession, or that it betrays our gender and progress.\n\nBut my salon \u201csorry\u201d did not diminish my sense of worth, or stem from a blithering lack of self-confidence. It was simply meant to acknowledge that the space was limited, and that I could imagine my neighbor\u2019s discomfort in my making it, for a moment, tinier still. My neighbor\u2019s \u201csorry,\u201d even further from an apology, was a small kindness nonetheless \u2014 a verbal token to let me know that she did not blame me for limitations beyond my control, but shared in their burden with me. It was not, in short, a finger-pointing damnation, but a benign commiseration.\n\nSure, we would have survived without the exchange. It was a fleeting near-nothing. But it lightened that unpleasant space, and our moods. Why should we feel sorry for that?\n\nThe confusion seems to be, at root, definitional. In Georgetown University linguist Deborah Tannen\u2019s book \u201cTalking from 9 to 5: Men and Women at Work,\u201d she argues that \u201cfor many women, and a fair number of men, saying \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 isn\u2019t literally an apology; it is a ritual way of restoring balance to a conversation.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve seen this disparity at work: In a rush, rounding a corner, I narrowly missed running into an equally harried male colleague \u2013 and he into me. \u201cSorry,\u201d I offered.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault,\u201d he chastised. \u201cBut it\u2019s OK.\u201d My empathic intention had been commandeered.\n\nTannen describes this kind of situation as a conversational imbalance: I used \u201csorry\u201d to mean \u201cI\u2019m sorry this happened,\u201d to express regret without taking or assigning blame. My colleague took my \u201csorry\u201d as an admission of wrongdoing, and worse.\n\nThe problem, then, is no one\u2019s, or, more precisely, everyone\u2019s. The question, therefore, should not be, \u201cWhy do women apologize too much?\u201d but \u201cWhy do men and women use \u2018sorry\u2019 differently?\u201d It could be neurologic difference, or socialized pressure, or enculturated American individualism, or most likely all that and more, combined and twisted. But it is striking that before we understand the answers, we are only asking American women to apologize less, and not American men to apologize more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The question isn't \u201cWhy do women apologize too much?\u201d \u2014 but \u201cWhy do men and women use \"sorry\" so differently?
