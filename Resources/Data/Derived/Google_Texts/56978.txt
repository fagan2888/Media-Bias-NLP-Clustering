Billionaire high-tech executive Marc Benioff, who has supported President Barack Obama, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Hillary Clinton, said he will only donate to politicians who promise to give the tech industry massive increases in guest-worker visas.

According to Business Insider, Benioff, the Salesforce.com CEO, “wants the government to give more H1-B visas to the tech industry so that bright kids who study and graduate from U.S. universities can stay and get jobs here” and suggested that “the visa should [be] ‘stapled to them’ when they graduate.” Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) noted that stapling visas to the diplomas of high-tech graduates would give cash-strapped universities incentives to admit foreigners willing to pay to obtain visas.

Benioff made his remarks at a recent Disrupt conference in San Francisco, and Business Insider noted that he was among the “billionaires that donated $25,000 to a SuperPAC for Hillary Clinton” in January. The high-tech industry has come under fire for demanding guest-worker visas that would lower the wages of American workers while they are laying off thousands of Americans.
