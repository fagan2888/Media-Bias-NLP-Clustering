Christopher Tuttle was also convicted and served a prison term in the same case.\n\nMaury County Assistant District Attorney General Brent Cooper, who prosecuted Jerry Tuttle last week, argued Friday that $1.1 million in cash seized during the raid at his home was buried on Tuttle\u2019s property at 4571 Dugger Road for safe-keeping until he and his son were released from prison.\n\nIn 2000, the father and son \u201cwere moving, apparently, thousands of pounds of marijuana at that time in Middle Tennessee, in our community,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAnd they got lucky back then because the officers only found a little over $100,000 that was at Jerry\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nCooper continued, saying evidence presented in last week\u2019s trial was \u201coverwhelming\u201d that Jerry Tuttle had at least $1.1 million more buried on his property, dug it up about a year before his arrest during the April 24, 2012 raid at his Dugger Road trailer, and hid it in the trunk of a Honda Civic parked in front of his trailer.\n\n\u201cProof is also overwhelming that when Chris and Jerry both went to prison for what they were doing back in 2000, that they weren\u2019t rehabilitated, they didn\u2019t learn their lesson, they didn\u2019t decide to go straight,\u201d Cooper continued.\n\n\u201cIt appears that Jerry was siphoning off part of that money that wasn\u2019t found back in 2000, the million dollars that I\u2019m sure they dreamed about when they were laying their little heads on those thin prison pillows when they were in the penitentiary.\u201d\n\nWhen Christopher Tuttle was released from prison in 2011, Cooper maintained, he and his father went right back into the dope and money laundering business.\n\nJerry Tuttle\u2019s attorney, John Colley, countered that there was no proof that the father and son continued their conspiracy while they were in prison, adding, \u201cWe don\u2019t know when the criminal conduct occurred that led to those funds that led him to acquire these vehicles.\u201d\n\nThe vehicles Colley referred to included dozens of cars, trucks and motorcycles, as well as expensive farm equipment that Jerry Tuttle said he used to earn his living as a farmer with a hay-mowing business.\n\nAs for the cash, Colley said to Hargrove, \u201cAre we going to hand over all that money, including the 600 bucks a month that he got from (U.S.) Treasury, as drug proceeds?\u201d\n\nExcept for the credit union account that received Jerry Tuttle\u2019s Social Security payments, as well as any personal property and vehicles he purchased before his 2007 release from prison, Hargrove\u2019s ruling answered Colley\u2019s question.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly everything seized during a raid at convicted drug conspirator Jerry Tuttle's
