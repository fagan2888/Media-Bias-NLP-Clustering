He\u2019ll drive next season in the No. 78 Toyota Camry after driving a Chevrolet the last two seasons.\n\nToyota\u2019s major partnership is with Joe Gibbs Racing, which has all four drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship. Toyota was in the market for another team with the collapse of Michael Waltrip Racing.\n\nFRR had shared a technical alliance with Richard Childress Racing. It will now pair up with JGR and Truex will join a stout lineup of drivers that include Kyle Busch, Denny Hamlin, Carl Edwards and Matt Kenseth.\n\nTruex has found a home at Furniture Row, a one-car operation based in Denver, Colorado, far removed from NASCAR\u2019s North Carolina hub. The 35-year-old Truex has one win this season with crew chief Cole Pearn and he made the Chase.\n\n\u201cI feel like the team that I have right now is the best I\u2019ve ever been with,\u201d Truex said Sunday at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to doing that for another year and we\u2019ll see where that takes us.\u201d\n\nFRR hoped to expand to two cars in 2017 if it can secure the needed sponsorship.\n\n\u201cFor them to have the courage to make this change is something,\u201d said David Wilson, president and general manager of TRD. \u201cThis is now the second time they\u2019ve made the Chase and it puts a lot of pressure on all of us to perform. It\u2019s somewhat of a leap of faith they\u2019re taking, because you could argue, \u2018Why make a change?\u2019 as well as they\u2019re running. But it\u2019s the belief we collectively share in how we can even be better yet.\u201d\n\nTruex, in his second season with FRR, drove a Toyota for MWR from 2010 to 2013. Furniture Row made its NASCAR debut in 2005 and has qualified for the Chase in two of the last season seasons. It was the first single-car team to earn a Chase berth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just begun a growth spurt that will take us to a new level,\u201d Truex said.\n\nEven with success in a Chevy, FRR general manager Joe Garone said the opportunity to align with JGR and Toyota was too good to pass up. Toyota will provide engines to FRR.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to find a platform to continue our growth and Toyota gives us that growth, platform,\u201d he said. \u201cIt puts us perfectly where we want to head. Being a single-car team that wants to expand, it\u2019s going to help give us some tools.\u201d\n\nGarone said Chevrolet did not make a push to keep FRR.\n\n\u201cWe thank Furniture Row Racing for all of the team\u2019s hard work and accomplishments over the past decade, and we wish (owner) Barney Visser and his organization continued success with their future endeavors,\u201d said Jim Campbell, Chevy\u2019s vice president of performance vehicles and motorsports.\n\nToyota joined Sprint Cup in 2007 and partnered a year later with JGR. It\u2019s the clear favorite to win the championship.\n\n\u201cThe way things have worked out for the Toyota cars right now is perfect timing, especially coming into the Chase,\u201d Garone said.\n\nJoe Gibbs said the organizations are \u201cstill working through all the ways we have to work together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think what they bring is another crew chief that can help solve problems,\u201d Gibbs said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Martin Truex Jr. earns extension with Furniture Row, jumps to Toyota", "title": "Martin Truex Jr. earns extension with Furniture Row, jumps to Toyota", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/27/martin-truex-jr-earns-extension-with-furniture-row-jumps-to-toyota/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150905__Martin-truexp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150905__Martin-truexp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-27T13:13:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T23:58:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LOUDON, N.H. \u2014 Martin Truex Jr. is sticking with Furniture Row Racing for 2016 \u2014 only he\u2019ll make a hopeful championship push in a Toyota.\nTruex has found a home at Furniture Row, a one-car operation based in Denver, Colorado, far removed from NASCAR\u2019s North Carolina hub.\nFurniture Row made its NASCAR debut in 2005 and has qualified for the Chase in two of the last season seasons.\nToyota\u2019s major partnership is with Joe Gibbs Racing, which has all four drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship.\nThe 35-year-old Truex has one win this season with crew chief Cole Pearn and he made the Chase."}
