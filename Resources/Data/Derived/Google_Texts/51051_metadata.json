I think it\u2019s some of the highest health care costs in the country, and we found we haven\u2019t been able to bring in enough premiums to cover the costs of claims on an individual market,\u201d Gootee said.\n\nCurrently moving through the legislature is Senate Bill 206, which would offer a reinsurance program for \u201chigh risk\u201d residents with an insurer assessment to cover the costs of this program.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the two companies offering individual health insurance policies for Alaskans on the federally facilitated health insurance marketplace has announced that it will be withdrawing from that market next year.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press and KTUU Staff", "og": {"url": "http://www.ktuu.com/content/news/Moda-Health-leaving-Alaska-individual-health-market-in-2017-377894351.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/590*315/-img1-vid-Nurses-shortage.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "One of the two companies offering individual health insurance policies for Alaskans on the federally facilitated health insurance marketplace has announced that it will be withdrawing from that market next year.", "title": "Moda Health leaving Alaska individual health market in 2017"}, "keywords": "Moda Health leaving Alaska individual health market in 2017", "fb": {"pages": 108536136665}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "Ekfe7F10APF9lA_aZSyoeluUx0NOasQYSceH-HGbJk4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Moda Health leaving Alaska individual"}, "article_summary": "Moda Health Insurance announced Monday morning that it will not be providing healthcare insurance for Alaska\u2019s individual market in 2017.\nMonday's announcement by Moda Health will leave Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield as the only company providing individual health insurance policies in the state.\n\u201cA single insurer does not allow for adequate choice for the 23,000 Alaskan consumers on the individual market, and is even more of a concern given that Premera is also experiencing significant losses in Alaska\u2019s individual market,\u201d Wing-Heier wrote.\n\u201cWe have experienced a pretty significant financial loss in the last two years in the individual market in Alaska,\u201d said Jason Gootee, Moda\u2019s Director of Alaska Sales and Service.\nGootee says high claim costs and a relatively small market size in Alaska have been ongoing concerns for the company."}
