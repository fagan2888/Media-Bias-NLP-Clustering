Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it best in 2012: \u201cOur top political priority over the next two years should be to deny President Obama a second term.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s how they\u2019ve governed in the Obama era. Like political arsonists, they\u2019ve pursued no real positive agenda, choosing instead to undermine the president and stage symbolic protest votes to appease a disillusioned base. This is a big reason why something like 13 percent of the country approves of the job Congress is doing.\n\nFor a brief moment, when Paul Ryan was elected Speaker of the House, there was hope that things might change, if only a little. Although Ryan is hardly a moderate, he is nonetheless a serious legislator. His victory, one hoped, was a sign that House Republicans finally saw the light, finally realized that obstructionism wasn\u2019t a viable governing philosophy.\n\nWell, that\u2019s not happening.\n\nThere were already rumbles in conservative circles after Ryan agreed to pass $1.1 trillion spending bill earlier this month. To the hardliners on the right, any deal that removed the threat of a government shutdown constituted a gutless compromise, a conservative heresy.\n\nNow it appears that Ryan earned the faint support of Congressional Republicans by promising to get back to the business of negation and legislative navel-gazing. This was evident in Ryan\u2019s statement about his plans for Congress in January:\n\n\u201cWhen we return in January, the House will put an ObamaCare repeal bill on the floor and pass it and put it on the president\u2019s desk\u2026We are going to keep working to give families relief from this law while we work to dismantle and replace it altogether.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that a Republican-led Congress has already tried 56 times to repeal ObamaCare, knowing they never had the veto-proof majority they need. Each of these votes, like the recent Benghazi hearing, was a masturbatory exercise in political theater. Achieving a tangible legislative outcome was never the goal; instead, they were blinkered protest events, designed to please the Tea Party wing of the GOP.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The only goal of Republicans in Congress the last 7 years has been to stymie Obama, 2016 will be no different", "title": "All they want to do is screw over the president: Ryan, McConnell confirm they have no real agenda in \u201916 besides blocking Obama", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The only goal of Republicans in Congress the last 7 years has been to stymie Obama, 2016 will be no different", "title": "All they want to do is screw over the president: Ryan, McConnell confirm they have no real agenda in \u201916 besides blocking Obama", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/04/all_they_want_to_do_is_screw_over_the_president_ryan_mcconnell_confirm_they_have_no_real_agenda_in_16_besides_blocking_obama/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/mcconnell_ryan3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The only goal of Republicans in Congress the last 7 years has been to stymie Obama, 2016 will be no different", "title": "All they want to do is screw over the president: Ryan, McConnell confirm they have no real agenda in \u201916 besides blocking Obama", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/mcconnell_ryan3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean Illing", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, benghazi committee hearing, congressional republicans, Editor's Picks, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, Planned Parenthood, President Obama, Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd48\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 Elections, benghazi committee hearing, congressional republicans, Editor's Picks, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, Planned Parenthood, President Obama, Republican Party, Elections News, News, Politics NewsSince President Obama took office, Congressional Republicans have made it their business to obstruct everything he does.\nHis victory, one hoped, was a sign that House Republicans finally saw the light, finally realized that obstructionism wasn\u2019t a viable governing philosophy.\nLike political arsonists, they\u2019ve pursued no real positive agenda, choosing instead to undermine the president and stage symbolic protest votes to appease a disillusioned base.\nNow it appears that Ryan earned the faint support of Congressional Republicans by promising to get back to the business of negation and legislative navel-gazing.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it best in 2012: \u201cOur top political priority over the next two years should be to deny President Obama a second term.\u201dAnd that\u2019s how they\u2019ve governed in the Obama era."}
