Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is among the top contenders. As such, you may want to know a little more about him and, specifically, how some of his policy proposals would affect your finances.\n\nWhether Cruz or any other potential president will accomplish the goals outlined in their campaigns is a huge unknown; regardless, they\u2019re helpful to review as the election gets underway. We\u2019re putting together these summaries for all the frontrunners, and we\u2019ve already published pieces on how a Donald Trump or Sen. Bernie Sanders presidency could affect your money. Here are some changes you might experience if Cruz wins on election day.\n\nGet Your Free Credit Score & Monitoring Plus Weekly Updates From Our 50+ Experts Get It Now\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n1. Health Care Reform\n\nCruz wants to repeal \u201cevery word of Obamacare,\u201d according to his website. That would eliminate things like requirements that all Americans have health insurance (or face a penalty) and insurers cover people with pre-existing conditions (among many other things the law specifies). Depending on your personal insurance situation, that could help you save money or it could cost you more. It all really depends on how Cruz plans on enacting reforms to \u201cmake health care personal, portable, and affordable.\u201d In short, a President Cruz would want to change the way we pay for health care.\n\n2. A Smaller Government\n\nCruz proposes eliminating the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Education, the Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). He calls it his Five for Freedom plan.\n\nIf you rely on any of those departments for anything \u2014 say, you want to buy a home with an Federal Housing Administration loan, a program administered by HUD \u2014 a Cruz presidency could significantly disrupt your plans. That\u2019s not to say he\u2019ll get rid of everything these departments do (his website said his administration would determine if any programs need to remain intact), but it seems impossible that these departments could disappear without sending shockwaves through certain populations.\n\nThese departments do a lot of things that directly affect Americans\u2019 finances. The Department of Education is a good example: What would happen to student loans and programs the department runs, like student loan forgiveness? Given how many people use federal student loans to pay for college and how much student loan debt Americans have ($1.3 trillion of mostly federal loans), that\u2019s no small question.

A \u2018More Stable Dollar\u2019\n\nCruz has highlighted dollar instability as an economic woe for the U.S., saying that a highly valued dollar tends to lower prices and be good for the consumer, but that\u2019s not good for manufacturers and exporters. A low dollar can result in the opposite, costing consumers but helping to grow the economy. He is proposing stabilizing the dollar by auditing the Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cA rules-based monetary system would restore stability to the dollar and to the international currency system,\u201d his website reads. \u201cThis will help us get beyond these cycles of boom, bust, and malaise, and return us to rising productivity, strong economic growth, and higher incomes for all.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say how this proposal would affect your finances directly since stabilizing the dollar at high or low value will inherently be good for some and bad for others (and Cruz didn\u2019t specify what he meant by \u201cstable.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThe problem is there\u2019s upsides and downsides to having a strong and weak dollar, and they both serve a purpose,\u201d said Samuel Rines, an economist and portfolio manager with Chilton Capital in Houston. On top of that, the act of stabilizing currency is really complicated.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whether we wanted a stable currency, we would have to make a determination of how we would do that,\u201d Rines said. It\u2019s not just up to the United States. The economies of other countries affect the value of the dollar. \u201cIt would be really difficult to enact,\u201d he said.\n\n4. Lower Taxes\n\nCruz proposes a Simple Flat Tax. Instead of the seven existing tax brackets, everyone will pay a 10% income tax, but for a family of four, the first $36,000 will be tax-free. For tax year 2015, the lowest bracket starts at a 10% tax. Cruz says that tax change will increase wages by 12.2%. Note: With the proposed dissolution of the IRS, it\u2019s unclear if you\u2019ll have to file taxes to make sure you\u2019re paying your required 10%. At any rate (pun intended), the way you pay taxes is likely to significantly change under a Cruz administration.\n\n5. Job Creation\n\nCruz also claims that the Simple Flat Tax will create more than 4.8 million jobs. He\u2019s also pitching approval of the Keystone Pipeline and similar projects that will expand oil, natural gas and ethanol operations, which he says will fuel job creation. So, if you\u2019re among the 5.5% of unemployed Americans, that\u2019s something to consider.\n\nMore Money-Saving Reads:\n\nImage: CrushRush", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Credit.com", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://blog.credit.com/2016/02/5-ways-your-money-could-be-affected-by-a-ted-cruz-presidency-136176/", "article_author_name": "Christine DiGangi", "image": "//cache-blog.credit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ted_cruz.jpg", "site_id": "b7019d11c34f5e8ba3eb19028e0b5f7b", "article_published_time": "2016-02-02T05:01:45+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-27T04:05:23+00:00", "keywords": "federal taxes, government, politics, presidency, ted cruz, how would ted cruz presidency affect my money, personal finance", "wp_version": "7.8.0.0"}, "description": "Want to know how a Ted Cruz administration would impact your wallet?
