REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS) - RTX17FD8\n\n4072486\n\nA top House Democrat slammed Obamacare\u2019s inability \u201cto work\u201d \u2014 but only after he announced his impending retirement from Congress.\n\n12-term Virginia Rep. Jim Moran, an Appropriations Committee member who said this month that he will not seek re-election in 2014, said that not enough young people are signing up for Obamacare coverage to make the law work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that the millennials, if you will, are less likely to sign up. I think they feel more independent, I think they feel a little more invulnerable than prior generations. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get enough young people signing up to make this bill work as it was intended to financially,\u201d Moran said in an interview with WAMU American University Radio.\n\n\u201cAnd, frankly, there\u2019s some legitimacy to their concern because the government spends about $7 for the elderly for every $1 it spends on the young,\u201d Moran said.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to do it frankly. If we had a solution I\u2019d be telling the president right now,\u201d Moran said.\n\nMoran voted for President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which depends on young healthy \u201cinvincibles\u201d to sign up for health insurance exchanges to offset the high number of older, sicker people that drive rates up and make Obamacare plans more expensive.\n\nObama will likely make his case for Obamacare\u2019s success at his State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Lil' late, buddy", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A top House Democrat slammed Obamacare's inability \"to work\" --- but only after he announced his impending retirement from Congress.    12-term Virginia Rep.
