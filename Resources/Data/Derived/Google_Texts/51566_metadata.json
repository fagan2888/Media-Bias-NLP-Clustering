Alabamians who are in the market for health insurance can apply online using the federal exchange, which covers 37 states, along with state-based exchanges. The open enrollment period ends Feb. 15 of next year.\n\nGov. Bentley announced in Nov. of 2012 that Alabama \u2014 like many other states around the country \u2014 would refuse to set up an ObamaCare-mandated health insurance exchange at the state level.\n\n\u201cI am not going to set up a state-based exchange that will create a tax burden of up to $50 million on the people of Alabama,\u201d he said. \u201cAs governor, I cannot support adding such a tax burden onto our citizens.\u201d\n\nBut in spite of ObamaCare\u2019s disastrous rollout; many states\u2019 decision not to participate in the exchange; countless lawsuits; and congressional Republicans\u2019 numerous attempts to repeal it, the Obama administration continues to push forward.\n\nMost recently, several videos surfaced of Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist who was one of the chief architects of ObamaCare, admitting that the administration used a \u201clack of transparency\u201d and exploited the \u201cstupidity of the American voter\u201d to push the law through.\n\nBut for most citizens, it\u2019s the law\u2019s promise of accessible and affordable healthcare that matters the most.\n\nSo does ObamaCare deliver on its promises?\n\nMany Alabamians have already come forward with stories illustrating that the president\u2019s assurance that \u201cIf you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor\u201d turned out to be inaccurate.\n\nAnd now it looks like the already-rising costs for many businesses and individuals purchasing insurance in the private market will be compounded by the rising cost of insurance provided through the exchange.\n\nAccording to data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, federal health exchange rates are going up by as much as 29.5 percent in some parts of the country in 2015.\n\nIn Alabama, rates will increase next year in 65 of the state\u2019s 67 counties.\n\nFor details on how your county will be effect, check out the graphic below. Counties are listed in order from largest increase down the to the two counties \u2014 Mobile and Limestone \u2014 where exchange rates will go down.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Yellowhammer News", "description": "ObamaCare 2.0 rolled out over the weekend with open enrollment beginning Saturday morning.
