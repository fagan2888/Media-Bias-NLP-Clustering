I have no idea what would lead to this.\u201d\n\nAn emergency call was made from the townhome just outside Monument, about 20 miles north of Colorado Springs, at 5:25 p.m. Friday, she said.\n\nWhen deputies arrived, they found the mother and the boy on the driveway.\n\n\u201cThe mother had been stabbed multiple times,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cIt appears the boy either fell or jumped out of the third-story window. It was at least 30 feet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the mother or a neighbor called 911. After the boy stabbed his mother, she searched for the boy and found him on the pavement, Kirby said.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence that he is the one who did the stabbing, but we will have to wait until the investigation is completed until we know for sure what happened,\u201d Kirby said.\n\nThe woman and her son were the only two people who lived in the townhome and the only two inside when the incident took place.\n\nThe circumstances leading to the stabbing are still under investigation. Deputies canvassed the neighborhood looking for witnesses who may know something pertinent to the assault.\n\n\u201cI think this is a little more challenging to investigate given the condition of the mother and boy,\u201d Kirby said.\n\nThe El Paso County district attorney\u2019s office will determine what charges to file and whether the boy will be tried as an adult, Kirby said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all based on the circumstances,\u201d she said.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Monument: 11-year-old boy stabs mom, falls 30 feet from window", "title": "Monument: 11-year-old boy stabs mom, falls 30 feet from window", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/02/monument-11-year-old-boy-stabs-mom-falls-30-feet-from-window/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-02T10:50:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-02T10:50:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think this is a little more challenging to investigate given the condition of the mother and boy,\u201d Kirby said.\nAfter the boy stabbed his mother, she searched for the boy and found him on the pavement, Kirby said.\nThe El Paso County district attorney\u2019s office will determine what charges to file and whether the boy will be tried as an adult, Kirby said.\nThe mother and boy were treated at different Colorado Springs hospitals for serious injuries before being transported by helicopter to hospitals in the Denver area, El Paso County sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman Jacqueline Kirby said Saturday.\nWhen deputies arrived, they found the mother and the boy on the driveway."}
