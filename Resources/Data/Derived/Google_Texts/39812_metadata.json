Ted Cruz (R-TX) is off and running on his \u201cTake Off with Ted Cruz Country Christmas Tour.\u201d\n\nSaturday, Cruz before a crowd of roughly 1,500 people in the Eastern Shore suburbs of Mobile, Alabama, the first of two stops in that state.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAt a press gathering shortly before the rally itself, Cruz emphasized the importance of Alabama along with other so-called SEC primary states to the GOP\u2019s nominating process.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here in Alabama is what we\u2019re seeing all across the country,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing conservatives uniting, conservatives are coming together. We\u2019re seeing it in the early primary states. We\u2019re seeing it in Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada. But then we\u2019re seeing it across that SEC primary. That March 1 Super Tuesday is going to be a critical date in the Republican primary and I think Alabama is going to play a central role in ensuring the next Republican nominee for president and the next president of the United States is a strong and committed conservative.\n\nHe added:\n\nAnd what I\u2019m most encouraged about is we\u2019re seeing that old Reagan coalition coming together. We\u2019re conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians. We\u2019re seeing young people and Hispanics and African-Americans and Jewish voters and women and Reagan Democrats all coming together. And the way we win is we stand for the working men and women of this country. We fight a populist campaign on behalf of the working men and women who have gotten hammered by seven years of the Obama-Clinton economy and we run against the bipartisan corruption of Washington that is embodied by Hillary Clinton.\n\nCruz was formally introduced by hometown favorite Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), who months earlier had made an appearance at campaign rally for Cruz\u2019s opponent, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump.\n\nDuring the rally, Cruz received boisterous applause when he went through his list of first-day-in-office priorities, which included undoing President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions, ordering a Department of Justice investigation of Planned Parenthood, halting \u201cpersecution of religious liberty,\u201d terminating the nuclear deal the United States negotiated with Iran and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\n\nIn addition to those items, Cruz included the repeal of ObamaCare, ending the Department of Education\u2019s effort to institute Common Core, cutting off funding for sanctuary cities and ending welfare benefits for those in the United States illegally.\n\nCruz got perhaps his biggest response from attendees when he suggested Sessions would be a member of his cabinet.\n\n\u201cFor anyone who wonders \u2013 can we really, really secure the border?\u201d he said. \u201cI got three words for you: Secretary Jeff Sessions. You want to talk about a Homeland Security secretary that will go down there and build the wall himself?\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s appearance is the third of high-profile Republican presidential candidates to visit southwest Alabama in recent months. In August, Trump held a rally at Mobile\u2019s Ladd-Peebles Stadium and last month, former Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon Ben Carson spoke to supporters at an event on the University of South Alabama campus.\n\nIn addition to Sessions\u2019 attendance at the Cruz event, Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-AL), the congressman representing the district of which the rally was held, made an appearance.\n\nByrne told a gaggle of reporters that although he was not endorsing a candidate as of yet, he was glad to have Cruz visit the area.\n\n\u201cWe should all be honored to have somebody that could likely be the president of the United States here,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cWe had a great conversation. I\u2019m still looking at all the candidates. He is certainly one at the very top.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Cruz held a rally in Savannah, GA and will continue his tour Sunday with a stop in Birmingham. After Cruz will make stops in Tennessee and Arkansas before wrapping up his tour with two stops in Oklahoma on December 23.\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
