The new website is designed to educate the public about why a nonprescription oral contraceptive is needed. (You can\u2019t buy the Pill on the site.)\n\nIn the run-up to November\u2019s mid-term elections, some Republican Senate candidates also proposed making oral contraceptives available without prescription. Democratic opponents claimed that that this was merely an election year ploy to attract female voters by distracting them from the Republican Party\u2019s anti-abortion stance and the recent Hobby Lobby Supreme Court decision. Since over-the-counter drugs are not covered by health insurance, making birth control pills available without prescription would make the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate irrelevant.\n\nOral contraceptives are used by 16 percent of American women, the single-biggest birth control category, the National Center for Health Statistics reported last month, although that varies widely according to age, race, and level of education (graphic is here).\n\nThe idea for making birth control pills available without prescription in the United States is not new: it originated in the early 1990s among health care practitioners and population experts working in conjunction with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In 1992, Philip A. Corfman, director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, proclaimed at birth control conference: \u201cI think the pill is safer than aspirin and aspirin is available over the counter.'\u201d\n\nThe following year, the FDA announced it would hold an open hearing to discuss issues related to providing oral contraceptives without prescription but canceled it in response to public criticism from feminist health activists and consumer protection groups who had participated in the Senate hearings on the safety of the Pill in the 1970s and continued to argue that use of the Pill carried too many contraindications to be made available without prescription. \u201cDon\u2019t make the pill easier to acquire,\u201d pleaded Judy Norsigian, co-founder of the Boston Women\u2019s Health Book Collective (now Our Bodies Ourselves) Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen\u2019s health research group, argued that removing the prescription requirement would increase the use of the pills by women at risk for serious side effects. Cindy Pearson, executive director of the National Women\u2019s Health Network observed, \u201cA birth control prescription is the poor woman\u2019s ticket to health care.\u201d Women who visited a birth control clinic not only received a prescription for contraceptives, they were also screened for sexually transmitted diseases, high blood pressure, cancer, and other health problems.\n\nFor the next decade, proponents of OTC oral contraceptives focused on getting emergency contraception \u2013 a critically important but tiny slice of the market \u2013 approved by the FDA and making it available without prescription. (It was approved in 2000, with limitations, and is far harder to get in some other countries.) Then, in 2004, Ibis Reproductive Health created the Oral Contraceptives Over-the-Counter (OCOTC) Working Group \u201cto evaluate objectively the risks and benefits of demedicalizing contraceptive care, with an eye toward improving access to OCs and potentially other hormonal contraceptive methods by making them available without a prescription.\u201d\n\nThe new Free the Pill website is the latest step in the women\u2019s health advocacy organization\u2019s efforts to set the pill free from the prescription. Ibis Reproductive Health and its supporters cannot make oral contraceptives available over the counter on their own: for that to happen, they must persuade a drug company to file a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) with the FDA requesting that the pill be switched from prescription to over-the-counter status. No drug company in the United States has chosen to do so.\n\nIbis hopes that the new website will convince the public and drug manufacturers that a prescription free pill is needed.
