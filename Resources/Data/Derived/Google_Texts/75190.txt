A man is dead of an apparent gunshot wound in Sperry.

A man is dead of apparent gunshot wounds early Sunday morning near Sperry.



Emergency crews responded shortly after 2 a.m. to a home in the 4100 block of East 86th Street North.



Authorities say an elderly man the family allowed to live on their property shot and killed the victim, identified as William Kelley.



Deputies arrested Foster Fletcher, 78.Owasso ambulance crews tried to revive the 42-year-old Kelley, whose body was found near a white metal shop located outside the home. They could not save him.

Foster was booked on a complaint of first-degree murder.

Kelley's son said he and his father went out to the shop to get equipment to retrieve a four-wheeler that had gotten stuck in the mud. They encountered Fletcher, who did not seem to recognize them.

The elderly man went inside the shop and said he was calling police then opened fire on Kelley, deputies say.

An arrest report says when authorities arrived they found Kelley's body and a rifle lying nearby. A .22-caliber shell casing was on the floor near the rifle.

The report also states that there had been a previous incident involving Fletcher in March of this year. The elderly man had appeared confused during that incident and pulled a gun on a man.

Kelley's official cause of death will be determined by the medical examiner, Major Shannon Clark of the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office said in a news release.

Owasso police and firefighters and Turley firefighters assisted in the response to the homicide.
