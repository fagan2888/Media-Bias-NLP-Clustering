Error Reveals Donors and the Price of Access", "article_keywords": ["reveals", "documents", "group", "donors", "governors", "price", "political", "public", "access", "members", "error", "republican", "corporate", "gop", "association"], "article_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/us/republicans-corporate-donors-governors.html", "article_text": "With Congress producing so little legislation, governors\u2019 offices have become attractive targets, Mr. Wertheimer said. Last year, the Republican Governors Public Policy Committee allowed corporate donors to make their cases on how to carry out the Affordable Care Act; discuss hydraulic fracturing, an oil- and gas-exploration method regulated at the state level; and hash over state budgets just as coffers began to loosen.\n\nThe spokeswoman for the governors association, Gail Gitcho, said the organization did not reveal the names of donors to its tax-exempt arm, and she denounced CREW as a group of partisan hypocrites who refused to divulge their own donors as they unmasked others. CREW has for years maintained that it is nonpartisan, but last month, it was taken over by David Brock, a former conservative who now runs a network of groups aligned with Democrats.\n\n\u201cCREW accessed those documents from behind a password-protected website,\u201d Ms. Gitcho said. \u201cCREW hides behind the facade of an educational group when their only real purpose is to act as a liberal front group for Democrats.\u201d\n\nIn a tit for tat, the Republican association unearthed documents from the Democratic Governors Association that also name corporate donors and the benefits: meetings with Democratic governors, \u201cpreferred seating\u201d at policy discussions, and lavish receptions. But those documents do not detail contribution levels, nor do they reveal the corporate members of the Democratic association\u2019s own secretive 501(c)(4), the Center for Innovative Policy.\n\nAmong the R.G.A. documents is a 21-page schedule of the policy committee\u2019s Carlsbad meeting last year that lists which companies attended, who represented them and what they contributed. The most elite group, known as the Statesmen, whose members donated $250,000, included Aetna; Coca-Cola; Exxon Mobil; Koch Companies Public Sector, the lobbying arm of the highly political Koch Industries; Microsoft; Pfizer; UnitedHealth Group; and Walmart. The $100,000 Cabinet level included Aflac, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Comcast, Hewlett-Packard, Novartis, Shell Oil, Verizon Communications and Walgreen.\n\nPhoto\n\nOther documents detail, in part, what they received in return.\n\nOne 2009 document states the benefits of a Governors Board membership, for a $50,000 annual contribution or a one-time donation of $100,000, saying it \u201coffers the ability to bring their particular expertise to the political process while helping to support the Republican agenda.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBoard members received two tickets to \u201can exclusive breakfast with the Republican governors and members of their staff\u201d; three tickets to the Governors Forums Series, where \u201ca group of 5-8 governors discuss the best policy practices from around the country on a particular topic\u201d; and a D.C. Discussion Breakfast Series, among other events.\n\nIf they bump up to Cabinet Membership \u2014 $100,000 annually or a single payment of $200,000 \u2014 contributors also receive two invitations to \u201can exclusive Gubernatorial Dinner,\u201d an \u201cintimate gathering with the Republican governors and special Republican V.I.P. guests\u201d at the Willard InterContinental Hotel in Washington.\n\nPolitical finance experts say the practice apparently laid out in the documents is not illegal, and probably not unusual. In hundreds of pages posted online, the Republican governors group put it down in black and white.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that you don\u2019t suspect this, but here you see these companies paying the governors for access,\u201d said Melanie Sloan, the executive director of CREW. \u201cAmericans all think it\u2019s pay-to-play politics. This is what confirms it.\u201d\n\nDonors refused to comment on their membership in the 501(c)(4). But those who would speak more broadly said they had also given to Democrats. Cynthia Michener, a spokeswoman for Aetna, pointed to the company\u2019s public political contributions disclosure, which showed gifts of $300,000 each to the Republican and Democratic governors associations last year. It lists nothing to the two groups\u2019 tax-exempt arms.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe R.G.A. documents, dating to 2008, show just how well the governors\u2019 corporate contributors have been treated. Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah and the Mississippi governor at the time, Haley Barbour, hosted donors in 2010 at the St. Regis Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah, for an event featuring skiing and snowmobiling. At the association\u2019s 2012 annual conference in Las Vegas, donors not only received access to the governors, staff and \u201cV.I.P. guests,\u201d but were also treated to an \u201cunder the Eiffel Tower\u201d event at the Paris Las Vegas hotel\u2019s Chateau Nightclub, taken clay shooting and offered a \u201cback of house\u201d tour at Wynn Las Vegas.\n\nOf course, the perks came with a cost. Hotel room drops, the gifts welcoming attendees to Las Vegas, ran to $7,500 per sponsor. One donor was sought to sponsor wireless Internet in the meeting spaces for $25,000.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe governors association\u2019s 2011 annual conference in Orlando included a welcoming reception at Universal Studios\u2019 Wizarding World of Harry Potter, a golf swing clinic, afternoons at SeaWorld and Disney World, and a late-night party hosted by the lobbying firms Blank Rome Government Relations and Dutko Grayling.\n\nAlso in 2011, the Republican governors Rick Perry of Texas, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Bob McDonnell of Virginia gathered donors at the Newseum and the W Hotel, among other Washington sites, for dinners, senior staff briefings and an invitation-only breakfast.\n\nThis month, Mr. McDonnell, whose term ended in January, was convicted of public corruption charges for accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, loans and gifts from a donor. During the trial, Mr. McDonnell\u2019s tenure leading the Republican Governors Association came up often as a window into the group\u2019s high-stakes fund-raising.\n\nTax documents filed this year show that the R.G.A. raised $27 million last year, much of it from declared corporate donors such as Chrysler, Archer Daniels Midland, Altria and Genworth Financial.\n\nThe list of members of the tax-exempt arm of the governors association attending the Carlsbad symposium included three executives from Dutko Grayling, David Beightol, Mary Kay Hogan and Steve Palmer; Loren Monroe of BGR Group and his wife; three executives from WellPoint and Anthem Blue Cross, including Michael Prosio, who was a top aide to Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was the governor of California; and the utility representatives Stoney Burke, the chief lobbyist at Southern Company, and Brad Viator, the director of external affairs at the Edison Electric Institute.\n\nMany of the names of the R.G.A.\u2019s corporate donors would be expected: Allen Richardson, a government affairs manager at Koch Companies Public Sector; Randy Kozuch and Erika Scheffer, political affairs executives at the National Rifle Association; Bill Miller, the chief lobbyist at the Business Roundtable, which represents the chief executives of the largest companies; and Bill Guidera, the senior vice president of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation. Maria Cino, a longtime Republican political operative and former official in George W. Bush\u2019s administration, was there representing Hewlett-Packard.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140924125823, "twitter": {"description": "An unintended disclosure of documents from the Republican Governors Association opens a window onto corporate donors and the size of their checks.", "title": "G.O.P.
