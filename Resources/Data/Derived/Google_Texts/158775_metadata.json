It essentially blamed undocumented immigrants for the poor performance of the state economy in the early 1990s. The law called for cutting off benefits to undocumented immigrants: prohibiting their access to health care, public education, and other social services in California. It also required state authorities to report anyone who they suspected was undocumented. Status: The law passed with the support of 55 percent of the voters in 1994 but declared unconstitutional 1997. The law was killed in 1999 when a new governor, Democrat Gray Davis, refused to appeal a judicial decision that struck down most of the law. Even though short-lived, the legislation paved the way for harsher immigration laws to come. On the other hand, the strong reaction from the Hispanic community and immigration advocates propelled a drive for naturalization of legal residents and created as many as one million new voters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWhat would you do in their shoes?\u201d That\u2019s the question I ask my fellow conservative friends whenever we debate immigration, and in particular the questi...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-05-25 16:17:57 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "\u201cWhat would you do in their shoes?\u201d That\u2019s the question I ask my fellow conservative friends whenever we debate immigration, and in particular the questi...", "title": "Conservative: The Way We Treat Immigrants Is Wrongheaded And Counterproductive", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/24/conservative-immigration_n_5386506.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1815556/images/o-IMMIGRATION-PROTESTORS-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostPol", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1815556/images/o-IMMIGRATION-PROTESTORS-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "\u201cWhat would you do in their shoes?\u201d That\u2019s the question I ask my fellow conservative friends whenever we debate immigration, and in particular the questi...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Conservative: The Way We Treat Immigrants Is Wrongheaded And Counterproductive"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-05-24 16:17:57 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5386506", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "conservative-immigration,immigration reform,video,immigration,jeb bush", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "conservative-immigration,immigration reform,video,immigration,jeb bush", "published_time": "2014-05-24 16:17:57 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-05-24 16:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "It essentially blamed undocumented immigrants for the poor performance of the state economy in the early 1990s.\nThe law called for cutting off benefits to undocumented immigrants: prohibiting their access to health care, public education, and other social services in California.\nThe Template: California Proposition 187 (1994)California's Proposition 187 was submitted to the voters with the full support of then Republican governor Pete Wilson.\nStatus: The law passed with the support of 55 percent of the voters in 1994 but declared unconstitutional 1997.\nEven though short-lived, the legislation paved the way for harsher immigration laws to come."}
