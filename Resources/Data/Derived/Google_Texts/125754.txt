Having insurance coverage is no guarantee that New Jerseyans who want or need to see a psychiatrist will be able to find one, according to a survey commissioned by the Mental Health Association in New Jersey.

The survey was conducted after hearing complaints from people who called the association’s hotline about how difficult it was to find a psychiatrist who accepts insurance and was accepting new patients, said Carolyn Beauchamp, executive director of the association, a patient advocacy group.

Nearly half -- 49 percent -- said they were not accepting patients or would only accept new patients are narrow circumstances, the survey found.

Of the 1,550 board-certified psychiatrists in the state, just 702 of them were listed as participating in at least one of the major preferred provider organizations, or PPOs: Aetna, AmeriHealth, CIGNA, Coventry, Geisinger, Horizon and Oxford/Liberty. The association’s survey team called a random sample of 525 psychiatrists and managed to reach 321 by telephone – most of them after multiple attempts. One-third of the listings contained inaccurate information.

According to the survey:

• 51 percent said they were accepting new patients;

• 16 percent said there were not accepting any new patients;

• 13 percent said they were only accepting patients in their hospitals;

• 12 percent said they were only accepting Medicaid patients at public clinics;

• 8 percent were not psychiatrists.

Of the 126 psychiatrists who answered the question about when they were accepting new patients, the survey found:

• 25 percent said the wait time for an appointment with a new patient is one to two weeks;

• 25 percent said the wait-time was two to four weeks;

• 25 percent said one to two months;

• 25 percent said longer than two months.

Beachamp called the results “appalling.”

"There are 1,500 psychiatrists in New Jersey and at the end of the day there were only 172 who were in-network, accepting new patients and able to see them within a two-week period," Beauchamp said.

People who are ready to see a psychiatrist are likely in the midst of a crisis, so a prolonged wait is more than just a discouragement, said Linda Gochfeld, a psychiatrist and member of the association’s Public Policy Committee who collaborated on the study.

“People with severe emotional problems, depression or anxiety, struggle against the hopelessness and stigma to seek help,” Gochfeld said. “It's not easy to make that phone call. If they don't get a positive response after a few tries they are likely to give up and may continue a downward spiral into hospitalization, disability or even suicide.”

The association performed the survey last year and has since shared the findings with state officials and managed care companies to look for solutions. Managed care companies have been verifying and updating their listings of in-network psychiatrists at the association’s request, Beauchamp said.

The association also wants the insurance companies to explain that out-of-network psychiatrists may be used if the consumer can show there is no one in network willing to take them on, Beauchamp said. State regulations require HMOs to offer specialists within 45 miles or one-hour driving time, of 90 percent of the plan’s members, according to the survey’s report.

“Access to behavioral health care is necessary and important,” said Ward Sanders, president of the New Jersey Association of Health Plans, a trade group for the managed care companies. “Findings of inaccuracies concern the health plans and they have undertaken efforts to contact behavioral health providers and correct outdated information.”

Debra E Koss, a trustee for the New Jersey Psychiatric Association, blamed insurance companies for making it difficult for people to obtain treatment.

“The fact of the matter is that the insurance companies - intentionally or inadvertently - have created barriers for patients seeking care. It is the insurance companies that are impeding access to care and wedging themselves between physicians and patients," Koss said.

“Patients throughout the state of New Jersey should not be misled into believing there are an insufficient number of psychiatrists for adults in our state," she added. "The NJPA is committed to working with the Mental Health Association to strengthen the physician/patient relationship, as well as the insurance companies to encourage patient access to care."

The association encourages people to call 800-345-0143 if they are having difficulty finding a psychiatrist, she said.

Mental and behavioral health care is one of the essential benefits all insurance plans must offer if they sell coverage on the health exchange.
