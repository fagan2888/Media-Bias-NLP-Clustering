Authorities say that the death occurred in a mobile home park near Herman Street, on Olive Avenue.\n\nThe man\u2019s identity has been revealed as that of 22-year-old Matthew Tucker. According to his family, everything in their power was done to help their relative and get him somewhere that he would receive help in his life being saved. Their efforts were futile, however, and the man died after being transported to Mercy Medical Center.\n\nAs for the reason why this young individual was shot to death on Mother\u2019s Day, all authorities are revealing at this point is that he was a documented gang member. They say that they will be vigoriously patrolling the aforementioned area on a regular basis as a result of the shooting, in case the situation escalates and whoever was involved comes back to hurt the man\u2019s family or anyone else in association to whatever the conflict surrounded.\n\nBy Rebecca Grace\n\nSources:\n\nABC30\n\nPhoto by Reb Frost \u2013 Creativecommons Flickr License\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "Mother\u2019s Day, which was held on May 10, tragically ended in a fatal shooting for one man in Atwater, California.
