There was the scandal over contaminated baby formula, soy sauce made from human hair, and pesticide-covered vegetables, among a slew of others over the years.\n\nNow, a suspect meat supplier in China, which has provided food products to the likes of Mcdonald\u2019s, Burger King, and Papa John\u2019s, has been identified as the source of expired meat that has reached restaurants in both China and Japan.\n\nHusi Food, the Shanghai-based company in question \u2014 which is a subsidiary of U.S.-based OSI Group \u2014 reportedly provided major fast food restaurants with bad meat and was deceptive about it. \u201cWe do feel we were a bit deceived relative to one of these plants,\u201d McDonald\u2019s CEO Don Thompson told USA Today. He continued: \u201cIf those things are confirmed at a higher level, we will deal with that effectively, swiftly and appropriately.\u201d\n\nAccording to Dragon TV, a Shanghai broadcaster, Husi allegedly took expired chicken and beef, repackaged them, and placed new expiration dates on them \u2014 then sold them to McDonald\u2019s, Pizza Hut, and KFC. Investigators have found that workers at Husi used this rotten meat between June 18 to 30 and repackaged over 5,108 boxes of it.\n\nHusi\u2019s food-processing plant in Shanghai was closed by the China Food and Drug Administration, and the facilities will be under inspection throughout central, eastern, and southern China. In addition, the affected restaurants have taken precautionary steps to prevent any sicknesses from the bad meat: Starbucks outlets throughout China have removed the Chicken Apple Panini, which might have contained expired meat, and Burger King China also suspended any products that might have been contaminated. Japan\u2019s McDonald\u2019s has removed McNuggets from over 1,300 outlets.\n\nHusi Food claims that the incident is an \u201cisolated event,\u201d however. In a statement, the company said it was \u201cappalled by the report\u201d and that it would cooperate with the investigation and make the results public. \u201cOur company management believes this to be an isolated event, but takes full responsibility for the situation and will take appropriate actions swiftly and comprehensively,\u201d the company stated.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chinese police detained five people who were associated with the meat expiration scandal at the company, including the responsible officer and quality-control manager of Husi Food.\n\nThe CEO\u2019s of affected fast food restaurants have noted that it\u2019s important to regulate their supply chains more strictly. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s and Yum Brands in China should announce permanent food-safety procedures where all of their ingredients go through quality-control testing to assure the public of safety,\u201d Steven Addis, CEO of Addis, told USA Today.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fast food safety, mcdonald's, china meat", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Investigations have found a meat supplier in China guilty of repackaging spoiled meat and sending it to major fast food restaurants.", "title": "Expired Meat Scandal Spreads To McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, And Starbucks", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/china-expired-meat-scandal-spreads-mcdonalds-burger-king-and-starbucks-your-fast-food-safe-294540", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/23/expired-meat.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Investigations have found a meat supplier in China guilty of repackaging spoiled meat and sending it to major fast food restaurants.", "title": "Expired Meat Scandal Spreads To McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, And Starbucks", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/china-expired-meat-scandal-spreads-mcdonalds-burger-king-and-starbucks-your-fast-food-safe-294540", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/23/expired-meat.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/23/expired-meat.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-07-23T13:52:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-23T13:52:59-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Investigations have found a meat supplier in China guilty of repackaging spoiled meat and sending it to major fast food restaurants."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb00c\"", "article_summary": "The CEO\u2019s of affected fast food restaurants have noted that it\u2019s important to regulate their supply chains more strictly.\nA Shanghai-based facility known as Husi Food is being investigated after allegedly repackaging expired meat and selling it to major fast food companies throughout China and Japan.\nHusi\u2019s food-processing plant in Shanghai was closed by the China Food and Drug Administration, and the facilities will be under inspection throughout central, eastern, and southern China.\nNow, a suspect meat supplier in China, which has provided food products to the likes of Mcdonald\u2019s, Burger King, and Papa John\u2019s, has been identified as the source of expired meat that has reached restaurants in both China and Japan.\nHusi Food, the Shanghai-based company in question \u2014 which is a subsidiary of U.S.-based OSI Group \u2014 reportedly provided major fast food restaurants with bad meat and was deceptive about it."}
