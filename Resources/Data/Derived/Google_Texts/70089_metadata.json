Formed in the late 1970s in order to oppose a proposed state constitutional amendment which would have banned gays and lesbians from working in public schools, members of the grassroots organization identify themselves as \u201cloyal Republicans\u201d who \u201cbelieve in limited government, strong national defense, free markets, low taxes, personal responsibility, and individual liberty.\u201d\n\nBut unlike many leaders of the Republican Party, Log Cabin Republicans say they are a bit more socially liberal than the GOP base, and believe all Americans deserve civil equality and equal protection under the law, such as being able to marry a same-sex partner.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nIn order for these socially liberal Republicans to make a change, they say they need the Republican Party to remove the bylaw that excludes groups advocating for \u201ccertain lifestyle preferences or orientations\u201d from holding a position within the party.\n\nBecause of the current bylaws, Log Cabin Republicans are not eligible to win charter status in the party, meaning they cannot appoint any delegates to attend GOP conventions or have a permanent seat on the party\u2019s executive committee.\n\nCharles Moran is the Chair of the California Log Cabin Republicans, delegate of the California Republican Party and Executive Committee member. He said that while he doesn\u2019t want to have to \u201cgo to war with the GOP\u201d in order for the party to accept LGBT people, he will if he has to. \u201c[If] I have to go on the floor to tell my coming-out story, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said.\n\nMoran said now is the time when the Republican Party should \u201cunite\u201d on issues that \u201creflect the diversity\u201d of the United States.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge amount of diversity in the conservative thought movement, so I don\u2019t paint all grassroots activists as \u2018social conservatives\u2019 and as anti-gay automatically,\u201d Moran says. \u201cIf you are pro-life, you\u2019re not automatically anti-gay. If you\u2019re strongly religious, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re anti-gay, either. And if you\u2019re a Tea Partier who is outraged over the size and scope of government encroachment in our lives, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re anti-gay.\u201d\n\nFred Schein is the San Francisco chapter leader of the Log Cabin Republicans. He said that what the group is trying to change is the notion that you can\u2019t be both conservative and a gay person.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the nation, the economy and the excesses of government in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Schein said. When new members join the group, Schein says they often find it exhilarating that they can be both. But Schein, like others in the group, say that in order for the group to make any changes and attract more LGBT people to the Republican Party, the group should be able to have a voice.\n\nAccording to Brad Torgan, a Log Cabin member and secretary of the Republican Party of Los Angeles County, the Log Cabin Republicans have seen success in largely Democratic areas such as San Francisco and Los Angeles because \u201cwe go into the belly of the beast \u2014 places where other Republicans fear to tread.\u201d\n\nBut the group has struggled to garner support in rural areas and in portions of the United States where the old values of the Republican Party are still emphasized.\n\nOne prominent fundamentalist Republican who disagrees with the inclusion of the Log Cabin Republicans in the party is the Rev. Lou Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition. At a recent GOP convention, he shared that he has fought against the \u201cgay agenda\u201d for the past 40 years and said he plans to continue to fight for \u201cfamily values.\u201d\n\nBut Moran says statements such as Sheldon\u2019s are not going to stop them. \u201cWe\u2019ll take on some of the conservative non-thought leaders,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we\u2019re just as conservative and Republican as they are.\u201d\n\nBattle at the polls\n\nIn order to remove some of these anti-LGBT conservatives from blocking the Log Cabin Republicans from obtaining a larger voice within the Republican Party, some are urging Republican voters to support those conservative politicians who support equality for all.\n\nFor example, in September David Lampo, who is on the national board of the Log Cabin Republicans, wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post on why Republican voters in Virginia should not vote for Ken Cuccinelli for governor.\n\nLampo wrote that while a vote against Cuccinelli or not voting at all may seem \u201cunpleasant,\u201d he said it was necessary for the sake of the party\u2019s future since Cuccinelli has \u201cbuilt his career on anti-gay, anti-abortion and anti-immigrant votes (as a state senator) and legal decisions (as attorney general).\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile such positions play well with highly conservative voters, more mainstream voters, particularly those with libertarian leanings, need to stop and take stock of Cuccinelli\u2019s long-held social views,\u201d Lampo wrote. Though Cuccinelli has run on a platform that includes support for reducing taxes and spending, as well as for gun rights and repealing the Affordable Care Act, Lampo says Cuccinelli\u2019s views on social issues show he is anything but a libertarian:\n\n\u201cMost libertarians understand that there is more to liberty than just low taxes and the right to bear arms. Regardless of their personal religious views, libertarians (as well as many conservatives) believe in the time-honored principle of separation of church and state: not just freedom of religion but freedom from religion for those who so choose. \u201cGiven their fundamental belief in social tolerance, the last thing libertarians should want is a government based on what many conservatives refer to as \u2018biblical principles,\u2019 yet that seems to be what Cuccinelli wants to give us. Most principled libertarians do not believe that the government should oppose equal rights for gay and lesbian Virginians simply because some religions consider homosexuality sinful; such a view is a complete repudiation of the live-and-let-live basis of libertarianism.\u201d\n\nLampo went on to say that Cuccinelli\u2019s record is awful and includes\n\n\u201copposition to repealing the state\u2019s sodomy law, which was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court 10 years ago; opposition to allowing private firms to offer health and life insurance benefits to employees\u2019 domestic partners; opposition to expanding Virginia\u2019s anti-discrimination law to cover state employees who are gay; opposition to protections for gays and lesbians working at Virginia colleges and universities; opposition to domestic partnerships or civil unions for gay and lesbian couples; support for taxpayer funding of private adoption agencies that discriminate against gay and lesbian Virginians; and support for a law making divorce more difficult, potentially trapping people in unhappy marriages.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Cuccinelli\u2019s record that has the group concerned. His running mate and Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, the pastor E.W. Jackson, is worse, according to Lampo:\n\n\u201cHis claim to fame is a history of extreme statements about people he dislikes. He has labeled gays as \u2018perverted\u2019 and \u2018very sick,\u2019 disparagingly said the president has the \u2018sensibilities of . . . an atheist and a Muslim,\u2019 and compared Planned Parenthood to the Ku Klux Klan. He told a conference of conservatives in June that \u2018freedom doesn\u2019t mean \u2018do whatever you want.\u2019\u2019 Apparently, when it comes to running your life, it\u2019s his way or the highway, the very antithesis of limited government and individual rights.\u201d\n\nWhile there are candidates like Cuccinelli that the Log Cabin Republicans argue should not be elected for the sake of the party\u2019s future, other candidates such as Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Fleck the group has urged to support.\n\nFleck, a member of the Log Cabin Republican group himself, has twice been elected to the Pennsylvania legislature with 100 percent of the vote \u2014 once in 2008 and again in 2012. He ran unopposed, but after he announced last year that his 10-year marriage was ending because he was gay, some say Fleck\u2019s political race will illustrate whether or not the Republican Party accepts or rejects homsexuality, especially since his stance on issues such as gun control have not changed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite being denied a formal role in the Republican Party, gay and lesbian conservatives are fighting for a voice., conservatives, LGBT, Log Cabin Republicans, Republicans,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Katie Rucke", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Despite being denied a formal role in the Republican Party, gay and lesbian conservatives are fighting for a voice., conservatives, LGBT, Log Cabin Republicans, Republicans,", "title": "Gay Republicans Flout GOP Orthodoxy, Promote LGBT-Friendly Candidates", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/lgbt-conservatives-republican-party/170623/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101513_logcabin_16x9.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-16T01:29:36-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite being denied a formal role in the Republican Party, gay and lesbian conservatives are fighting for a voice., conservatives, LGBT, Log Cabin Republicans, Republicans,", "creator": "@katierucke", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101513_logcabin_4x3.jpg", "title": "Gay Republicans Flout GOP Orthodoxy, Promote LGBT-Friendly Candidates", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Republicans", "published_time": "2013-10-16T05:04:13-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-16T01:29:36-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Gay Republicans Flout GOP Orthodoxy, Promote LGBT-Friendly CandidatesDespite being denied a formal role in the Republican Party, gay and lesbian conservatives are fighting for a voice.\nCharles Moran is the Chair of the California Log Cabin Republicans, delegate of the California Republican Party and Executive Committee member.\nOne of the most vocal LGBT Republican organizations is the San Francisco-based Log Cabin Republicans group.\nOne prominent fundamentalist Republican who disagrees with the inclusion of the Log Cabin Republicans in the party is the Rev.\nMoran said now is the time when the Republican Party should \u201cunite\u201d on issues that \u201creflect the diversity\u201d of the United States."}
