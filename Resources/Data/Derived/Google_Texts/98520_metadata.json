As a result, some patients incurred big unforeseen medical bills because they unwittingly went out of network for care.\n\nIn addition to the state's enforcement action, consumer lawsuits are still pending against both insurers.\n\n\u201cThe DMHC has taken enforcement action and fined Blue Shield and Anthem due to unacceptable inaccuracies in their directories,\u201d said Shelley Rouillard, the agency's director. \u201cThese inaccuracies limited enrollee access to care that resulted in an unacceptable consumer experience and must be fixed.\u201d\n\nRegulators said both plans must improve the accuracy of their provider directories and reimburse enrollees who may have been negatively affected by the misleading information.\n\nThe state said Blue Shield has already reimbursed more than $38 million to enrollees who incurred out-of-network costs. Officials said they didn't have a reimbursement figure for Anthem yet.\n\nAnthem and attorneys representing consumers said they are close to settling a class-action case that would set aside money to cover past medical bills.\n\nBoth companies will report to regulators on the final number of enrollees reimbursed and the total amount paid out. The state urged consumers who have questions \u2014 or believe that they should receive reimbursement \u2014 to contact the companies.\n\nA year ago, the Department of Managed Health Care released the results of a five-month investigation into the doctor networks advertised by both insurers.\n\nMore than 25% of physicians listed by Anthem and Blue Shield weren't taking patients in the Covered California health exchange or were no longer at the location listed by the companies, according to the state's investigation.\n\nIn response to consumer complaints, California lawmakers approved legislation this year requiring insurers to update their provider directories weekly to improve accuracy.\n\n\u201cWe don't allow grocery stores to sell food mislabeled with the wrong ingredients,\u201d said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access, a consumer advocacy group that backed the legislation. \u201cWe can't have a functioning insurance market if consumers don't know what they are buying.\u201d\n\nAnthem and Blue Shield have been the top two insurers by enrollment in the state's Obamacare exchange, with roughly 800,000 members combined.\n\nThe insurers have acknowledged mistakes were made as the companies raced to overhaul their policies and networks for the implementation of the health law in 2014.\n\n\u201cDuring this time of unprecedented change and despite Anthem\u2019s continual efforts to improve the accuracy of the system, Anthem\u2019s provider directory inadvertently listed some providers\u201d that weren\u2019t part of the policyholders\u2019 network, said spokesman Darrel Ng.\n\n\u201cIn the last two years, Anthem has spent more than $4 million improving the provider directory to make it more user friendly and to improve the accuracy of the data,\u201d he said.\n\nIndianapolis-based Anthem is the nation\u2019s second-largest health insurer.\n\nIn a statement, Blue Shield said it \u201cbelieves this agreement is in the best interest of our members. The settlement addresses past issues raised in 2014, and our members should not be concerned about their current plan or its networks.\u201d\n\nState officials said they slapped Blue Shield with a heftier fine because it was less cooperative during the investigation.\n\n\u201cThere was a lack of timeliness in receiving responses and overall cooperation from Blue Shield, so the fine was a little higher,\u201d said agency spokeswoman Rachel Arrezola.\n\nKevin and Jane McCarthy of Thousand Oaks are among the consumers suing Blue Shield over out-of-network medical bills in San Francisco County Superior Court.\n\nMcCarthy said he and his wife spent nearly $2,000 out of pocket to see their primary-care physicians and a neurologist last year.\n\nHe said he had checked Blue Shield's online listing of network doctors for his Silver PPO plan during the sign-up process and confirmed the information with a company representative by phone.\n\nBut he said Blue Shield's information was wrong and that he got stuck paying higher out-of-network charges.\n\n\u201cIt was false advertising, and Blue Shield needs to pay for what they did,\u201d McCarthy said. He wasn't impressed by the state's fine of $350,000.\n\n\u201cBlue Shield is getting off with a slap on the wrist,\u201d he said.\n\nConsumer Watchdog, a Santa Monica advocacy group, is spearheading the litigation against Blue Shield and Anthem.\n\nJerry Flanagan, the group\u2019s lead staff attorney, said Blue Shield\u2019s reimbursement process puts too big a burden on consumers to file claims, so his organization will keep pursuing a legal settlement with better terms.\n\nBlue Shield said it doesn't comment on pending litigation.\n\nThe managed-care agency has begun a new survey of Anthem and Blue Shield's physician networks to check whether problems have been resolved. The results might be available early next year.\n\nchad.terhune@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "California fines top health insurers for overstating Obamacare networks", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "California regulators fined two insurance giants for overstating their Obamacare doctor networks and said the companies will pay millions of dollars in refunds to patients who paid too much for care.", "title": "California fines top health insurers for overstating Obamacare networks", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-obamacare-network-probe-20151103-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56380a87/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-network-probe-20151103", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, covered california, anthem, blue shield, health insurance, narrow networks", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/84908430", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-11-03", "Description": "California regulators fined two insurance giants for overstating their Obamacare doctor networks and said the companies will pay millions of dollars in refunds to patients who paid too much for care.The state\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care levied fines of $350,000 against Blue Shield of California...", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "obamacare, covered california, anthem, blue shield, health insurance, narrow networks"}, "article_summary": "The state\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care levied fines of $350,000 against Blue Shield of California and $250,000 for Anthem Blue Cross.\nThe state said Blue Shield has already reimbursed more than $38 million to enrollees who incurred out-of-network costs.\nThe managed-care agency has begun a new survey of Anthem and Blue Shield's physician networks to check whether problems have been resolved.\nIn a statement, Blue Shield said it \u201cbelieves this agreement is in the best interest of our members.\nBut he said Blue Shield's information was wrong and that he got stuck paying higher out-of-network charges."}
