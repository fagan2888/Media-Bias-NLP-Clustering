The Motion alleged that the Petitions represent an ongoing abuse of the inter partes review process that are driven entirely by a \u201cprofit motive\u201d unrelated to the purpose of the AIA or a competitive interest in the validity of the challenged patents. Patent Owner requested dismissal of the Petitions on the basis that the reasons for seeking review are illegitimate.\n\nThe Board stated that Patent Owner, as the moving party, bears the burden of proof that it is entitled to the requested relief. The Board reviewed the Motion under a preponderance of the evidence standard.\n\nRegarding Patent Owner\u2019s argument that the Petitions be dismissed because Petitioner seeks to profit from the Petitions, the Board stated that profit is at the heart of nearly every patent and nearly every inter partes review. Therefore, an economic motive itself does not raise abuse of process issues. The Board took no position on the merits of a short-selling investment strategy other than that it is legal and regulated.\n\nRegarding Patent Owner\u2019s contention that Petitioner has no competitive interest in the patents they are challenging, the Board noted that the AIA allows any person who is not the owner of a patent to file a petition for inter partes review, as opposed to covered business method patents, which require a party to have been sued or charged with infringement of a patent. Therefore, Article III standing is not a requirement to appear before the PTO.\n\nRegarding Patent Owner\u2019s contention that the Petitions are contrary to the AIA, which is to allow the parties to challenge a granted patent as an expeditious and less costly alternative to litigation, the Board noted that was not the only purpose of the AIA. The Board stated that the AIA was designed to encourage the filing of meritorious challenges in an effort to improve patent quality, and Patent Owner did not allege that Petitioner filed a non-meritorious patentability challenge.\n\nCoalition for Affordable Drugs VI, LLC v.
