And over the last year, they focused their efforts on assessing how various branches of local government work. Some of the findings were startling. Others confirmed what many people already believed. But we hope each one, in some way, informed the public debate. Here are some examples:\n\n\u2014 Questions have arisen over the accuracy of some crime statistics from the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\n\u2014 L.A. police, fire and civilian employees take longer, costlier injury leaves than those in other jurisdictions in the state.\n\n\u2014 Eastside neighborhoods wait significantly longer than others for building inspectors to respond to complaints of possible illegal construction and other issues.\n\n\u2014 A large number of recruits in L.A.\u2019s city and county fire departments are related to current employees, and the new classes lack diversity.\n\n\u2014 Certain neighborhoods in L.A. get a disproportionate amount of street-sweeping tickets.\n\n\u2014 Hit-and-run incidents involving cyclists are rising as police struggle to solve cases.\n\n\u2014 In many ways, Obamacare is changing California.\n\n\u2014 The complicated and largely hidden web of money that pushed Proposition 47.\n\n\u2014 Water pipe breaks are more common in some neighborhoods than others.\n\n\u2014 Many landmark buildings are along the Hollywood earthquake fault.\n\n\u2014 Metro can\u2019t figure out how many riders are using rail for free.\n\n\u2014 Why Thursday evening is the Southern California commuter\u2019s worst nightmare.\n\nDriver\u2019s Licenses, Immigrants and Change\n\nHow much have attitudes changed about allowing immigrants who are in the country illegally to obtain California driver\u2019s licenses?\n\nOne measure is how little criticism or controversy we\u2019ve seen as immigrants began lining up to get the licenses on Friday.\n\nIt was just 20 years ago that California voters approved Prop. 187, which barred those in the U.S. illegally from receiving many public services, let alone driver\u2019s licences. In 1979, a Times article titled \"Alien Drivers Seen as Perils on the Streets\u201d captured sentiments of that era.\n\nPolling has shown that Californians' views have changed significantly over a time \u2014 immigrants here illegally are seen less as a threat and more as an asset. That attitude appears to have spilled over into the issue of driver\u2019s licenses. A 2013 USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll showed narrow overall support for driver's licenses (nearly 69% of Latino voters supported the idea, as did 44% of whites).\n\nCritics say it sends the wrong message to give licenses to those here illegally. But DMV officials said they believe that requiring all drivers to get registered and take tests will make the roads safer.\n\nAll this was a particularly big moment for L.A. City Councilman Gilbert Cedillo, who as a state legislator pushed the issue for so many years that he got the nickname \"One Bill Gil.\u201d Recalling those battles, he said: \"It was difficult politically to carry a legislation for a community that was vilified, not appreciated, and marginalized.\u201d\n\nGuns, Drugs and the Law\n\nThe massacre last year near UC Santa Barbara by a troubled college student heightened the debate about guns and how to treat people with emotional and mental problems. It also prompted several new laws in California that went into effect Jan. 1.\n\nThe gunman, Elliot Rodger, killed six and wounded 13 others. There had been warning signs that Rodger suffered from mental illness and might be a threat to others. Less than a month before the attack, police had visited Rodger to check on his welfare but did not know he had guns.\n\nOne new law allows police or family members to seek a restraining order that bars a person deemed dangerous from possessing firearms for 21 days. Another requires law enforcement agencies to develop policies encouraging officers to consult a state database that shows who owns guns before checking on someone who is potentially dangerous.\n\nOn the issue of drugs, another new California law seeks to right what critics long have seen as an injustice in the legal system: Those convicted of possessing crack cocaine for sale, who previously could be sentenced to three to five years in jail, now face two to four years \u2014 the same penalty applied to offenses involving powder cocaine.\n\nWeekend Reading\n\nFinally, here are some great reads for your weekend:\n\n\u2014 \u201cStephanie Edwards and Bob Eubanks \u2026 have had more drama in their Rose Parade partnership than most long-married couples,\u201d writes Robin Abcarian.\n\n\u2014 A man with surveillance cameras and a mission in South L.A.\n\n\u2014 The Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department diet.\n\n\u2014 Violent crime is up in L.A. for the first time in 12 years.\n\n\u2014 New details but no resolution in the shooting of Ezell Ford.\n\n\u2014 How the L.A. City Council embraced, then rejected, a ban on genetically modified crops.\n\n\u2014 Our best graphics and reader photos from 2014.\n\n\u2014 When Father Boyle and Sister Mary get together, watch out.\n\nSign up here: Get the Essential California newsletter delivered to your inbox.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Keeping Track, Changing Course as 2015 Begins", "Description": "Happy new year and welcome to Essential California, our weekly newsletter on the Golden State.
