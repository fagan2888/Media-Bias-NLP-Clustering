Hours before he is believed to have fatally stabbed and shot six people and wounded 13 others in that coastal college town, Elliot Rodger filmed a video of himself \u2014 palm trees behind him, the glow of an orange sun highlighting his young face \u2014 and vowed to get \u201crevenge against humanity.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more in the video, and the 140-page \u201cmanifesto\u201d he left in his apartment. Rodger felt victimized by women, whom he appeared to desire and loathe simultaneously. He expressed anger and resentment toward other men, often because of their relationships with women. He seemed to be a profoundly troubled, profoundly lonely young man. According to a statement from the Rodger family\u2019s attorney, he was receiving care from mental health professionals after his parents were alarmed by his Internet footprint \u2014 a series of YouTube videos and men\u2019s rights chat groups where he expressed his violent views about women, men and himself.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say what any of this actually tells us. Maybe nothing. I won\u2019t pretend to know. What role did Rodger\u2019s misogyny play in this tragedy? And what about his apparent struggle with mental illness \u2014 that big, blanket term we never talk about except to throw it around as if it explains why someone would murder six people? And what about guns? What of our cowardice \u2014 the cowardice of our elected officials \u2014 when it comes to regulating deadly weapons so that we stand a better chance of keeping them out of the hands of men like Elliot Rodger? What about these things? As a friend and I discussed earlier while trying to grapple with the tragedy as we learned each new chilling detail, all of these things matter, but none seem sufficient to explain what happened. They couldn\u2019t possibly, and yet they\u2019re all we have.\n\nIt would be irresponsible to lay this violence at the feet of the men\u2019s rights activists with whom Rodger seemed to find support for his rage. Rodger is alleged to have murdered six women and men. No amount of Internet vitriol \u2014 no unfulfilled threats of violence \u2014 can equal that. But it also denies reality to pretend that Rodger\u2019s sense of masculine entitlement and views about women didn\u2019t matter or somehow existed in a vacuum. The horror of Rodger\u2019s alleged crimes is unique, but the distorted way he understood himself as a man and the violence with which he discussed women \u2014 the bleak and dehumanizing way he judged them \u2014 is not. Just as we examine our culture of guns once again in the wake of yet another mass shooting, we must also examine our culture of misogyny and toxic masculinity, which devalues both women\u2019s and men\u2019s lives and worth, and inflicts real and daily harm. We must examine the dangerous normative values that treat women as less than human, and that make them \u2014 according to Elliot Rodger \u2014 deserving of death.\n\nThere is an angry part of me \u2014 a frightened part of me \u2014 that wants to tear Rodger\u2019s video manifesto apart in the pettiest terms imaginable. Point to how cliched it all is \u2014 the tired self-importance, the god comparisons, his lazy use of \u201csluts\u201d and \u201cbrutes\u201d to describe the women and men he would allegedly target and murder only hours later. I have seen these videos before. Women have heard these threats before, and been forced to consider how seriously they should take an anonymous man who says he knows where they live and tells them, \u201cI am the one who is going to kill you.\u201d If Rodger had posted his angry monologue to YouTube or fired it off in an email and then gone about his day \u2014 seething privately and without violence about his wounded sense of entitlement and the sting of having his resentful and warped desires unfulfilled \u2014 the country wouldn\u2019t be talking about him. Because until the moment that he is alleged to have killed six women and men, Elliot Rodger was every bit the same as the other men who are defined by their resentment toward women and their sense of bitter victimization in the world. Men who threaten women in person and online in an attempt to control their lives. Men who feel that girls and women owe them adoration, sexual gratification, subservience. Men whose sense of rage and entitlement has rotted their brains and ruined them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In moments after unspeakable tragedy we must not rush to conclusions.
