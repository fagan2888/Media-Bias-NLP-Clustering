But many look back on Lauve\u2019s trial as a defining moment in the still-evolving world of cannabis use and regulation.\n\n\u201cThat case got us in part to where we are today,\u201d said Rob Corry, the Denver marijuana advocacy attorney who defended Lauve.\n\nThe 2006 acquittal of Gunnison resident Ryan Margenauon felony charges of possessing pot without a medical marijuana card preceded Lauve\u2019s trial. But Corry said the latter case was far higher-profile and had greater policy impacts.\n\n\u201cIt was significant because it caused a lot of prosecutors to ask why they were taking these cases and wasting taxpayer money,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the prosecutors who began to loudly question the wisdom of pot prosecutions was Boulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett, whose office had charged Lauve.\n\n\u201cIt was a pivotal case for me,\u201d Garnett said. \u201cIt pointed out what juries thought about marijuana possession \u2014 which wasn\u2019t much.\u201d\n\nHe said the case also made it plain to him that the possession limits spelled out in Amendment 20, the medical marijuana initiative passed by Colorado voters in 2000, couldn\u2019t be enforced effectively given the defense\u2019s successful argument at trial that the law allowed a patient to have as much pot as was \u201cmedically necessary.\u201d\n\nPolice had found 34 ounces of marijuana and more than 30 pot plants \u2014 far more than the 2 ounces of usable pot and six plants permitted by the statute \u2014 in Lauve\u2019s Louisville home.\n\nIn September 2009, Garnett announced that marijuana possession cases would become the lowest priority prosecution for his office. The next month, he dismissed charges against a Nederland medical marijuana patient who faced felony charges for having 50 pot plants.\n\nGarnett said his office hasn\u2019t prosecuted a minor pot possession case since Lauve was acquitted.\n\n\u201cA lot of things contributed to getting where we are today, and clearly the Lauve case was a part of that,\u201d he said.\n\nLauve, who now lives in Broomfield, likened his case to the first few pieces of mortar being chiseled out of the Berlin Wall before it fell in 1989.\n\n\u201cIt was a hole in the armor (of marijuana law enforcement),\u201d he said. \u201cThe two sides could now communicate; it was no longer polar opposites on this.\u201d\n\nAfter he was found not guilty, Lauve said he began receiving calls from patients, attorneys and dispensary owners throughout Colorado.\n\n\u201cThey said \u2018Thank you for standing up,\u2019 \u201d said Lauve, who still uses forearm crutches to get around. \u201c\u2018How did you do it? Can I see your case?\u2019 I felt empowered. It showed me we can defend our rights.\u201d\n\nElisa Kappelmann, owner of Southern Colorado Medical Marijuana in Colorado Springs, said Lauve inspired her to fight when she was charged with two felonies after police raided her grow house in 2010.\n\nPolice said Kappelmann was growing far more plants than state law allowed. But a jury in 2012 found her not guilty after Corry, her attorney, argued that the \u201cmedically necessary\u201d element in the state\u2019s medical marijuana law applied to the case.\n\n\u201cThe Lauve case was a breakthrough because before that if you were going to court, you were going to jail,\u201d Kappelmann said. \u201cThe stigma is so great with marijuana that law enforcement thinks it can run over you. Jason came down and encouraged me to fight.\u201d\n\nLauve, who went on to publish a medical marijuana magazine and now consults for the burgeoning industrial hemp industry, said much work remains to be done in the field of cannabis legalization. There are still district attorneys taking on medical marijuana patients, he said, and the industry struggles under the dual conflict of being legal statewide yet illicit at the federal level.\n\nBut those challenges, he said, don\u2019t diminish the accomplishments made in the pot legalization movement since he nearly collapsed in a Boulder courtroom five years ago after hearing his not guilty verdict.\n\n\u201cThis has happened faster, better and bigger than I could have imagined,\u201d Lauve said.\n\nJohn Aguilar: 303-954-1695, jaguilar@denverpost.com or twitter.com/abuvthefold", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Pivotal Boulder case blazed the way to pot regulation, use", "title": "Pivotal Boulder case blazed the way to pot regulation, use", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/05/pivotal-boulder-case-blazed-the-way-to-pot-regulation-use/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140805__20140806_A4_CD06LAUVEp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140805__20140806_A4_CD06LAUVEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-05T19:55:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:07:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaea4\"", "article_summary": "Garnett said his office hasn\u2019t prosecuted a minor pot possession case since Lauve was acquitted.\n\u201cThe Lauve case was a breakthrough because before that if you were going to court, you were going to jail,\u201d Kappelmann said.\nThe next month, he dismissed charges against a Nederland medical marijuana patient who faced felony charges for having 50 pot plants.\n\u201cA lot of things contributed to getting where we are today, and clearly the Lauve case was a part of that,\u201d he said.\nIn September 2009, Garnett announced that marijuana possession cases would become the lowest priority prosecution for his office."}
