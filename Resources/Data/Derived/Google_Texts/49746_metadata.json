He came to prominence in the early 2000s as a corner kid turned rap artist, climbing an uncertain path to success perhaps best encapsulated by the title of his breakout album, \u201cGet Rich or Die Tryin\u2019.\u201d \u201cIn Da Club\u201d and \u201cP.I.M.P.\u201d are club bangers that define the first few years of the 21st century, making lines like \u201cwe\u2019re going to party like / it\u2019s your birthday\u201d into standard-issue bro refrains. His skill at writing rhymes brought him to the limelight; his astonishing success has kept him there.\n\nAs the title of that 2003 album suggests, the tension between success and survival is a potent one for 50 Cent. In 2000, the fledgling rapper was shot nine times at close range\u2014a remnant of his past as a criminal rearing its head as he attempted to make a living on the right side of the law. Other rappers with similar life experiences have shed their hood trappings with gusto; Jay Z, for example, once a street drug dealer, is now every inch the well-heeled, white-shoe businessman. 50 Cent is somewhere between getting rich and dying trying. He\u2019s got the success and the fame, but his creative instincts seem to return, again and again, to the person he didn\u2019t end up becoming\u2014a career criminal that died at the wrong end of a gun.\n\nPerhaps as a result of that obsession, 50 Cent has turned away from music. His fifth studio album, \u201cAnimal Ambition,\u201d failed to make a dent with either critics or listeners, and the long-awaited \u201cStreet King Immortal\u201d has been delayed for four years. Instead, he\u2019s turned to film and television. He starred in a roman \u00e0 clef about his own life, \u201cGet Rich or Die Tryin\u2019,\u201d in 2005. And last year, Starz debuted \u201cPower,\u201d an original TV series from the network that features Jackson as an executive producer and recurring cast member. The show\u2019s main creative force is Courtney Kemp Agboh, who worked, most notably, on \u201cThe Good Wife.\u201d 50 Cent brings the star power. In Season 1, his character, Kanan, played a restless, imprisoned drug kingpin, threatening the happiness of Ghost (Omari Hardwick). In Season 2, debuting June 6, Kanan\u2019s finally out of prison. I caught up with the rapper to talk about the transition from rap to cable TV, what appeals to him about telling this particular story, and the \u201cEmpire\u201d business model.\n\nOne of the things that interested me about the story of \u201cPower\u201d is that you\u2019re playing someone who has been a prison inmate. That\u2019s a story about this criminal sort of life that seems like the \u201cdie trying\u201d part of \u201cGet Rich or Die Tryin\u2019,\u201d not the \u201cget rich\u201d part. Is that one of the reasons this appealed to you?\n\nThe story itself was created by communication between myself and Courtney Kemp [Agboh]. So a lot of the characters in the story are portions or behaviors from real people that I\u2019ve come across in my life. Courtney, it wouldn\u2019t be what it is without Courtney. Because she designed it, and even the pace of the first season is her creative choice. That allowed you to focus on other areas outside of what the person\u2019s life choices were\u2014career-wise, or for financial situations. They allowed you to be more invested in Ghost\u2019s struggle, about if he\u2019s done things the right way. It offers compassion, because people see him not wanting to be a part of a lifestyle that he\u2019s chosen.\n\nHe\u2019s really trying to break out of it.\n\nYeah. Overall, I think that it\u2019s impossible for you to create these things and have people identify with it without having some sort of insight. Courtney is able to take the pieces that matter out of the conversation and put them in the right places. It\u2019s been so exciting to do it, because\u2014everything resonates differently to me, because I know where the pieces came from. We\u2019ll be having a conversation and she\u2019ll go, \u201cWait, say that again?\u201d And then it ends up somewhere in the series. She just likes different parts. Even portions of things that some of them say\u2014literally, they came out of my mouth before they ended up in different characters\u2019 mouths.\n\nWhen I was first hearing about the show, I was thinking that the character of Ghost actually sounded a little bit like your narrative.\n\nShe created Ghost based on my journey, and her father\u2019s. The whole energy of coming from not having very much and making it to that point, she had those references prior, from talking with her dad. That wit, the instincts that you get\u2014you can\u2019t get it out of a book, the experience of being around people and watching them, how they maneuver or do things. She was able to give Ghost a real identity like that.\n\nRight, this survival instinct, I think, that I think he shares with Kanan, which I think is one of the things they have in common.\n\nGhost is a little more complex. Kanan is manipulative, but it\u2019s from being around the lifestyle so often. There\u2019s points where he needs to get it done, versus him doing it. He\u2019s the kind of guy, he\u2019s out on the street, it\u2019s \u201cGet it done,\u201d and it\u2019s, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll do it myself. It\u2019s not a big deal. Plus, I wasn\u2019t sure if that guy would have told on me, but I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t tell on him.\u201d [Laughs.]\n\nSounds like you relate to that a little bit.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s real life at that point. People are willing to do things\u2014like the way I grew up and the things that I\u2019ve come across\u2014when there\u2019s not a lot of finances around. It seems like the answers to all your problems. Relating any actions or activities to the right amount of money, it can happen in that environment. It makes it authentic to that. From the first season, I was going, Where is this going to go? It\u2019s great, but it feels like someone\u2019s going to get caught. They\u2019re already figuring it out\u2014she knows that Tommy\u2019s looking at him like he\u2019s Ghost\u2014but it\u2019s close enough for a case to start to happen, once you\u2019ve got facial recognition. Going into Season 2, the intensity of the finale is carried all the way across the 10 episodes. It doesn\u2019t die down. I know people are going to be at the edge of their seats going, \u201cYo!\u201d The first season was, like I said, her pace was slow enough for you to identify with who everybody is and what their aim is. Now all the action from Pink Sneakers [a mysterious assassin in the first season] is directly translated over to Kanan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon talks to the producer/actor about going from \"In Da Club\" to the TV writers' room with his intense Starz show", "title": "The \u201cPower\u201d of 50 Cent: \u201cPeople are going to be at the edge of their seats going, \u201cYo!'\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon talks to the producer/actor about going from \"In Da Club\" to the TV writers' room with his intense Starz show", "title": "The \u201cPower\u201d of 50 Cent: \u201cPeople are going to be at the edge of their seats going, \u201cYo!'\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/the_power_of_50_cent_people_are_going_to_be_at_the_edge_of_their_seats_going_yo/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/50_cent.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon talks to the producer/actor about going from \"In Da Club\" to the TV writers' room with his intense Starz show", "title": "The \u201cPower\u201d of 50 Cent: \u201cPeople are going to be at the edge of their seats going, \u201cYo!'\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/50_cent.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 50 Cent, courtney kemp agboh, curtis jackson, Power, starz, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe59\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 50 Cent, courtney kemp agboh, curtis jackson, Power, starz, TV, Entertainment NewsCurtis Jackson, better known as the rapper 50 Cent, is a man of many talents.\nAs the title of that 2003 album suggests, the tension between success and survival is a potent one for 50 Cent.\nPerhaps as a result of that obsession, 50 Cent has turned away from music.\nThe show\u2019s main creative force is Courtney Kemp Agboh, who worked, most notably, on \u201cThe Good Wife.\u201d 50 Cent brings the star power.\n50 Cent is somewhere between getting rich and dying trying."}
