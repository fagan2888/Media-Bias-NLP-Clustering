The searchable database will be available to the public. It is slated to launch in late September.\n\nSome Big Pharma companies already provide this information, but often it is tucked into voluminous financial disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission and to investors. The information can be beneficial in uncovering conflicts of interest, such as when a doctor is receiving money from a device maker on one hand and yet on the other forms an influential opinion on one of the company\u2019s devices.\n\nDoctor\u2019s Withdrawal Shows Benefits of New Database\n\nThe potential significance of the new regulations was underscored in July. Two days before a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel was set to review the safety of power morcellation devices, panel member Dr. Andrew Brill stepped down when it was disclosed he was receiving consultation fees from Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Ethicon division. Brill removed himself from the panel but only after a reporter from The Wall Street Journalasked the FDA about Brill\u2019s financial ties to Ethicon. The reporter had compared names of panel members with a list of paid consultants on J&J\u2019s website, the paper reported.\n\nBrill, a San Francisco gynecologist, received more than $100,000 in consulting fees from Ethicon, which leads the market in morcellation sales. The Journal found that at least two other doctors on the panel had financial ties to J&J. Neither of the other two physicians recused themselves from the panel.\n\nCharles Ornstein, a senior reporter with ProPublica, said some physicians and drug and device companies have concerns that the public might not understand the financial relationships between drug companies and doctors. A group of medical societies and pharmaceutical-industry trade groups asked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which will run the database, to delay its launch. The group wants CMS to provide context explaining the data to the public, otherwise it can lead to \u201cconfusion and misinterpretation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe context that they\u2019re looking for,\u201d Ornstein said during a ProPublica podcast, \u201cis statements from the government that relationships between drug companies and doctors are beneficial to the public.\u201d\n\nLike Obamacare, Database Launch Already Late\n\nThe database is expected to be up by September 30 even as the government irons out wrinkles in the system. Much like the initial rollout of Obamacare, the system launch was delayed several times because of technical glitches. CGI Federal, the same software development company that built the bug-laden Healthcare.gov website, is in charge of the Open Payments site.\n\nCMS started collecting 2013 data from companies in mid-2014. By July, doctors and teaching hospitals were allowed to register to get a preview. Some doctors reported problems with the system including long wait times during the login process, ambiguous error messages that make the system confusing and questions about data accuracy. When some doctors found their names tied to payments that weren\u2019t theirs, the CMS shut down the system for 11 days to make changes.\n\nThe CMS also said it is withholding about one-third of the collected data from the site during the September launch because of inconsistencies in the information. Dozens of doctors and medical groups have asked the CSM to delay the launch until March 2015 to give doctors more time to review and contest the data.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act is forcing pharmaceutical companies to disclose financial ties to doctors, putting new transparency into the health care system.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "DrugWatch", "description": "The Affordable Care Act is forcing pharmaceutical companies to disclose financial ties to doctors, putting new transparency into the health care system.", "title": "Affordable Care Act Forces Financial Transparency for Drugmakers", "url": "https://www.drugwatch.com/2014/08/29/obamacare-forcing-pharmaceutical-transparency/", "image": {"width": 256, "identifier": "https://www.drugwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/cash-bottle-of-pills.jpg", "height": 196}, "locale": "en_US", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-29T11:44:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-18T17:37:42+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.drugwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/cash-bottle-of-pills.jpg"}, "title": "Affordable Care Act Forces Financial Transparency for Drugmakers", "description": "The Affordable Care Act is forcing pharmaceutical companies to disclose financial ties to doctors, putting new transparency into the health care system.", "card": "summary", "site": "@Drug_watch"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, obamacare, big pharma, medical device companies, physician payment sunshine act, open payments database"}, "article_summary": "Much like the initial rollout of Obamacare, the system launch was delayed several times because of technical glitches.\nThe database, a provision of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act and the 2010 Affordable Care Act, requires pharmaceutical companies, biological drug companies and device and medical supply manufacturers to disclose payments and gifts over $10 given to physicians and teaching hospitals.\nCharles Ornstein, a senior reporter with ProPublica, said some physicians and drug and device companies have concerns that the public might not understand the financial relationships between drug companies and doctors.\nThe Journal found that at least two other doctors on the panel had financial ties to J&J.\nBrill removed himself from the panel but only after a reporter from The Wall Street Journalasked the FDA about Brill\u2019s financial ties to Ethicon."}
