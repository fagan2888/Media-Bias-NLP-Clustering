Not because it makes our presidents look like monsters, mind you\u2014 although it certainly does that\u2014but because it makes them look powerless and pointless, almost pathetically so.\n\nIf Internet punditry is to be believed, George W. Bush was a tyrant who could be understood with \u201cthe language used to describe [King] George III,\u201d a \u201cdefiant warmonger to the last,\u201d as a piece in U.K.\u2019s the Telegraph describes him, one \u201con the rampage\u201d to legalize torture. Meanwhile, Barack Obama is also a tyrant \u201cjust like the Founders warned us against,\u201d a president who \u201cfiercely defends the military-industrial complex,\u201d and \u201cthe media\u2019s favorite autocrat.\u201d\n\nThe Internet likes to view these men in an authoritarian, all-seeing role, but the CIA report proves that\u2019s anything but true. Here are seven facts that go against those preconceptions.\n\nMore from The Daily Dot: \u201cStephen Colbert interviewed Smaug and it was glorious\u201d\n\n1) The CIA didn\u2019t inform President Bush of the full extent of its methods until more than five years into his presidency.\n\nDespite his vaunted reputation as the \u201cdecider,\u201d Bush was not briefed on specific interrogation techniques until April 2006, 63 months after he first took office, and more than four and a half years after the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nIndeed, the report goes into detail as it describes how the president \u201cexpressed discomfort with the image of a detainee, chained to the ceiling, clothed in a diaper, and forced to go to the bathroom on himself.\u201d This contradicts Bush\u2019s later claim to have \u201cpersonally approved the techniques\u201d in conversations with CIA Director George Tenet.\n\n2) The CIA tricked President Bush into lying to the American people about preventing a strike against a Marine base.\n\nIn a speech he delivered on September 6, 2006, Bush defended the use of \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d by insisting that it wasn\u2019t torture and arguing that it yielded \u201cintelligence that cannot be found any other place.\u201d Bush said, \u201cOur security depends on getting this kind of information.\u201d\n\nNot only does the report reveal that these methods often yielded either bad information (suspects would frequently make up anything to make the interrogation stop) or material that the military had already known, but it also discusses the use of \u201cforced rectal feedings,\u201d waterboarding until victims were \u201cnear drowning,\u201d and frequently violated the law and Constitution by ignoring Justice Department guidelines (and then lying to the necessary officials about it).\n\n3) The torture report has made high-ranking members of the Bush administration look ridiculous, either by being easily misled while in office or unconvincingly lying to save face afterward.\n\nDespite promising to be completely forthright with the president\u2019s foreign policy advisers, the report reveals that a great deal of information was kept from Secretary of State Colin Powell out of concern that he would\u2014as a 2003 NSA memo put it\u2014\u201cblow his stack\u201d if he found out torture was being used.\n\nMore from The Daily Dot: \u201cDaredevil with a jetpack races an airplane\u201d\n\nMore recently, in an interview with The New York Times, former Vice President Dick Cheney reiterated his claim that \u201cthe [torture] program was authorized.\u201d Cheney said, \u201cThe agency did not want to proceed without authorization, and it was also reviewed legally by the Justice Department before they undertook the program.\u201d As a summary of the congressional review in Politico explains, however, \u201cthe CIA\u2019s actual tactics often went far beyond the terms laid out in Justice Department legal opinions,\u201d with agents often going out of their way to mislead and dupe their superiors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans like to believe its presidents are monsters.
