Technology experts and Obamacare backers worry that each step ahead in the process \u2014 filling out applications, checking on subsidies and selecting a health insurance plan \u2014 creates a potential technology choke point. And that doesn\u2019t even count any additional chaos when people try to use their new health insurance come January.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThere is grave concern that many individuals who are intent on securing coverage by [Jan. 1] may not be able to do so by that date,\u201d said consultant Dan Schuyler, who helped design a health insurance exchange in Utah and is now the senior technology expert at Leavitt Partners. \u201cThere\u2019s a small window [the Department of Health and Human Services] has. If the problems persist another three or four weeks, those at the back of the line will not have coverage.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\nThe Obama administration and the contractors building the federal website have given scant explanation for the problems, other than blaming early problems on overwhelming turnout.\n\nSenior Hill Republicans, who had been predicting a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d even as they refused repeated administration requests for money to set up the system, are pressing HHS and the lead Obamacare software contractors \u2014 CGI and Quality Systems Software \u2014 to explain what went wrong.\n\n\u201cDespite the widespread belief that the administration was not ready for the health law\u2019s Oct. 1 launch, top officials and lead IT contractors looked us in the eye and assured us all systems were a go,\u201d Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said in a statement Thursday. \u201cInstead, here we are 10 days later and delays and technical failures have reached epidemic proportions.\u201d\n\n( WATCH: Kentucky residents react to Obamacare roll-out)\n\nObamacare advocates knew there would be glitches at the start, but they didn\u2019t expect anything like the technological logjam that has kept enrollment to a trickle.\n\nOutside tech experts have offered all sorts of explanations for the meltdown, but only those with direct knowledge of the tech infrastructure know \u2014 and they are still working through it. And when they put out one fire, another one could flare up.\n\nSome software engineers have suggested that the consumer end of the website, designed by one contractor, is not \u201ctalking to\u201d the back end of the website, developed by a different company.\n\nDiagnostic tools in Web browsers have identified coding issues that may be complicating account creation. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the administration is considering an overhaul of the registration system this weekend to allow people to browse health plan options without first creating an account. The paper said the tech experts are focused on a bottleneck where a flood of data meets an Oracle software component involved in identification verification.\n\n( WATCH: Ben Carson compares Obamacare to slavery)\n\nBut no one knows for sure whether or where other serious bugs lurk. Insurers and other businesses involved have complained about inadequate time to test the system after the already ambitious timetable was compressed because of delays in finalizing regulations for the Obamacare insurance exchanges and in signing off on contracts with insurers.\n\nThere have been some improvements since the rocky start; wait times are shorter and more people have been able to create accounts. But still, relatively few visitors to HealthCare.gov get through from start to finish \u2014 including registration, personal data submission, identity verification, tax credit eligibility and plan selection. And when the first obstacles come down and millions of people log on and try to complete each of these steps \u2014 any or all could turn into another choke point. There\u2019s particular worry about that tax credit calculation, which determines how much of the premium people have to pay.\n\n\u201cIf we are already running into issues at the user account stage, we\u2019re going to run into a lot more issues when we get to the more complex operations at the [subsidy] eligibility determination,\u201d said Leavitt\u2019s Schuyler. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality. It\u2019s a very complex process, and I think it\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Ted Cruz: Hecklers are Obama operatives)\n\nHHS declined to comment on The Wall Street Journal report or to respond to POLITICO\u2019s specific questions about possible problems with subsidy determinations or the enrollment transfers to insurers, two of the areas that experts pointed to as of particular concern.\n\n\u201cWe know that people are enrolling in coverage and the system works. As individual problems are raised by insurers, we work aggressively to address them,\u201d spokeswoman Joanne Peters said.\n\nPart of the problem is that signing up for Obamacare coverage is far more complicated than the online transactions Americans are used to, like checking a bank balance or ordering a book. The Obamacare website must knit together platforms from five huge federal agencies \u2014 Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration, HHS, the Treasury Department and the Department of Justice \u2014 each of which marches to its own IT specifications. It must also interact with separate systems set up by the 15 states that built their own exchanges, plus all of those outside insurers.\n\nIt\u2019s an unprecedented experiment in federal information technology.\n\n\u201cIf they pull it off, they will be making IT history,\u201d said Stephen Parente, director of the Medical Industry Leadership Institute at the University of Minnesota and a former health care adviser to Sen. John McCain. \u201cThis has never been done before.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Musicians singing Obamacare tune)\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t a pop quiz. The government had 3\u00bd years to prepare, and the warning signs were visible.\n\nFunding, in particular, has been a challenge, given the general budget impasse and the deep GOP opposition to Obamacare. The White House\u2019s April budget laid out an impossible request for an additional $1.5 billion for the final push to set up the law. Acknowledging Republican lawmakers would never agree to pony up those funds, administration officials assured the public they could move some money around and make do with what they had.\n\nWhatever the cause of the problems, the first 10 days have given plenty of fuel to the GOP complaint that Obamacare wasn\u2019t ready for prime time. \u201cA complete fiasco\u201d is how Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming summed it up this week.\n\nIt shook the confidence of some Obamacare supporters, too.\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "They worry issues with ACA enrollment will prevent some from even getting coverage.", "title": "Tech experts fear Obamacare bugs", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/obamacare-aca-tech-experts-glitches-issues-problems-98202.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/10/obamacare_signup3_reu_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Department Of Health And Human Services (158),Affordable Care Act (477),Technology (713),Health Care (1608),Obamacare (637)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "They worry issues with ACA enrollment will prevent some from even getting coverage.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ab8\"", "article_summary": "Outside tech experts have offered all sorts of explanations for the meltdown, but only those with direct knowledge of the tech infrastructure know \u2014 and they are still working through it.\n| REUTERS Tech experts fear Obamacare bugsThe glitch-plagued Obamacare rollout might be just the beginning: A series of potential technology problems could thwart the Obama administration\u2019s goal of getting 7 million people enrolled in the new exchanges by the end of March.\nThe paper said the tech experts are focused on a bottleneck where a flood of data meets an Oracle software component involved in identification verification.\nTechnology experts and Obamacare backers worry that each step ahead in the process \u2014 filling out applications, checking on subsidies and selecting a health insurance plan \u2014 creates a potential technology choke point.\n( WATCH: Ben Carson compares Obamacare to slavery)But no one knows for sure whether or where other serious bugs lurk."}
