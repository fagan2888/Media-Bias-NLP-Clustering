And even for a spell Saturday afternoon, the Thompson Valley lineup was waiting until the end.\n\nEventually, the Eagles' order found its way, belting out 16 hits against Greeley Central pitching at Constantz Field, producing a 16-6 victory in a six-inning game.\n\n\"We're starting to see the bats come alive, which is nice,\" TVHS coach Jay Denning said, his team improving to 2-2 in the Northern Conference, 3-2 overall. \"We kind of got the earlies out of us, and we're starting to fight a little bit more at the plate consistently and being aggressive. That's something we've been preaching at practice, and I saw that today. It shows me we're developing still.\"\n\nThompson Valley had some struggles in the first, with a pair of errors leading to a pair of unearned runs for the Wildcats. But once the Eagles got going, they kept up the pace. The odd part was in when the offense started to click.\n\nThe first nine runs Thompson Valley scored came in two big innings, and they all came with Greeley Central one out away from no damage.\n\nIn the second, there were two outs and nobody was on base when the Eagles erupted for a four-run frame, all of them unearned. It was with two outs and runners on first and second when the Eagles unleashed four straight hits to produce a five-run fourth, one that took the score from 4-3 to 9-3. And when the Wildcats (1-6, 1-3) scored three in the top of the fifth, the Eagles responded with three of their own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's good to not give up on the inning and just have your team keep working to get the next guy to the plate,\" said Colton Wilson, whose two-run double closed the scoring in the fourth. \"It's good to not panic. Just getting hits like that and not hanging around with them is really important. We can have a little bit of a cushion and kind of have a little more fun with it and not be stressed out. I think we play better when we're having fun.\"\n\nThompson Valley's Colton Wilson throws a pitch in the top of the fourth inning against Greeley Central on Saturday. Wilson picked up the win and also delivered a two-run double in a five-run fourth inning. (Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nEvery Eagle scored at least one run, and eight of them had hits. Matt and Mike Berg, Mitch Zundel and Wilson each drove in a pair. At the bottom of the order, Bailey Porter hit three of the team's seven doubles in the contest and scored three runs.\n\nIt was the most complete offensive showing the team has had, and one it felt it was capable of producing all along. Mike Berg and Kyler Deluca had three hits each, making life much more comfortable for the Eagles' pitchers.\n\nWilson started the game and went four solid innings, saying he ran out of steam in the fifth as the first five Wildcats reached base. Porter came on in relief, allowing an RBI single to the first batter, but then induced a pop-up and a line-drive double play to Deluca to thwart the threat.\n\n\"It's amazing, knowing that our defense is there to protect us,\" Porter said. \"We scored like six runs the past three games, and we've been trying to get it to break open. Finally today, everybody up and down finally got into it.\"\n\nDenning has been happy with the poise Porter has shown closing out games, finishing the final two innings with little noise to pick up the save. The coach was more encouraged with the at-bats his team had on the day, finishing the game early in a rush. The Eagles scored four in the sixth without an out being recorded, and only Josh Lewis producing a run-scoring hit; the others scored on two outfield errors and a wild pitch.\n\n\"If we can go out and produce like we did today with two outs, there's not a whole lot better that takes the wind out of a team's sail when they think they've got you,\" Denning said. \"There was nobody on, and that's the inning we get four on them. The important this is with two outs and two strikes, we didn't give up the at bat or give up the inning.\"\n\nMike Brohard: 970-635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com and twitter.com/RHpreps\n\nEagles 16, Wildcats 6 (6 inn.)\n\nAt Constantz Field\n\nGreeley Central 200 130 \u2014 6 7 3\n\nThompson Valley 040 534 \u2014 16 16 2\n\nW \u2014 Colton Wilson (1-0).
