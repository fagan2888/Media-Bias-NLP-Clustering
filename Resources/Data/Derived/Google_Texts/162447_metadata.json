He\u2019s cool in the pocket, that T.J. Ward, the guy they call \u201cBoss,\u201d a black fedora placed on his head just so. He\u2019s asked about the victory, about the interception. Then, after they retreat, he\u2019s asked about the real story of the defense \u2014 T.J. Ward finally being T.J. Ward again.\n\n\u201cHow many times did you blitz today?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think three,\u201d the Broncos safety said.\n\n\u201cIn the other games, how many blitzes did you average per game?\u201d\n\nAfter a light chuckle, Ward said, \u201cProbably 0.5, maybe one. There\u2019ve been a few games where I didn\u2019t blitz at all. I think it\u2019s a great call \u2014 the blitz allows me to use my speed against bigger interior linemen, so I\u2019m not running straight into them.\u201d\n\nThere were many game-changing plays Sunday, but the game-resetting play came from Ward, who also later intercepted a pass on a tipped ball in the fourth quarter which led to Denver\u2019s winning score.\n\nOn Miami\u2019s first drive, those Dolphins seemed to do whatever they wanted to, even allowing Larry Csonka to get a carry. But on the second Dolphins\u2019 drive, Denver defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio unleashed Ward on a third-and-8. No. 43 blitzed quarterback Ryan Tannehill, forcing the kid out of the pocket, resulting in an incomplete pass. This play exemplified his abilities, and, for a moment, justified why Denver paid big for a defensive shark who, after some quiet performances, was dubbed by a certain someone: \u201cShark Weak.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Miami Dolphins vs. Denver Broncos at Mile High\n\nIt took just a quick 11 weeks to do so. Yeah, Ward\u2019s close friend Rahim Moore said the public doesn\u2019t see the little things Ward has done this season to enhance the defense. Look, when Denver introduced Ward at a news conference, they didn\u2019t gush about the little things he does. They talked about the impact plays \u2014 the nasty. We finally saw it Sunday.\n\nDoes the \u201cBoss\u201d want to blitz more often?\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, I love blitzing,\u201d Ward said. \u201cWhenever I get an opportunity to put pressure on the quarterback and make third downs a little harder for them, that\u2019s where I\u2019m most comfortable. Whatever Jack wants to call and feels is the best defense, I\u2019m fine with that, too.\u201d\n\nDefensive coordinator Jack Del Rio is the boss, a proven defensive mind. But the subtle subtext of Ward\u2019s final line there \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m fine with that, too\u201d \u2014 caught my ear. Ward clearly wants to be a bigger part of the onslaught.\n\nWard plays \u201cthe most positions on the team,\u201d Moore explained, and we saw it Sunday. When asked about the defense allowing only 7 second-half rushing yards, Ward smiled after lauding the front of the defense, explaining that, \u201cI was kind of part of that front, too.\u201d\n\nWard is as much a linebacker (in sub packages) and a safety (in base packages), a dynamic weapon when used properly. A lot of football is finding a fit and a stride \u2014 we saw it with Denver\u2019s offensive line Sunday, admirably blocking an oft-used run offense. And a \u201cfreer\u201d T.J., Ward\u2019s words, allows him to attack.\n\nYes, T.J. made two dumb penalties Sunday \u2014 no excuses there. But he was also a hawk, deflecting two passes, forcing drops and occasionally blitzing like a boss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty comfortable at linebacker,\u201d the safety said. \u201cThere are some nuances I do have to fix, because I can\u2019t be in two meetings at one time.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, fans will talk about Ward\u2019s interception, the one that ricocheted into his arms, essentially sealing the victory. But they should also laud and applaud Del Rio for utilizing Ward and allowing him to do \u2014 in addition to the aforementioned little things \u2014 big things.\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/hochman", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hochman: Turning loose T.J.
