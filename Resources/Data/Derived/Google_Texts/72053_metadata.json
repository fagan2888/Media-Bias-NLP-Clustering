The ridge of high pressure keeps us nice and dry for Friday and Saturday\u2013 as morning clouds burn off for nice afternoon sunshine and temps near 80 degrees. That\u2019s much warmer still than the normal of 72 for this part of late summer.\n\nA system of low pressure called a cut-off low is heading our way and should be here by Sunday. It\u2019s riding on the fast moving jet stream\u2013 but it will bring clouds, cooler temperatures and a chance of Sunday showers as well as some possible Cascade thunderstorms. The timing on the showers looks to be later in the day on Sunday.\n\nA front right behind it looks to drop our temperatures even further\u2013 to highs in the mid 60s. Those are temperatures we were seeing as morning lows last week! Showers look likely for Monday and Tuesday morning. A brief break Wednesday and the forecast models look in pretty good agreement that we\u2019ll see some rain back on Thursday. This weekend is the last full one of the official summer season\u2013 so hopefully you can get out and enjoy the Saturday sunshine at least. Sunday, ignore the clouds and focus on rooting on the Seahawks!", "article_metadata": {"description": "After one of the hottest days all summer on Wednesday-- with a scorching 93 degrees-- we're cooling things off with big changes ahead.
