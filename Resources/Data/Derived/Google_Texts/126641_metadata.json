Pete Ricketts, a Republican, has signed legislation into law that will lift arduous occupational licensing requirements on the state\u2019s hair braiders.\n\nState Sen. Nicole Fox, R-Omaha, who introduced the legislation, said cosmetology licensing in the state requires nearly two years of schooling and costs $20,000 to $22,000 in tuition.\n\nFox\u2019s district is the third poorest in the state, she said, with a high number of single females.\n\n\u201cFor somebody who is a young single female, potentially a young single mom, who doesn\u2019t have a lot [of] resources and is already struggling to make ends meet, cosmetology in the state of Nebraska is expensive,\u201d Fox told The Daily Signal.\n\nPaul Avelar, a senior attorney at the Institute for Justice who helped draft Fox\u2019s legislation, said that prior to the new law, an individual practicing hair braiding without an occupational license could face up to three months in jail and $500 in fines.\n\nIf the braider continued to practice after receiving a cease and desist order from the state, he or she could be hit with a class III felony, which could subject an individual to four years in jail and $25,000 in fines.\n\n\u201cIn terms of things like braiding, what occupational licensing does is, it makes it more difficult for people to get into a field,\u201d Avelar told The Daily Signal. \u201cAnd for something like braiding, that\u2019s oftentimes a person\u2019s first step up the economic ladder.\u201d\n\nFox and Avelar worked with Brandy McMorris, an Omaha natural hair braider, to create legislation that would exempt braiders from Nebraska\u2019s strict licensing requirements.\n\nThe bill garnered bipartisan support and passed the legislature in a unanimous 42-0 vote.\n\n\u201cWe came together and said, \u2018This is something that people have done for centuries. Why is the government stepping in and trying to regulate this?\u2019\u201d Fox said.\n\nShe said the government is often \u201ctoo intrusive\u201d and enacts restrictions that prevent people from earning an honest living. She hopes her bill, which Ricketts signed into law March 9, will empower female professionals to take risks, which she said will help build self-esteem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the pursuing of the American Dream,\u201d Fox said. \u201cI think when you start taking risks and accomplishing things, it kind of makes you, the entrepreneur, set the bar higher and try to accomplish more.\u201d\n\nSalim Furth, a research fellow in macroeconomics at The Heritage Foundation, said more states should follow suit.\n\n\u201cIf you talk to women who get their hair braided, many of the braiders are unlicensed and thus work in the \u2018shadow economy,\u2019\u201d Furth told The Daily Signal. \u201cWith that regulation out of the way, it\u2019s easier for them to move into the formal economy, open a storefront, employ others, and teach their craft.\u201d\n\nCurrently, 16 states, along with Nebraska, do not require any sort of license to practice braiding, Avelar said. Another 15 states require a specialty license to braid hair, which Avelar said ranges from obtrusive to simple depending on the state.\n\nThe remaining 20 states, along with Washington, D.C., have grouped braiding into the practice of cosmetology, beauticians, and hairdressers, he said, meaning that in those states, individuals have to have at least 1,000 hours of training before they can braid hair professionally.\n\nFurth said Nebraska\u2019s legislature should continue to deregulate work in the state, where there is \u201cno serious, proven risk\u201d to public safety.\n\n\u201cOne easy way to deregulate is to accept other states\u2019 licenses: If you\u2019re good enough to be a dentist in Iowa, you\u2019re good enough to be a dentist in Nebraska,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an easy way for a state to attract more skilled workers without being accused of risking public safety.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just two weeks ago, Nebraskans who wanted to make money braiding hair had to undergo 2,100 hours of training to obtain a cosmetology license.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Just two weeks ago, Nebraskans who wanted to make money braiding hair had to undergo 2,100 hours of training to obtain a cosmetology license.", "title": "Nebraska Repeals Strict Licensing Laws for Hair Braiders", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160318_NebraskaHairBraiding_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-21T21:18:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1VwLAol"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Just two weeks ago, Nebraskans who wanted to make money braiding hair had to undergo 2,100 hours of training to obtain a cosmetology license.", "title": "Nebraska Repeals Strict Licensing Laws for Hair Braiders", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160318_NebraskaHairBraiding_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "regulation", "published_time": "2016-03-21T18:03:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-21T21:18:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Nebraska, Pete Ricketts, Nicole Fox, Institute for Justice, Paul Avelar, hair braiding, occupational license, cosmetology license, economic freedom"}, "article_summary": "Pete Ricketts, a Republican, has signed legislation into law that will lift arduous occupational licensing requirements on the state\u2019s hair braiders.\nJust two weeks ago, Nebraskans who wanted to make money braiding hair had to undergo 2,100 hours of training to obtain a cosmetology license, which state officials say dedicates little time to natural hair braiding techniques.\nAnother 15 states require a specialty license to braid hair, which Avelar said ranges from obtrusive to simple depending on the state.\nState Sen.
