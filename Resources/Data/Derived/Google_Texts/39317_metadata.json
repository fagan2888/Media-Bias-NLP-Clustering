Among other measures, the recommendations call for recognizing caregivers as members of \u201ccare teams,\u201d including information about caregivers in patient records, assessing caregivers\u2019 need for support, and making services like respite care more widely available.\n\nBut this group of 15 experts couldn\u2019t agree on how to pay for long-term care services needed by frail older adults or people with disabilities. The full report doesn\u2019t change that.\n\nCurrently, only those who are impoverished and qualify for Medicaid get significant assistance from the government for long-term care. For the most part, middle-class families are left to bear the burdensome expenses: $18 an hour on average for homemaker services, $19 an hour for home healthcare aids, $3,405 a month for assisted living, $230 a day for a private nursing home room, according to the latest report from Genworth Financial.\n\nHow to ease this financial burden was the most important issue facing the commission. In the end, the report proposed two alternatives: some kind of government insurance program for long-term care, or some kind of private insurance option. Then commission members essentially threw up their hands, admitting they couldn\u2019t agree.\n\nWhen my colleague Paula Span wrote about the commission earlier this year, she asked whether its work would elicit a yawn or a cheer. For many, the answer is neither. Even some commission members feel a sharp sense of frustration and disappointment.\n\nOne is Judy Feder, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, who voted against the commission\u2019s final recommendations on the grounds that they didn\u2019t fulfill Congress\u2019s charge to come up with a comprehensive solution. I asked her about a statement from six of her fellow commissioners insisting that any new long-term care program not enlarge public budgets.\n\n\u201cThe current system has a budgetary implication,\u201d Dr. Feder said. \u201cIt sticks it to families.\u201d\n\nAnother disappointed member is Judith Stein, executive director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy. \u201cThe vision in the majority report is not much more than we have now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is, \u2018Plan, understand, think about savings and insurance, and provide for those who are impoverished.\u2019 That kind of approach doesn\u2019t meet our long-term care needs now, and it won\u2019t meet them in the future.\u201d\n\nWhile several of the commission\u2019s recommendations are welcome, they will make a difference only \u201caround the margins,\u201d Ms. Stein said.\n\nFamilies will bear the consequences, said Ms. Stein and other experts. Elderly spouses will continue to struggle to care for each other, and adult children will strain to balance jobs and the needs of frail parents and their own children. Untold numbers of aging Americans won\u2019t get enough care, and caregivers will suffer from stress and depression, endangering their own health.\n\nIf a public insurance program is unaffordable, as several commission members claimed, might the private market supply a solution to the aging population\u2019s need for affordable long-term care? That seems unlikely. Premiums for private long-term care insurance have been rising dramatically, policies are becoming more restrictive, insurers have been exiting the market, and bureaucratic red tape makes it difficult for many individual and families to receive expected benefits.\n\nFinancially, the only way to make private insurance work is to spread risk over a wide base of policy holders. But the cost of long-term care coverage makes it unlikely that millions of healthy people will purchase policies. This was the economic calculus that doomed the Class Act, the voluntary long-term care insurance program that was originally part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIs there a way forward? The long-term care commission recommended two options: convening a White House conference on aging to consider long-term care policies, and establishing yet another advisory committee to continue its work. But, said Dr. Joanne Lynn, a geriatrician who directs the Center for Elder Care and Advanced Illness at the Altarum Institute, \u201cThe administration has shown no interest in having that happen, and here we are on the cusp of the largest generation in history growing old.\u201d\n\nShe believes that it\u2019s a mistake to separate long-term care from broader reforms of Medicare and the health care delivery system. The two systems of caring for people with disabilities and older adults need to be much more tightly integrated, Dr. Lynn said. Savings from eliminating inappropriate medical care \u2014 by some estimates, as much as one-third of all care \u2014 could be used to finance the expansion of long-term care services, she suggested.\n\nAs for another commission, is there any reason to hope it will be more successful in tackling critical issues when advocates of smaller government are committed to standing against a new federal insurance program for long-term care that might rely, at least in part, on public financing?\n\n\u201cI think this will be a hard discussion, but it is one that we as a country will have to grapple with,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Chernof, the commission\u2019s chairman and president of the SCAN Foundation in California. He sees the seeds of a potential compromise embedded in the commission\u2019s report. The two primary financing options considered by the commission share \u201csome commonalities,\u201d he said, including agreement on the need for strong public programs and a role for the private sector.\n\n\u201cIf you look carefully at these two perspectives, you can begin to see a way forward.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20130919165926, "twitter": {"description": "The full report from the federal Long-Term Care Commission offers few ideas about how Americans should pay for long-term care.", "title": "No Easy Answers on Financing Long-Term Care", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/no-easy-answers-on-financing-long-term-care/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@TheNewOldAge", "card": "summary"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000002453691, "DISPLAYDATE": "September 19, 2013", "keywords": "Elder Care,Elderly,Long-Term Care Insurance,News & Research", "GBLC": "News & Research", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/newoldage/No Easy Answers on Financing Long-Term Care ( 20130919 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Judith Graham", "SCG": "newoldage", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "newoldage", "CLMST": "Judith Graham", "byl": "Judith Graham", "BN": "newoldage", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/newoldage/post", "description": "The full report from the federal Long-Term Care Commission offers few ideas about how Americans should pay for long-term care.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 19, 2013", "article": {"tag": "News & Research", "published_time": 1379624366, "modified_time": "2013-09-19T20:59:26-04:00", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20130919205926, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20130919, "pdate": 20130919, "des": "Elder Care;Elderly;Long-Term Care Insurance", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "The New Old Age Blog", "description": "The full report from the federal Long-Term Care Commission offers few ideas about how Americans should pay for long-term care.", "title": "No Easy Answers on Financing Long-Term Care", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/no-easy-answers-on-financing-long-term-care/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/no-easy-answers-on-financing-long-term-care/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "No Easy Answers on Financing Long-Term Care", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc57b\"", "article_summary": "The long-term care commission recommended two options: convening a White House conference on aging to consider long-term care policies, and establishing yet another advisory committee to continue its work.\nSavings from eliminating inappropriate medical care \u2014 by some estimates, as much as one-third of all care \u2014 could be used to finance the expansion of long-term care services, she suggested.\nThis was the economic calculus that doomed the Class Act, the voluntary long-term care insurance program that was originally part of the Affordable Care Act.\nCurrently, only those who are impoverished and qualify for Medicaid get significant assistance from the government for long-term care.\nBut this group of 15 experts couldn\u2019t agree on how to pay for long-term care services needed by frail older adults or people with disabilities."}
