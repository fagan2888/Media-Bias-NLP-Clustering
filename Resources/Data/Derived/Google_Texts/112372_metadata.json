People who drink them say they don\u2019t cause jitters or crashes like other energy drinks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can even compare the ingredients that are in G Fuel to the ingredients of some energy drinks,\u201d said Clifford Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Gamma Labs, which makes the G Fuel drinks.\n\nBut caffeine and other stimulants remain central ingredients. G Fuel\u2019s caffeine content, 150 milligrams per 12 fluid ounces, is higher than many of the Monster and Red Bull drinks, according to Caffeine Informer. GungHo does not disclose its caffeine content.\n\nCaffeine is not the only concern, Schneider said. Other ingredients such as taurine and guarana, a plant extract, also act as stimulants. Taurine, for example, which is in G Fuel, \u201cworks on the heart,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/06/hfyouth02.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Traditional energy drink makers have also been playing to the growing gamer culture in some labels \u2014 Mountain Dew Game Fuel (with extra doses of caffeine) and Nintendo Power Up Energy Drink.\nPeople who drink them say they don\u2019t cause jitters or crashes like other energy drinks.\nG Fuel and a competitor called GungHo are a new incarnation of energy drink, growing in popularity while the energy drink industry as a whole has been under scrutiny because of deaths and hospitalizations linked to consumption of caffeine- and sugar-laden beverages.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can even compare the ingredients that are in G Fuel to the ingredients of some energy drinks,\u201d said Clifford Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Gamma Labs, which makes the G Fuel drinks.\nIn the days afterward, online followers from hardcore gamers to middle-schoolers on Xboxes ordered tubs of the stuff, the latest flavor of a powdered energy drink called G Fuel that is marketed as a secret sauce to enhance focus and endurance for virtual battles."}
