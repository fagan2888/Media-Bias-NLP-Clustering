The Wednesday panel of MSNBC’s Morning Joe defended Donald Trump after his confrontational press conference back-and-forth with Univision’s Jorge Ramos, noting that Ramos wasn’t “thrown out” and that he was grandstanding, not asking questions.

The Blaze’s Amy Holmes noted it was a “win-win” for journalists to attack Trump. “Look how much attention Jorge Ramos is getting for this exchange–”

“For pretending he was bullied and pretending he was thrown out of a room?” host Mika Brzezinski cut it. “…He made himself the story.”

“I was reminded of Larry King listening to a call in, saying, ‘Alright caller, caller, do you have a question?'” Holmes said. “Clearly he wanted to bait Donald Trump and he succeeded.”

“You look at the transcript, no reporter that I know would go to a press conference — to President Obama– and deliver a speech,” host Joe Scarborough agreed. “He had a hilarious tweet this morning, ‘reporters ask questions.’ Well, if he had actually asked a question upfront, we wouldn’t be talking about it. And of course he wouldn’t want that. He wants to make it about him.”

When contributor Mike Barnicle noted how uncomfortable it must have been in the room, Brzezinski responded, “I’m not sure Trump was the one making it uncomfortable. And the question he finally got to was not a very good one, to be honest.”

“He was editorializing the entire time. Write an editorial,” Scarborough concluded bluntly
