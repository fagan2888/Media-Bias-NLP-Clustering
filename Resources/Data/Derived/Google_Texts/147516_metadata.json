By voting for the DARK Act, these politicians voted against truth and transparency, against science, against the more than century-old right of states to legislate on matters relating to food safety and labeling.\n\nThey voted against the 93 percent of Americans who are in favor of mandatory labeling of GMOs. They voted against the producers of non-GMO foods.\n\nThey voted against you.\n\nNow that the DARK Act has been approved by the House, we\u2019ll have to stop it in the Senate. We have to move fast \u2014 because Monsanto is desperate to pass a bill that preempts mandatory GMO labeling laws at the state and federal levels, before Vermont\u2019s GMO labeling law takes effect next year.\n\nH.R. 1599 was sold to Congress via multi-million dollar public relations and lobbying campaigns built on lies and deception. The bill\u2019s sole purpose is to support an industry \u2014 Monsanto\u2019s poison-peddling industry \u2014 that was founded on lies and deception from the get-go.\n\nReports show that since 2013, the biotech and food industries have spent $143 million lobbying against GMO labeling at the state and federal level. House members who supported H.R. 1599 took in $29.9 million in contributions from agribusiness and food industries in 2014 alone, according to OpenSecrets.org.\n\nWere the Congress members who voted against you fooled by Monsanto\u2019s slick, deceitful packaging of this so-called \u201cSafe and Accurate Food Labeling Act\u201d? Or did they simply vote with their wallets, stuffed full of biotech and junk food industry cash?\n\nWe don\u2019t know. But we know this: We can\u2019t let this bill get through the U.S. Senate. That\u2019s why we\u2019re asking consumers to reach out, through a petition to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to help. As a proponent of labeling, a critic of corporate money in politics, a senator from the only state whose GMO labeling law is in imminent danger, and a presidential candidate who is attracting widespread media attention right now, Sanders could draw national attention to this issue. He could influence his fellow senators to reject a Senate version of H.R. 1599. He could filibuster a Senate version, if it gets that far.\n\nTAKE ACTION: Urge Senator Bernie Sanders to speak out against the DARK Act\n\nLess than 24 hours before the July 23 House vote, the industry-funded front group behind H.R. 1599 was still pushing out the lies. The \u201cCoalition for Safe and Affordable Food,\u201d feigning concern for consumers, emailed members urging them to support the DARK Act because if we require mandatory labeling, it will increase the cost of your food by $500/year. That lie has been debunked over and over, by legitimate independent studies. It\u2019s a lie based on a study funded by, and which remains the intellectual property of, the Council for Biotech Information \u2014 of which Monsanto is a member.\n\nLess than 24 hours before the House vote, a staffer in the office of the bill\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Mike Pompeo, told a caller that the DARK Act gives consumers what they want: the means to know whether or not their food contains GMOs. \u201cConsumers can choose to presume that all foods have GMO contents unless they are labeled or otherwise presented as non-GMO. Meaning that it is knowable and it is known by the public which products have GMO and which don't,\u201d claimed a Pompeo staffer.\n\nMore lies. The DARK Act creates a voluntary, government-run non-GMO certification program. Unless every producer of non-GMO products pays to have those products certified non-GMO, consumers will still have no way of knowing which products contain GMOs, and which don\u2019t. And why should the burden of labeling fall on the producers of non-GMO foods, when the risk factor is associated with those foods that do contain GMOs?\n\nH.R. 1599 would repeal existing state GMO labeling laws, such as Vermont\u2019s Act 120, and would preempt any future state or federal laws requiring mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods or foods containing GMOs. That\u2019s unconstitutional, according to the Campaign for Liberty, which said this in a blog post:\n\nWhatever your views on GMOs, there is no Constitutional justification for the federal government to preempt state laws in this area. There certainly is no justification for Congress to preempt private sector efforts to meet consumer demands for non-GMO foods, while allowing those who support the use of GMOs to do so.\n\nYet 275 members of the U.S. House voted against the U.S. Constitution. And if we don\u2019t stop them, a majority of U.S. senators could do the same.\n\nIf we are going to stop the federal government from taking away our right to demand truth and transparency in labeling, we will have to double or triple our size and our impact. Please ask Sen. Bernie Sanders to help us stop this bill in the Senate, and then reach out to your own senators as well.\n\nTAKE ACTION: Urge Senator Bernie Sanders to speak out against the DARK Act\n\nTAKE ACTION: Tell your senators to vote NO on the DARK Act\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nHow Monsanto Could Get Even Bigger and More Powerful\n\nBill Nye on the Monsanto Eco Disaster: \u2018We Accidentally Decimated the Monarch Butterfly Population\u2019\n\nEl Salvador Farmers Successfully Defy Monsanto\n\nAs Chipotle Goes GMO-free, Monsanto's Worst Fear Is Coming True \u2014 and Corporate Media Is Freaking Out\n\nIs Monsanto's Notorious Herbicide in Your Body?
