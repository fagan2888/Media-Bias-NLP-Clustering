Complaints against lawyers are usually disposed of with a letter of discipline that stays confidential. Generally, it\u2019s only when a court imposes public discipline do allegations ever become public.\n\nMr. Gillers\u2019s paper helped persuade New York\u2019s retiring chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, to set up a commission to examine attorney discipline in New York and invite him to participate as a member. Mr. Gillers\u2019s research is cited repeatedly in the 86-page report the panel released last month recommending changes to standardize the system. Court officials also praised the scholar for his work on the issue. What they didn\u2019t do was take his recommendations.\n\nThe several-dozen-member panel, mostly composed of New York lawyers and judges, came up with what they described as a compromise on disclosure: Disciplinary proceedings could be unsealed \u201cupon a finding\u2026that the attorney\u2019s conduct places clients at significant risk or presents an immediate threat to the public interest.\u201d\n\nMr. Gillers, in a letter to the court system this week, said the proposed move would actually be a step backward for transparency.\n\nToday, a court can lift secrecy on a finding of \u201cgood cause.\u201d The Commission\u2019s recommendation would require more \u2013 i.e., a finding \u201cthat the attorney\u2019s conduct places clients at significant risk or presents an immediate threat to the public interest.\u201d The recommendation actually makes things worse for clients. It reduces transparency. Furthermore, if indeed there is a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to clients or an \u201cimmediate threat to the public interest,\u201d merely lifting secrecy is entirely inadequate.\n\nIn nearly 40 states, according to Mr. Gillers, disciplinary charges against attorneys are automatically made public upon a finding of probable cause. That\u2019s when there\u2019s reasonable grounds to believe that an attorney has committed an ethical violation.\n\nCommission members who objected to more disclosure said it would risk damaging the reputation of an attorney who is accused of wrongdoing but later exonerated. The risk of harm \u2014 potentially leading to, in the words of the commission\u2019s report, \u201ccareer-damaging publicity which, in the era of social media, could never be fully retracted \u2014 outweighed whatever extra confidence and trust in the disciplinary system that more openness would bring, the critics said, according to the report.\n\nThe report didn\u2019t say how often attorneys who face complaints are exonerated. \u201cWe were told that there were very few,\u201d Mr. Gillers told Law Blog on Tuesday.\n\nDeclining to respond to the professor\u2019s criticisms, New York court system spokesman David Bookstaver told Law Blog the court system\u2019s leadership appreciates Mr. Gillers\u2019s input. \u201cHe brought to light an issue that certainly hasn\u2019t been addressed over the years, and the chief judge thought it was important to address his concerns,\u201d Mr. Bookstaver said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A New York judicial commission has rejected a push by a leading legal ethics expert to make the state's system for disciplining lawyers more transparent.", "title": "New York Lawyers Resist Push to Make Attorney Discipline Less Secret", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/10/20/new-york-lawyers-resist-push-to-make-attorney-discipline-less-secret/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DZ178_giller_G_20140805135642.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "New York Lawyers Resist Push to Make Attorney Discipline Less Secret", "description": "A New York judicial commission has rejected a push by a leading legal ethics expert to make the state's system for disciplining lawyers more transparent.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Jacob Gershman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Law Blog Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Law Blog", "article.summary": "A New York judicial commission has rejected a push by a leading legal ethics expert to make the state's system for disciplining lawyers more transparent.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-10-20T20:20:41-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/10/20/new-york-lawyers-resist-push-to-make-attorney-discipline-less-secret/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-LB-52388", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A New York judicial commission has rejected a push by a leading legal ethics expert to make the state's system for disciplining lawyers more transparent.", "title": "New York Lawyers Resist Push to Make Attorney Discipline Less Secret", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/10/20/new-york-lawyers-resist-push-to-make-attorney-discipline-less-secret/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DZ178_giller_G_20140805135642.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Law Blog", "article.id": "BL-LB-52388", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-10-22T18:20:16-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1756\"", "article_summary": "Sanctions against attorneys in New York often take the form of non-public discipline, wrote New York University law professor Stephen Gillers.\nGenerally, it\u2019s only when a court imposes public discipline do allegations ever become public.\nDeclining to respond to the professor\u2019s criticisms, New York court system spokesman David Bookstaver told Law Blog the court system\u2019s leadership appreciates Mr. Gillers\u2019s input.\n\u201cWe were told that there were very few,\u201d Mr. Gillers told Law Blog on Tuesday.\nIn nearly 40 states, according to Mr. Gillers, disciplinary charges against attorneys are automatically made public upon a finding of probable cause."}
