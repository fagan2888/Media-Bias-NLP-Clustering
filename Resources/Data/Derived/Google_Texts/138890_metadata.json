But once in a while, exceptions arise.\n\nCBS\u2019s Norah O\u2019Donnell joined a panel with her \u201cThis Morning\u201d co-anchor Charlie Rose and legal analyst Jack Ford on January 6 to discuss the heated controversy of brain dead Marlise Munoz, a Texas woman who remains on life support because of her unborn baby. Predictably, many liberals believe Munoz should be taken off life support and allowed to die \u2013 along with her now 18-week-old unborn infant.\n\nBut O\u2019Donnell argued for the baby, noting, \u201cBut in this case, it involves another life. It involves a baby. She\u2019s pregnant, and now that baby is 18 weeks old and, you know, eight weeks maybe, less before viability.\u201d Story continues after video.\n\nYet O\u2019Donnell was alone. Online media bewailed the continued life support for the 33-year-old Munoz, whose husband found her lying on the floor. The outlets disregarded her (then 14-week-old) unborn baby \u2013 except as an obstacle to Munoz\u2019s \u201cpeaceful\u201d death. Due to her pregnancy, Texas law prevented family from taking Munoz off life support.\n\nBegging sympathy only for the woman \u201cforced\u201d to live, the front page of The New York Times blasted, \u201cPregnant, and Forced to Stay on Life Support\u201d on Jan. 8. The message went viral via lefty sites as Slate\u2019s Amanda Marcotte announced, \u201cBrain-Dead Woman Forced to Stay on Life Support Because She\u2019s Pregnant\u201d while Feministing\u2019s Lori Adelman agreed, \u201cAll She is is a Host for a Fetus\u201d: Brain-Dead Pregnant Woman Forced to Stay on Life Support in Texas. Salon\u2019s Katie McDonough chimed in, \u201cTexas Family Describes \u201cPure Hell\u201d of Being Forced to Keep their Loved One on Life Support.\u201d\n\nOther sites compared Munoz to a robot (what\u2019s that, feminism?). Jezebel\u2019s Doug Barry lamented, \u201cTexas Will Keep a Dead Woman on Life Support Just to Incubate Her Fetus\u201d while The Huffington Post (UK) complained, \u201cMarlise Munoz, Brain-Dead Texan Woman, Kept Alive To Incubate Unborn Baby\u201d Think Progress\u2019 Tara Culp-Ressler summarized, \u201cTexas Family Outlawed From Removing Brain Dead Woman From Life Support Because She\u2019s Pregnant.\u201d\n\nEven the big name media outlets focused solely on the mother. The Guardian\u2019s Tom Dart wrote \u201cTexas Hospital to Keep Pregnant, Brain-Dead Woman On Life Support\u201d as his title, while ABC\u2019s Susan Donaldson James\u2019 report read, \u201cHusband Wants Pregnant Wife Off Life Support.\u201d CBS\u2019 Ryan Jaslow similarly focused on how \u201cTexas Life Support Battle Pits State Law Against Pregnant Woman\u2019s Earlier Wishes.\u201d\n\nExcepting the pleasant surprise from O\u2019Donnell, the networks danced with censorship in the past when it came to life, from covering last year\u2019s March for Life in a mere 17 seconds to popularizing the word \u201cfetus\u201d versus \u201cbaby.\u201d\n\nThe secular left howled back in 1995 when Pope John Paul II described a \u201cculture of death\u201d that had grown in Western society. The fact that O\u2019Donnell is the sole media voice urging mercy for Marlise Munoz\u2019s baby proves the pontiff\u2019s case, and shows how far we\u2019ve gone down the road he described: \u201cChoices once unanimously considered criminal and rejected by the common moral sense are gradually becoming socially acceptable.\"\n\n\u2014 Katie Yoder is Staff Writer, Joe and Betty Anderlik Fellow in Culture and Media at the Media Research Center.
