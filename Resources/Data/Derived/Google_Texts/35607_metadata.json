Customers will still be able to evaluate their experience via a confidential survey provided with each check.\n\nUnder the change, all servers, whether salaried or hourly, will be paid a minimum of $20/hour, according to the release. The average kitchen wage will go up to $14.50/hour, from $11/hour. Most servers will be moved to a 34-hour salaried work week and will receive two weeks of paid sick leave/vacation and discretionary annual bonuses. Restaurant owners are also exploring health-care options for full-time employees.\n\n\u201cAll of our employees are like family and they deserve to be treated like family,\u201d restaurant owner Nancy Progar said in a statement. \u201cEveryone who works in our restaurant deserves a living wage. Happier employees mean better food and service which results in happier customers. While this approach to compensation will be slightly more expensive for us, we feel that it will allow us to be more successful in the future. In addition, we believe that a customer\u2019s written review will be a much better vehicle for feedback and improvement than an arbitrary tip.\u201d\n\nAbrusci\u2019s follows in the footsteps of some very well known restaurants across the U.S. Among those that have replaced tipping with surcharges or all-inclusive prices are Alinea in Chicago, Chez Panisse in Berkeley, French Laundry in Napa Valley and Per Se in New York.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Abrusci's Italian Restaurant,no-tipping,Wheat Ridge", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thebalancesheet/2015/07/07/abruscis-restaurant-in-wheat-ridge-institutes-no-tipping-policy/13003/", "site_name": "The Balance Sheet", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog", "title": "Abrusci\u2019s restaurant in Wheat Ridge institutes no-tipping policy"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Abrusci\u2019s restaurant in Wheat Ridge institutes no-tipping policy", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thebalancesheet/2015/07/07/abruscis-restaurant-in-wheat-ridge-institutes-no-tipping-policy/13003/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@emilierusch", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Abrusci's Italian Restaurant, 3244 Youngfield St., announced Wednesday that it will institute a no-tipping policy starting July 20."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda916\"", "article_summary": "The next time you eat at Abrusci\u2019s Italian Restaurant in Wheat Ridge, don\u2019t bother tipping your server.\nThe restaurant at 3244 Youngfield St. announced Tuesday that it will institute a no-tipping policy starting July 20.\nHappier employees mean better food and service which results in happier customers.\nUnder the change, all servers, whether salaried or hourly, will be paid a minimum of $20/hour, according to the release.\n\u201cAll of our employees are like family and they deserve to be treated like family,\u201d restaurant owner Nancy Progar said in a statement."}
