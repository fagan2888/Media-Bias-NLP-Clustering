The band, participating in the Dot to Dot Festival in the UK, is known for its bizarre kazoo solos, pizza-box banging and pizza parodies like, \u201cTake a Bite of the Wild Slice\u201d (\u201cWalk on the Wild Side\u201d), \u201cAll The Pizza Parties\u201d (\u201cAll Tomorrow\u2019s Parties\u201d) and \u201cIt\u2019s a Pizza Day\u201d (\u201cPerfect Day\u201d). Apparently, that is about as annoying as it sounds, though the crowd at Rock City went a little too far to express their displeasure, according to the Nottingham Post.\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nAfter being attacked by beer bottles, Culkin cried, \u201cWhy are you throwing those?

Sorry that a couple people ruined it for everyone. \u2014 pizza underground (@cheesedayz) May 25, 2014\n\nNot all of the band\u2019s performances were, err, as poorly received.
