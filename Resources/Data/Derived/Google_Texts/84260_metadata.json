Many opponents called it \"out of sight, out of mind\" politics by those that would \u201crather not look at the homeless.\u201d\n\nAfter years of trying to pass the ordinance and several hours of heated debate and public comment on Tuesday, the Oklahoma City Council approved an ordinance that would ban panhandling from city medians.\n\nThe council voted 7-2. Members Dr. Ed Shadid and Pete White voted against the measure.\n\nDespite the lopsided vote, supporters at the meeting were outnumbered nearly four to one. Many opponents called it \"out of sight, out of mind\" politics by those that would \u201crather not look at the homeless.\u201d\n\nThere was talk of tabling the vote until June 14, to allow non-profit organizations time to study homelessness and poverty, but that was voted down despite attempts to work across differing opinions. The arguments were split between serving those in need and serving the public by keeping intersections safe.\n\nOklahoma City Police Chief Bill Citty showed the council slides of intersections with broken medians where vehicles had damaged medians. He also showed the number of fatal or injury crashes topped 12,000 in 2014. Fifteen people were killed while standing or sitting on medians.\n\nWhen asked if similar ordinances in other major cities reduced the number of panhandlers, Citty said they did not, but made clear his concern was safety.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] absolutely not public safety ordinance, the fact of the matter is individuals will be less safe because of this ordinance,\u201d said Whitley O\u2019Connor, who helped found the Curbside Chronicle.\n\nThe Curbside Chronicle is a magazine that is sold by the homeless or jobless on street corners and medians. O\u2019Connor said the new law will most likely kill the business.\n\nUnder the ordinance, all panhandling or fundraising is banned from any median less than 30 feet wide. Most in Oklahoma City are under that width. Panhandlers would also be required to be 200 feet from an intersection and anyone caught by authorities would be fined up to $100. But critics say the law will be difficult to enforce.\n\n\u201cI don't think the city right now, if you asked the city of Oklahoma City what it takes to in compliance with the measure, I don't think they can tell you,\u201d Ryan Keisel, director of ACLU-Oklahoma said after the vote.\n\nSomething Citty disagreed with.\n\n\u201cI find that many of the people that were soliciting in the medians, which they won't be able to get now, and in many cases you'll have a panhandler or somebody like that, they'll know it's against the law,\u201d City said.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "After years of trying to pass the ordinance and several hours of heated debate and public comment on Tuesday, the Oklahoma City Council approved an ordinance that would ban panhandling from city me...", "author": "Grant Hermes", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30699976/debate-continues-after-okc-city-council-passes-ordinance-against-panhandling", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9419055_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "After years of trying to pass the ordinance and several hours of heated debate and public comment on Tuesday, the Oklahoma City Council approved an ordinance that would ban panhandling from city me...", "title": "Debate Continues After OKC City Council Passes Ordinance Against Panhandling"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9419055_G.jpg", "description": "After years of trying to pass the ordinance and several hours of heated debate and public comment on Tuesday, the Oklahoma City Council approved an ordinance that would ban panhandling from city me...", "card": "summary", "title": "Debate Continues After OKC City Council Passes Ordinance Against Panhandling"}, "wnreadableurl": "debate-continues-after-okc-city-council-passes-ordinance-against-panhandling", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/12/08", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive,panhandling", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS07", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive,panhandling"}, "article_summary": "Oklahoma City Police Chief Bill Citty showed the council slides of intersections with broken medians where vehicles had damaged medians.\nThe council voted 7-2.\nMost in Oklahoma City are under that width.\n\u201cI don't think the city right now, if you asked the city of Oklahoma City what it takes to in compliance with the measure, I don't think they can tell you,\u201d Ryan Keisel, director of ACLU-Oklahoma said after the vote.\n\u201c[It\u2019s] absolutely not public safety ordinance, the fact of the matter is individuals will be less safe because of this ordinance,\u201d said Whitley O\u2019Connor, who helped found the Curbside Chronicle."}
