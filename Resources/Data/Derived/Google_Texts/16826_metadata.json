After March 31, Connecticut residents won't be able to buy individual-market health plans for this year, unless they go through a change in circumstances like losing a job or getting divorced (and no, getting sick doesn't count).\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the deadline, how you can qualify for a special enrollment period if something changes and you need coverage after March 31, the penalty for not having insurance and how to get an exemption from the individual mandate.\n\nIf you have a question about Obamacare, email Mirror health reporter Arielle Levin Becker at alevinbecker@ctmirror.org.\n\nWhat is the March 31 deadline for?\n\n\n\nMarch 31 is the last day to buy individual-market private insurance in Connecticut for 2014. That applies to health plans sold by the health exchange and those sold outside the exchange.\n\n(Because of inaccurate information provided by the companies, last week\u2019s Q&A incorrectly said that at least one company would continue selling insurance to individuals after March 31. In fact, none will, unless you have a change in circumstances that qualifies you to buy insurance outside the open enrollment period.)\n\nBut the deadline does not apply to small-group insurance plans. It also doesn\u2019t apply to people who qualify for Medicaid, who can sign up at any time during the year.\n\nWhat if I lose my job after March 31? Would I be unable to buy insurance?\n\nNo, you would be able to buy insurance because losing your job is considered a \u201cqualifying life event\u201d that allows you to sign up for insurance even if the open enrollment period for the year has ended. Other qualifying events include getting married or divorced, having a baby, moving to another state or, in some cases, changes in income.\n\nPeople who have a qualifying event and want to buy insurance can request a \"special enrollment period\" to sign up for coverage. That would give them 60 days from the date of the qualifying event to buy insurance.\n\nHow do you get a special enrollment period to sign up for coverage after March 31?\n\nThe easiest way for people who want to buy coverage through the exchange to request a special enrollment period is to use the Access Health call center (1-855-805-4325), said Chad Brooker, policy and legal analyst at Access Health.\n\nYou will probably be asked to submit documentation to prove why you qualify for the enrollment exception, such as a letter confirming that your job no longer provides health care or a letter saying you no longer qualify for Medicaid.\n\nPeople will also still be able to browse health plans through the exchange's website after March 31, Brooker said.\n\nPeople who qualify for special enrollment periods can also purchase insurance sold outside the exchange.\n\nI\u2019m working on my tax returns now. Do I need to do anything to prove that I have insurance?\n\nNo. The individual mandate didn\u2019t take effect until this year so your taxes for 2013 are not affected.\n\nI\u2019m thinking of not getting insurance and paying the penalty. What do I need to know?\n\nThe penalty for 2014 is 1 percent of your income above the tax return threshold or $95, whichever is higher. (For most people, it will be 1 percent.) The penalty will increase in subsequent years.\n\nIf you have coverage for part of the year, you\u2019ll owe a prorated penalty. It\u2019s calculated based on the number of months you didn\u2019t have coverage, with each month costing you 1/12 of the full-year penalty. So if you're uninsured for six months, you'd owe half of 1 percent of your income.\n\nIf you're uninsured for fewer than three consecutive months, you won't have to pay a penalty.\n\nAnother thing to note: According to federal regulations, if you have insurance for at least one day in a given month, you are considered to be insured for that full month and wouldn\u2019t owe a penalty for that month.\n\nWhat happens if you don\u2019t pay your penalty? The federal government can\u2019t issue a lien, but it can deduct the amount from any refund you\u2019re owed, according to the IRS.\n\nI think I\u2019m exempt from the individual mandate. How do I get out of paying the penalty for not having insurance?\n\nIn most cases, you\u2019ll have to apply for an exemption through Connecticut's exchange. (Brooker said Connecticut is the only state handling its own exemption process. The other states are relying on the federal government to do it.)\n\nTo apply for an exemption, you\u2019ll have to fill out this form. (You can find it on the Access Health website, www.accesshealth.com, by clicking the \u201cCan I opt out?\u201d tab on the bottom right corner of the homepage.)\n\nA team at the exchange will review the submitted forms and any supporting documents people include and determine if they meet the requirements for an exemption. For those who qualify, the team will also determine whether they will be granted an exemption for the full year or for part of the year.\n\nOne group that doesn\u2019t need to apply for an exemption: People who don\u2019t have enough income to be required to file a federal income tax return. The Internal Revenue Service has said people in that category, who are not subject to the individual mandate, don\u2019t have to take any action to get an exemption.\n\nThere are several circumstances in which someone could be exempt from the individual mandate. They are:\n\nIf you're uninsured for fewer than three months of the year;\n\nIf coverage is unaffordable to you -- that is, if the cheapest option available would cost more than 8 percent of your household income;\n\nIf your income is too low for you to be required to file a tax return (in Connecticut, many people in this category would qualify for Medicaid);\n\nBelonging to a federally recognized tribe;\n\nBeing a member of a recognized health care sharing ministry;\n\nBeing a member of a recognized religious sect with religious objections to insurance, including Social Security and Medicare;\n\nIf you\u2019re incarcerated;\n\nIf you\u2019re not in the country legally.\n\nIn addition, people could potentially qualify for a \u201chardship exemption\u201d from the mandate if any of the following affected their ability to buy health insurance:", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/03/18/obamacare-qa-health-insurance-deadlines-and-taxes/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/03/18/obamacare-qa-health-insurance-deadlines-and-taxes/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Here\u2019s what you need to know about the March 31 deadline for buying coverage, how you can qualify for a special enrollment period if something changes and you need insurance after the deadline, the penalty for not having coverage and how to get an exemption from the individual mandate.", "title": "Obamacare Q&A: Health insurance deadlines and taxes", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/03/18/obamacare-qa-health-insurance-deadlines-and-taxes/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2013/09/kff-image2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/03/18/obamacare-qa-health-insurance-deadlines-and-taxes/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca3f3\"", "article_summary": "That would give them 60 days from the date of the qualifying event to buy insurance.\nIn addition, people could potentially qualify for a \u201chardship exemption\u201d from the mandate if any of the following affected their ability to buy health insurance:\nIn fact, none will, unless you have a change in circumstances that qualifies you to buy insurance outside the open enrollment period.)\nThere are two weeks to go in the first-ever open enrollment period for buying private insurance coverage as part of the federal health law commonly known as Obamacare.\nWould I be unable to buy insurance?"}
