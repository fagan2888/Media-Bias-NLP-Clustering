Converse Chuck Taylor All Star fans rejoice! Your favorite sneaker is receiving its first construction update since debuting 98 years ago.



The idea behind the All Star II is comfort, Converse said in a statement Thursday.



The update is made of durable Tencel canvas, as opposed to the cotton kind, with higher tech shock absorption in Nike Lunarlon for the footbed. There's foam padding inside at the ankle, non-slip padded tongues and perforated micro-suede liners along the interior sides.



For the exterior, the iconic circle patch is embroidered on and eyelets will be colored to match the shoe. In addition, the sole is slightly higher than traditional Chucks.



The easily recognizable rubber toe cap will remain. The new shoe goes on sale July 28 in black, white, red and blue.
