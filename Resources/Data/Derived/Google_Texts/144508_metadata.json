But the former first lady has focused attention on an agenda that, polls suggest, Americans want their elected leaders to take on.\n\nMaking high-cost drugs affordable should be the top healthcare priority for the next president and Congress, three-quarters of Americans said in a nationwide survey this year.\n\nMost Americans also want their elected leaders to protect them from surprise out-of-network medical charges. They want government to ensure health plans have sufficient networks. And they want more information about the prices of doctors\u2019 visits, tests and procedures, according to the poll, by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nBy contrast, fewer than half the respondents want their elected officials to deal with concerns about the Affordable Care Act. Just a third want it fully repealed.\n\n\u201cHealth is really a pocketbook issue more than a political issue now,\u201d foundation President Drew Altman said.\n\nThe evolution may reflect in part Republicans\u2019 waning repeal campaign.\n\nFive-and-half years after its enactment, the law has survived two major legal challenges and three national elections. And, contrary to opponents\u2019 warnings, it has extended coverage to millions of Americans without destroying the existing employer-based system that most in the U.S. rely on for health insurance.\n\nBut another factor is likely driving Americans\u2019 concerns about drug prices and medical costs.\n\nOver the last decade, the average deductible that workers must pay for medical care before their insurance kicks in has more than tripled from $303 in 2006 to $1,077 today, according to a recent report on employer-provided coverage from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust.\n\nThat is seven times faster than wages have risen in the same period.\n\nAt the same time, nearly a third of Americans with private health insurance have received a bill in which they were charged more than they had expected to have to pay, a recent nationwide Consumer Reports survey showed.\n\nIn response, Clinton is proposing a series of new restrictions on insurers and drug makers.\n\nAmong other things, she would put a $250 monthly cap on how much consumers could be required to pay out of pocket for medications. She would allow consumers to buy pharmaceuticals abroad, where they are often substantially cheaper.\n\nClinton also would create a new tax credit that Americans could use to help defray their out-of-pocket medical bills.\n\nInsurers would be required to cover at least three doctor visits annually that aren\u2019tsubject to a deductible.\n\nAnd doctors who are providing care at a hospital that is in-network would be prohibited from charging patients out-of-network prices.\n\nClinton is also pushing broader policies to clamp down on the pharmaceutical and insurance industries, including restrictions on drug advertising and new federal oversight of insurance rate hikes. She would also allow the federal government to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, something that could save billions of dollars but is currently prohibited.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent challenging Clinton for the Democratic nomination, is proposing his own six-point plan for reducing drug prices, including allowing the federal government to negotiate Medicare drug discounts.\n\nNEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>\n\nSome experts have dismissed parts of Clinton\u2019s agenda as unrealistic, especially her proposal to require drug makers to spend more on research.\n\nBut this kind of consumer-focused agenda holds great promise for Democrats who\u2019ve been paralyzed by the GOP\u2019s long campaign against the Affordable Care Act, said Celinda Lake, a veteran party strategist. \u201cThis is a post-Obamacare message \u2026 that has something for the insured, as well as the uninsured,\u201d she said.\n\nIn contrast, none of the leading GOP candidates has a healthcare plan, though Florida Sen. Marco Rubio published a Fox News opinion piece in March calling for broad changes to the healthcare system, including deregulation of insurance markets to lower costs.\n\nThe most detailed healthcare plan in the Republican field was put forward by former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker; he dropped out of the race two weeks ago.\n\nDespite the lack of specifics, the GOP\u2019s simple anti-government, anti-Obamacare message still resonates with large swaths of the electorate, however.\n\nAlthough huge majorities of Americans complain about drug prices, for example, substantially fewer support government intervention.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "How the debate over healthcare is changing - just in time for the 2016 election", "Description": "With the first primaries of the 2016 presidential campaign just months away, the national healthcare debate is poised to enter a new phase, more focused on consumers\u2019 pocketbooks than on re-litigating the 5-year-old Affordable Care Act.
