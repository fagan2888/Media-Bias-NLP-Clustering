LANSING -- John Engler is one of three former Republican governors from across the country arguing in support of the Common Core State Standards in a set of new Web videos.

The videos, released Wednesday by the Collaborative for Student Success, a group supporting the standards and backed by the Gates Foundation, feature Engler along with former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue and former Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas.

"We're not preparing young people well enough in mathematics and their literacy skills, their reading comprehension, they're not where they need to be to be successful in the workforce," Engler says in one video advocating for the more strenuous Common Core guidelines.



Michigan is one of more than 40 states to adopt the standards, although lawmakers explored abandoning the Common Core last summer before ultimately giving the Michigan Department of Education the go-ahead to keep the guidelines in place.

Critics of the standards have drawn comparisons between the Common Core and the Affordable Care Act, calling the guidelines "Obamacore" and alleging they represent a federal takeover of education.

Engler directly addresses the issue of President Barack Obama's involvement in the standards in one of the videos, saying the standards are a state, not federal, effort.

"These were all designed by governors and state and local education officials prior to his being elected," Engler said.

The videos were released Wednesday as a partial response to conservative commentator Glenn Beck, a frequent critic of the Common Core who hosted a live event simulcasted to movie theaters across the country Tuesday evening.

Beck's event, titled "We Will Not Conform," was designed to encourage organized opposition to the standards as well as promote his latest book, which also criticizes the Common Core.
