Five years from today, the Census Bureau estimates that more than one in seven United States residents will have been born abroad. Eight years from today, the share of the population that is foreign-born will rise above any level ever before recorded and keep surging.\n\nIt defies reason to argue that the record admission of new foreign workers has no negative effect on the wages of American workers, including the wages of past immigrants hoping to climb into the middle class. Why would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs?\n\nThe New York Times once plainly acknowledged as much, writing in a 2000 editorial: \u201cBetween about 1980 and 1995, the gap between the wages of high school dropouts and all other workers widened substantially. Prof. George Borjas of Harvard estimates that almost half of this trend can be traced to immigration of unskilled workers.\u201d\n\nSince that sentence was published, another 18 million immigrants have arrived in the United States, while the share of Americans in the work force has declined almost five percentage points.\n\nReuters says Americans, by a nearly 3-to-1 margin, wish to see immigration reduced, not increased. Policy makers and voters should be openly discussing this issue of national interest. Efforts to intimidate Americans into silence will no longer work.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJEFF SESSIONS\n\nChairman, Senate Subcommittee on\n\nImmigration and the National Interest\n\nWashington", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150417204826, "twitter": {"description": "Jeff Sessions, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, takes issue with an editorial.", "title": "Senator Jeff Sessions Argues for a Cut in Immigration", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/18/opinion/senator-jeff-sessions-argues-for-a-cut-in-immigration.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003634508"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/18/opinion/senator-jeff-sessions-argues-for-a-cut-in-immigration.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003634508", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/18/opinion/senator-jeff-sessions-argues-for-a-cut-in-immigration.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "A Senator, on Immigration", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 17, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Immigration and Emigration,United States Politics and Government,Sessions  Jefferson B III,Foreign Workers,Wages and Salaries", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Sessions, Jefferson B III", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Jeff Sessions, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, takes issue with an editorial.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Jeff Sessions, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, takes issue with an editorial.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 17, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-04-22", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Wages and Salaries", "published": "2015-04-17", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "l18immig", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150422163144, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/18/opinion/senator-jeff-sessions-argues-for-a-cut-in-immigration.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Jeff Sessions, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, takes issue with an editorial.", "title": "Senator Jeff Sessions Argues for a Cut in Immigration"}, "pdate": 20150417, "des": "Wages and Salaries", "articleid": 100000003634508, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Senator Jeff Sessions Argues for a Cut in Immigration", "col": "Letter", "PST": "Letter"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb39c\"", "article_summary": "In 1970, fewer than 1 in 21 United States residents were born abroad.\nFive years from today, the Census Bureau estimates that more than one in seven United States residents will have been born abroad.\nTo the Editor:\u201cSenator Sessions, Straight Up\u201d (editorial, April 15), like almost all arguments made in favor of large-scale immigration, provides no numbers.\nWhy would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs?\nEight years from today, the share of the population that is foreign-born will rise above any level ever before recorded and keep surging."}
