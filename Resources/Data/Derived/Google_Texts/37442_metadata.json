The reinsurance fee, however, was meant to raise $25 billion over three years to help pay for ObamaCare, and raise $25 billion it shall \u2014 by making up for that lost revenue elsewhere. Via the Washington Examiner:\n\nThe rules change, first proposed by the White House earlier this month, was announced by the Health and Human Services Department on Monday evening. The change exempts \u201cself-administered, self-insured group health plans\u201d from the law\u2019s reinsurance fee. The shift will raise the cost of the tax for those who do pay to $44 a year. It had previously been $42. In essence, the change is forcing those who don\u2019t get the exception to pay an extra $2 for those who do.\n\nIt isn\u2019t the eligibility for ObamaCare\u2019s subsidies for which unions were really pulling, but it ain\u2019t peanuts, either. The administration could hardly leave Big Labor completely out to dry, especially now that it looks like Democrats are going to need all the 2014 help they can get to ward off criticisms of ObamaCare\u2019s inauspicious debut; but, of course, the administration insists that this really wasn\u2019t specifically about giving unions a break at all, no sir! Via Fox News:\n\nSen. John Thune, R-S.D., who flagged the obscure rule change after it was filed in the Federal Register (see page 70), blasted the exemption as \u201ccrony capitalism at its worst.\u201d \u201cUnions are now experiencing the ugly reality of this law, and they want out,\u201d he said in a statement. \u2026 A Health and Human Services official also disputed the claim that this is directed at unions. \u201cThis definition would exempt any self-insured group health plan that does not use a third party administrator for claims processing or enrollment, not only union plans,\u201d the official told FoxNews.com, adding they are proposing the change to better \u201calign\u201d the definition with the law. \u201cThe phrase \u2018self-insured, self-administered plans\u2019 is not synonymous with multiemployer plans, or Taft-Hartley plans.\u201d\n\nPuh-lease, spare us the rhetorical parsing. It\u2019s not going to mask the fact that this administration is making up rules and changes as they go along, whenever and however they see fit.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cCrony capitalism at its worst.\u201d", "title": "Yep: Unions get their exemption from ObamaCare\u2019s reinsurance fee", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/27/yep-unions-get-their-exemption-from-obamacares-reinsurance-fee/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-27T20:01:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-27T19:20:24+00:00"}, "keywords": "Big Labor, exemptions, insurance, Obama administration, ObamaCare, taxes, unions,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2e9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe phrase \u2018self-insured, self-administered plans\u2019 is not synonymous with multiemployer plans, or Taft-Hartley plans.\u201dPuh-lease, spare us the rhetorical parsing.\nThe change exempts \u201cself-administered, self-insured group health plans\u201d from the law\u2019s reinsurance fee.\nIt isn\u2019t the eligibility for ObamaCare\u2019s subsidies for which unions were really pulling, but it ain\u2019t peanuts, either.\nThe reinsurance fee, however, was meant to raise $25 billion over three years to help pay for ObamaCare, and raise $25 billion it shall \u2014 by making up for that lost revenue elsewhere.\n\u2026 A Health and Human Services official also disputed the claim that this is directed at unions."}
