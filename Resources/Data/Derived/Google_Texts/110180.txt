Some people believe that feminists hate men, but I’m actually pretty sure that Fox News hates men. If you were an alien and tried to learn everything you could about men exclusively by watching Fox News, you would basically think they were the worst pieces of shit ever.

Earlier this week, Fox News hated men by declaring that all of them like to catcall women and that street harassment is basically in their man blood and man bones. In a panel discussion on “Outnumbered,” the female co-hosts debated whether they loved being catcalled or super-loved being catcalled. During the the conversation, the following sacred truths were shared:

“Let men be men.”

“Look, men are going to be that way. What can you do?”

BUT NOT ALL MEN OR SOMETHING?

Search the clip or the words “Let men be men” on Twitter and you won’t find any collective outrage from the people who lose their minds when women talk about sexual assault or sexism in the workplace. And there’s nothing about it on A Voice For Men, either. (Though there is a post raging against the “one good man” who “sees all other men as feckless, immoral, weak, beneath him.” That guy should really stop generalizing about men!)
