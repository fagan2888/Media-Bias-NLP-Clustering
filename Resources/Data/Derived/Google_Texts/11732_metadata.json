Trudeau vowed to kill Ottawa\u2019s longstanding plan to buy 65 fighters for roughly $9 billion and find a cheaper aircraft to replace the country\u2019s CF-18 Hornet fleet, rather than spend anywhere from $16 billion to $49 billion over the F-35 fleet\u2019s projected lifetime.\n\nRelated: How the Liberal\u2019s Win in Canada Could Hurt the F-35\n\nPentagon officials, left wondering about Trudeau\u2019s intentions, received a tentative answer last week: Canada will stand by its pledge to invest $150 million in the F-35 effort\u2019s development but will also hold a new fighter competition to examine alternatives.\n\n\"I think they're going to have another full and open competition. I think the F-35 will be part of that but the requirements from the competition may change. We don't know,\" Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work told reporters traveling with him back the Halifax International Security Forum, according to Reuters.\n\nOn Friday, Canadian Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan told the news service it would be \u201cpremature\" to talk about the F-35 or any aircraft that might supplant the CF-18.\n\nHe said he was \u201cfocused on the requirements that we need.\u201d\n\nRelated: Yet Another Costly F-35 Glitch That Won\u2019t Be Fixed Any Time Soon\n\nThe comments by Sajjan and Work indicate there\u2019s a new understanding of what it could mean if Ottawa backed out of the F-35 program completely.\n\nIn 2002, Canada joined the nine-nation partnership developing the fifth-generation fighter jet. Some development work and parts for the jet are being produced in Canada, worth roughly $600 million, and losing out on those contracts would be a blow to the Canadian economy.\n\nIf Canada or any of the nine partner countries developing the F-35 pulled out of the effort, about $1 million would be added to the price tag for each fighter jet, Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the head of the aircraft\u2019s program office, told Congress last month.\n\nThe U.S. alone wants to purchase 2,440 F-35s over the coming years, meaning billions could be added to the program\u2019s long-term $1 trillion cost and force the Pentagon to cut its total purchase, a decision that could negatively impact relations between the countries and have a ripple effect with the seven other partner nations.\n\nThe Pentagon has spent around $400 billion to develop the F-35, making it the most expensive weapons effort in U.S. history.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why 'President Trump' Might Dump the F-35\n\nFor now, Canada is sticking with its commitment. Ottawa is scheduled to participate in a meeting of the effort\u2019s executive steering board in Italy next month, according to a spokesman for the Pentagon\u2019s F-35 joint program office.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When it comes to the future of its involvement with the multibillion dollar F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, Canada\u2019s new government seems to want it both ways: remaining a partner in the costly effort but not fully committing to ensure its future, either.", "title": "With Billions on the Line, the F-35 May Get Another Chance in Canada", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/23/Billions-Line-F-35-May-Get-Another-Chance-Canada", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Canadian_F-35_Lightning_II_mock-up_04.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/23/Billions-Line-F-35-May-Get-Another-Chance-Canada", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Canadian_F-35_Lightning_II_mock-up_04.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "When it comes to the future of its involvement with the multibillion dollar F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, Canada\u2019s new government seems to want it both ways: remaining a partner in the costly effort but not fully committing to ensure its future, either.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "We don't know,\" Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work told reporters traveling with him back the Halifax International Security Forum, according to Reuters.\nIn 2002, Canada joined the nine-nation partnership developing the fifth-generation fighter jet.\nThe Pentagon has spent around $400 billion to develop the F-35, making it the most expensive weapons effort in U.S. history.\nIn October, Canada overwhelming elected the Liberal Party and its leader, Justin Trudeau, as prime minister.\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why 'President Trump' Might Dump the F-35For now, Canada is sticking with its commitment."}
