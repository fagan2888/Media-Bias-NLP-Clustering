Officials and lawmakers have said they believe the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) members behind assault likely conducted their planning over encrypted communication platforms, shielding them from intelligence agencies.\n\nAlthough no evidence has been presented to back up these claims, the belief has given new momentum to law enforcement agencies' long-standing argument that they should have guaranteed \"backdoor\" access to encrypted data when armed with a warrant.\n\n\u201cThe proliferation of sophisticated encryption technology and other technological barriers have increasingly hindered law enforcement\u2019s ability to lawfully access criminal and terrorist-related communications,\u201d the two organizations said in the release.\n\nSecurity experts and tech companies have fought back, arguing that any such guarantee would be ruinous for digital privacy and expose all secured data to hackers.\n\nThe Information Technology Industry Council, one of the country\u2019s leading tech sector groups, last week rejected calls from those seeking access to secure data.\n\n\u201cWeakening encryption or creating backdoors to encrypted devices and data for use by the good guys would actually create vulnerabilities to be exploited by the bad guys, which would almost certainly cause serious physical and financial harm across our society and our economy,\u201d the council's CEO, Dean Garfield, said in a statement.\n\nBut the chiefs and prosecutors on Tuesday said they would push for legislative action to change the laws that govern access to digital data, including the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.\n\n\u201cIACP and NDAA are committed to finding a solution to this critical issue, which balances the needs of the law enforcement community with protecting the public\u2019s right to privacy,\u201d the groups said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The argument has gained momentum in the wake of the Paris terror attacks.", "description": "The argument has gained momentum in the wake of the Paris terror attacks.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The argument has gained momentum in the wake of the Paris terror attacks.", "title": "Police chiefs, DAs call for backdoor data access", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/261235-police-chiefs-prosecutors-call-for-encrypted-data-access", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/clevelandpolice_052415getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/261235-police-chiefs-prosecutors-call-for-encrypted-data-access", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-24T17:03-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-24T17:03:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/261235-police-chiefs-prosecutors-call-for-encrypted-data-access", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The argument has gained momentum in the wake of the Paris terror attacks.", "card": "summary", "title": "Police chiefs, DAs call for backdoor data access"}, "dcterms.title": "Police chiefs, DAs call for backdoor data access"}, "article_summary": "Police chiefs and prosecutors around the country on Tuesday launched a renewed campaign for legislation that would give investigators access to encrypted communications.\nAlthough no evidence has been presented to back up these claims, the belief has given new momentum to law enforcement agencies' long-standing argument that they should have guaranteed \"backdoor\" access to encrypted data when armed with a warrant.\nThe Information Technology Industry Council, one of the country\u2019s leading tech sector groups, last week rejected calls from those seeking access to secure data.\nBut the chiefs and prosecutors on Tuesday said they would push for legislative action to change the laws that govern access to digital data, including the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.\nSecurity experts and tech companies have fought back, arguing that any such guarantee would be ruinous for digital privacy and expose all secured data to hackers."}
