This is the second year that Oticon has been represented in the event that dares participants to test their mettle with military-style obstacles, rugged terrain, steep inclines and water hazards. Funds raised at this weekend\u2019s event support the Wounded Warrior Project and its mission to assist severely injured veterans. Oticon Hearoes, including a former Marine, hope that their participation also helps to raise awareness of hearing loss as the number-one service-related disability. In addition to a $3,000 donation from Oticon Inc., each Oticon Hearo worked to raise additional funds and awareness through individual sponsorships from friends, family, colleagues, professional partners and others reached through Oticon USA Facebook postings and tweets in the weeks leading up to the challenge.\n\nA test of muscles and determination\n\nThe Oticon team trained to conquer the Tough Mudder\u2019s 11-mile rugged terrain of steep inclines, water hazards and 20 to 30 military-style obstacles throughout the summer. Experienced team members from the 2013 challenge coached newcomers, advising them to build both their stamina and determination to meet the demands of obstacles such as the Funky Monkey, a series of monkey bars across a water pit and Walk The Plank, a climb up a 12-foot wooden platform before jumping into cold water below.\n\n\u201cEvery member of the team was determined to finish the Tough Mudder and finish strong,\u201d said Oticon Regional Marketing Manager Joe Lugara, who served as team manager. \u201cOur larger goal was to use this popular event as a springboard for a broader outreach that would increase awareness of hearing loss as a leading disability among veterans and motivate support for the Wounded Warriors organization.\u201d\n\nBraving the obstacles as a team\n\nTeam members completed the course in just over 5 hours. Muddy and exhausted, they stopped only to celebrate their success before heading home for a well-earned rest.\n\nTeam member Shannell Sorrell, clinical scheduler, sales, participated in memory of her grandfather, a Navy veteran. \u201cMy grandfather was hearing impaired and wore Oticon hearing aids to help him with his hearing loss,\u201d she said. \u201cI know he would have been proud to see me working to raise awareness for something that meant so much to him and to his life.\u201d\n\nIT-Network Specialist Ruben Carpio, an ex-marine and veteran of last year\u2019s Tough Mudder challenge, reported that the event renewed his appreciation of the courage of disabled veterans. \u201cThis was a one day challenge for me,\u201d he explained. \u201cMy inspiration is the many Wounded Warriors who bravely face challenges in their life every day.\u201d\n\nMore support for wounded warriors\n\nOticon Hearoes hope that sharing their story will inspire others to support and contribute to the Wounded Warriors Project.
