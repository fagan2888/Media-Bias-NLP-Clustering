At the same time, the nurse asks the people they\u2019re serving if they have health insurance, so they can get more traditional health care at a clinic or hospital. If they don\u2019t have insurance and they want it, the nurse signs them up, usually for Medicaid, the state-federal health program for low-income people.\n\nThe organization focuses on six neighborhoods with high rates of uninsured people: Uptown, South Shore, Pilsen, Humboldt Park, Wicker Park and Back of the Yards. Each night, it goes to two or three of those neighborhoods.\n\nThey go out at night, so they can find homeless people at places where they are known to sleep or take refuge at night \u2014 whether that be on a street corner, near a park or at an industrial area.\n\n\u201cOur program is really aimed at people who are living on the street and are very vulnerable,\u201d said Erin Ryan, vice president of operations at The Night Ministry. \u201cWe take our facility to them.\u201d\n\nThe Night Ministry is far from new. It was founded in 1976, and has operated mobile buses since 1989.\n\nAnd the mobile bus does a lot more than just provide health care. Volunteers also provide food to the hungry and information on housing for those in need.\n\nWith new options for health coverage through the Affordable Care Act, though, The Night Ministry has put more focus on connecting them to Medicaid enrollment and community health clinics.\n\nOn Wednesday night, around 7:30., about two dozen people showed up at the Health Outreach Bus near 71st and Jeffery in South Shore. Another two dozen gathered around 10 p.m. at Hazel and Wilson in Uptown.\n\nNo one expressed interest in applying for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act that night. Most said they already had insurance, either from their job or through CountyCare \u2014 an early rollout of the Medicaid expansion in Cook County through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThough Linda Tanni, the registered nurse on the bus that night, said, \u201cI register someone pretty much every day.\u201d\n\nThe Night Ministry did not immediately have information on how many people they had signed up for insurance, but they said they did about 1,220 health assessments last year on the bus.\n\nAnd for those who still can\u2019t get health insurance through the law \u2014 usually because they\u2019re undocumented \u2014 The Night Ministry remains a key avenue for them to get their health care needs met.\n\n\u201cThere are still these cracks, and those are the cracks that services like the Night Ministry in our program are filling,\u201d Ryan said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>When most of Chicago is just coming home from work, The Night Ministry is just starting its day, seeking uninsured people to make sure they\u2019re aware of new health insurance options through the Affordable Care Act.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/night-ministry-looking-to-aid-the-uninsured/", "description": "<p>When most of Chicago is just coming home from work, The Night Ministry is just starting its day, seeking uninsured people to make sure they\u2019re aware of new health insurance options through the", "site": "@suntimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Night Ministry looking to aid the uninsured"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282828", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Weather and More", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.suntimes.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/night-ministry-looking-to-aid-the-uninsured/", "type": "article", "site_name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "description": "<p>When most of Chicago is just coming home from work, The Night Ministry is just starting its day, seeking uninsured people to make sure they\u2019re aware of new health insurance options through the Affordable Care Act.</p>", "title": "Night Ministry looking to aid the uninsured"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27e7\"", "article_summary": "Night Ministry looking to aid the uninsuredWhen most of Chicago is just coming home from work, The Night Ministry is just starting its day, seeking uninsured people to make sure they\u2019re aware of new health insurance options through the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cThere are still these cracks, and those are the cracks that services like the Night Ministry in our program are filling,\u201d Ryan said.\n\u201cWe take our facility to them.\u201dThe Night Ministry is far from new.\n\u201cOur program is really aimed at people who are living on the street and are very vulnerable,\u201d said Erin Ryan, vice president of operations at The Night Ministry.\nNo one expressed interest in applying for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act that night."}
