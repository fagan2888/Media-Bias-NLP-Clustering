John Kasich will be playing spoiler on Tuesday when he tries to prevent Sen. Ted Cruz from scooping up all 40 delegates in Utah and narrowing Donald Trump\u2019s lead in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nStill riding high from his solid, favorite-son victory over Trump last Tuesday in the Ohio primary, the moderate conservative Kasich is trying to figure out how best to position himself for a long-shot bid for the GOP nomination in Cleveland this summer.\n\nRelated: Conservative-Backed Third Party Push Will Have to Wait\n\nWith many establishment Republicans including Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina now holding their noses and supporting Cruz as part of a \u201cstop Trump at any cost\u201d movement, Kasich is the fly in the ointment.\n\nCruz has beaten Trump more than a half dozen times so far in the 2016 primaries and caucuses and rightfully portrays himself as the best hope for derailing Trump. Kasich, meanwhile, will be hard pressed to find another state where he could actually carry a majority of votes this spring, as he did in Ohio.\n\nBut the former House Budget Committee chair and one-time investment banker desperately needs to somehow to build on his Ohio victory to make the case that he is electable \u2014 and can raise money \u2014 in a political season almost totally dominated by Trump and his populist, anti-immigration and anti-establishment messages.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a Kasich path that doesn\u2019t involve [a brokered] convention,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, a political analyst with the Rothenberg-Gonzales Political Report.\n\nRelated: How Far Will Republicans Go to Stop Trump?\n\nUnder current GOP party rules, Gonzales notes, candidates must win majorities in at least eight states in order to be considered in the first round of voting for the nomination at the national convention. Short of a change of rules or an absolute miracle, there\u2019s no way Kasich will be able to overcome that hurdle.\n\n\u201cIn order to stay relevant, he needs to stay in the race,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cAnd for those Republicans who are complaining about Kasich\u2019s role in Utah, even Cruz supporters might need Kasich [to slow Trump] in some of the New England and Northeast states to come.\u201d\n\nKasich, 63, a late entrant in the campaign, has held himself out as a common-sense, highly experienced moderate conservative with a proven record of job creation and budget-balancing. While Trump, Cruz and others have engaged in some of the ugliest political theatrics seen in a long time, Kasich, the son of a McKees Rocks, Pa., mailman, stressed his optimism and a proven record for government problem-solving.\n\nRelated: The GOP's Last, Best Hope to Stop Trump?\n\n\"Let me tell you, neither Cruz nor Trump can win the general election,\" Kasich said on NBC\u2019s Today show the morning after his one and only victory. \"They can't come in to Ohio with the philosophy they have and win. You can't win Ohio, you can't be president.\"\n\nKasich said he was determined to ride his campaign all the way to his party\u2019s convention in mid-July because neither he nor the other two contenders is going to have the minimum votes to claim the nomination. Trump insists that he will have enough \u2014 or nearly enough \u2014 delegates, and he warned last week that there would be \u201criots\u201d among his supporters if party leaders attempt to deny him his rightful due.\n\nTrump currently leads the field of three candidates with 678 national delegates, more than halfway to the required 1,237, compared to 413 for Cruz and 143 for Kasich. There are still 1,059 delegates available.\n\nCruz \u2014 arguably the most reviled member of the Senate \u2014 insists that he is now the only one who realistically stands a chance of outright beating Trump. \"A vote for John Kasich is a vote for Donald Trump,\" Cruz said Saturday while campaigning in Utah.\n\nRelated: Trump Moves to Take Control of the Republican Party\n\nBut in order to keep Trump from winning the nomnation, Cruz must gather together the broken shards of the GOP and win over Republicans who have long despised him for his arrogance and self-serving tactics. That\u2019s why he has been engaged in serious fence-mending in recent days and has lined up a series of prominent endorsements to bolster his campaign.\n\nGraham, who fell by the wayside in the presidential contest after losing to Trump in his home state of South Carolina, once said that choosing between Trump and Cruz was like choosing between poisoning or being shot. But on Thursday, Graham pledged his allegiance to Cruz because he found him far preferable to Trump\u2019s menacing rhetoric and polices.\n\nThen on Friday, Romney wrote on Facebook that he would vote for Cruz in Utah\u2019s GOP caucuses Tuesday, while stopping short of giving the Texan a blanket endorsement. \"Today, there is a contest between Trumpism and Republicanism,\u201d wrote Romney. \u201cThrough the calculated statements of its leader, Trumpism has become associated with racism, misogyny, bigotry, xenophobia, vulgarity and, most recently, threats and violence. I am repulsed by each and every one of these.\u201d\n\n\"The only path that remains to nominate a Republican rather than Mr. Trump is to have an open convention,\u201d Romney added. \u201cAt this stage, the only way we can reach an open convention is for Senator Cruz to be successful in as many of the remaining nominating elections as possible \u2014 beginning with the potentially winner take all contest for Utah\u2019s 40 national delegates.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Brutal Economic Truth Behind the Rise of Trump\n\nAs for Kasich, Romney said that while he likes the governor and campaigned with him in Ohio last week, \u201cA vote for Governor Kasich in future contests makes it extremely likely that Trumpism would prevail.\u201d Others, like right-wing broadcaster Glenn Beck, who despises Trump as a pony conservative, had much stronger words for Kasich to get out of Cruz\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cKasich, I mean, excuse my language, but, you son of a bitch, the republic is at stake,\u201d Beck said on his show last Wednesday. \u201cThis is not like a normal race. The republic is at stake.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Virginia political scientist Larry J. Sabato said late last week that \u201cKasich won't be influenced by criticism from Cruz and his allies, but yes, he's probably making it easier for Trump to claim the nomination.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are only three candidates left, and wild scenarios notwithstanding, one of them will be the nominee,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cKasich just has to hang in there and hope the other two self-destruct. Not bloody likely, but it's a wild year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Ohio Gov.", "title": "As Republicans Gear Up to Stop Trump, Kasich Plays Spoiler", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/20/Republicans-Gear-Stop-Trump-Kasich-Plays-Spoiler", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06232015_John_Kasich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/20/Republicans-Gear-Stop-Trump-Kasich-Plays-Spoiler", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06232015_John_Kasich.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Ohio Gov.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37d1\"", "article_summary": "\"A vote for John Kasich is a vote for Donald Trump,\" Cruz said Saturday while campaigning in Utah.\nYou can't win Ohio, you can't be president.\"\n\"Let me tell you, neither Cruz nor Trump can win the general election,\" Kasich said on NBC\u2019s Today show the morning after his one and only victory.\nCruz has beaten Trump more than a half dozen times so far in the 2016 primaries and caucuses and rightfully portrays himself as the best hope for derailing Trump.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a Kasich path that doesn\u2019t involve [a brokered] convention,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, a political analyst with the Rothenberg-Gonzales Political Report."}
