A Panama City man died early Sunday morning when his SUV rear ended a Panama City Police Department patrol vehicle which had stopped at a traffic light at 19th Street and Beck Ave in St. Andrew.

Tyrone Sherman, Jr., then fled the scene going east on 19th street and turned southbound on Chestnut Ave., where he ran off the roadway between 16th and 17th streets and crashed through several bushes, a fence and then a tree.

The Florida Highway Patrol is handling the investigation since it involved another law enforcement agency.

Troopers say Sherman dies a short while after the 2:15 AM crash. Their investigation is continuing
