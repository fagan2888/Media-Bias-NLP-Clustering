Instead, Republicans passed budgets that would give big tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.\n\nThe numbers, as compiled by Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, reveal the truth about the Republican Party.\n\n0: GOP jobs bills passed in the 114th Congress.\n\n5: Additional times the House GOP has voted in the past 135 days to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act (2015 Vote #14, 2015 Vote #45, 2015 Vote #58, 2015 Vote #142, 2015 Vote #183).\n\n58: Times so far House Republicans have voted to repeal or undermine the ACA since 2011.\n\n100: Percent of House Republicans who voted against bringing up the student loan refinancing bill.\n\n2.9 million: Number of jobs that would be destroyed under the House GOP FY 2016 Budget.\n\n$2,000: More in taxes for middle-class American families with children greenlighted by the final FY 2016 Republican Budget.\n\n$200,000: Average tax break for the wealthiest Americans making $1,000,000 or more greenlighted by the final FY 2016 Republican Budget.\n\n99: Percent of House Republicans who voted against allowing a vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act \u2013 a bill to ensure equal pay for equal work.\n\n[[AD2]]\n\nThe only Republican attempt at a \u201cjobs\u201d bill was the Keystone XL legislation, which won\u2019t create more than a handful of permanent jobs, and it isn\u2019t a jobs bill. The Republican-run Congress has lived down to expectations. If you are a corporation in need of some regulatory rollback, or a wealthy person who wants a tax cut, the Republican Congress is your new best friend.\n\nFor working people, women, the poor, the disabled, veterans, and everyone else, Republicans are only interested in cutting what you have to give more to the wealthy.\n\nThe Republican Congress does not represent the majority of the American people. The congressional majority is being controlled by corporations and billionaires. Republicans are more interested in taking away your health care than creating an economic environment where people have good paying jobs.\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t lie. Republicans are working against the interests of the majority in this country, which is why the American people must stand up and take their Congress back.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In their first 138 days in control of Congress, Mitch McConnell and John Boehner have passed zero jobs bill.
