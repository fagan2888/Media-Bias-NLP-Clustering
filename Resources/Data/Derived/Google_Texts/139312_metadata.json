Those who took part in the study were shown a transcript of what they believed to be a conversation between an employee and a human resources professional.\n\nIn the transcripts, some of the listed employees requested to begin the work day early and leave work early three days a week or asked to work remotely from home twice a week.\n\nEmployees who asked for flexibility were from both genders and gave various reasons (such as childcare issues) for requesting the time off.\n\nOnce participants read the transcript, they were asked how likely it was they would approve the request. Participants also evaluated the employees on such factors as dependability, likeability, commitment and dedication.\n\nRevealing a Gender Bias\n\nThe responses offered by participants revealed a significant gender gap in favor of male workers seeking flexible work options. Here is how participants responded to questions on the survey:\n\nGranting flexibility \u2013 69.7% said they would be \u201clikely\u201d or \u201cvery likely\u201d to approve a man\u2019s request to work from home for childcare versus 56.7% for female employees\n\n69.7% said they would be \u201clikely\u201d or \u201cvery likely\u201d to approve a man\u2019s request to work from home for childcare versus 56.7% for female employees Likeability \u2013 24.3% found the man to be \u201cextremely likeable,\u201d as compared to 3% who said the same for the woman\n\n24.3% found the man to be \u201cextremely likeable,\u201d as compared to 3% who said the same for the woman Commitment \u2013 Only 2.7% found the man \u201cnot at all\u201d or \u201cnot very\u201d committed versus 15.5% who said the woman was \u201cnot at all\u201d or \u201cnot very\u201d committed.\n\nExplaining the Differences\n\nMunsch said the disparities may reveal persistence of traditional gender role perceptions in the workplace. Men, for example, are considered the breadwinners. Those who also help out at home may be considered progressive, great guys.\n\nOn the other hand, women are still viewed as the primary caregivers at home, which means employers and colleagues may feel it would be impossible for them to telecommute and remain productive professionally.\n\nMunch said the research shows that companies should proceed with caution when creating flexible work policies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big proponent of flexible work, but this work shows that unless we\u2019re careful about how we implement it, we may just exacerbate inequality,\u201d she was quoted by the Washington Post as saying.\n\nShe suggests devising objective measures for productivity and performance that help overcome unconscious bias.\n\nGet Free Updates!
