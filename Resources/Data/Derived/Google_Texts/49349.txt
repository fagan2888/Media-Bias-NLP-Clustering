A Carabassett Valley couple has created a line of dog and horse vests that keep out ticks, increase visibility during hunting season and protect animals in low light situations.

Bill and Julie Swain of Kingfield, Maine created Dog Not Gone vests, which they say are particularly useful for bushwhacking at this time of year when the ticks are prevalent.

New Hampshire has Lyme ticks which attack and sicken dogs, as well as humans. In late summer, horses can get Eastern equine encephalitis.

The vests not only protect the four-legged friends from such pests, but they are brightly colored and help with visibility, including a line of orange vests that are useful during hunting season.

It was that need for protection that launched the company.

"As the maker and retailer of handmade fleece clothing, I was approached by one of my customers who asked if I could make a hunter-orange vest for her hunting dog so she would be easier to see in the field. Existing products on the market just didn’t hold up or didn’t fit very well," Julie Swain wrote.

That same customer, who is a very active upland game bird hunter and dog trainer, had come up with a pattern that she believed would be the effective, durable, and long wearing but she needed someone to make them," she said.

With a few modifications, the Dog Not Gone safety dog vest was born.

"What sets our products apart is really quite simple – superior design, top quality components, and highly skilled American manufacturing. Dog Not Gone Visibility Products are made with pride in Maine from American-made 10 Mile cloth. Our exclusive double-Velcro closure ensures the vest fits perfectly and won’t come off even in the thickest cover," she said.

The genuine 3M reflective stripe glows brightly to ensure that the dog is seen in low-light situations.
