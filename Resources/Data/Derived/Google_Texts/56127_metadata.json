Republicans won white voters without a college degree by 30 points, 64 percent to 34 percent, according to exit polls, equal to their margin in the wave election of 2010.\u201d In addition, \u201csupport for President Barack Obama among working-class whites has dropped 8 points since 2010.\u201d\n\nPolitical analyst Charlie Cook told the outlet that \u201cDemocrats have chosen to focus on issues that the liberal base of the party really likes, but the working-class person in West Virginia or Arkansas or Louisiana or Alaska doesn\u2019t necessarily identify with.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe challenge that the Democratic Party has in parts of the country appears to be even more formidable than it was two years ago,\u201d he added.\n\nBut Obama is likely to swerve even more to the left after Democrats in red states like Mark Pryor, Kay Hagan, Mark Begich and Mary Landrieu lost their reelection bids in Arkansas, North Carolina, Arkansas, and Louisiana, respectively.\n\nIn his end-of-year press conference, Obama indicated that he was liberated because he no longer had to worry about the reelection prospects of Democrats from conservative states. Obama and Democrats are gambling that minorities who powered Obama into the White House will continue to be galvanized in presidential elections.\n\nIf minorities do not turn out with the same level of enthusiasm when Obama is not at the top of the ticket, though, Republicans have opportunities to win the White House without getting massive increases in the Hispanic vote.\n\nThe New York Times recently noted that Republicans can win the White House without supporting massive amnesty legislation because \u201cimproving among white Northern voters is the core of the G.O.P. route to victory, regardless of whether the party makes gains with Hispanic voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Republicans can\u2019t make gains among white Northerners and hold Mr. Romney\u2019s share of white Southerners, it just won\u2019t really matter whether they receive 25 or 40 percent of the Hispanic vote,\u201d the Times concluded.\n\nA recent Washington Post analysis also determined that \u201cupcoming elections\u2026 won\u2019t put the GOP at much of a disadvantage\u201d even if the party oppose amnesty legislation because there will see larger numbers of older voters.\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News has noted, though,\u201dolder white voters and working-class voters may stay at home if they are opposed to a Republican presidential candidate whose stance on amnesty is no different than Obama\u2019s. In the end, perhaps that is what Obama and Democrats are gambling on occurring.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "2016: Democrats on Thin Ice with White Working-Class Voters", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "2016: Democrats on Thin Ice with White Working-Class Voters", "title": "2016: Democrats on Thin Ice with White Working-Class Voters - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/11/Stop-Illegal-Immigrationpng.png", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/02/2016-democrats-on-thin-ice-with-white-working-class-voters/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "2016: Democrats on Thin Ice with White Working-Class Voters", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/11/Stop-Illegal-Immigrationpng.png", "title": "2016: Democrats on Thin Ice with White Working-Class Voters - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "democrats, illegal immigration, white working class vote,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "white working class vote", "published_time": "2015-01-02T12:51:26-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde6e\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn 2016, especially after President Barack Obama\u2019s executive amnesty, Democrats may be on even thinner ice with white voters, especially white working-class males.\nObama and Democrats are gambling that minorities who powered Obama into the White House will continue to be galvanized in presidential elections.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThough the mainstream media wants to gin up the narrative that Republicans have trouble winning minorities, the 2014 midterm elections again showed, as Politico noted, \u201cthat Democrats have their own significant demographic vulnerability: working-class white voters.\nThe New York Times recently noted that Republicans can win the White House without supporting massive amnesty legislation because \u201cimproving among white Northern voters is the core of the G.O.P.\nIn the end, perhaps that is what Obama and Democrats are gambling on occurring.\u201d"}
