The clinic has also been assisting individuals who have Obamacare but can't afford their deductibles.\n\n\u201cWe're here for the whole community,\u201d said Dickinson.\n\nLocated near Maitland Blvd. at 7900 Forest City Road, the clinic currently offers primary care, pediatrics and dental care for adults and children. The clinic's pharmacy is expected to open in summer.\n\nMental health care and optometry services, which are expected to open in the next two months, didn't exist in Eatonville and Rosemont and were added in response to patient demand.\n\nJeffrey Bowman, vice president and Chief Operating Officer of Community Health Centers, said that the increase in demand is due to a population that's growing and aging.\n\n\u201cThere's also an overall family provider shortage,\u201d said Bowman.\n\nHe said Community Health Center hopes to be the medical home for patients and play a part in reducing ER visits and the rates of readmission to hospitals.\n\nThe center's 12 sites in Orange and Lake counties served more than 60,000 patients last year, 40 percent of whom were uninsured and another 40 percent who had Medicaid. It provided dental services to another 50,000 patients.\n\nThe center is holding an open house on May 14 at 10 a.m. Its Eatonville and Rosemont centers permanently closed last week.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Community Health Centers opens new clinic in Orlando", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "Community Health Centers has opened a 16,000-square-foot facility near Maitland Blvd. to replace its two older and smaller clinics at Eatonville and Rosemont.", "title": "Community Health Centers opens new clinic in Orlando", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/health/vital-signs/os-chc-new-clinic-in-orlando-20160413-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-570ec18f/turbine/os-chc-new-clinic-in-orlando-20160413", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp13.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "health, chc, community, fqhc, business, insurance", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/86542640", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-04-13", "Description": "Community Health Centers has opened a 16,000-square-foot facility near Maitland Blvd. to replace its two older and smaller clinics at Eatonville and Rosemont.", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "health, chc, community, fqhc, business, insurance"}, "article_summary": "CHC Orlando Naseem S.
