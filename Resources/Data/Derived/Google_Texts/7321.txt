An internal memo has surfaced describing commotions aboard domestic U.S. flights that are being described by pilots as “dry runs” for another terrorist attack.

“They’re going to try it again,” Wolf Koch, chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association International’s Aviation Security Committee, told Tampa Bay 10 News. “One hundred percent, no question in my mind. They’re going to try it again.”

The Tampa Bay station obtained a copy of the memo, which said, “There have been several cases recently throughout the industry of what appear to be probes, or dry-runs, to test our procedures and reactions to an inflight threat.”

“If a dry-run is occurring, the attack will shortly follow,” Koch said.

The most recent incident took place on Sept. 2 during a flight from Washington, D.C., to Orlando. According to 10 News:

Crew members say that shortly after takeoff, a group of four “Middle Eastern” men caused a commotion. The witnesses claim one of the men ran from his seat in coach, toward the flight deck door. He made a hard left and entered the forward bathroom “for a considerable length of time.” While he was in there, the other three men proceeded to move about the cabin, changing seats, opening overhead bins, and “generally making a scene.” They appeared to be trying to occupy and distract the flight attendants.

Although the Transportation Safety Administration said it was aware of the incident, it told Tampa Bay 10 News that no additional investigation was required.

A federal air marshal called agency officials “flat-out liars” when told of the response, when interviewed by 10 News.

Twelve years after al-Qaida terrorists killed almost 3,000 Americans when they flew planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Shanksville, Pa., another similar attack may now be on the horizon.
