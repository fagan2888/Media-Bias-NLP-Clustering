Tulsans came out on a sunny November afternoon for the annual Harvest Art Faire at Mrs. DeHaven's Flower Shop. About 25 different local artists exhibited their work. There was also fun and games for kids.

The event benefited the Animal Rescue Foundation (ARF) of Tulsa who brought some animals that are up for adoption. A portion of the proceeds from a promotional coffee mug painted by local artist Christopher Westfall will go to the rescue agency.

Mrs. DeHaven's is located at 15th and Boston in Tulsa.
