Kirk into two people. Picard was Kirk\u2019s rational side, and William Riker was his passionate side. I prefer a complete captain. To be effective, you need both heart and mind.\u201d\n\nPerhaps part of the reason he likes Kirk so much has to do with his assessment that \u201cKirk is quite likely a Republican, and Picard is quite likely a Democrat.\u201d\n\nHowever, Cruz did spot one big difference between himself and Kirk: \u201cI can affirmatively say that I have made out with far fewer space aliens.\u201d\n\nh/t New York Times\n\nLead image via @thebarrytone.", "article_metadata": {"home_name": "Sun-Times National", "description": "Ted Cruz let his inner nerd out during an interview with the New York Times, discussing everything from Spider-Man to his affinity for \"Star Trek.\"", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aggrego.SunTimes.National", "locale": "en_US", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "site": "@News_STN"}, "og": {"site_name": "Sun-Times National", "description": "Ted Cruz let his inner nerd out during an interview with the New York Times, discussing everything from Spider-Man to his affinity for \"Star Trek.\"", "title": "Ted Cruz geeks out about Han Solo, Spider-Man and 'Star Trek'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://bullseye-prod.aggrego.org//wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2015/07/ted-cruz-star-trek.jpg?o=eyJ3aWR0aCI6MCwiaGVpZ2h0IjowLCJ4IjowLjUsInkiOjAuNX0%3D&s=1FnuA9Nz76InsI5nTvwrrpN6U0o%3D", "updated_time": "2015-07-23T10:58:27+00:00", "url": "http://national.suntimes.com/national-world-news/7/72/1516571/ted-cruz-star-trek-spider-man/", "type": "article"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "gmt_offset": "-5", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=930568317", "article": {"section": "National Politics", "tag": "2016 Presidential Election", "published_time": "2015-07-23T08:58:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-23T10:58:27+00:00"}, "home_url": "http://national.suntimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab62\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf you look at \u2018Star Trek: The Next Generation,\u2019 it basically split James T.
