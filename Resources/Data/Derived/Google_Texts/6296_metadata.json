In fact, sales of these products are expected to hit $10.5 billion this year \u2013 a 44 percent jump from 2011, according to the latest estimate.\n\nBut there\u2019s only a very small number of people who, for medical reasons, need to avoid gluten, a protein found in wheat and related grains such as barley and rye. About 1 percent of Americans have celiac disease, which means they can\u2019t digest gluten. So who else is buying all those gluten-free products?\n\nA new report by market research firm Mintel found that it\u2019s primarily people who think avoiding gluten is healthier and could help them slim down. A survey of 2,000 Americans showed that 65 percent who eat gluten-free foods think the foods are healthier, and 27 percent think eating gluten-free can help them shed weight.\n\nSign up for the AARP Health Newsletter\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see that consumers think gluten-free foods are healthier and can help them lose weight, because there\u2019s been no research affirming these beliefs,\u201d Amanda Topper, a food analyst at Mintel, said in a statement.\n\nStill, avoiding bread, baked goods and other products containing wheat has caught on, championed by celebrities, athletes and the best-selling book Wheat Belly, by William Davis, M.D., a cardiologist.\n\nSvelte stars such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Victoria Beckham and Miley Cyrus have touted a gluten-free diet for staying slim, and athletes like Wimbledon champ Novak Djokovic and Super Bowl quarterback Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints have credited their health and success to diets that are gluten-free.\n\nSo can going against the grain, so to speak, really help you shed pounds?\n\nWell, yes, but probably because you\u2019re cutting out \u201ccalorie-dense refined carbohydrates, like pasta, bagels, baked goods and crackers,\u201d says Alissa Rumsey, a registered dietitian at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center.\n\n\u201cHowever, more often than not, going gluten-free may actually cause weight gain,\u201d she adds. \u201cMany of the gluten-free options in the store these days have even more calories than their gluten-containing counterparts.\u201d\n\nGet discounts on health and wellness products and services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nProcessed gluten-free foods tend to be higher in fat, calories and sugar \u2013 to make up for the missing gluten \u2013 and lower in fiber, vitamins and minerals. So if you\u2019re simply trading one type of junk food for a gluten-free version, it really isn\u2019t going to help your waistline.\n\nFor those who truly need to avoid gluten because of an allergy or intolerance, Rumsey recommends replacing the gluten-containing foods with more fruits, vegetables and healthy gluten-free whole grains like quinoa or wild rice.\n\nBottom line: Cleaning up your diet by avoiding too much white flour, sugar and processed snack foods is undoubtedly a good thing for everyone, not just those who want to avoid gluten.\n\nIf, though, you are gluten-sensitive or have a wheat allergy, check out these AARP recipes for gluten-free versions of favorites like banana bread, pizza dough and red velvet cake.\n\nPhoto: Austin Kirk/Flickr\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "The popularity of gluten-free food products has soared in the past few years, with supermarkets carrying everything from gluten-free cake mix and crackers to pasta and pancake mix.
