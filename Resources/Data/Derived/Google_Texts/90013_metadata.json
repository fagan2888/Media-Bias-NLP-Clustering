The study also claims that it is likely for Obama to have won his Presidency owing to the illegal votes of non-citizens.\n\nThanks to Obama's immigration plan, many non-citizens tend to favour Democrats and more than 80% of such voters from the 2008 sample collected by the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, voted likewise.\n\nThe influence of the illegal votes is so much that it even affects the Electoral College votes, and Congressional Elections. The study claims, \"Non-citizen votes likely gave Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress.\"\n\nIf the results of the study are accurate, it means that Obama's presidency is the result of fraud; Obamacare, which is the most significant refurbishing of the US healthcare system since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, was the result of fraud; and the repeal of \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy, was the result of fraud.\n\nWashington Post, in the article \"Could non-citizens decide the November election?\" had revealed that while most \"non-citizens do not register, let alone vote. But enough do that, so their participation can change the outcome of close races.\"\n\nJudicial Watch, the politically conservative, nonpartisan government watchdog, has long maintained that foreign nationals have helped Democrats steal the recent elections and this study confirms the same.", "article_metadata": {"DC.description": "It is likely for Obama to have become the President in 2008 owing to the non-citizen voting.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "english", "Copyright": "2016 IBTimes", "Author": "Mangala Dilip", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times, India Edition", "description": "It is likely for Obama to have become the President in 2008 owing to the non-citizen voting.", "title": "Barack Obama became President With Illegal Votes, Claims Study", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.co.in/barack-obama-became-president-illegal-votes-claims-study-615475", "image": "http://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/544919/history-okay.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.ibtimes.co.in", "description": "It is likely for Obama to have become the President in 2008 owing to the non-citizen voting.", "title": "Barack Obama became President With Illegal Votes, Claims Study", "image": "http://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/544919/history-okay.jpg", "site": "@ibtimes_india", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.ibtimes.co.in/barack-obama-became-president-illegal-votes-claims-study-615475", "robots": "index, follow", "Subject": "Barack Obama became President With Illegal Votes, Claims Study", "fb": {"app_id": 1386147698272496}, "dc.source": "http://www.ibtimes.co.in/", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Barack Obama,non-citizen voting,illegal votes,Judicial Watch,US elections,Democrats,immigrants,Obamacare,don't ask don't tell,presidency,2008 elections,washington post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ibtimes.india", "section": "Politics", "tag": "Washington post", "published_time": "2014-11-28T17:04:32+05:30", "modified_time": "2014-11-28T17:04:32+05:30"}, "news_keywords": "Politics,Barack Obama,Non-citizen voting,Illegal votes,Judicial Watch,US elections,Democrats,Immigrants,Obamacare,Don't ask don't tell,Presidency,2008 elections,Washington post", "DC.subject": "Barack Obama,non-citizen voting,illegal votes,Judicial Watch,US elections,Democrats,immigrants,Obamacare,don't ask don't tell,presidency,2008 elections,washington post", "DC.title": "Barack Obama became President With Illegal Votes, Claims Study", "DC.language": "en", "Description": "It is likely for Obama to have become the President in 2008 owing to the non-citizen voting."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0803\"", "article_summary": "The study also claims that it is likely for Obama to have won his Presidency owing to the illegal votes of non-citizens.\nThe influence of the illegal votes is so much that it even affects the Electoral College votes, and Congressional Elections.\nThe study, \"Do non-citizens vote in U.S.\nAccording to a study published by the Judicial Watch, a large number of votes cast by non-citizens were responsible for US President Barack Obama's victory in the 2008 elections.\nThe study claims, \"Non-citizen votes likely gave Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress.\""}
