I'm just saying in general, what's going on is the marketplace has been wimping out on making health care a product and really managing it and selling it.\"\n\n\n\nBecause so many people lacked health insurance before the introduction of the Affordable Care Act and there was never a true variety of plans, both factors forced President Barack Obama's reforms to become more like a program than a marketplace, Bush said.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Former President George W.
