In an internal memo to staff, Fink said he had been \u201casked to resign,\u201d but didn\u2019t provide further details.\n\nFink oversaw implementation of the troubled Kolea eligibility system that opened in October 2013 to accommodate expanded Medicaid enrollment under Obama\u00adcare.\n\nKolea has come under fire after widespread complaints by community health centers that for more than a year the online system has constantly frozen up, frequently lost applicant information, didn\u2019t update eligibility in a timely manner and couldn\u2019t upload documents required for verification.\n\nLawmakers have criticized Medicaid officials for concealing the problems with the Kolea system and for how much DHS has spent on the faulty technology.\n\nMohr Peterson served as Oregon\u2019s state Medicaid director since September 2009 and has 18 years of experience in public health.\n\n\u201cDr. Peterson\u2019s leadership as Medicaid director in Oregon is ideal for Hawaii as we consider innovations within our own Medicaid programs,\u201d said Gov. David Ige in a press release. \u201cI expect she will work closely with DHS Director Rachael Wong to reshape the culture of government and improve services for our keiki, kupuna and all Hawaii people.\u201d\n\nMohr Peterson began her career with Medicaid in 1997 first managing various sections of the Oregon Medicaid agency and later the Oregon Health Authority. She previously evaluated and reported on children\u2019s mental health in Texas and received her master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in anthropology from the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n\u201cHealth care services work best when they are focused on the people we serve,\u201d Mohr Peterson said in the release. \u201cI look forward to working with Hawaii communities to help bring new innovations for better health, better care and lower costs for everyone.\u201d\n\nHawaii was one of the first states to implement Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. DHS said the net effect was a 10 percent increase (29,836) in enrollment between September 2013 and April 2014. More than 320,400 residents currently receive health care coverage under the more than $2 billion Medicaid program, funded by the federal and state governments.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "description": "Judy Mohr Peterson has been named head of the state Medicaid program amid continuing problems with a new online eligibility system estimated to cost taxpayers as much as $144 million.", "title": "State names new Medicaid director | Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "url": "http://www.staradvertiser.com/business/state-names-new-medicaid-director/", "image": "/wp-content/uploads/site-images/sa-fb-thumb.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/staradvertiser/", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2015-05-11T10:33:24-10:00"}, "fb": {"pages": 112299605447935}, "twitter": {"description": "Judy Mohr Peterson has been named head of the state Medicaid program amid continuing problems with a new online eligibility system estimated to cost taxpayers as much as $144 million.", "creator": "@staradvertiser", "image": "http://staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/site-images/sa-fb-thumb.jpg", "title": "State names new Medicaid director | Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "site": "@staradvertiser", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "State names new Medicaid directorJudy Mohr Peterson has been named head of the state Medicaid program amid continuing problems with a new online eligibility system estimated to cost taxpayers as much as $144 million.\nPeterson\u2019s leadership as Medicaid director in Oregon is ideal for Hawaii as we consider innovations within our own Medicaid programs,\u201d said Gov.\nShe fills a position left vacant since February when DHS ousted former state Medicaid director Kenny Fink, who led program since 2008.\nMohr Peterson served as Oregon\u2019s state Medicaid director since September 2009 and has 18 years of experience in public health.\nMore than 320,400 residents currently receive health care coverage under the more than $2 billion Medicaid program, funded by the federal and state governments."}
