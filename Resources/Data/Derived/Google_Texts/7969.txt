Lifetime is among the most all-over-the-place networks on TV — mixing well-crafted reality like “Project Runway” with junk reality like “True Tori,” and classy Emmy-bait like “The Trip to Bountiful” with actual trash like “The Brittany Murphy Story.” The channel seems less interested in finding a brand identity and more interested in grabbing onto anything with a strong potential fan base and throwing it on the air. It doesn’t make for a very coherent lineup, but maybe a slate of shows that logically lead into one another matters far less than a bunch of attention-grabbing gambits.

And so it is that a western movie produced by Nicholas Sparks, the writer’s TV debut, ended up on Lifetime’s air. Sparks is the novelist whose works (“The Notebook,” “Dear John,” “The Lucky One,” “Safe Haven”) are unusually easy to adapt into films. The Nicholas Sparks movie, at this point a genre all its own, stars inexpensive actors and features a plot that’s heavy on sentiment if a bit light on reason. (“Safe Haven,” his most recent film, revealed at its end that a central character had been a protective ghost the whole time.) Each novel basically feels like a blueprint for an eventual movie. Cutting out the middleman, as Lifetime has done, would seem more efficient — Sparks is the executive producer of “Deliverance Creek,” but it’s not based on any existing material.

This would certainly seem to be Sparks’ B-material, had he written it — it’s airing on TV rather than hitting theaters timed to Valentine’s Day, and the logline is about a widow protecting her family, rather than getting into a torrid affair that heals her broken heart. (The movie is intended as a “backdoor pilot” to test the waters for a potential series.)
