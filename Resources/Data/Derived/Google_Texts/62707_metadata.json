Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin admitted the state can\u2019t afford Green Mountain Care and shelved it.\n\n\u201cI have always made clear that I would ask the state to move forward with public financing only when we are ready and when we can be sure that it will promote prosperity for hard-working Vermonters and businesses, and create job growth,\u201d Shumlin said in a press release Wednesday. \u201cPushing for single-payer health care when the time isn\u2019t right ... could set back for years all of our hard work toward the important goal of universal, publicly financed health care for all.\u201d\n\nLaunching Green Mountain Care, which was likened to Medicare for all, would have required a double-digit percentage payroll tax on businesses and as much as a 9.5 percent assessment on individuals\u2019 incomes to pay the premiums.\n\n\u201cThese are simply not tax rates that I can responsibly support or urge the Legislature to pass,\u201d the governor said. \u201cIn my judgment, the potential economic disruption and risks would be too great to small businesses, working families and the state\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nShumlin had made a single-payer health-care system a cornerstone of his re-election campaign as a way to provide affordable coverage and unburden businesses. He blamed the decision to shelve the program on an inability to contain costs.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nReaction to Shumlin\u2019s decision was swift. Betsy Bishop, head of the Vermont Chamber of Commerce, said her group will go further, pushing to overturn state mandates requiring businesses to buy coverage on the state\u2019s health-insurance exchange, the Vermont Press Bureau reported. She said businesses were relieved by Shumlin\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cOur members were concerned that single-payer could have added significant costs of doing business, forcing them to make negative employment decisions,\u201d she said.\n\nMore than 50 people participated in a Vermont Workers\u2019 Center rally Thursday on the Statehouse steps, burning health-care bills and collection-agency notices, the Vermont Press Bureau said. One of the demonstrators set fire to a sign reading, \u201cNow is not the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cTime and again, I\u2019m forced to choose whether to meet my medical needs or pay other bills,\u201d the Associated Press quoted Randolph resident Stauch Blaise as saying. \u201cJust last week, I had to forgo care for my foot because of my deductible and co-pays. Governor Shumlin has burned all of us by bailing on universal health care, and now it\u2019s time for the Legislature to assume leadership and follow through.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the Healthcare Is a Human Right Campaign demonstrated Shumlin\u2019s career \u201cis toast\u201d by delivering a platter of toast.\n\nDr. Deb Richter told Vermont Public Radio Shumlin\u2019s decision is not the death of of the single-payer movement. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a slower phase-in of this,\u201d Richter said. \u201cAnd I think trying for the whole thing all at once was what made it impossible, or made it more difficult to do.\u201d\n\nShumlin said he and his team didn\u2019t realize earlier that the system was untenable because of overly optimistic revenue assumptions. He said a belief the federal Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, would result in $400 million in annual revenue for the state by 2017 did not appear likely to be reflected by reality. The state also will not get $150 million in Medicaid funds on which it had been counting. Slow recovery from the recession also was a factor.\n\nDarcie Johnston of Vermonters for Health Care Freedom said he was not surprised by Shumlin's decision.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always believed the financing didn\u2019t work. It didn\u2019t take ... millions of dollars to figure that out,\u201d he told Vermont Public Radio. \u201cAnd we\u2019re glad. We think he\u2019s done the right thing. But there\u2019s still more work to do. We still need to make sure that patients have choice and competition.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "single-payer health care system, single-payer plan, vermont shelves single-payer health care plan, verming single-payer health care plan too expensive, green mountain care, vermont gov. peter shumlin gives up on single-payer health care system", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Gov.
