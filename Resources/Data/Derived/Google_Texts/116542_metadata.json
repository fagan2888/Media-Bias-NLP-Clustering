Posed as a nearly cost-free alternative to U.S. boots on the ground, U.S. security assistance spending has ballooned, despite the often dismal outcomes it produces. Now, observers of U.S. foreign policy are finally calling into question the wisdom and efficacy behind this supposed \u201csmall footprint\u201d strategy.\n\nStill the administration and Congress are poised to spend even more on military assistance this year, with zero strings attached. Without more oversight and assessment, the U.S. government is doomed to repeat the widely reported failures of the past.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSince General Lloyd Austin\u2019s admission to Congress in September of the magnitude of the Syrian train and equip program\u2019s failure , criticism of recent security assistance programs has appeared in The Washington Post The Wall Street Journal , and Foreign Policy\n\nOver the past decade, $25 billion was wasted on building up Iraq\u2019s security sector. The corruption and sectarianism of the U.S.-backed Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki consistently undermined whatever progress had been made, leaving Iraq\u2019s defense capabilities a shambles and actually driving the grievances that led to the rise of ISIS.\n\nIn Afghanistan, after $67 billion and more than a decade of training and equipment, the country\u2019s national security forces were left scrambling in the face of the Taliban\u2019s capture of Kunduz. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported that the U.S. military has been partnering with Afghan security officials who have been sexually abusing young boys with impunity.\n\nFar from being cost-free, security assistance \u201crisks further destabilizing already unstable situations and actually countering U.S. interests,\u201d as Phil Carter rightly observed in The Washington Post. Supplying money, equipment, and training cannot make up for the absence of fair and accountable governance.\n\nThis shift in attitude appears to have come too late for this year\u2019s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which not only renews previously established military aid programs but also creates half a dozen new ones. They include providing $100 million more in counterterrorism aid to allied African nations; $300 million in military aid for Ukraine; $50 million to build up the navies of countries on China\u2019s perimeter; and $28 million in weapons aid to Eastern European allies to participate in multilateral trainings with the U.S. armed forces.\n\nCongress has used the massive defense spending bill to create a $10 billion foreign aid program that the Pentagon administers, adding to the nearly $10.5 billion in State Department aid that trains and arms foreign military and police forces.\n\nBut unlike the State Department\u2019s foreign aid budget, the Pentagon is not required to present a coherent picture of the assistance it provides. In fact, for the fullest picture of where the U.S. government is seeking to build a foreign military up to do our bidding, you must consult Security Assistance Monitor, an independent research project. (Full disclosure: the Security Assistance Monitor is a grantee of the Open Society Foundations.)\n\nNor has Congress required regular assessment of the outcomes of this considerable expenditure, leaving the public to guess at what is being done with its money and whether it\u2019s working.\n\nWithout public transparency and evaluation, there are feeble safeguards against the misuse and waste of public funds. Only two laws try to prevent U.S. funds\u2014whether from the State or Defense Department budgets\u2014from directly underwriting malfeasance.\n\nThe \u201cLeahy Law,\u201d named after its Senate sponsor, requires that every security force unit or individual receiving U.S. assistance first be vetted for past gross violations of human rights. There is no waiver to the law as it applies to the State Department-funded aid, which has caused considerable consternation among those who would relegate human rights concerns. But on a shoestring budget of $5 million, the State Department does not have the resources to handle a vetting caseload of more than 150,000 foreign military training events annually and growing.\n\nSigned into law in 2008, the Child Soldiers Prevention Act (CSPA) requires the State Department to identify countries that use child soldiers and impose sanctions on them by cutting off U.S. taxpayer funded military assistance. But the president has the authority to waive the sanctions if he deems it to be in the \u201cnational interest.\u201d President Obama recently exercised this authority for Nigeria, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Sudan.\n\nThese laws are all that check the damage wrought by the U.S. instinct toward military action. And as it stands, the laws are not being adequately enforced. To avoid wasting billions of dollars on ineffective programming, better public oversight of DoD security assistance is needed.\n\nRavinsky is a program assistant at the Open Society Foundations, working on issues relating to Department of Defense spending and security assistance.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Over the past decade, $25 billion was wasted on building up Iraq\u2019s security sector.", "description": "Over the past decade, $25 billion was wasted on building up Iraq\u2019s security sector.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Over the past decade, $25 billion was wasted on building up Iraq\u2019s security sector.", "title": "The NDAA\u2019s bottomless security assistance pit", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/256937-the-ndaas-bottomless-security-assistance-pit", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/256937-the-ndaas-bottomless-security-assistance-pit", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-15T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Jeremy Ravinsky", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-15T10:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/256937-the-ndaas-bottomless-security-assistance-pit", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Over the past decade, $25 billion was wasted on building up Iraq\u2019s security sector.", "card": "summary", "title": "The NDAA\u2019s bottomless security assistance pit"}, "dcterms.title": "The NDAA\u2019s bottomless security assistance pit"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34a4\"", "article_summary": "Still the administration and Congress are poised to spend even more on military assistance this year, with zero strings attached.\nPosed as a nearly cost-free alternative to U.S. boots on the ground, U.S. security assistance spending has ballooned, despite the often dismal outcomes it produces.\nTo avoid wasting billions of dollars on ineffective programming, better public oversight of DoD security assistance is needed.\n(Full disclosure: the Security Assistance Monitor is a grantee of the Open Society Foundations.)\nFar from being cost-free, security assistance \u201crisks further destabilizing already unstable situations and actually countering U.S. interests,\u201d as Phil Carter rightly observed in The Washington Post."}
