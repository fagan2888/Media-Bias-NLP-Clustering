Read more here www.aarp.org/magazine/\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, DC\u2014 Before the unexpected death of her mother last September, Melissa and Joan Rivers were Hollywood\u2019s most well-known mother-daughter tag team. In a revealing, intimate interview with AARP The Magazine, Rivers reminisces about the cherished memories she and her mother created and provides insight on what her life looks like now without her best friend and creative confidante. In discussing what she misses most about her mother as well as the many friends who have helped her cope, Melissa shares her story of the lessons learned and growth that have come with having now lost both parents.\n\nThe following are excerpts from the June/July issue of the AARP The Magazine cover story featuring Melissa Rivers, available in homes today and online now at www.aarp.org/magazine.\n\nOn her response to whether she thinks her mother is looking out for her from another parallel:\n\n\u201cIf she is, she can keep a little of this f\u2014king chaos at bay! Seriously, if you\u2019re supposed to be sitting on my shoulder and making sure everything\u2019s OK \u2013chop-chop, get on it! Things are crazy around here!\u201d\n\nOn her reaction to Joan Rivers\u2019 exclusion from the In Memoriam segment of the Oscar awards:\n\n\u201cShe was one of the first women directors ever, with Rabbit Test [the 1978 feature comedy debut of Billy Crystal], and she had acting credits. We changed the awards-show business. Throw her picture up on the screen for 15 seconds!\u201d\n\nOn the working relationship she had with her mother:\n\n\u201cMy mother and I each had our own lanes. She\u2019d work on one thing, I\u2019d work on another, and then we\u2019d come up with the game plan. Suddenly it feels like the work hasn\u2019t doubled; it\u2019s tripled. There\u2019s a new entity: the estate and the legacy. And there\u2019s no map. I don\u2019t want to blow it, so there\u2019s a lot of pressure.\u201d\n\nOn dealing with the loss of both her mother and creative partner:\n\n\u201cI was part of a comedy team. I was the straight man. And now I\u2019m a solo act. That\u2019s the hard part. I\u2019m trying to find my voice.\u201d\n\nOn where she is in the grieving process:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still in that deification phase. You miss even the sh-ttiest things: I miss when she\u2019d come in and rearrange my furniture and tell me how I ran my house wrong and criticize everything. I miss the criticism! I\u2019m still in that phase.\u201d\n\nOn making the decision to let Joan Rivers go:\n\n\u201cShe had a living will and an advance directive that was very specific. My mother\u2019s definition of quality of life was having all her faculties and being able to go on stage for one hour and, here was the kicker, be funny. As hard as it was, I knew the right decision.\u201d\n\nOn remembering her father, Edgar Rosenberg, and his last words on a tape recording he left for her after taking his life:\n\n\u201cHe said goodbye and told me it was my job to take care of Mommy. At the very end, his primary concern was my mother, he cared for her that much. But who was supposed to take care of me? Suicide is complicated.\u201d\n\nOn her thoughts on moving forward in life without her parents:\n\n\u201cWhen one parent dies, it\u2019s a comma. When the second parent dies, it\u2019s a period.\u201d\n\nOn how writing her new book, The Book of Joan: Tales of Mirth, Mischief and Manipulation, helped her heal:\n\n\u201cThose blocks of writing saved me, because Larry [Amoros] and I would laugh and laugh. I wanted to call the book Cheaper Than Therapy.\u201d\n\nOn how her relationship with her boyfriend developed after her mother\u2019s death:\n\n\u201cA number of people really surprised me. My boyfriend is one. I\u2019d never seen him as someone dependable and strong and who gave a crap. He said he\u2019d never seen me defenseless and didn\u2019t want to see me that way again. As any therapist will tell you, probably not the best time to get into a relationship! But we figure it can\u2019t get any worse.\u201d\n\nOn the changes that are taking place with Fashion Police:\n\n\u201cWe came back too fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were a family and when the head of a family passes, it throws everyone into emotional turmoil.\u201d\n\nOn Joan Rivers\u2019 humorous generosity:\n\n\u201cShe was so kind and generous to the point you wanted to smack her. She\u2019d be in my house and someone would say, \u2018Oh, I like those candlesticks.\u2019 And she\u2019d say, \u2018Take them!\u2019 They were mine! She\u2019d say, \u2018You can get more.\u2019\u201d\n\nFormer Fashion Police co-star Kelly Osbourne on her friendly encounter with Joan Rivers while they were unknowingly on the same flight:\n\n\u201cI went right to sleep. When I woke up, I thought I had gone blind because Joan had duct-taped a note to my head. I keep it on my desk. It says, \u2018Kel!! You must stop stalking me. XoXo. Look at seat 3H, you have a friend. PS. Can you give me a lift? PPS. You don\u2019t snore.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the complete interview, along with behind the scenes video and images, check out http://www.aarp.org/magazine/.\n\n# # #\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout AARP The Magazine\n\nWith more than 35.2 million readers, AARP The Magazine is the world's largest circulation magazine and the definitive lifestyle publication for Americans 50+.
