If they choose a provider that exceeds the price, they must pay the difference.\n\nWhen done right, reference pricing can reap savings for both consumers and insurers. For example, Cigna controlled costs by persuading members to choose less expensive labs.\n\nHowever, reference pricing may not yet be ready to shine. The practice raises questions about care quality and access, administrative costs and communicating the plans to members. These kinds of loose ends need to be tied up before reference pricing can succeed\n\nThis FierceHealthPayer special report examines the benefits and limitations of reference-based pricing and takes a look at how these initiatives could evolve to gain more widespread adoption.\n\nSign up for FierceHealthPayer's free email newsletter to read exclusive interviews, examples of successful programs and get a glimpse into what the future holds for reference pricing.\n\nEmail: * Job Level: * Chairman/CEO Owner/Principal Other C-Level President VP/SVP/EVP Director Manager Supervisor Staff Student Job Function: * Accounting/Finance Billing/Accounts Receivable Cardiology Clinical Operations Collections/Coding and Reimbursement Compliance/Risk/Regulatory Data Management Engineering/Facilities/Materials Executive Management Information Systems/Services IT IT Security Lab/Pathology Managed Care Materials Management Medical Informatics/Clinical Informatics Medical Records Medical/Nursing Molecular Imaging Network/Intranet Nuclear Medicine Nurse Nursing Informatics Oncology Operations PACS Patient Accounts/Admissions Pharmacy/Formulary Physician Purchasing/Procurement/Acquisitions Quality/Patient Safety Radiology Revenue Cycle Supply Chain Surgery/ICU/CCU Other General Job Function: Accounting/Finance Business Development Compliance Consultant Customer Service Editor/Writer Educator Engineering Executive Management Graphic Design HR IT Legal Marketing/PR Medical Operations Physician Research & Development Sales Staff Student N/A Organization Type: * Healthcare Organization/Provider Healthcare Services/Supplier Home care Hospital/Health System Imaging Center Integrated Delivery System/IDN Accountable Care Organization Lab Long Term Care/SNF/Rehab Pharmacy Physician Practice/Medical Clinic/Ambulatory Care Center Physician Organization (IPA, PHO, etc.) Health Payer Disease Management HMO Medicare/Medicaid Pharmacy Benefits Manager POS PPO Third Party Administrator Utilization Review Organization Insurance Healthcare Vendor Medical Equipment Medical Device Mfr.
