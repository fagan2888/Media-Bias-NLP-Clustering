ABS \"is also speaking to investors about a variety of possible investment opportunities.\"\n\n- No New York bailout -\n\nIn New York, unlike most cities, the network was set up on the grounds that it would cost the taxpayer nothing.\n\nThe first sponsor, Citigroup, paid $41 million over five years to have its logo on 6,000 bikes and 332 stations in southern Manhattan and various parts of Brooklyn.\n\nThat was supposed to be a first step before the scheme was widened to 10,000 bikes and nearly 600 stations in a larger area.\n\nBut maintenance turned out to be more expensive than anticipated.\n\nTechnological problems sometimes shut down bike stations or prevented riders from paying by bank card.\n\nWhat's more, the director general of Citi Bike, Justin Ginsburgh, resigned recently. And in January, the Canadian company Bixi, which makes the equipment and technology, went bankrupt.\n\nIf annual membership, at $95, exceeded expectations, then the rates of $35 a week and $9.95 a day, mainly targeting tourists, have been disappointing.\n\n\"It was our first year, we didn't have a lot of time to deal with marketing,\" said Simons. \"We'll be doing more this year.\"\n\nWhile waiting for more funding, expansion projects risk remaining on ice. No date for any such plans has been set, she acknowledged.\n\nCiti Bike has discussed raising rates but so far no decision has been made.\n\nOfficials confirm they have not asked New York for money.\n\n\"At this point, city budget money is not on the table,\" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said. \"We will collaborate with them to help them find ways to be more efficient and more effective.\"\n\nTransport Commissioner Polly Trottenberg has been frank.\n\n\"We all know Citi Bike has been tremendously popular with New Yorkers. But there have been significant financial and operational issues,\" she said in a statement.\n\nShe listed those issues as a need for more effective redistribution of bikes and technology problems resulting in malfunctioning stations and failed credit card transactions.\n\n\"We expect the system's operator, NYC Bike Share, to resolve these issues so the system can perform effectively and ultimately expand,\" she said.\n\n\"Everything is on the table for Citi Bike, from improving operations to new sponsorships, to additional financing.\"\n\nRead the original article on Agence France Presse.
