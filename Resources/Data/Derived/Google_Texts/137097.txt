On Thursday’s “Kelly File,” fill-in host Shannon Bream went over some of the new Obamacare taxes and fees expected to hit Americans in 2014.

Citing analysis by USA Today, Bream noted that some counties lack even “bronze” plans for 40-year-old couples making a little too much to qualify for financial assistance. Further, for 50-year-olds who don’t qualify for any subsidies, “more than a third of the counties don’t offer an affordable individual plan in any of the four tiers of plans — bronze, silver, gold, and certainly not platinum,” she said.

As of Dec. 26, more than six million Americans had reportedly lost their insurance plans, which critics argue is due to Obamacare.

Using an example from Alabama, the hosts said new Obamacare fees can add $23 a month to an individual’s monthly premium, or about $278 a year.

FoxNews.com’s Chris Stirewalt argued the Obama administration regularly refers to such increases as “fees” instead of “taxes” because it is better for them politically.
