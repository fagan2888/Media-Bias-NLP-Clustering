People at the Pier Park Beach Ball Drop rang in the New Year with a bang. Despite the rainy weather, energy from the crowd was high.

"The weather sort of dampered our crowd," said Panama City Beach Police Chief Drew Whitman. "Then the rain stopped, the adults are coming out they're enjoying the band playing."

Once the rain died down, the crowd came back to life.

"We just moved here from Birmingham, Alabama, and we just moved here from Panama City and this is my first beach ball drop and I'm so excited I've been trying to get here for three years," said Cherie Sims.

The evening kicked off with the kids beach ball drop at 8, where 10,000 beach balls descended on an excited crowd.

"It was pretty thrilling, it was like all of them came out at once," said Regan Fields. "It was like we gotta get it but I think the easiest part was picking them up off the ground."

The Celebrity Allstars kept everyone rocking all night long. Executive Director of the TDC Dan Rowe said after eight years the Pier Park beach ball drop has become a tradition here in Bay County. One that attracts people from across the country.

"When we were giving out the hats you're wearing we were asking people where they're from and they said Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Michigan," said Rowe. "We're getting folks from all over coming down to hangout with us which is great."

The highlight of the night was when Paris and Kelly had a man propose to his girlfriend live on our show.

That was followed by the most anticipated event, the 800 pound beach ball drop and then a round of fire works.

No word yet on exactly how many people turned out last night, but staff with Pier Park told us they were expecting less people than the 40,000 we saw last year because of the rain.
