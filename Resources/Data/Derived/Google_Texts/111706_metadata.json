But a new ticketing study shows that the resale market might often benefit those primary ticket sellers.\n\nIn research recently published in Strategic Management Journal, a trio of business-school professors from New York University, Harvard University and the University of Southern California examined the effect that Craigslist had each time it launched in a different local market, from 2003 to 2008. The online-classifieds company is a popular online marketplace for fans looking to buy and resell tickets.\n\nThey found that after Craigslist launched in a given vicinity, regardless of the market size or geographical location, promoters generally reacted by raising prices along with booking smaller venues or taking other measures to get shows closer to selling out. It is generally more profitable to sell out a venue with fewer seats at higher prices than to sell only a portion of the available tickets at a bigger venue.\n\nUSC business school professor Victor Bennett, who interviewed promoters around the country, said they did so to take advantage of a phenomenon: when the secondary market \u201cthickens,\u201d primary ticket issuers benefit\u2014but only if demand for a particular show exceeds supply. That\u2019s because average fans are more likely to buy face-value tickets from the primary ticket issuer, such as Live Nation Entertainment\u2019s Ticketmaster, if they trust they will easily be able to resell the tickets for a profit at the last minute, should their plans change.\n\nPromoters generally started booking smaller venues to ensure this outcome, Mr. Bennett said, which, in turn, allowed them to price the primary tickets higher. The researchers also observed a similar effect each time eBay Inc.\u2019s StubHub entered a local market, though the study isn\u2019t based on the StubHub data.\n\n\u201cDemonizing or lionizing the secondary market is just too simple \u2013 it can be really, really good for artists, fans and promoters,\u201d said Mr. Bennett. \u201cIf you are buying a ticket three months in advance, the ability to resell makes you more likely to jump on that rather than waiting.\u201d\n\nNew resale sites, such as Live Nation Entertainment Inc.\u2019s TM+, could accelerate the trend.\n\nTo be sure, resellers can hurt primary sellers in cases where an act doesn\u2019t sell as many tickets as expected. Scalpers who can\u2019t resell their tickets slash prices, potentially forcing the primary seller into a price war.\n\nBut that is becoming less common as the ticketing industry becomes more sophisticated.\n\n\u201cNot everyone has to promote Lady Gaga \u2013 you just have to be good at predicting how well (an act) will do,\u201d Mr. Bennett said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A study by a trio of business-school professors suggests ticket scalpers might not be the bane of the concert industry that many promoters and musicians consider them to be.", "title": "Musicians and Promoters: Scalpers May Not Be the Enemy After All", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/25/musicians-and-promoters-scalpers-may-not-be-the-enemy-after-all/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/RV-AC969_TICKET_G_20110527012631.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Musicians and Promoters: Scalpers May Not Be the Enemy After All", "description": "A study by a trio of business-school professors suggests ticket scalpers might not be the bane of the concert industry that many promoters and musicians consider them to be.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Hannah Karp", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "A study by a trio of business-school professors suggests ticket scalpers might not be the bane of the concert industry that many promoters and musicians consider them to be.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-25T15:18:00-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/25/musicians-and-promoters-scalpers-may-not-be-the-enemy-after-all/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-5212", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A study by a trio of business-school professors suggests ticket scalpers might not be the bane of the concert industry that many promoters and musicians consider them to be.", "title": "Musicians and Promoters: Scalpers May Not Be the Enemy After All", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/25/musicians-and-promoters-scalpers-may-not-be-the-enemy-after-all/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/RV-AC969_TICKET_G_20110527012631.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-5212", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-25T15:18:36-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe14f4\"", "article_summary": "The online-classifieds company is a popular online marketplace for fans looking to buy and resell tickets.\nSteven Rojas/GrandLife HotelsMusicians and concert promoters often gripe that ticket scalpers are cannibalizing their business.\nBut a new ticketing study shows that the resale market might often benefit those primary ticket sellers.\nPromoters generally started booking smaller venues to ensure this outcome, Mr. Bennett said, which, in turn, allowed them to price the primary tickets higher.\nScalpers who can\u2019t resell their tickets slash prices, potentially forcing the primary seller into a price war."}
