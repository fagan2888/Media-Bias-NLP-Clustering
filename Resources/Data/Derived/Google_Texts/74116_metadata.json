Facing a critical shortage of psychiatric beds, and new financial pressures to reduce costly readmissions, hospitals are increasingly turning to outside social workers for help \u2014 even deploying them inside hospitals, settings once considered off-limits to nonmedical professionals.\n\nThe goal is to arrange basic social services for psychiatric patients \u2014 including housing, transportation and job training \u2014 before they ever walk out of the hospital door. These efforts, known in social-service parlance as \u201cin-reach,\u201d also build trust between case workers and patients who may be too stubborn to seek help and too depressed to show up for doctors\u2019 appointments and take their medications.\n\n\u201cThis is a sea change,\u201d said Dr. Michael Trangle, associate medical director for behavioral health at HealthPartners, which owns Regions Hospital in St. Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the stirrings of [hospital] systems finally saying, \u2018We have to start changing our approach to help manage this population.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAt Allina Health, which owns Abbott Northwestern and 11 other hospitals statewide, about 40 percent of patients discharged from psychiatric units never make their first doctor\u2019s appointment. Many disappear into homelessness or isolation, and cycle in and out of hospital emergency rooms.\n\nKendall Coleman, left, works with his case manager, social worker Jolene Peterson.\n\nTo slow this revolving door, Allina recently began bringing in teams of outside experts \u2014 including county social workers, therapists and psychologists \u2014 to develop long-term treatment plans with patients who have a history of repeat hospital admissions.\n\nSimilarly, North Memorial Health Care has teamed up with Vail Place, a nonprofit mental health services provider in the Twin Cities, to create a care center across the street from its hospital in Robbinsdale. The center, to open in July, will employ health professionals from North Memorial as well as case managers from Vail Place who will help mental health patients find housing, vocational training and transportation to medical appointments, among other services.\n\nAnd at Hennepin County Medical Center\u2019s psychiatric emergency room in downtown Minneapolis, visitors who request housing or other community services can meet with a social worker within 30 minutes after arrival, under a new \u201cin-reach\u201d effort launched last spring. HCMC\u2019s psychiatric emergency room sees 800 to 1,000 visits a month from mental health patients.\n\nRevolving door\n\nThe driving force behind these initiatives is the idea that people with serious and persistent mental illnesses are less likely to rotate in and out of emergency rooms and acute care hospitals if they have stable housing, a source of income, counseling and other services that can remove the underlying sources of their anxiety.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t have the money to pay for a prescription or don\u2019t have a place to live or don\u2019t have a job, then these patients will fall through the gaps and end up being re\u00adadmitted,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Sawyer, medical director of psychiatry and integrative care at North Memorial. \u201cThere has to be more of a bridge to community services.\u201d\n\nIn Minnesota, the effort took on urgency in late 2013, with a new state law that put additional pressure on already-stretched psychiatric wards across the state. The law, known as the \u201c48-hour rule,\u201d requires inmates in county jails to be transferred to state psychiatric facilities within 48 hours after being committed by a state judge. While the law has accelerated placement of mentally ill inmates at state hospitals, it has also created a growing backlog of other patients awaiting treatment.\n\nThe push to reduce hospitalizations has also been motivated by the Affordable Care Act of 2010, President Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nUnder the law, hospitals that readmit \u201cexcessive\u201d numbers of Medicare patients within 30 days of discharge now face significant financial penalties. In October, the federal government fined a record number of hospitals \u2014 2,610 nationwide, including 36 in Minnesota \u2014 for having too many patients return within a month after being discharged.\n\nFeeling safer\n\nAmber Dahlman, 31, who suffers from bipolar disorder, began seeing a social worker about a year ago, after she was hospitalized with a near-fatal drug overdose. She now has weekly meetings with a case manager at Vail Place who helps her manage her medications and get social services.\n\nThe care has emboldened Dahlman to pursue one of her principal passions: art.\n\nOn a recent visit, Dahlman proudly displayed one of her paintings, \u201cMixed State,\u201d depicting the conflicting emotions of a person suffering a manic episode of bipolar disorder. \u201cA year ago, I felt like I didn\u2019t want to be here,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I feel safe to share more of myself.\u201d\n\nColeman has a similar story.\n\nFor years, he suffered from bouts of manic depression, sometimes going days without sleep. Coleman said his untreated schizophrenia reached a crisis five years ago, when police took him away after he tore up his apartment in a violent rage. \u201cI felt like the entire world was out to get me,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cBut I was always taught to keep my problems to myself.\u201d\n\nThat changed when Peterson, clinical services manager at Vail Place, met him at North Memorial. Over a series of meetings, Coleman described the voices in his head and the traumatic experiences of his childhood. Peterson became a relentless advocate for Coleman, lining him up with stable housing, employment, and twice-monthly appointments with a therapist and psychiatrist.\n\nOn a recent weekday, Coleman cracked jokes as Peterson helped him through the process of re-enrolling for Medical Assistance. He still has difficult days when the voices return. But he says they are \u201cmore like whispers\u201d and not the \u201cloud yelling\u201d of years past. Now, with a stable job as a janitor, Coleman plans to save enough money to attend the college graduations of his two sons in May.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling to know that, no matter what, I\u2019ve got someone fighting in my corner,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one should have to face a mental illness alone.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @chrisserres", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Facing a shortage of beds and cost pressures, hospitals use outside social workers for help.", "title": "Strategies shift for treating mental illnesses", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/strategies-shift-for-treating-mental-illnesses/289098571/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142172313681988.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142172313681988.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Facing a shortage of beds and cost pressures, hospitals use outside social workers for help.", "title": "Strategies shift for treating mental illnesses", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/strategies-shift-for-treating-mental-illnesses/289098571/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142172313681988.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142172313681988.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Facing a shortage of beds and cost pressures, hospitals use outside social workers for help."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd614\"", "article_summary": "HCMC\u2019s psychiatric emergency room sees 800 to 1,000 visits a month from mental health patients.\nColeman is among hundreds of patients across Minnesota benefiting from a fundamental shift in the way hospitals and health plans treat people with serious mental illnesses.\nThe push to reduce hospitalizations has also been motivated by the Affordable Care Act of 2010, President Obama\u2019s health care law.\nSimilarly, North Memorial Health Care has teamed up with Vail Place, a nonprofit mental health services provider in the Twin Cities, to create a care center across the street from its hospital in Robbinsdale.\nThe law, known as the \u201c48-hour rule,\u201d requires inmates in county jails to be transferred to state psychiatric facilities within 48 hours after being committed by a state judge."}
