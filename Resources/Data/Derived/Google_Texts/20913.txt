North Korea reportedly fired several short-range missiles or pieces of artillery into the Sea of Japan, just hours after the UN Security Council unanimously approved a new round of sanctions against the country for its nuclear and missile tests. South Korea’s defense ministry said Thursday it was trying to determine if the projectiles were missiles, artillery, or rockets. The UN resolution, considered the toughest sanctions on the regime in more than two decades, prohibits the export of coal, iron, and iron ore being used to fund North Korea’s nuclear program and bans exports of gold, titanium ore, vanadium ore, and rare earth minerals. The sanctions also require inspections of cargo leaving and entering North Korea by land, sea, or air.
