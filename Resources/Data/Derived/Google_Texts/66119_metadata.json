Dems complain OFA is MIA\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s campaign spun off into its own mega-grassroots political group last year, striking fear into the hearts of conservative groups with promises to sell the president\u2019s agenda across the country.\n\nBut now, heading into midterm election season, Democrats are asking: Where\u2019s the juice?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOrganizing for Action raised $26 million last year, but officials say they aren\u2019t planning to unleash any of that cash to help Democratic candidates buy TV ads. Instead, they\u2019re planning to pressure Congress to pass liberal bills, staying out of electoral politics altogether.\n\nSome strategists and state party operatives are frustrated that even at a time when vulnerable Democrats are fighting to hang onto the Senate and incumbents are being bombarded with negative ads from conservative groups backed by brothers Charles and David Koch, OFA is not stepping up the air cover.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Democrats' would-be Karl Rove)\n\nDemocratic governors also complained about Obamacare when they were in town over the weekend, telling President Obama that they need help as the battle over Obamacare has moved from Washington to the states.\n\nObama spoke to the group on Tuesday night and touted volunteer efforts to sign up 4 million Americans under the health care law.\n\nDemocrats point to key battleground states like North Carolina, Arkansas and Louisiana as places where OFA\u2019s resources are needed to combat mega-spending by conservative groups like Americans for Prosperity. OFA is organized under the tax code in the same way as the Koch brothers-backed group.\n\n\u201cI think in states like North Carolina you kind of have to have all hands on deck to help someone like [Sen. Kay Hagan],\u201d said Thomas Mills, a North Carolina-based Democratic consultant. \u201cHagan could certainly use some help. She\u2019s a first-term senator. She\u2019s not well-defined. She needs help in defining herself before AFP does that for her.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: Senators up for election in 2014)\n\nArkansas Democratic Sen. Tom Pryor could also use air cover as he tries to fend off Rep. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). Cotton has gotten high-profile support by several conservative groups that have run ads in the state.\n\nVeteran Arkansas Democratic consultant Robert McLarty said the pro-Cotton ads have significantly outweighed the Pryor ads in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cThey definitely have beefed up a lot more,\u201d said McLarty of the number of ads attacking Pryor. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty significant in ads favoring [Cotton] or against Pryor.\u201d\n\nSome Democratic strategists point to that as the exact reason why OFA is needed. They are concerned that OFA is hurting the party\u2019s chances of holding the Senate by taking money away from other outside groups, while having little impact. If the Democrats lose their majority in the Senate, OFA\u2019s work in pushing for Obama\u2019s agenda will be pointless anyway.\n\n\u201cThey are certainly attracting a lot of big donors. But if I were one those donors, I would be asking what they\u2019ve done with my money,\u201d said one strategist.\n\n( PHOTOS: 10 must-watch House races in 2014)\n\nAnother Democratic operative said that the downside is, \u201cDemocrats are getting outspent as heavily as they are in the Senate with Americans for Prosperity and they could be pushing back.\u201d\n\nIn stark contrast, Priorities USA, the pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC, sent a missive to donors asking them to contribute to efforts to keep the Senate and take back the House.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Heading into midterm election season, Democrats are asking: Where\u2019s the juice?", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Heading into midterm election season, Democrats are asking: Where\u2019s the juice?", "title": "Dems complain OFA is MIA", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/organizing-for-action-mia-103922.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/02/24/barack-obama-governors-speech-ap-328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Grass Roots,Democrats,OFA,Organizing For Action", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Annapalmerpolitico/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec4f\"", "article_summary": "Dems complain OFA is MIABarack Obama\u2019s campaign spun off into its own mega-grassroots political group last year, striking fear into the hearts of conservative groups with promises to sell the president\u2019s agenda across the country.\nVeteran Arkansas Democratic consultant Robert McLarty said the pro-Cotton ads have significantly outweighed the Pryor ads in recent weeks.\nCotton has gotten high-profile support by several conservative groups that have run ads in the state.\nStory Continued BelowOrganizing for Action raised $26 million last year, but officials say they aren\u2019t planning to unleash any of that cash to help Democratic candidates buy TV ads.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty significant in ads favoring [Cotton] or against Pryor.\u201dSome Democratic strategists point to that as the exact reason why OFA is needed."}
