Miami — There were smiles all around the batting cage Saturday afternoon at Marlins Park.

It couldn’t be helped, not with Andres “The Big Cat” Galarraga on hand.

“One of the great smiles of all time, and he wore it 24-7,” said Rockies manager Walt Weiss, who played with Galarraga for four years in Colorado (1994-97) and three in Atlanta (1998-2000).

Galarraga, who lives about an hour north of Miami in West Palm Beach, was celebrating “Venezuela Day” at Marlins Park by throwing out the first pitch. Galarraga, 53, was born in Caracas, Venezuela, on June 18, 1961.

“This is special, against the Rockies, and in Miami,” said Galarraga, who wore a purple-striped shirt for the occasion.

The Big Cat, of course, was the Rockies’ first big star. Under the tutelage of manager Don Baylor, he resurrected his career in 1993, hitting .370 to win the National League batting title in the Rockies’ first year of existence. The nimble first baseman was a three-time all-star with the Rockies.

Galarraga hit 399 career homers for seven different teams in his long career, but being in Miami, the subject of his most famous home run came up Saturday. It was a towering grand-slam off the Marlins’ Kevin Brown on May 31, 1997 into the upper deck at Pro Player Stadium. It was originally called one of the longest homers ever hit, traveling 579 feet. The homer was later reduced to a more modest 529 feet.

“They said it was the longest ever when I hit it,” Galarraga said. “At the time I hit it, I was so excited. I hit it off Kevin Brown and everything. The bases were loaded, it was here in Miami with a lot of people from Venezuela. I was so happy. Then they cut it back … I don’t know what happened there.”

The actual distance of Galarraga’s homer, considered the longest ever hit by a Rockies player, has been the subject of debate since 1997. In 2011, ESPN’s Home Run Tracker tested the distance of the Big Cat’s legendary blow.
