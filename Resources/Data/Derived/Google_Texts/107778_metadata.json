The two sides had been rushing to craft a replacement, with Europe\u2019s data privacy regulators vowing to begin enforcement action this week.\n\nSupporters say the new deal, known as the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, will prevent a potentially catastrophic disruption to transatlantic trade by providing regulatory certainty to the over 4,000 firms that had relied on Safe Harbor.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s economy is online and it runs on data, and so the biggest winners here are the EU and U.S. economies,\u201d Information Technology Industry Council President Dean Garfield said in a statement. \u201cWe congratulate European and American negotiators for their efforts to work through these complex issues and reach an agreement that is essential to innovation, job creation, and economic growth.\u201d\n\nBut onlookers have long been skeptical that a replacement agreement will satisfy the high court\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cWe have to be absolutely sure that this stands in court. I want to be reassured, but I am not reassured yet,\u201d European Parliament member Sophie in 't Veld said yesterday.\n\nThe key sticking point was whether the U.S. could adequately reassure European privacy regulators that citizens\u2019 data would not be subject to \u201cindiscriminate surveillance\u201d by intelligence agencies. Andrus Ansip, Vice President for the Digital Single Market on the European Commission, insisted Tuesday that the Commission was satisfied the agreement met that condition.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has clarified that they do not carry out indiscriminate surveillance of Europeans,\u201d Ansip said Tuesday.\n\nHe cited \u201cdetailed written assurances by U.S. on the safeguards and limitations by surveillance\u201d in the new agreement.\n\nU.S. officials said Tuesday that the Privacy Shield will still contain an exception for national security purposes, once characterized as a key roadblock in negotiations.\n\nThe new deal puts in place a redress scheme whereby EU citizens who feel their data has been mishandled can seek remedy via the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission \u2014 a core requirement of the high court\u2019s ruling. The State Department will also create an ombudsman, whose office will address complaints on possible access by national intelligence authorities.\n\nThe arrangement also includes an annual review process that Jourova insisted would allow for real-time adjustments to the framework.\n\n\"The negotiations were structured around the [EU high court] case so that we could make sure we addressed the various provisions as delineated in the opinion,\" Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker Penny PritzkerOvernight Cybersecurity: Obama signs trade secrets bill Overnight Finance: Trump now open to raising minimum wage Pritzker urges passage of trade deals to boost US exports MORE said on a call with reporters announcing the new framework.\n\nAlthough the agreement is not subject to congressional approval in the U.S., the new deal must still receive approval from the 28 EU member states. Several EU Parliament members as recently as yesterday expressed deep skepticism that any replacement would be sufficiently robust.\n\n\u201cIf this does not comply with the laws, then we can be sure that tomorrow, Max Schrems, a very active European citizen, plus another thousand of his friends are going to go to court,\u201d in \u2019t Veld said yesterday, referring to the privacy advocate who effectively brought down Safe Harbor by lodging a privacy complaint with Ireland\u2019s privacy regulator.\n\nJourova estimated Tuesday that the new mechanisms would be in place within three months.\n\n--This post was updated at 12:16 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The deal will permit Facebook, Google and other firms to handle Europeans\u2019 personal data.", "description": "The deal will permit Facebook, Google and other firms to handle Europeans\u2019 personal data.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Katie Bo Williams", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The deal will permit Facebook, Google and other firms to handle Europeans\u2019 personal data.", "title": "Eleventh-hour deal reached to keep data flowing across the Atlantic", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/267878-us-eu-reach-long-awaited-data-flow-agreement", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/hillstaffersfacebook_021215getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:19:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:19-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/267878-us-eu-reach-long-awaited-data-flow-agreement", "dcterms.date": "2016-02-02T11:47-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Katie Bo Williams", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Penny Pritzker,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-02T11:47:41-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:19:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/267878-us-eu-reach-long-awaited-data-flow-agreement", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The deal will permit Facebook, Google and other firms to handle Europeans\u2019 personal data.", "card": "summary", "title": "Eleventh-hour deal reached to keep data flowing across the Atlantic"}, "dcterms.title": "Eleventh-hour deal reached to keep data flowing across the Atlantic"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6047\"", "article_summary": "The two sides had been rushing to craft a replacement, with Europe\u2019s data privacy regulators vowing to begin enforcement action this week.\nThe United States and the European Union have reached an eleventh-hour agreement that will permit Facebook, Google and thousands of other companies to continue handling Europeans\u2019 personal data.\nAndrus Ansip, Vice President for the Digital Single Market on the European Commission, insisted Tuesday that the Commission was satisfied the agreement met that condition.\nThe key sticking point was whether the U.S. could adequately reassure European privacy regulators that citizens\u2019 data would not be subject to \u201cindiscriminate surveillance\u201d by intelligence agencies.\nThe European high court struck down the original arrangement in October, claiming that the U.S. could not be seen to adequately protect privacy thanks to its mass surveillance practices."}
