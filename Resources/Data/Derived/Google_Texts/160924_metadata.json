The facility will be paid off this year.\n\nPresident Jim Dau said the facility was built with high security because of the nature of the organization's work, but there have been no incidents.\n\nFor security reasons, the organization protects the identity of the people they work with in foreign countries.\n\nVoice of the Martyrs operates on a $40 million budget and has 125 employees reaching 64 nations.\n\nDonors fund the entire operation.\n\nAbout 80 to 85 percent of the budget goes to direct ministry. The organization meets the standards of the Evangelical Council on Financial Accountability and has been named one of Ministry Watch's Shining Lights for its financial accountability.\n\n\"We are trying to awake the American church to what the persecuted church is dealing with,\" said Allan Walker, manager of reader services.\n\nHe said experts have estimated that 100,000 Christians are being killed each year for their faith \u0097 a million people from 2000 to 2010.\n\nAnd the church is growing rapidly in the midst of persecution. China had 1 million Christians in 1970 and has some 70 million to 100 million today.\n\n\"Nothing in history compares to the growth of the church in China,\" he said.\n\nVoice of the Martyrs workers develop relationships with Christians in restricted areas of the world and are a conduit for Bibles, Christian study materials and other aid.\n\nA Voice of the Martyrs pilot has dropped some 100,000 small parachutes over Colombia, carrying books, Bibles and solar-powered radios.\n\nMore than 200,000 \"Action Packs\" containing clothing and bedding have been shipped to the Middle East since 2001.\n\nVolunteers from around the U.S. come to Bartlesville to help out, staying in apartments on the complex or in the RV campground.\n\nLast year they donated 39,000 hours of labor.\n\n\"We are not helping persecuted Christians immigrate to the United States,\" Walker said. \"We help them work in their own country.\"\n\nVoice of the Martyrs was founded by Richard Wurmbrand, a Romanian Jew who converted to Christianity in 1938 and became a Lutheran pastor.\n\nWhen Romania became communist in the 1940s, he denounced it and later was arrested. He spent 14 years in prison \u0097 on and off \u0097 before coming to the United States, where he founded Jesus to the Communist World, the organization that became Voice of the Martyrs.\n\nHe tells his story in \"Tortured for Christ,\" a classic Christian book.\n\nVoice of the Martyrs started in California. It moved to Bartlesville in 1991 because former Director Tom White was from Bartlesville and wanted to raise his family there.\n\nDau, a retired Marine, joined the organization in 1999 and became president in 2012 after White took his own life in the wake of allegations that he had molested a young girl.\n\nBill Sherman 918-581-8398", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "The Voice of the Martyrs is a global organization that sees itself as a bridge between American Christians and Christians in hostile and restricted nations.", "title": "Bartlesville-based organization helps persecuted Christians", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/religion/bartlesville-based-organization-helps-persecuted-christians/article_a3d60cd4-626c-5c0d-9b52-151e21fb3ffd.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/11/611f8191-4f8a-5be7-ad5f-d2b7f44c9da4/52e36ff1dd622.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C373", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The Voice of the Martyrs is a global organization that sees itself as a bridge between American Christians and Christians in hostile and restricted nations.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "martyrs,director,voice,christians,organization,church,million,persecution,bartlesville,com,religion,religionhomepage3,news,communities,bartlesville,news", "news_keywords": "martyrs,director,voice,christians,organization,church,million,persecution,bartlesville,com,religion,religionhomepage3,news,communities,bartlesville,news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c49\"", "article_summary": "China had 1 million Christians in 1970 and has some 70 million to 100 million today.\nBARTLESVILLE -\u0097 The Voice of the Martyrs is a global organization that sees itself as a bridge between American Christians and Christians in hostile and restricted nations.\n\"We are not helping persecuted Christians immigrate to the United States,\" Walker said.\nIt sends out 500,000 newsletters a month, all over the United States, telling the story of the persecuted church.\n\"Last year we did over 1,000 projects to help Christians in hostile and restricted nations,\" such as providing legal help to a pastor and distributing more than 1 million Bibles."}
