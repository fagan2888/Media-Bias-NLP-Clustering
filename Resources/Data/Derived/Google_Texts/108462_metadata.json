The Ted Cruz primary fight in 2018 will be interesting, at least.\n\nWisconsin sources say discussions building in favor of challenging @RepPaulRyan over his role in the #ObamaTrade. #PeoplesCandidate \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) June 12, 2015\n\nFACT: @RepPaulRyan will have mega bucks to defend his reelection from the same Corps that benefit from & lobbied for #ObamaTrade. \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) June 12, 2015\n\nHas anyone seen Dems or GOP fight for anything as hard in the past year? #FastTrackforAmericaNeeded https://t.co/dDnnRbWPzw \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) June 12, 2015\n\nIngraham championed Dave Brat\u2019s challenge to Eric Cantor last year, which virtually no one but her took seriously until election night, so when she says Ryan\u2019s on the chopping block there\u2019s a bit of extra credibility to it. I won\u2019t believe it until I see it happen; as far as I know, Ryan\u2019s still well liked in his home district, something that wasn\u2019t true of the often absent Cantor. For a guy normally regarded as a conservative hero, though, he does have some conspicuous heresies in his record \u2014 TARP, comprehensive immigration reform, the 2013 budget deal with Patty Murray, his ongoing alliance with Boehner and the reviled House leadership, now this. The recent Pelosi-esque line about finding out what\u2019s in the bill after it passes was icing on the cake. I think it\u2019s less likely that he\u2019ll be primaried than that his path to higher office, be it the presidency or the Senate, has been damaged, if only temporarily. If you\u2019re going to stick your neck out for entitlement reform, you\u2019d better have conservatives in your corner at least. Increasingly he doesn\u2019t.\n\nSpeaking of losing your base over trade bills, a golden moment from Obama\u2019s huddle this morning with House Democrats:\n\nHouse Democratic Rep #1 re: POTUS visit to Hill: \"He was fine until he turned it at the end and became indignant and alienated some folks.\" \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) June 12, 2015\n\nReally? That sounds so unlike him.\n\nNow that Pelosi and his own caucus have royally humiliated him on a high-profile vote, I think we can safely safe that Hillary Clinton has replaced the lame duck as the new leader of the Democratic Party. Henceforth, proper Hot Air usage will change from \u201csemi-retired president\u201d to \u201cfully retired.\u201d Exit question: Via the Right Scoop, skip to 1:15 of the clip below for a little cheerleading for fast-track trade authority.
