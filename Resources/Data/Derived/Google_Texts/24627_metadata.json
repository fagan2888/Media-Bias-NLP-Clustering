It also is home for the Ohio Benefit Bank and runs the largest navigator program for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in Ohio.\n\nThe tax assistance is meant to be a free alternative to paid preparers, allowing people to keep all of their refund. As part of the process, the benefit bank checks for tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credits, and allows Ohioans to electronically file their returns.\n\nThe Ohio Benefit Bank began providing the tax assistance in 2006 and has helped nearly 100,000 taxpayers file at no cost. The Association of Foodbanks estimates those filers received refunds of about $227 million.\n\n\u201cWe want everyone to remember that your tax refund belongs to you,\u201d Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, executive director for the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, said in a statement. \u201cWhether you file on your own using our free online service, or you set up an appointment with one of our trained tax counselors, don\u2019t give part of your hard-earned money away.\u201d\n\nTaxpayers get help filing on their own through an online question-and-answer based process. Trained tax counselors are also available through the site\u2019s Benefit Bank Locator or by calling 800-648-1176.\n\nThe Benefit Bank helps connect people to a host of services, such as food and nutrition programs, health care assistance, student aid and senior programs.\n\nIn Greater Cleveland, it has more than 150 benefit bank sites, partnering with local United Way agencies, social service organizations, churches and government community service offices.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "internal-revenue-service,lisa-hamler-fugitt,ohio-association-of-foodbanks,ohio-benefit-bank,tax-preparation-assistance", "title": "Free tax preparation help available to many Ohioans through the Ohio Benefit Bank", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Free tax preparation help available to many Ohioans through the Ohio Benefit Bank\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/04/free_tax_preparation_help_avai.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/consumeraffairs/photo/14470438-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12578519\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-03T17:22:54Z\", \"author\": \"Robert Higgs, Northeast Ohio Media Group Columbus bureau chief\", \"tags\": [\"internal-revenue-service\",\"lisa-hamler-fugitt\",\"ohio-association-of-foodbanks\",\"ohio-benefit-bank\",\"tax-preparation-assistance\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/consumeraffairs/photo/14470438-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@RHiggsPD", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "The free assistance is available to joint filers with incomes less than $95,000 and individuals whose incomes are less than $65,000."}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, April 03, 2014,  4:42 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/consumeraffairs/photo/taxesjpg-cae4c1805d29c78e.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"RHiggs\", \"author_nickname\": \"Robert Higgs, Northeast Ohio Media Group Columbus bureau chief\", \"author_id\": \"2184\", \"source_blog_name\": \"OPEN: Ohio Politics\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "The free assistance is available to joint filers with incomes less than $95,000 and individuals whose incomes are less than $65,000.", "title": "Free tax preparation help available to many Ohioans through the Ohio Benefit Bank", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/04/free_tax_preparation_help_avai.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, April 03, 2014,  1:22 PM", "article_author": "Robert Higgs, Northeast Ohio Media Group Columbus bureau chief", "Description": "The free assistance is available to joint filers with incomes less than $95,000 and individuals whose incomes are less than $65,000."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcafe1\"", "article_summary": "It also is home for the Ohio Benefit Bank and runs the largest navigator program for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in Ohio.\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio -- As the filing deadline looms less than two weeks away, many low- and middle-income Ohioans are eligible for free help completing their tax returns through the Ohio Benefit Bank.\nThe Ohio Benefit Bank began providing the tax assistance in 2006 and has helped nearly 100,000 taxpayers file at no cost.\nAs part of the process, the benefit bank checks for tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credits, and allows Ohioans to electronically file their returns.\nTrained tax counselors are also available through the site\u2019s Benefit Bank Locator or by calling 800-648-1176."}
