Mean Tweets: campaign edition with Senator @AlFranken.https://t.co/F57Uv45SBT — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 25, 2016

Democratic Sen. Al Franken showed his support for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Thursday by appearing in a “mean tweets” video.

The former Saturday Night Live comedian and Minnesota senator has had plenty of feedback since tweeting his support for Clinton, and he responded to some them in an amusing video shared by the Clinton campaign on Thursday.

“Franken is plugged into the establishment matrix,” one of them read, to which he responded: “Ok, that sounds painful, and it was, it was. It was part of the enhanced interrogation techniques they did during the Bush administration, thank god we stopped plugging people into the establishment matrix.”

In the video, he says that he agrees with Clinton on the following issues:

Making college affordable

Lowering student debt

Universal pre-K

Raising minimum wage

Rebuilding infrastructure

Combating climate change

Creating clean energy jobs

Protecting Planned Parenthood

Pay equality

Strengthening social security

Improving Obamacare

Expanding mental health coverage

According to City Pages, Senator Amy Klobuchar and Governor Mark Dayton also support Clinton.
