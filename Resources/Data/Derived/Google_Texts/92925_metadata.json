A perfect place, he reasoned, to test the Healthcare.gov website.\n\n\u201cThese folks are savvy. Every person in here is a tech savvy person whose used to being online,\u201d Petrila said. \u201cNo one's in here thinking, \u2018Well, what's the Internet?\u2019 If these folks can't navigate this website, then that's a serious problem.\"\n\nThere is a serious problem. They tried with different browsers, including Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. A few students had iPads, but they wouldn't scroll. They somehow figured out they might have better luck by clearing their browser history; that got them further.\n\n\u201cI've been trying to create an account, which is kind of interesting because you'll click on it and it doesn't take you to anything else,\u201d said Rachel McCollister, a senior public health major. \u201cSo, I thought maybe what's up here right now is create your own account, but I keep trying and I'm having a lot of difficulty.\u201d\n\nShe couldn't create a username and password, so she tried the \u201clive chat\u201d window. The woman on the other end told her to check her inbox for a message from Healthcare.gov. McCollister said she had never entered her email address on the site.\n\nAbout three hundred man hours later, Petrila said the Health Insurance Marketplace website isn\u2019t the shopping experience most of us are used to.\n\n\u201cWhat it claims to be, I think, is a place where you can go, look at an inventory, price it, compare it, and then at least make some tentative decisions about whether that fits your need or not,\u201d Petrila said. \u201cI didn't hear anything from any of these students that suggested they could do that.\"\n\nDuring the classroom discussion, students shared that the links didn\u2019t work. Another student was re-directed to mail in his application.\n\n\"Which is counterintuitive when it comes to doing things online,\" Petrila said. \"This would have been a great website in the 19th century, it sounds like.\"\n\nPetrila jokes and has fun in his class. But the website issues do trouble him, especially for students who actually need it to work so they can sign up for health coverage.\n\nYaisial Monatnez, a senior public health major, is one of the more than 3.8 million uninsured Floridians. For her, this wasn't only a class exercise.\n\n\"Children under 26 years old can be on their parents' health insurance, but my mom doesn't have health insurance so I really kind of have to get my own,\u201d Montanez said. \u201cI have had situations and I've had to pay out of pocket and it can cost a lot of money, so I know I have to do something soon.\"\n\nDuring the first month of open enrollment on the new Health Insurance Marketplace, only about 3,500 Floridians picked a plan.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the top federal health official, was in Florida this week to put a positive spin on the rocky rollout.\n\n\"The website is on a constant improvement plan,\u201d Sebelius said. \u201cIt is so much better today than it was at the beginning of October and we don't want people to be discouraged from using the website today, tomorrow and the next day.\"\n\nThe Obama Administration has said most of the site's problems will be fixed by the end of the month \u2013 so Petrila's students just might have another chance to test Healthcare.gov before the semester is over.\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
