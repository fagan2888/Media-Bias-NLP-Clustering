For them, the legacy tag means a big rate hike.\n\nAdditional Photos :Christmas tree farmer Jay Cox of Cape Elizabeth is among the policy holders facing a 13.4 percent hike in his Anthem insurance premiums. Since 2009, the average annual increase had been 4 percent until now, he said. Carl D.

Eric A. Cioppa, the superintendent of insurance, approved the increase after rejecting as excessive Anthem\u2019s request for an average hike of 18.32 percent on its \u201clegacy individual products.\u201d\n\nThe policies are those left behind after the adoption of the ACA, said Mitchell Stein, an independent health policy consultant in Maine.\n\nStein said the law allows some individual policies written before the law went into force \u2013 and even a few that were written afterward \u2013 to continue for people who want to keep them, even if they don\u2019t meet legal requirements for covering essential health conditions and out-of-pocket maximums.\n\nMost individuals, he said, find a better deal on the ACA website, healthcare.gov, especially with subsidies that can help people with the cost. He said in some cases, families with a lot of children can get some subsidies even if their income is as high as $90,000.\n\nBut there are still some people who aren\u2019t helped by the law and the selection of policies.\n\nJay Cox, who runs The Old Farm Christmas Place in Cape Elizabeth and runs a fishing boat in Alaska four months of the year, said he wasn\u2019t able to find a better plan on healthcare.gov even though his premium on his Anthem individual policy will rise $800 this year, to $8,136, with a $2,500 deductible.\n\nHe has helped family members sign up for insurance on healthcare.gov and believes many got good deals. But when he searched for himself, the cost, co-pays and deductibles were higher than his Anthem plan.\n\nHe\u2019s had his Anthem policy since 2009 and the average yearly increases were 4 percent, until this year. Cox was shocked when he heard about the proposed increase of more than 18 percent earlier this fall and wrote to the Bureau of Insurance to register his objection.\n\nThe actual increase, he said, was \u201ca bit more reasonable,\u201d but it\u2019s still a big jump.\n\n\u201cI like what I\u2019ve got, but I\u2019m concerned if it\u2019s going to continue,\u201d Cox said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to take it year-to-year at this point.\u201d\n\nStein said that\u2019s a good approach, because premiums are likely to continue to rise. As the risk continues to be spread among a shrinking pool of people, he said insurers will have to charge enough to prepare for high costs in case a lot of the policy holders draw heavily on their coverage.\n\nThe state can even order a company to drop the policies, Stein said, although Maine has opted to keep them in place, at least for 2015.\n\nHe predicted that more people who have the policies will drop them increasingly in future years.\n\n\u201cEven though by inertia, people want to keep what they have, it\u2019s worth shopping around,\u201d Stein said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state\u2019s insurance superintendent approves the increase for \u2018legacy\u2019 policies that predate the Affordable Care Act, but rejects Anthem\u2019s request for 18.32 percent.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The state\u2019s insurance superintendent approves the increase for \u2018legacy\u2019 policies that predate the Affordable Care Act, but rejects Anthem\u2019s request for 18.32 percent.", "title": "Anthem\u2019s 13.4 percent rate hike to hit more than 11,000 Mainers - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/232367-20141121_Anthem_010.jpg", "height": 2000}, "updated_time": "2014-11-22T01:14:29-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/11/22/maine-regulators-approve-anthem-rate-hike/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The state\u2019s insurance superintendent approves the increase for \u2018legacy\u2019 policies that predate the Affordable Care Act, but rejects Anthem\u2019s request for 18.32 percent.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/232367-20141121_Anthem_010.jpg", "title": "Anthem\u2019s 13.4 percent rate hike to hit more than 11,000 Mainers - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2014-11-22T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-22T01:14:29-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce1b1\"", "article_summary": "Additional Photos :Christmas tree farmer Jay Cox of Cape Elizabeth is among the policy holders facing a 13.4 percent hike in his Anthem insurance premiums.\nThe state can even order a company to drop the policies, Stein said, although Maine has opted to keep them in place, at least for 2015.\nHe\u2019s had his Anthem policy since 2009 and the average yearly increases were 4 percent, until this year.\nBut that\u2019s not the case for holders of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield\u2019s \u201clegacy\u201d individual health insurance policies, those that predate the Affordable Care Act.\nFor them, the legacy tag means a big rate hike."}
