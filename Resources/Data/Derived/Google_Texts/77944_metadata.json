In November of 1994, five years out of office, doctors diagnosed him with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. A new analysis suggests the signs may have been evident even before he left the White House.\n\nThe findings hail from Arizona State University and are published in the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. They give credence to a method of disease detection that relies on analyzing speech patterns for irregularities, such as the repetition of certain phrases or forgetting them altogether. Alzheimer\u2019s disease carries no reliable diagnostic tool, as scientists have yet to find a way to unlock the so far impenetrable black box of the brain.\n\nAs a window into dementia, speech analysis can be tricky. Decades of recorded words aren\u2019t usually lying around, waiting to be fed through a computer. But politicians, in their years of documented campaigning and national addresses, can act as a helpful outlier.\n\nIn their analysis, Visar Berisha and Julie Liss, professors of speech and hearing science at ASU, compared Reagan\u2019s transcripts to those of President George H.W. Bush. The two men acted as a reliable comparison for analyzing speech because they were around the same age during their presidency and served in the same decade. This proximity was important for Berisha and Liss because people speak differently across various time periods and at different stages in life.\n\nIn parsing both presidents\u2019 many transcripts, they discovered some key differences. Compared to Bush, who has exhibited no signs of dementia, Reagan began relying on crutch words more often toward the end of his presidency, such as using the word \u201cthing\u201d instead of a more specific term. He also repeated himself more often, the researchers found.\n\nBerisha and Liss got the idea for their study after coming across a study that analyzed autobiographical essays of nuns living in a convent, some of whom developed Alzheimer\u2019s and tended to project the signs in their writing. \u201cIt was surprising that, by analyzing discourse rather than writing samples, similar changes were detectable over the course of two presidential terms,\u201d Berisha told Yahoo.\n\nCognitive decline is best caught early. It isn\u2019t a gradual slide into senility so much as a push off of the edge of a cliff. Once the fall has begun, the amyloid plaques destroying neural connections quickly wipe away speech function and mental reasoning. Vocabulary size begins to shrink and known words elude people\u2019s grasp. For Berisha and Liss, the hope is these kinds of detection methods can apply to the general public. They want to devise a study that can record conversations between physicians and patients to analyze speech patterns over time. They also want to study NFL press conferences among players who have suffered head trauma.\n\n\u201cOur goal,\u201d Berisha told Yahoo, \u201cis that one day we can develop health applications that automatically analyze speech and language biomarkers for disease onset or progression.\u201d\n\nSource: Berisha V, Wang S, LaCross A, Liss J.
