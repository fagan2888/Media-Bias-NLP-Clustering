Super Bowl VI for Pat Bowlen and John Elway. Super Bowl I for Champ Bailey.\n\nAs Winston Churchill would have declared, the Broncos \u201chad their finest hour\u201d Sunday.\n\nGet ready, New York and New Jersey. Here come the Broncos. It\u2019s high time to ride again.\n\nTwo down, one to go. Two world championships, a chance at a third.\n\nNew England bowed deeply to the flawless Broncos on a magnificent Sunday afternoon with a landscape of orange, a sky of blue and a backdrop of snow-capped mountains in a scene that could have been painted by Monet \u2026 or maybe the master artist Manning.\n\nAfterward, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said the Broncos possess \u201cprobably the best offense in NFL history.\u201d In restricting the Patriots to 16 points and two measly touchdowns, the Broncos unleashed a defense to match.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 mantra this season is \u201cFinish.\u201d To do so, they must defeat the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl.\n\nBut first, \u201cwe will savor this moment,\u201d Manning said.\n\nHe shared his triumph with brothers Eli and Cooper, and dad Archie. It was one of the few times the First Family of Quarterbacks has gathered for a reunion at a locker after a game. As Peyton dressed, the three brothers traded barbs.\n\nOldest brother Cooper, whose career ended prematurely because of spinal stenosis before he began his freshman season at Ole Miss, walked over and said to me: \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re being kids again. I gave Peyton only one piece of advice. Play like you\u2019re 10 years old, and we\u2019re playing in the front yard.\u201d\n\nCooper said Peyton disregarded his counsel.\n\n\u201cBut he has ignored me on a consistent basis, and he\u2019s turned out OK.\u201d (And yet Cooper was the one person Peyton turned to when he was choosing to play in Denver.)\n\nEli has won two Super Bowls as the quarterback with the Giants against, of all people, Tom Brady and the Patriots. Peyton has played in two, won one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny that the last time Eli won, it was at my home stadium (in Indianapolis), and now I\u2019m going to play at his stadium (in East Rutherford, N.J.),\u201d Peyton Manning said. \u201cIt\u2019s great that the family was here for me today. It was so hectic in Indianapolis after the Super Bowl, we weren\u2019t together.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos will be returning for the first outdoor Super Bowl in a northeastern metropolis. Early forecasts are for temperatures considerably colder than the 63 degrees at kickoff Sunday. Let it snow.\n\nThe Pressure on Peyton to win had been the primary topic before the latest \u201cFight of The Century\u201d vs. Brady. Manning wasn\u2019t pressured, and barely touched, by the Patriots.\n\nManning threw for 400 yards and two touchdowns. He was in control. He has won his past two AFC championship games against the Double B\u2019s \u2014 Brady and Belichick. Coach Bill called Manning \u201ca good quarterback.\u201d\n\nYou think?\n\nStay classy, Bill.\n\nManning completely baffled the Patriots\u2019 defense, and the Broncos\u2019 defense bewildered Brady. So much for the presumptuous belief in New England that the Patriots would overrun the Broncos and overpower Manning. The Patriots rushed for 64 yards. Manning connected with eight receivers, and the Broncos gained 507 yards.\n\nAdam Gase, soon to be an NFL head coach, called a brilliant game, while his Patriots counterpart, former head coach Josh somebody, was bewildered.\n\nOverall, the Broncos were super, and the Patriots were in a stupor. So the Broncos tied the Patriots for Super Bowl appearances (seven) and can tie the Patriots with a third victory.\n\nIt\u2019s Super (times seven) to be Manning and the Broncos.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Woody Paige: For Broncos, seventh heaven in trip to Super Bowl", "title": "Woody Paige: For Broncos, seventh heaven in trip to Super Bowl", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/19/woody-paige-for-broncos-seventh-heaven-in-trip-to-super-bowl/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140120__john-elwayp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140120__john-elwayp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-19T21:44:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T00:38:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Super, Super, Super, Super, Super, Super, Super Bowl.\nIt was so hectic in Indianapolis after the Super Bowl, we weren\u2019t together.\u201dThe Broncos will be returning for the first outdoor Super Bowl in a northeastern metropolis.\nSo the Broncos tied the Patriots for Super Bowl appearances (seven) and can tie the Patriots with a third victory.\nThe Broncos\u2019 mantra this season is \u201cFinish.\u201d To do so, they must defeat the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl.\nSuper Bowl VII for Denver."}
