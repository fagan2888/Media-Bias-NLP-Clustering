We also have three viable financing options to ensure we have the capital reserves to meet our regulatory requirements. One option includes reinsurance financing. Another is receiving capital support from another successful CO-OP. And finally, we are talking with a private investor.\n\nWe\u2019re working hard to ensure that we\u2019re here to stay. #believeit\n\nBut state insurance regulators are forcing it to shut down due to financial insecurity. Colorado AP reporter Kristen Wyatt announced via Twitter that the largest insurer on Colorado\u2019s health exchange has indeed collapsed.\n\nBREAKING: The largest insurer on Colorado\u2019s health insurance exchange, @COHealthOP, collapses, becoming nation\u2019s 5th failed ACA co-op \u2014 Kristen Wyatt (@APkristenwyatt) October 16, 2015\n\nThis announcement comes just days after both Tennessee and Kentucky announced closures of their co-ops as well. Colorado is now the 7th co-op to fold \u2013 leaving only 16 of 23 operating. To date, the Colorado HealthOP has received $72 million of the $2.4 billion given in low-interest federal loans to subsidize these marketplace experiments.\n\nThe latest numbers show that approximately 80,000 Coloradans are insured through the co-op and will need to find new plans and providers. They join the over 400,000 others who have lost their plans under failed ObamaCare cooperatives.\n\nJust last week I reported that the federal government was reneging on previous promises and would be shorting insurance companies $2.5 billion that they were guaranteed under ObamaCare. Without those funds, expect more of these closures.\n\nMembers of Colorado HealthOP will be covered until the end of 2015, and the next Open Enrollment period begins on November 1, 2015 and runs through January 31, 2016. The newly uninsured need to work fast if they\u2019re going to avoid their \u201cshared responsibility payment\u201d for not having approved coverage.\n\n___________________________\n\nKristina Ribali is the Senior Coalitions Director for the Foundation for Government Accountability.
