A teacher had suggested the book, after seeing me struggle with the more realist selections of the typical undergrad creative writing syllabus of the early 2000s, and almost immediately I was hooked, on both that book and Lethem\u2019s writing in general. \u201cAmnesia Moon\u201d is an intoxicating but very strange novel \u2014 perhaps Lethem\u2019s strangest, at least for me \u2014 and so I was surprised, in 2003, to find myself reading \u201cThe Fortress of Solitude,\u201d with its much more grounded period setting beginning in 1970s Brooklyn.\n\nI would soon immerse myself in the rest of Lethem\u2019s books, and this range became one of the most exciting aspects of reading his novels and stories and essays: His interests are broad, his obsessions deep and his influences both announced and fully explored, engaged, built upon. If Lethem has topics or time periods or genres he returns to frequently, it feels to me less like a tic or a limitation and more like an indication that something is not yet finished, that his unshed obsessions return often to further provoke his imagination into new stories.\n\nJonathan Lethem\u2019s \u201cLucky Alan\u201d is his first short story collection since 2004\u2019s \u201cMen and Cartoons,\u201d collecting the stories written in the decade that followed. In the years between, he\u2019s published three novels, including 2013\u2019s \u201cDissident Gardens,\u201d and a slew of other projects in other genres, including penning a reboot of the comic book \u201cOmega the Unknown\u201d; collecting two books of essays, including \u201cThe Ecstasy of Influence,\u201d titled after his provocative Harper\u2019s essay of the same name; editing a volume of selections of Philip K. Dick\u2019s journals; and another nonfiction book on The Talking Heads album \u201cFear of Music\u201d for the popular 33 1/3 series. Our conversation with Lethem discusses how stories in \u201cLucky Alan\u201d were written, as well as what changed (and what stayed the same) throughout this busy and productive decade.\n\nOnce I was a few stories into \u201cLucky Alan,\u201d I started thinking about the book\u2019s ordering, wondering if you\u2019d consciously decided to start with two of the more realist stories \u2014 the title story and \u201cThe King of Sentences\u201d \u2014 before moving on to stranger fare, like \u201cTraveler Home,\u201d where the protagonist is given a baby by a pack of wolves, or \u201cProcedure in Plain Air,\u201d with its surreal \u201cinstallation\u201d involving a man left in a hole outside a coffee shop, \u201can inverted phone booth of dirt and rubble.\u201d But then a friend mentioned seeing you read \u201cProcedure in Plain Air\u201d at Skylight Books in Los Angeles a few weeks ago, where he reported that you\u2019d said the stories appear here in the order they were written.\n\nThat answers one question but begs another: How do you chart the progress of your interests in the short story over that time? Does \u201cPending Vegan,\u201d the last story, complete some line of artistic thought that began with the first, \u201cLucky Alan,\u201d or is the book simply a method of collecting all the short work of a certain period in one place?\n\nI\u2019ve got at least 12 answers to this question, depending on whether I grab it by trunk or tail or some other appendage. Somewhere I once read a pragmatic assertion that the way to order a story collection is to put the best story first and the second-best last and the rest anywhere you like. I do think \u201cLucky Alan\u201d and \u201cPending Vegan\u201d are the two most satisfying and complete stories I\u2019ve written, or at least that were uncollected. When I threw them into those positions, just to see what that looked like, I noticed immediately that one was the earliest piece in the book, and the other the most recent. Putting them in chronological sequence made for a quick solution to what probably wasn\u2019t an important question in the first place: Does anybody typically read a story collection from beginning to end? (Of course many would say I could quit that rhetorical question sooner: Does anybody typically read a story collection?)\n\nOf course, I may have forgotten or been mistaken or be lying about the order of writing of some of the stories between those two. I jiggered the sequence at some point to make for what I thought would be a better alternation of the \u201cmore realist\u201d with the \u201cstranger fare\u201d \u2014 though we might differ on what\u2019s strange. In the experience of their maker, \u201cThe King of Sentences,\u201d for instance, is stranger than \u201cProcedure in Plain Air.\u201d The first is an unrepeatable language pratfall, the second a pretty methodological fiction, putting two incommensurate things together and playing out the result. That one feels traditional to me. But that\u2019s just the experience of the maker.\n\nTo answer your last question, both. What\u2019s great about short stories is the opportunity to play at reinvention; all those new departures, all those new landings to try to stick. It makes me happy to think of the book as a window into the last decade\u2019s worth of tiny revolutions and self-overthrowings, and as a laboratory for what I might still become as a writer. For instance \u201cLucky Alan\u201d was the last thing I wrote before starting \u201cChronic City,\u201d and it looks to me like I was testing my confidence for that milieu and tone. What if \u201cPending Vegan\u201d will tell me as much about what I\u2019m capable of, looking back later?\n\nOn the other hand, hey, I\u2019m 50. This is the third time I\u2019ve gathered a decade\u2019s stories. Let\u2019s be clear about how much such introspection matters to the reader who\u2019s either aboard or not aboard my \u201cproject\u201d by now: likely, not bloody much. Somerset Maugham once adopted the title of a next collection of his stories from a weary reviewer\u2019s description of his previous one: \u201cThe Mixture as Before.\u201d The secret title of this book is \u201cThe Mixture as Before.\u201d\n\nThe idea of stories as a laboratory for what might come next feels true to me too: I can go back and look at my first book of stories and see proto-versions of elements I\u2019d use later in longer work, as well as kinds of fiction I\u2019ve never returned to. A reviewer once wrote that she wished my first novel was more like a certain story in my first book, and I remember thinking: Give me time to get to that novel \u2014 I\u2019d like to write it too! It takes so much longer to change at the novel scale, compared to how fast you might reinvent yourself as a story writer. Are there stories of your that haunt you in this way, styles or subjects you haven\u2019t had the chance to scale up?\n\nThe relationship between the two forms is permanently charged and strange \u2014 it seems simple, but it\u2019s not. They seem so obviously related, they\u2019re typically done by the same writers, and yet there\u2019s a kind of abyss between them. There\u2019s a lot you can do in short fiction that you can\u2019t in a novel, and the reverse is true as well, and yet as you say they can be testing grounds. I never mistake an idea or a plan or character from one form for the other; they seem absolutely clear to me when they declare themselves. I\u2019ve published chapters from books as short stories, but it always feels like a trick. The characters know they live in a larger space, and so they keep glancing out of the frame. So, I wouldn\u2019t think of it in terms of \u201cscaling up,\u201d no.\n\nYet faced with your question, I feel a fundamental and terrifying recognition. I\u2019m haunted, yes, all the time, and increasingly, by the kinds of writer I\u2019ll never get to turn out to have been. I\u2019ve been digging in my own buried archives recently and discovered bunches of notebooks with jottings for stories and novels I never got around to writing (as well as jottings indicating some of those I did \u2014 I was amazed to find that I\u2019d basically already conceived the intention to write The \u201cFortress of Solitude,\u201d my sixth novel, when I was 19). Crime novels, autobiographical novels about parts of my life untouched by the autobiographical novels I\u2019ve actually managed, surrealist stories, plays even! Every one of those notes feels alive to me, waiting to be picked up and realized. Probably none of them ever will be.\n\nWhen I\u2019m writing short stories I feel closer to this laboratory-self, the kid with all those notebooks so sure he\u2019d get to be all those different kinds of writer. Simply because the situation of story-writing \u2014 brisk, fleeting, beginning-middle-end accomplished in a few weeks \u2014 encourages the crazy optimism, the sensation of being modular and capable of anything. When I\u2019m writing a novel, which is most of the time, I\u2019m simply inside the project, managing its potentialities and necessities, living with its people, for a period of years. There is no outside, then. Each novel I write feels like my last, not for some morbid feeling that I\u2019ll quit or die after I write \u201cthe end,\u201d but simply because I lose sight of the imaginative zone beyond its horizon. To write a novel is to be merely (and fulfillingly) the writer of that novel. The task of trying to answer that novel\u2019s requirements is more than enough.\n\nTo loop back to an earlier answer: Is there a freedom that comes with this point in the career, where \u201cThe Mixture as Before\u201d feels like an honest way to title a book? Does knowing that many readers already know whether they\u2019re into your \u201cproject\u201d or not free you to do work you might not otherwise have done? I think that sounds a little like I\u2019m trying to trap you into saying that caring too much about what people thought restrained you in the past, but I\u2019m really wondering if there\u2019s a point in the career where your relationship with the bulk of your readers stabilizes and becomes something new and perhaps better than what came before.\n\nTo the extent that I can detect \u201cmy relationship with my readers,\u201d it never stabilizes, thank god. I don\u2019t think \u201cReaders,\u201d despite the illusion created by the Amazon or Goodreads star-systems, stabilize into some monolithic and lucid voice that you can listen to. Instead, when I come out of my house \u2014 I do, sometimes \u2014 I\u2019ll meet people who\u2019ve declared one or another of my books to be their favorite; after reminding myself how lucky it is that I\u2019m read at all, I add a second blessing that each of my willful and divergent artifacts seems to find some individual constituency. Of course this has to do with the different purposes readers bring to things, to their age, leaning, what they had for dinner, and so forth. When I meet one of the \u201cGirl in Landscape\u201d people I\u2019m extra happy. I like the books better as they age out of their initial publicity, which is a kind of fever or toxic shock that the book is temporarily ill with, and instead become part of the backdrop of what\u2019s out there, the literary environment. It usually happens four or five years after publication.\n\nNeedless to say, if I\u2019d been super-obedient to broadband expectations beaming my way (more from journalists than from readers \u2014 and not, I\u2019d emphasize, from my editors) I\u2019d have written loads of books about weird private detectives and/or 1970s Brooklyn. It might have been simpler, except I couldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t say that in a bragging-about-my-perversity sort of way. I say it in a confessing-an-incapacity sort of way. I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t have.\n\nI\u2019ve been a big fan of \u201cThe King of Sentences\u201d since it first appeared in The New Yorker, and rereading it I was stuck between shaking my head at the absurd fandom of the two protagonists, while also knowing that whatever shames them is something I shared. I\u2019ve also thought the two young writers were the primary target of the story\u2019s satire, but now I wonder if it\u2019s not the King of Sentences that bears the brunt of the story\u2019s blow. After all, your own fandom for writers and musicians and comics is such an integral part of the way you\u2019ve charted your development as a writer and a person that it seems somewhat hard for me to believe you\u2019re really being too harsh on the two writers here, caught in the \u201ctime when all [they] could talk about was sentences, sentences.\u201d Was there a specific writer or literary movement you were intent on skewering here, either with the young writers or the King? Is there, as it seems to me, just as much celebration here as there is takedown?\n\nThere\u2019s definitely no specific writer or literary movement I was intent on skewering. In fact, my intent to skewer is practically nonexistent. If I could make just one general statement here it would be that I am almost always already never skewering anything when I set out to write. One of the sad-strangest things I experience is when I\u2019m taken for skewering characters I adore and cherish, identify with, and am abiding with out of fascination and yearning.\n\nThe kids in that story obviously come from a kind of appalled and delighted fascination with my own aspirant self. Shelley Jackson and I, when we were still bookstore clerks, once read a Don DeLillo book aloud to each other, slowly over weeks. So there\u2019s a grain there, blown into a kind of balloon and sent sailing. At the same time, I\u2019m hugely identified with that poor old grouse who just wants to be left alone to do his work, concealed from view, unconfronted with his limitations, forgiven his trespasses. Each day that passes puts me nearer to the title character in the story, not for my achievement in sentences, which is not for me to judge, but for my hermetic reluctance, and my distrust of people with excessively smooth skin. So: I locate my \u201cself\u201d between the two poles in the story \u2014 the kids, the King. I pray I\u2019ll always float somewhere in the space between them, able to make contact with both.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He talks to Salon about his new book \"Lucky Alan,\" comics, fans and adoring his characters\u2014even the difficult ones", "title": "Jonathan Lethem: \u201cMy intent to skewer is practically nonexistent\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "He talks to Salon about his new book \"Lucky Alan,\" comics, fans and adoring his characters\u2014even the difficult ones", "title": "Jonathan Lethem: \u201cMy intent to skewer is practically nonexistent\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/28/jonathan_lethem_my_intent_to_skewer_is_practically_nonexistent/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/jonathanlethem-johnlucas.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He talks to Salon about his new book \"Lucky Alan,\" comics, fans and adoring his characters\u2014even the difficult ones", "title": "Jonathan Lethem: \u201cMy intent to skewer is practically nonexistent\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/jonathanlethem-johnlucas.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Matt Bell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, chronic city, Editor's Picks, Jonathan Lethem, Lucky Alan, The Fortress of Solitude", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd91b3\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Books, chronic city, Editor's Picks, Jonathan Lethem, Lucky Alan, The Fortress of Solitude, Entertainment NewsI started reading Jonathan Lethem with \u201cAmnesia Moon,\u201d maybe five or six years after it first came out.\nCrime novels, autobiographical novels about parts of my life untouched by the autobiographical novels I\u2019ve actually managed, surrealist stories, plays even!\nIn fact, my intent to skewer is practically nonexistent.\nJonathan Lethem\u2019s \u201cLucky Alan\u201d is his first short story collection since 2004\u2019s \u201cMen and Cartoons,\u201d collecting the stories written in the decade that followed.\nThe kids in that story obviously come from a kind of appalled and delighted fascination with my own aspirant self."}
