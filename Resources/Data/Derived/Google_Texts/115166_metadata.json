He wouldn\u2019t provide details on those plans.\n\nThe package announced Monday largely amounts to a $10-a-month discount for getting TV and wireless services at any level on the same bill. Bentley said customers also would have a single number to call for customer service, and employees at AT&T stores would be able to set up customers\u2019 phones so that they could start watching TV through apps right away, even before service is installed in the living room.\n\nBut the content on phones won\u2019t differ from what DirecTV customers have already been able to get on their apps. It\u2019s typically a selection of what\u2019s available on regular TVs because of rights restrictions placed by content owners.\n\nBeyond the $10-a-month single-bill discount, savings will come from promotions that TV and wireless companies typically offer already as stand-alone companies. The offer starts Aug. 10.\n\nRoger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics, said TV as a stand-alone business is dead, as consumers see TV as part of their overall media and telecommunications experience. So far, AT&T is the only company able to provide both mobile and TV services. Rivals are limited to partnerships, which Entner said don\u2019t work as well for consumers and the companies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AT&T, as new owner of DirecTV, offers TV-wireless package", "title": "AT&T, as new owner of DirecTV, offers TV-wireless package", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "AT&T, as new owner of DirecTV, offers TV-wireless package", "title": "AT&T, as new owner of DirecTV, offers TV-wireless package", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/08/03/att_as_new_owner_of_directv_offers_tv_wireless_package/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/at-and-t-tv-and-wireless-package.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AT&T, as new owner of DirecTV, offers TV-wireless package", "title": "AT&T, as new owner of DirecTV, offers TV-wireless package", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/at-and-t-tv-and-wireless-package.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Anick Jesdanun", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Beyond the $10-a-month single-bill discount, savings will come from promotions that TV and wireless companies typically offer already as stand-alone companies.\nBut the content on phones won\u2019t differ from what DirecTV customers have already been able to get on their apps.\nThe package announced Monday largely amounts to a $10-a-month discount for getting TV and wireless services at any level on the same bill.\nThe change isn\u2019t huge, given that AT&T and DirecTV already had cross-marketing deals as separate companies.\nBentley said AT&T is planning several products to integrate mobile phone and TV services in ways rivals can\u2019t because they don\u2019t own both businesses."}
