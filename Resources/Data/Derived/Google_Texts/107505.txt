Four days after nine people were massacred in one of Charleston’s most historic black churches, leaders are preparing to hold a service Sunday morning, said the top bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.

“It will be a celebration for those who survived,” said Bishop John Bryant, the church’s top worldwide official. Interim pastor Norvel Goff is scheduled to officiate the 9:30 a.m. service.
