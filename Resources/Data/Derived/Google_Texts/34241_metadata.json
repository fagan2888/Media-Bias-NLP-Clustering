They need to realize, accidents happen,\u201d Biden said, holding up her left arm in a camouflage cast as an example.\n\nBiden, who broke her left wrist last month when she slipped and fell, is expected to be in a cast for about six weeks.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s wife, a community college teacher, helped the national grass-roots group MomsRising kick off its health care house party campaign at member Marie Murray\u2019s DeSoto home.\n\nThe group aims to educate families, neighbors and colleagues about why Medicaid expansion is important and how to sign up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding health care decisions in family units are made by women,\u201d said Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, who joined about 15 women at the kickoff. \u201cPeople listen more to women. So empowering other women to talk to people they love should really help.\u201d\n\nMomsRising provides toolkits that include information on coverage options and enrollment to people willing to host gatherings in their communities.\n\nVeronica Moore, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regional outreach specialist, said that people are more willing to listen if the information is coming from a trusted source, like a faith community or neighborhood association.\n\nAlice Kinsey of Duncanville showed off her son\u2019s health care card to the group. Kinsey is a member of Texas Organizing Project, which champions Medicaid expansion.\n\nHer son got health coverage through the Affordable Care Act, but she said she\u2019s still trying to persuade her best friend, a stylist with pre-existing conditions, to do the same.\n\n\u201cI got her so far as to set up an account,\u201d Kinsey said. \u201cShe\u2019s not computer-savvy. It\u2019s a work in progress.\u201d\n\nSome said they had been met with resistance in previous attempts to educate their communities about health care.\n\nTara Mitchell of Burleson, a 39-year-old grad student who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, said other people she has spoken with \u201care not receptive to the idea. They\u2019re scared of change.\u201d\n\nShe said she has a friend who will not leave a bad marriage because she has a pre-existing condition and her husband has good insurance.\n\n\u201cI told her you don\u2019t have to do that anymore,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nAbout 1 in 4 people in Texas \u2014 or 6.4 million residents \u2014 is uninsured.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In DeSoto visit, vice president\u2019s wife urges them to host educational house parties in their communities.", "og": {"description": "In DeSoto visit, vice president\u2019s wife urges them to host educational house parties in their communities.", "title": "Jill Biden urges Dallas-area women to help others get health coverage", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/best-southwest/headlines/20140218-jill-biden-urges-dallas-area-women-to-help-others-get-health-coverage.ece", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/best-southwest/headlines/20140218-nm_18biden10.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NM_18biden10.jpg", "height": 400}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-02-19T05:57:53Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-02-19T05:47:41Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Jill Biden urges Dallas-area women to help others get health coverage\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/best-southwest/headlines/20140218-jill-biden-urges-dallas-area-women-to-help-others-get-health-coverage.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/best-southwest/headlines/20140218-nm_18biden10.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NM_18biden10.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1447985\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-19T05:47:41Z\", \"section\": \"Best Southwest Headlines\", \"author\": \"CLAIRE Z.
