The surprise announcement was a stunning setback for supporters of \u201cthe next step\u201d envisioned in President Obama\u2019s Affordable Health Care Act.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nShumlin announced at a press conference Wednesday that \u201cit\u2019s not the right time\u201d for single-payer.\n\nThe last-minute reversal by Shumlin is the first major political consequence of the \u201cGruberGate\u201d scandal surrounding recently publicized comments by Jonathan Gruber, the controversial MIT economics professor often called the \u201carchitect\u201d of Obamacare.\n\nIn July 2014, the state of Vermont signed a $280,000 contract with Gruber to conduct some of the financial modeling for Green Mountain Care, the state\u2019s proposed single-payer health care system authorized by the Vermont Legislature in 2011, conditional upon the presentation by the governor of a viable financial plan.\n\nBut investigative reporting by Breitbart News, Vermont Digger, and the Vermont Press Bureau unveiled details about Gruber\u2019s modeling activities and interaction with the Shumlin administration that cast doubt on the integrity of the process. In particular, these press reports raised questions about the lack of transparency and oversight in the state\u2019s contract with Gruber. One area of concern that emerged was irregularities in Gruber\u2019s billing practices.\n\nShumlin, who was first elected governor in 2010 on the promise that he would introduce a single-payer health care plan to the state, said that though it was the biggest political disappointment of his career he had concluded the state simply could not afford single-payer at this time.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that, as we completed the financing modeling in the last several days, it became clear that the risk of economic shock is too high at this time to offer a plan I can responsibly support for passage in the Legislature,\u201d Shumlin said.\n\nIn 2011, the Vermont Legislature passed Act 48, which authorized the establishment of the state\u2019s Green Mountain Care single-payer health care system, conditional upon the governor submitting a viable financial plan by 2013.\n\nBut the Shumlin administration missed the 2013 deadline. That tardiness, combined with the administration\u2019s lack of transparency about the process by which the plan was being developed, prompted Democratic State Representative Cynthia Browning to file a lawsuit designed to force the administration to release documents related to that process.\n\nThough the Shumlin administration\u2019s claims of executive privilege were backed up by a Superior Court judge\u2019s decision last week rejecting Browning\u2019s request, a potential appeal of that decision to the State Supreme Court was under consideration at the time Shumlin dropped his political bombshell.\n\nAs recently as December 3, all indications were that Governor Shumlin was still on target to introduce a single-payer system. On that date, the governor announced that the plan would be unveiled on December 29 or December 30.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Shumlin pulled the plug on the Green Mountain Care single-payer system, at least for 2015.\n\nShumlin\u2019s decision was a personal setback for Gruber, an avowed supporter of single-payer. In a celebratory email sent to Michael Costa, deputy director of health care reform for the state of Vermont after securing the contract with the state in July, 2014, Gruber said, \u201cI think we have the chance to really make history here.\u201d\n\nGruber has apparently made history, but not the sort he envisioned back in July.", "article_metadata": {"description": "First Casualty of GruberGate: Vermont Governor Abandons Single-Payer Health Care Plan", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "First Casualty of GruberGate: Vermont Governor Abandons Single-Payer Health Care Plan", "title": "First Casualty of GruberGate: Vermont Governor Abandons Single-Payer Health Care Plan - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/jonathan-gruber-testimony-afp.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/12/18/first-casualty-of-grubergate-vermont-governor-abandons-single-payer-health-care-plan/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "First Casualty of GruberGate: Vermont Governor Abandons Single-Payer Health Care Plan", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/jonathan-gruber-testimony-afp.jpg", "title": "First Casualty of GruberGate: Vermont Governor Abandons Single-Payer Health Care Plan - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, Economics, Obamacare,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2014-12-18T07:16:58-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERVermont\u2019s Democratic Governor Peter Shumlin is abandoning his efforts to implement the nation\u2019s first single-payer health care system in 2015.\nThe surprise announcement was a stunning setback for supporters of \u201cthe next step\u201d envisioned in President Obama\u2019s Affordable Health Care Act.\nIn 2011, the Vermont Legislature passed Act 48, which authorized the establishment of the state\u2019s Green Mountain Care single-payer health care system, conditional upon the governor submitting a viable financial plan by 2013.\nAs recently as December 3, all indications were that Governor Shumlin was still on target to introduce a single-payer system.\nBut on Wednesday, Shumlin pulled the plug on the Green Mountain Care single-payer system, at least for 2015."}
