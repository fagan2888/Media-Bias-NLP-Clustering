Clapper called the stolen data \u201ca gold mine for a foreign intelligence service, whoever it was,\u201d during an interview Tuesday on \u201cAndrea Mitchell Reports.\u201d\n\nOfficials have said privately they believe China is behind the attack. But they have also indicated the White House will withhold from publicly blaming the Asian superpower over concerns about exposing classified intelligence.\n\nMany on Capitol Hill have pushed back against the White House\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThis refusal is a strategic mistake, and the fact that we\u2019re making it may indicate things are even worse than we\u2019ve been led to believe,\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) wrote in a Monday op-ed in USA Today.\n\nOn Tuesday, Clapper seemed to at least partly agree with the stance, potentially breaking with the administration line.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s right,\u201d he said when asked if not responding to the OPM hack would invite digital adversaries to continue targeting government networks.\n\nWithout established deterrents, foreign governments and cyber crime rings have gotten \u201cbolder and bolder\u201d with their attacks on the U.S., he said.\n\n\u201cAnd so I think the next \u2026 event or the next type of attack will involve deletion or manipulation of data as opposed to perhaps stealing it or denying service,\u201d Clapper continued. \u201cI think we'll see a progression and expansion of that envelope until such times as we create both the substance and the psychology of deterrents.\n\n\u201cAnd today we don't have that,\u201d he added.\n\nClapper previously deviated slightly from the party line when he called China the \u201cleading suspect\u201d in the OPM hacks. The remarks are the clearest public indication so far that the Obama administration is convinced China is responsible for the digital assault.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Spy chief James Clapper said the U.S. has not created \"deterrents\" to stop data breaches.", "description": "Spy chief James Clapper said the U.S. has not created \"deterrents\" to stop data breaches.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Spy chief James Clapper said the U.S. has not created \"deterrents\" to stop data breaches.", "title": "Intel chief: Lack of OPM response makes hackers 'bolder and bolder'", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/249448-intel-chief-lack-of-opm-response-makes-hackers-bolder-and-bolder", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/249448-intel-chief-lack-of-opm-response-makes-hackers-bolder-and-bolder", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-28T13:23-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-28T13:23:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/249448-intel-chief-lack-of-opm-response-makes-hackers-bolder-and-bolder", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Spy chief James Clapper said the U.S. has not created \"deterrents\" to stop data breaches.", "card": "summary", "title": "Intel chief: Lack of OPM response makes hackers 'bolder and bolder'"}, "dcterms.title": "Intel chief: Lack of OPM response makes hackers 'bolder and bolder'"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe128f\"", "article_summary": "Without established deterrents, foreign governments and cyber crime rings have gotten \u201cbolder and bolder\u201d with their attacks on the U.S., he said.\nClapper previously deviated slightly from the party line when he called China the \u201cleading suspect\u201d in the OPM hacks.\nThe remarks are the clearest public indication so far that the Obama administration is convinced China is responsible for the digital assault.\nBut they have also indicated the White House will withhold from publicly blaming the Asian superpower over concerns about exposing classified intelligence.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s right,\u201d he said when asked if not responding to the OPM hack would invite digital adversaries to continue targeting government networks."}
