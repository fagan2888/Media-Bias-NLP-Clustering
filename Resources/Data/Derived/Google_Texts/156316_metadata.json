Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, said in a formal statement earlier this month.\n\n\u201cBy moving to a $15 statewide minimum wage and enacting the strongest paid family leave policy in the nation, New York is showing the way forward on economic justice,\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a formal statement April 4.\n\nRaising the minimum wage is not new for either state. Both states already raised their minimum wages once in the last few months. New York bumped its minimum wage from $8.75 to $9 in December 2015, and California increased its minimum wage from $9 to $10 at the beginning of the year.\n\nIn the United States, only Washington, D.C.\u2019s minimum wage is currently higher at $10.50.\n\nBut now the states plan to raise their wages again. This time, the Empire State plans to implement a $15 pay rate between 2018 and 2021, and the Golden State plans to implement the same rate by 2022. Including inflation, which means workers in 2022 will effectively be paid $13.50 in today\u2019s dollars, the minimum wage will be higher than any other existing wage in the world.\n\nJames Sherk, a research fellow in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal in an email that when California\u2019s $15 minimum wage is adjusted for inflation and state-specific living expenses, California\u2019s minimum wage is still higher than everyone else, totalling $12.03 per hour. New York\u2019s wage totals $11.74 per hour when adjusted for inflation and state-specific living expenses, according to Sherk. He added that $11.74 is a statewide average.\n\nToday, Luxembourg and Australia have the highest minimum wages, topping out at $11.46 and $11.15 per hour respectively, according to the WSI Institute of Economic and Social Research\u2019s 2016 Minimum Wage Database.\n\nCalifornia and New York are even scheduled to top the minimum wage set by the Socialist Party in France, which presently ranks third highest in the world at $11.11, according to the German-based non-profit.\n\nSherk added that California\u2019s minimum wage increase would also penalize teenagers and youths more than Luxembourg, Australia, and France, because unlike those countries, California does not have a lower minimum wage for younger workers.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is proposing a historically unprecedented minimum wage increase. No country in the developed world has raised their minimum wage that high,\u201d Sherk said.\n\n\u201cEven left-leaning European governments that embrace activist government labor market regulation understand raising the minimum wage that high would hurt vulnerable workers,\u201d he added.\n\nThe WSI minimum wage report compares the minimum wages in 37 European and select other countries by comparing the purchasing power of those wages against the purchasing power of minimum wages in the United States.\n\nSherk said that comparing purchasing power is important because it accounts for living costs that affect the value of wages abroad.\n\n\u201cExchange rate conversions show what it would cost American tourists to purchase goods and services in a foreign country, but that does not necessarily reflect the living costs faced by workers who get paid in the local currency\u2014not American dollars,\u201d Sherk said, adding:\n\n\u201cPurchasing power parity comparisons account for these differences in living costs. Workers with the same [purchasing power parity] adjusted wages can afford the same goods and services in their own countries.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today, Luxembourg and Australia have the highest minimum wages, topping out at $11.46 and $11.15 per hour respectively.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Today, Luxembourg and Australia have the highest minimum wages, topping out at $11.46 and $11.15 per hour respectively.", "title": "$15 Minimum Wages Would Be the Highest in the World", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160331_CAMinWage_Mork.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1TnpCSA"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Today, Luxembourg and Australia have the highest minimum wages, topping out at $11.46 and $11.15 per hour respectively.", "title": "$15 Minimum Wages Would Be the Highest in the World", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160331_CAMinWage_Mork.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "labor", "published_time": "2016-04-22T14:36:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "California, New York, $15, Minimum Wage, James Sherk, highest, world wages, comparison"}, "article_summary": "The WSI minimum wage report compares the minimum wages in 37 European and select other countries by comparing the purchasing power of those wages against the purchasing power of minimum wages in the United States.\nToday, Luxembourg and Australia have the highest minimum wages, topping out at $11.46 and $11.15 per hour respectively, according to the WSI Institute of Economic and Social Research\u2019s 2016 Minimum Wage Database.\nNew York bumped its minimum wage from $8.75 to $9 in December 2015, and California increased its minimum wage from $9 to $10 at the beginning of the year.\nLeaders in New York and California signed legislation earlier this month that will raise the states\u2019 minimum wages to $15 an hour, a rate higher than any other state\u2019s in the nation, and every other nation in the world.\nNo country in the developed world has raised their minimum wage that high,\u201d Sherk said."}
