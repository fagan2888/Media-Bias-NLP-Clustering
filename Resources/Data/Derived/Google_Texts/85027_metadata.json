This is what he\u2019s heralding in this achievement, that the government is giving opportunity for people to decide if they want to work. This is the liberals\u2019 ideal of the opportunity society,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cOf course, in a free society, you can decide if you want to work, but what Obamacare does, and so the essence of liberalism, is you can choose not to work, and the people who do work end up subsidizing you.\u201d\n\nIn other words, he explained, the people who work \u201chave to send their money to the government\u201d so they can redistribute it to the people who choose, \u201cin this ideal new opportunity society,\u201d not to work.\n\nKrauthammer also echoed the words of CBO director Douglas Elmendorf, who admitted Obamacare creates a disincentive for people to work.\n\n\u201cNow, you can argue it\u2019s an inevitable side effect kind of benefit of this sort, but that\u2019s not the argument the administration is making,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is a benefit, a wonderful thing that we\u2019re giving people the opportunity not to work and to live off the sweat and the work of other people. Is that the American way? That sounds odd to me.\u201d\n\nWatch the segment here:\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\n(H/T: Fox Nation)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 41, "twitter": {"description": "Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer made the bold proclamation on Wednesday that the comments White House press secretary Jay Carney made in response to the recently-released CBO report on Obamacare will be \u201cemblazoned on the tombstone of liberalism.\u201d  Here\u2019s the statement made by Carney that he is referring to:...", "title": "The Comment Made by Jay Carney That Charles Krauthammer Says Will Be \u2018Emblazoned on the Tombstone of Liberalism\u2019", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/06/the-comment-made-by-jay-carney-that-charles-krauthammer-says-will-be-emblazoned-on-the-tombstone-of-liberalism/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/charles-krauthammer-wants-to-kill-the-house-and-senate-healthcare-reform-bills1.jpg", "creator": "@jason_howerton", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "charles, krauthammer, says, obamacare, comment, will, emblazoned, tombstone, liberalism", "sailthru.tags": "charles-krauthammer, jay-carney, media, obamacare, politics, us, video, author-jason-howerton, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 12371, "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "categories": "charles-krauthammer,jay-carney,obamacare,video,media,politics,us", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 253, "description": "Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer made the bold proclamation on Wednesday that the comments White House press secretary Jay Carney made in response to the recently-released CBO report on Obamacare will be \u201cemblazoned on the tombstone of liberalism.\u201d  Here\u2019s the statement made by Carney that he is referring to:...", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/758131", "linkedin-count": 7, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer made the bold proclamation on Wednesday that the comments White House press secretary Jay Carney made in response to the recently-released CBO report on Obamacare will be \u201cemblazoned on the tombstone of liberalism.\u201d  Here\u2019s the statement made by Carney that he is referring to:...", "title": "The Comment Made by Jay Carney That Charles Krauthammer Says Will Be \u2018Emblazoned on the Tombstone of Liberalism\u2019", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/06/the-comment-made-by-jay-carney-that-charles-krauthammer-says-will-be-emblazoned-on-the-tombstone-of-liberalism/", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/charles-krauthammer-wants-to-kill-the-house-and-senate-healthcare-reform-bills1.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 226}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-02-06T21:20:32+00:00", "twitter-count": 689}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5593\"", "article_summary": "This is the liberals\u2019 ideal of the opportunity society,\u201d Krauthammer said.\nThis is what he\u2019s heralding in this achievement, that the government is giving opportunity for people to decide if they want to work.\nKrauthammer also echoed the words of CBO director Douglas Elmendorf, who admitted Obamacare creates a disincentive for people to work.\n\u201cThis is a benefit, a wonderful thing that we\u2019re giving people the opportunity not to work and to live off the sweat and the work of other people.\nThat sounds odd to me.\u201dWatch the segment here:Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com(H/T: Fox Nation)"}
