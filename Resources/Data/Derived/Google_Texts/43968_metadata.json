That means it has to follow a different set of rules.\n\n\u201cThe exemption they were operating under was as a nonprofit. And with their corporate restructure, they were no longer deemed a nonprofit. Therefore, the exemption no longer applied to them,\u201d Hester says.\n\nThe decision will not affect Airlift Northwest\u2019s ability to provide medical evacuation flights in the state.\n\nIt and other air ambulance services take seriously ill or injured patients to hospitals with levels of care not locally available. Medevacs can cost $100,000 or more, depending on the distance and route.\n\nAirlift Northwest began more than 30 years ago as part of the University of Washington\u2019s medical system, which also includes hospitals and clinics. It operated for a while as a separate nonprofit group. But it moved back to the university a few years ago.\n\nExecutive Director Chris Martin says Airlift Northwest remains a nonprofit agency under Washington state rules. So she\u2019s disappointed Alaska officials decided it isn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWe have a business license with the state of Alaska. We have our Juneau base in the state of Alaska. Nothing has changed and this letter to us came out of the blue,\u201d she says.\n\nMartin says the AirCare program has more than 1,600 Alaska members.\n\nThey\u2019ve all been sent a letter saying coverage will end when their year-long memberships run out. The program also will not enroll any new Alaska members.\n\nThe state insurance division\u2019s Hester says the issue is not at all related to the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare.\n\nHe says Airlift Northwest voluntarily complied with the order. And he says it could change its Alaska program and resume business.\n\n\u201cIf they decide to become compliant with Alaska insurance statutes, and offer an approved insurance product, then they would be able to offer the membership program,\u201d Hester says.\n\nAirlift Northwest\u2019s Martin says it started the AirCare program to fill a need, not to make money.\n\nSo she says that\u2019s not going to happen.\n\n\u201cYou know, we are part of the University of Washington and our mission is our medical transports, not insurance. Nor is the university\u2019s,\u201d Martin says.\n\nMost of its Alaska business is in Southeast, but it also serves Anchorage and other parts of the state.\n\nIts main competitor, Utah-based GuardianFlight, does not have a similar membership program.\n\nFairbanks-based Apollo Medi Trans offers medevac insurance in Alaska. The state shut it down for part of this year after it failed to renew its license. State officials say it\u2019s not affected by this decision.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "MasterSlider 2.12.2 - Responsive Touch Image Slider", "og": {"site_name": "KRBD", "description": "The state has ordered a Seattle-based medevac insurance program to end coverage in Alaska.", "title": "State tells medevac payment program to drop Alaskans", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://krbd-org.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/8-6-13-An-Airlift-Northwest-Lear-Jet-waits-for-a-medevac-call-at-Juneaus-airport.-300x210.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-27T10:41:12-09:00", "url": "http://www.krbd.org/2013/11/26/state-tells-medevac-payment-program-to-drop-alaskans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://krbd-org.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/8-6-13-An-Airlift-Northwest-Lear-Jet-waits-for-a-medevac-call-at-Juneaus-airport.-300x210.jpg", "site": "@KRBDRADIO", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The state has ordered a Seattle-based medevac insurance program to end coverage in Alaska."}, "fb": {"admins": "krbdstaff"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/KRBD-FM-Rainbird-Community-Radio/158267229179", "section": "Syndicated", "published_time": "2013-11-26T17:18:27-09:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-27T10:41:12-09:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc65\"", "article_summary": "The state has ordered a Seattle-based medevac insurance program to end coverage in Alaska.\nThe state insurance division\u2019s Hester says the issue is not at all related to the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare.\nAnd he says it could change its Alaska program and resume business.\n\u201cIf they decide to become compliant with Alaska insurance statutes, and offer an approved insurance product, then they would be able to offer the membership program,\u201d Hester says.\nAirlift Northwest\u2019s AirCare program fills the gap between air ambulance charges and what health insurance pays."}
