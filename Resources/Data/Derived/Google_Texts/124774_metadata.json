The best of the best candidates, in other words. Desperate teams simply can\u2019t wait until early February to fill such an important position.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how much a priority this would be for the league because you\u2019re talking about a small percentage of coaches who are affected,\u201d Del Rio said Thursday after his weekly news conference. \u201cBut you are taking about an arrangement where in theory, anyway, some of the best people aren\u2019t available. I think it is something that probably needs to be discussed. I\u2019m just not the guy to lead the discussion.\u201d\n\nNo wonder Bill Belichick wins the AFC East every year. Every two or three years, he keeps coaching against new coaches.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills are looking for their seventh coach in the 17 years since Marv Levy retired. Or one every 2.4 years. The Miami Dolphins have had four coaches in the 10 years since Dave Wannstedt was fired. Or one every 2.5 years.\n\nEven with Rex Ryan hanging in there for a relatively lengthy six-season stay with the New York Jets, Joe Namath\u2019s former team is looking for its 10th head coach in 25 years, or one every 2.5 years.\n\nBelichick ain\u2019t great. He\u2019s just stable.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t with interviewing good men. The NFL did tweak the process so that all hot candidates get interviewed. Gase sat down with four teams last week. Del Rio met with Raiders owner Mark Davis.\n\nThe problem is, the best candidates can\u2019t be hired until their teams are finished with the playoffs. That often means they don\u2019t get hired.\n\nMike McCoy winces at this, but the heartbreaking truth is that his personal coaching career got a huge break when the Broncos were stunned by the Baltimore Ravens in a second-round playoff game two years ago. Had the Broncos won that game, and won the following week against Belichick and the New England Patriots in the AFC championship game, McCoy might still be the Broncos\u2019 offensive coordinator. Instead, the upset allowed the San Diego Chargers to fly into Centennial Airport the Tuesday after Denver lost to the Ravens and pick up their new head coach.\n\nThere are two better options. One, allow teams to hire the man they want soon after the season (so long as they\u2019re in compliance with the Rooney Rule, of course) even if that man is still coaching a playoff team.\n\n\u201cWill never happen,\u201d said Broncos coach John Fox. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to the owners of the playoff teams.\u201d\n\nNo doubt, it would be awkward in the upstairs offices at Dove Valley if, say, the Raiders hired Del Rio on Monday while the San Francisco 49ers held a major news conference to introduce Gase \u2014 only to have Del Rio and Gase return Tuesday to game plan for Denver\u2019s playoff game Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t hurt the Patriots in 2004 when, with three games remaining in the regular season, offensive coordinator Charlie Weis was announced as Notre Dame\u2019s head coach. Weis worked the next eight weeks for both teams, yet the Patriots won the Super Bowl anyway.\n\nThe other option is to hold off all head coaching interviews and hirings until the day after the Super Bowl. Give the coaches a free agency period that opens the first Monday in February just like the players have in mid-March.\n\nThis may propagate rampant tampering, but even if there is no perfect system, the current arrangement means any team looking to hire a head coach this week more often than not will be looking to hire another head coach in 2.5 years.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Klis: NFL playoffs hurt head coach hirings", "title": "Klis: NFL playoffs hurt head coach hirings", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/10/klis-nfl-playoffs-hurt-head-coach-hirings/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150110_031041_jack-del-rio.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150110_031041_jack-del-rio.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-10T14:55:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T07:26:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4167\"", "article_summary": "The other option is to hold off all head coaching interviews and hirings until the day after the Super Bowl.\nEasy as it is to picture this image, it may never become anything more than an illusion because of the NFL\u2019s head coach- hiring arrangement.\nBut it didn\u2019t hurt the Patriots in 2004 when, with three games remaining in the regular season, offensive coordinator Charlie Weis was announced as Notre Dame\u2019s head coach.\nInstead, the upset allowed the San Diego Chargers to fly into Centennial Airport the Tuesday after Denver lost to the Ravens and pick up their new head coach.\nThis may propagate rampant tampering, but even if there is no perfect system, the current arrangement means any team looking to hire a head coach this week more often than not will be looking to hire another head coach in 2.5 years."}
