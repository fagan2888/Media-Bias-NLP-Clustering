That and other steps taken by Mexican policymakers have helped stabilize the peso, and there had been less speculation against it since, Carstens said.\n\nTrading at around 17.46 per dollar on Tuesday afternoon, the peso is noticeably stronger than when it hit a record low of nearly 19.45 per dollar on Feb. 11. However, it is still down by more than 25 percent against the dollar in the past 18 months.\n\nThe peso's drop has yet to spur a significant jump in inflation, which stood at 2.6 percent in the year through March.\n\nThe peso has been hit by a decline in crude prices and Carstens said federal support for Mexico's state oil giant Pemex could help the currency follow recent oil market gains.\n\nThe governor also said the output gap in Latin America's No. 2 economy should remain negative this year.\n\n\"To the extent that the gap closes, we could have more inflationary pressure, which could prompt the bank to raise interest rates, especially to consolidate convergence in inflation towards the 3 percent rate,\" Carstens said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Adriana Barrera; Editing by Bill Trott)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S.", "title": "Mexico cenbank slams Trump remittance plan as rights violation", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/12/Mexico-cenbank-slams-Trump-remittance-plan-rights-violation", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mexico-economy-carstens_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/12/Mexico-cenbank-slams-Trump-remittance-plan-rights-violation", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mexico-economy-carstens_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"So it would be a serious violation of the property rights of our fellow citizens abroad and this measure would be completely unjust.\"\nMexican Central Bank Governor Agustin Carstens, speaking in Mexico's Congress, dismissed the idea.\nThe U.S. remittances are worth roughly $25 billion per year, or close to 2 percent of Mexican gross domestic product.\nThe peso fell sharply against the dollar from late 2014 through early February, when the central bank carried out a surprise rate hike.\nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump's proposal to force Mexico to pay for a border wall by threatening to block remittances from illegal immigrants would be a major violation of Mexicans' rights, Mexico's central bank governor said on Tuesday."}
