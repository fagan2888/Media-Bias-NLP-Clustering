Its officials have promulgated thousands upon thousands of pages of new regulations since Jan. 20, 2009, from ObamaCare rules to how you shower.\n\nIn March, we learned Obama\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency is designing new shower heads capable of wirelessly reporting your shower water usage to a central database. Because although Americans pay for their water, they waste too much of it, in the opinion of Washington bureaucrats.\n\nNow, about those obnoxious holiday lights. First of all, they use electricity. Here\u2019s how the Safety Commission explained its mission this week in the Federal Register:\n\n\u201cThe Consumer Product Safety Commission is issuing a final rule to specify that seasonal and decorative lighting products that do not contain any one of three readily observable characteristics (minimum wire size, sufficient strain relief or overcurrent protection), as addressed in a voluntary standard, are deemed a substantial product hazard under the Consumer Product Safety Act.\u201d\n\nGot that?\n\nHere\u2019s the problem, according to the \u201cfinal rule,\u201d in something more closely resembling English:\n\n\u201cA lighting string provided with decorative covers over the lamps is a decorative outfit. If not constructed properly, lighting powered by 120 volts can be damaged easily and can pose a risk of electrical shock or fire.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true. But then damaged wiring of any kind can be a fire hazard, right? Hair dryers. Radios. Televisions. And watch out of those hot, hot plates.\n\nThe commission warns that at least 258 deaths have been associated with holiday lights. Which sounds pretty serious. Until you realize the commission\u2019s fatality figures came over a span of 33 years, from 1980 to 2013. That works out to less than one death a year out of a U.S. population now approaching 320 million.\n\nAs the Washington Free Beacon acidly pointed out, more people than that die from alcohol poisoning alone just in California every single year.\n\nStill, you can never be too safe when it comes to writing regulations, right?\n\nOh, there\u2019s one more thing. The commission calls its new Christmas light regulations a \u201cvoluntary standard,\u201d if by \u201cvoluntary\u201d you mean you will face civil and \u201cpossibly criminal penalties\u201d for not reporting products that fail to meet the new regulation.\n\nAndrew Malcolm is IBD\u2019s national politics columnist.
