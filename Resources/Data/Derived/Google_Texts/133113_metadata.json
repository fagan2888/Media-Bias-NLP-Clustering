According to a recent Pew Research poll, about 35 percent of Millennials lean towards the Republican Party. The conservatives are undeniably winning over a significant number of the Democrats\u2019 staple 18 to 29 year-old voting block.\n\nThe distribution along the political spectrum of young conservatives is very different than that of Republicans as a whole, according to the Pew study. Roughly half (51 percent) of young conservatives say they have a \u201cmix\u201d of liberal and conservative political stances.\n\nOnly 31 percent of young conservatives have mostly \u201cright-of-center\u201d views; 18 percent actually have \u201cmostly liberal\u201d views. Young conservatives are generally skeptical of federal welfare programs, but are divided on whether stricter environmental regulations are worth their cost.\n\nOn the other hand, the Republican Party as a whole is made up of 53 percent voters who are \u201cconsistently conservative.\u201d There is a stark disparity in the conservatism of young Republicans and their older counterparts.\n\nSocial issues seem to be the place where young conservatives differ most from the older generations in the Republican Party.\n\nOver 60 percent of young Republicans hold that \u201chomosexuality should be accepted by society rather than discouraged\u201d \u2014 older Republicans are about split even.\n\nThe majority of young conservatives agree that, in general, \u201cimmigrants strengthen our country.\u201d The majority of older conservatives hold that \u201cimmigrants are a burden on our country by taking our jobs, housing and healthcare.\u201d\n\nIf Millennials tend to differ from the Republican Party as a whole, what are the issues that make the conservative ideology appealing to them?\n\nThe draw to the Republican Party among young voters seems to be fiscal conservatism.\n\nCorey Pray (CAS \u201917) is the president of Boston University\u2019s College Republicans. Pray described his attraction because of the Republican Party\u2019s answer to the rising costs of education: \u201cMost young people don\u2019t know that the federal government sets the rate for student loan payments \u2026 What if instead we phased out government-provided loans and allowed private transactions between lending institutions and students?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis would result in competition, resulting in lower rates and better services,\u201d Pray explained.\n\nThe rising costs of higher education are an issue that all young people are concerned with. Young conservatives\u2019 apparent disdain for the federal loan program is in line with their overall distrust of the federal government. Instead, they hold that market competition could resolve the rising cost of education.\n\nMichael Holtz (CAS \u201918), another member of BU College Republicans, echoed these sentiments. \u201cI definitely see [Republicans] as more focused on economic issues. We\u2019re going into a job market that doesn\u2019t have many jobs, and we have all this student loan debt, so it\u2019s really worrisome.\u201d\n\n\u201cI listen to what Republicans have to say about making college easier and open[ing] up markets and to get more jobs flowing,\u201d continued Holtz. \u201cI definitely agree more with what they have to say than Democrats.\u201d\n\nThe College Republicans\u2019 comments are indicative of the common Millennial concerns about job prospects and the cost of higher education. For young conservatives, a smaller federal government is the solution. Republicans want a neo-liberal economic model; they want government out and believe the private sector will fill the void.\n\nRight-leaning Millennials generally view government as a threat to individual liberty and are opposed to most government programs; roughly 60 percent of young conservatives agree that \u201cgovernment is almost always wasteful and inefficient.\u201d\n\nOn his opinion of the Republican Party\u2019s overall values, Pray noted \u201cevery person, no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you started out, has a right to fulfill their potential and to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that these rights cannot be taken away or interfered with by government. Big government should not create one-size-fits-all solutions for everyone. Individuals and communities know what is best for themselves and should be able to make certain decisions without the federal government being involved.\u201d\n\nYoung conservatives consider the size of the federal government to be a primary concern. While in many areas they break from older Republicans\u2019 positions, they generally want a smaller government and a more market-driven economy.\n\nLike all young people, Millennial Republicans are concerned with forward-looking issues such as employment prospects and sky-rocketing university costs. Despite our idea of Republicans as old men with cowboy hats who spit at people who say \u201cObamacare,\u201d there are young conservatives out there who don\u2019t wear cowboy hats; rather, they speak cogently and passionately about political engagement, and hold that a smaller federal government is the right direction for the country.\n\nFeature Photo: Wikimedia Commons", "article_metadata": {"description": "The words \"Millennial\" and \"Republican\" look like they belong in a BuzzFeed article titled \u201c10 Words You Never See Together.\u201d However, there are some", "generator": "WordPress 4.0.11", "og": {"site_name": "The Quad", "description": "The words \u201cMillennial\u201d and \u201cRepublican\u201d look like they belong in a BuzzFeed article titled \u201c10 Words You Never See Together.\u201d However, there are some Millennials out there who are conservatives.
