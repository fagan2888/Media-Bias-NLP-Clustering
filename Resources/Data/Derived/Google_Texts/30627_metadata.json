The Eagles steamrolled their way to the regional championship, getting 12 of their 13 wrestlers qualified for state, including eight regional champions.\n\nTVHS won the team trophy going away with 302 points, 91 more that second-place Pueblo West.\n\n\"I told them this was going to be a business trip. We wanted to get down there, get the job done and get out,\" coach Dave Juergensen said. \"That's pretty much how they handled it in their matches. They had a lot of pins where they just got after it and were very aggressive and just ended their matches quick and got off the mat.\"\n\nFour Eagles won their championship by pin \u2014 Morgan Fogg, Vlad Kazakov, Ben Hewson and Mike Berg \u2014 while Zach Kennison, Collin Williams, Parker Simington and David Eusea also won their weight class. Eusea's championship win came against top-seeded Benjamin Self of Air Academy.\n\n\"They wrestled really well this weekend, so I think we're peaking at the right time,\" Juergensen said. \"We just got the ball rolling, and the rest just fed off each other. Each match got the next wrestler excited to do their job. I think once we got momentum going, we kept it.\"\n\n3A Region 1\n\nEATON \u2014 Berthoud qualified six wrestlers for next weekend's state tournament, including titles for Jimmy Fate (145) and Chad Ellis (170).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFate beat Joseph Prieto of Holy Family by a 15-8 major decision, while Ellis pinned University's Justin Anderson in 2:58 at 170. Kyler Bailey was second at 126, Matt Bailey (120) and Devon Vise (152) third and Colin Leypoldt placed fourth at 106 as the Spartans finished third in the team race.\n\n\"I'm happy it's six. We lost a close one at 160's (Ben Poirier) in overtime that would have given us seven,\" BHS coach Scott Pickert said. \"That's the hard thing about regionals, you always want that one that's so close.\n\n\"Kyler wrestled really well today, and Jimmy and Chad were the norm; Chad was really smooth. Colin had a good tournament, and Devon stepped up pretty good today.\"\n\n5A Region 3\n\nWESTMINSTER \u2014 Loveland advanced three to the upcoming state tournament, finishing with 82 team points at regionals. The Indians had one champion crowned, Charles Dunkelman at 220.\n\nDunkelman won his first two matches of the tourney by fall, then won a 5-3 decision over Daniel Chavez of Pomona in the championship match. Loveland had two others take fourth, Matthew Dunkelman at 182 and Zach Swarthwout at 195.\n\n\"That was a big-time win against the Pomona kid,\" LHS coach Dave Dunkelman said. \"With the program Pomona has, that's a great win for Charles. He wrestled smart, and that was the thing. And it was a long time between matches, which we thought would hurt him, but it didn't.\"\n\n4A Region 1\n\nAt Palmer Ridge HS\n\nTeam scores \u2014 1.
