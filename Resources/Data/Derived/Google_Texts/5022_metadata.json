(Photo : Reuters)\n\n0 Subscribe to Newsletter!\n\nWhat's one difference between you and the president of the United States of America?\n\nYou're free to buy an Apple iPhone, and President Barack Obama is not.\n\nDuring a meeting to promote the Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as \"Obamacare,\" President Obama revealed he's not allowed to own an iPhone due to security concerns.\n\nFollow the Latest Tech News on Twitter: @LatinosPostTech\n\nObama, however, is able to keep his BlackBerry smartphone, but it wasn't easy for him to have it. According to Obama, he figuratively fought against Secret Service to keep his BlackBerry, a brand of smartphone still popular in Washington D.C. despite its fall in the overall market share.\n\nBlackBerry is credited for its strong security encryption; a special version of the smartphone was created for the president.\n\nReasons for Obama's battle to maintain a smartphone include concerns of the device being hacked, revealing his locations and stored data.\n\nMeanwhile, Obama's daughters are iPhone owners. It is unknown if special measures were taken to protect Malia and Sasha Obama's smartphones.\n\nObama's presence in technology has been noted as he's been spotted using his smartphone in various images. In comparison to previous presidents, President George W. Bush stopped using e-mails in 2001 while President Bill Clinton sent two e-mails during his two terms as commander in chief.\n\n__\n\nFor the latest updates, follow Latinos Post's Michael Oleaga on Twitter: @EditorMikeO\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n- Apple Inc.
