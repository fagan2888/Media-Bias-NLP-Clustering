NEW YORK (AP) — Charles Martin won the vacant IBF world heavyweight championship in an underwhelming bout against injured Vyacheslav Glazkov on Saturday night at the Barclays Center.

Martin (23-0-1) was crowned the champ once the fight was stopped at 1:50 the third round because Glazkov fell twice and hurt his right knee.

Glazkov, from the Ukraine, suffered a torn ACL and the fight was stopped as the pro-Polish crowd booed the finish.

The IBF stripped Tyson Fury of the belt when he agreed to an immediate rematch against Wladimir Klitschko instead of defending it against Glazkov, the organization’s mandatory challenger.

Martin, a rare left-handed heavyweight champion, withdrew from a scheduled fight last month once he had an unexpected shot at the title.

Deontay Wilder (35-0) defends the WBC version of the title against Artur Szpilka (20-1) in the main event.
