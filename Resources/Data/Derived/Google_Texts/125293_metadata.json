N\u00f6then, director of the Institute of Human Genetics of the University of Bonn Hospital, said in a statement. \"Many different genes are evidently involved and these genes work together with environmental factors in a complex way.\"\n\nIn searching for the origin of bipolar disorder, N\u00f6then and his colleagues last year recorded 2.3 million genetic regions within materials from participants recruited from the study, including healthy people serving as a control. Biostatistical analysis then revealed five genetic regions associated with a higher risk of developing the disorder, including the newly discovered \u201cADCY2\u201d gene on chromosome five as well as the \u201cMIR2113-POU3F2\u201d region on chromosome six.\n\nThough the other three regions had previously been described by science, the analysis further strengthened the association. \"These gene regions were, however, statistically better confirmed in our current investigation,\u201d N\u00f6then said. \u201cThe connection with bipolar disorder has now become even clearer.\u201d\n\nMost interesting to the researchers, however, was the enzymatic activity of ADCY2. \"This fits very well with observations that the signal transfer in certain regions of the brain is impaired in patients with bipolar disorder,\" N\u00f6then said. \"Only when we know the biological foundations of this disease can be also identify starting points for new therapies.\u201d\n\nKnown also as bipolar affective disorder, the illness is characterized by periods of mania \u2014 elevated or agitated mood \u2014 alternating with severe bouts of depression. As many as one to three percent of people around the world may suffer from the disorder, striking men and women equally across racial and ethnic lines. Today\u2019s treatments for the often debilitating illness involve psychotherapy and mood-stabilizing medication, such as lithium and benzodiazepines \u2014 with no cure in sight.\n\nThough many people with bipolar disorder effectively manage the condition, patients often suffer a volatile emotional life with sudden shifts in mood, and manic periods bringing delusions of grandeur, increased motivation, and a decreased need for sleep. Joyful heights of creativity are followed by crashes into the leviathan of despair.\n\nIn this investigation, N\u00f6then and colleagues in Mannheim and in Bonn analyzed genetic data from more than 2,2000 patients with bipolar disorder and another 5,000 health recruits for comparison. Co-investigator Marcella Rietschel, of the Central Institute of Mental Health, likened the study to looking for a needle in a haystack, but says a breakthrough would occur with a big enough sampling size. \"The investigation of the genetic foundations of bipolar disorder on this scale is unique worldwide to date,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bipolar gene, bipolar genes, new bipolar gene discovered, genetic origin bipolar, genetics and bipolar disorder, test for bipolar", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "With a sufficiently massive data sampling, researchers in Germany hope to find the genetic origins of bipolar disorder.", "title": "New Bipolar Gene Discovered", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/scientists-locate-bipolar-disorder-gene-and-gene-regions-bringing-total-count-5-270966", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/11/new-bipolar-gene-discovered.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With a sufficiently massive data sampling, researchers in Germany hope to find the genetic origins of bipolar disorder.", "title": "New Bipolar Gene Discovered", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/scientists-locate-bipolar-disorder-gene-and-gene-regions-bringing-total-count-5-270966", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/11/new-bipolar-gene-discovered.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/11/new-bipolar-gene-discovered.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-03-11T15:46:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-11T15:46:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "With a sufficiently massive data sampling, researchers in Germany hope to find the genetic origins of bipolar disorder."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4226\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe connection with bipolar disorder has now become even clearer.\u201dMost interesting to the researchers, however, was the enzymatic activity of ADCY2.\n\"The investigation of the genetic foundations of bipolar disorder on this scale is unique worldwide to date,\" she said.\n\"These gene regions were, however, statistically better confirmed in our current investigation,\u201d N\u00f6then said.\n\"This fits very well with observations that the signal transfer in certain regions of the brain is impaired in patients with bipolar disorder,\" N\u00f6then said.\nIn searching for the origin of bipolar disorder, N\u00f6then and his colleagues last year recorded 2.3 million genetic regions within materials from participants recruited from the study, including healthy people serving as a control."}
