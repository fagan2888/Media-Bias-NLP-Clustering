Being in nature is has long been associated with being mindful and meditative, but only recently has the scientific community researched the mental health benefits of outdoor immersion.\n\nA recent study conducted by researchers from the University of Essex and published by the mental health organization Mind found that taking a walk in nature reduced depression scores in 71 percent of participants. Researchers compared the effect with a control group who also took walk, but in a shopping centre. Only 45 percent of the shopping center walkers had reduced depression scores, while 22 percent of them actually felt more depressed.\n\n\u201cOur research shows people commissioning mental health services and social care that a holistic treatment like ecotherapy delivers not only health benefits, but wider social benefits and cost savings that medication could not,\u201d Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, said. Mind has funded several \u201cEcominds\u201d projects that bring people at risk of developing mental health problems to become involved in green activities like gardening or environmental conservation work. The organization has found that 69 percent of people had an increased sense of well-being after participating.\n\nNature Deficit Disorder\n\nOther studies have shown that reconnecting with green can help lift depression, improve energy, and boost overall well-being and mental health. As American author Richard Louv says in his book The Nature Principle, people living in high-tech societies often suffer from what he calls \"nature deficit disorder.\"\n\nA 2006 study investigated the benefits of contact with nature and found that it could help prevent mental health disorders. Researchers suggest that contact with nature could be applied in early intervention as well as treatment, along with physical activity and social connectivity. \u201cThe case example illustrates how \u2018active,\u2019 \u2018social\u2019 and \u2018adventurous\u2019 contact with nature may be combined with a treatment intervention to protect and enhance the health of individuals experiencing chronic mental, emotional and physical health difficulties,\u201d the study authors write.\n\nAnother study published in 2010 in the Journal of Environmental Psychology showed that spending even just 20 minutes outside per day could boost energy levels. \u201cResearch has shown that people with a greater sense of vitality don\u2019t just have more energy for things they want to do, they are also more resilient to physical illnesses,\u201d Richard Ryan, professor of psychology at the University of Rochester and an author of the 2010 study, said.\n\nBut what about the differences in the mental health of people who live in a rural area versus the mental health of urban-dwellers? Interestingly, even though taking walks in nature can help prevent depression, research has shown that the prevalence of depression is significantly higher in people who live in rural areas compared to urban areas in the U.S. This difference may be due to differing population characteristics. A similar study conducted in Canada in 2011 found the opposite: Rural people had a lower risk of depression and anxiety due to a \u201cstronger sense of community belonging.\u201d Likewise, another paper published in Urban Geography proposed a urban-rural happiness gradient, which showed that though \u201cthere are many benefits of big-city living,\u201d but \u201chigh levels of happiness are not among them.\u201d\n\nThere certainly is still no clear answer as to where happiness lies but perhaps it\u2019s all about finding a balance between nature walks, social community, and just enough green to boost your well-being.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ecotherapy, nature, depression, mental health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Talking walks in nature reduces depression by a significant amount, researchers found.", "title": "Benefits Of Ecotherapy: Being In Nature Fights Depression, Improves Mental Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/benefits-ecotherapy-being-nature-fights-depression-improves-mental-health-and-well-being-261075", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/26/nature.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Talking walks in nature reduces depression by a significant amount, researchers found.", "title": "Benefits Of Ecotherapy: Being In Nature Fights Depression, Improves Mental Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/benefits-ecotherapy-being-nature-fights-depression-improves-mental-health-and-well-being-261075", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/26/nature.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/26/nature.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-10-26T19:52:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-27T13:46:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Talking walks in nature reduces depression by a significant amount, researchers found."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd56e8\"", "article_summary": "But what about the differences in the mental health of people who live in a rural area versus the mental health of urban-dwellers?\n\u201cOur research shows people commissioning mental health services and social care that a holistic treatment like ecotherapy delivers not only health benefits, but wider social benefits and cost savings that medication could not,\u201d Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, said.\nBeing in nature is has long been associated with being mindful and meditative, but only recently has the scientific community researched the mental health benefits of outdoor immersion.\nA 2006 study investigated the benefits of contact with nature and found that it could help prevent mental health disorders.\nNature Deficit DisorderOther studies have shown that reconnecting with green can help lift depression, improve energy, and boost overall well-being and mental health."}
