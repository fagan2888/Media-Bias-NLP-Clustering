Walk-ins are welcome or interested applicants can call 1-844-765-1379.\n\nResidents who enrolled last year are encouraged to take advantage of the free, in-person help during this year\u2019s Open Enrollment Period to review any new health coverage options and the financial help available.\n\nHallberg explained, \u201cUnder the second year of the Affordable Care Act, the number of qualified health plans has more than doubled from the 165 plans offered in 2014 to over 400 plans being offered in 2015. That is great news for the insured because they now have more opportunities to find health coverage that best meets their needs and budget.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, other favorable statistics that are encouraging for consumers include (1):\n\n1. As of December 2014, 67% of Illinois Marketplace enrollees could obtain coverage for $100 or less after any applicable tax credits in 2015.\n\n2. In the first month of Open Enrollment, 80% of Illinois consumers who selected health insurance plans were determined eligible for financial assistance to help cover their cost and lower their monthly premiums.\n\nThe choice of qualified health plans, cost of coverage after applied tax credits, and financial assistance available are all motivating reasons for those who still need to obtain coverage. With only three weeks remaining until the 2015 Open Enrollment Period ends, the time is now for Illinoisans to obtain coverage. ACAenroll.com is eager to lend our expertise and are proud to collaborate with GCI by providing additional opportunities for local residents to seek coverage and avoid possible tax penalties,\u201d concluded Hallberg.\n\nSource:\n\n(1) http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2014pres/12/20141230a.html (December 30, 2014 )\n\nAbout ACAMES:\n\nACA Marketplace Enrollment Solutions (ACAenroll.com) is a national enrollment firm specializing in the Health Insurance Marketplace and the Senior Product Market.
