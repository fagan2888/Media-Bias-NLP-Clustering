There\u2019s no way you want to risk that.\u201d\n\nResearch on other expansions of government benefits has borne that out: A study in the journal Health Affairs looked at the \u201cwelfare magnet hypothesis\u201d and found no evidence that it exists.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure, anecdotally, that some people will move,\u201d said Benjamin Sommers, an assistant professor of health policy and economics at the Harvard School of Public Health and a co-author of the study. \u201cBut is this a major budget issue for states expanding Medicaid? Will there be a major wave of people moving to get insurance? Probably not.\u201d\n\nThe disparities among states have left about eight million low-income adults ineligible for Medicaid and have widened the difference in what federal safety-net benefits are available to similar families in different states. There are a number of border communities where one state is expanding Medicaid and the other is not: West Memphis, Ark., and Memphis; Chicago and Gary, Ind.; Washington\u2019s Maryland suburbs and those in Northern Virginia; and Spokane, Wash., and Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho.\n\nPerhaps nowhere is the anomaly clearer, though, than in two-state Texarkana. This close-knit community, with about 66,000 residents altogether, has two mayors, two fire departments and two police departments. The Texas side is dry; liquor stores abound on the Arkansas side. And every autumn, the fierce high school rivalry between the Texas Tigers and the Arkansas Razorbacks flares anew.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an odd little area down here,\u201d said Prissy Hickerson, a Republican who represents Texarkana in the Arkansas House of Representatives.\n\nPhoto\n\nBoth sides of Texarkana are largely middle and lower-middle class; its major employers are big-box stores, hospitals, chicken-processing plants, an Army depot and a tire factory. But unlike much of energy-rich Texas, it has seen its economy stagnate in recent years. Ms. Laurent said she struggled to meet more need with less money; grants and donations to the shelter dropped sharply last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the town\u2019s lowest-income residents, finding health care is one more hardship. Ms. Marks had a hole in her tooth this winter, she said, and went to the emergency room. They gave her a painkiller and a bill for $600, which she has ignored. The tooth remains so damaged that she can chew on only one side of her mouth.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s past due,\u201d she said in response to the letters the hospital has sent her. \u201cBut I can\u2019t just pay y\u2019all $600. I don\u2019t have $600.\u201d\n\nAnother resident at the Randy Sams\u2019 shelter, Ed Miller, 42, has congestive heart failure and sleep apnea. Recently, he went to the hospital and received a diagnosis of bronchitis too. Asked if he would consider moving to Arkansas to gain access to Medicaid, he responded, \u201cI might look into that.\u201d\n\nThe shelter helps its residents gain access to the government programs they are eligible for: food stamps, Social Security, disability, housing vouchers when available. Once, Ms. Laurent said, an Arkansas social worker came across the state line to see if anyone might be eligible for the Medicaid expansion.\n\nBut even many qualified people resist using government services, because of fear, a lack of knowledge or a criminal conviction. \u201cThey just don\u2019t trust the government,\u201d Ms. Laurent said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been told no over and over and over again.\u201d\n\nAnd moving even a few blocks away might pose an insurmountable challenge. The Salvation Army shelter on the Arkansas side of town charges $6 a night, more than many of the very poor can afford. Randy Sams\u2019, on the Texas side, is free.\n\n\u201cI tell my clients: You\u2019ve got to have paper, or you\u2019ve got to have paper,\u201d Ms. Laurent said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have money, or you\u2019re going to have to fill out a lot of paperwork for benefits.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Tramel said he walked to Texas from Missouri, finding God and kicking a drug habit along the way. The trip took him 11 days. He has no Social Security card, birth certificate or driver\u2019s license, let alone a stable address. The paperwork challenge of establishing residency in a state and applying for benefits, he said, seemed overwhelming to him.\n\n\u201cMedicaid, I think that should be universal,\u201d he said, getting ready for the long walk back to his tent.\n\nIndeed, until the Supreme Court ruling, the Obama administration had intended for the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act to be universal, covering all adults earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line, about $15,500 annually for a single adult or $32,000 for a family of four.\n\nThat\u2019s the way it is working out on the Arkansas side of the border, where health clinics and social service agencies are signing up eligible residents, even though this corner of the state is largely Republican and broadly resistant to the health care law.\n\nThe expansion is already having an effect on the city\u2019s biggest provider of charity care, the nonprofit Christus St. Michael Health System. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more patients with a payer,\u201d said Chris Karam, its president, referring to those with health insurance coverage.\n\nOn the Texas side, though, it\u2019s business as usual. \u201cIt makes me mad,\u201d said Mr. Miller, who is not receiving any federal benefits at the moment despite his array of illnesses. \u201cThey need to quit playing games with people\u2019s lives. Rich people. Government people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140608210525, "twitter": {"description": "On the Arkansas side of Texarkana, the poor gained access to Medicaid because of the Affordable Care Act.
