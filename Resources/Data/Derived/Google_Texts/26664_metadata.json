That TV ad drew fire from Democrats, who said the spot featured stock footage of Mexican miners.\n\nConway told the Kentucky Farm Bureau board of directors on Thursday that changes need to be made to the state\u2019s implementation of provisions of the ACA, which include the state-based exchange kynect and Medicaid expansion. But he did not provide specific examples, saying he would monitor the situation if elected.\n\nDuring his run for U.S. Senate in 2010, Conway tempered his support for a cap-and-trade bill that ultimately failed to pass Congress, saying he would back the legislation if Kentucky\u2019s energy interests are protected. His decision to sue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for its proposed rules on greenhouse gas emissions has also been heavily stressed on the trail.\n\nFor Crigler, Conway\u2019s current and previous stances on energy, health care and other topics deserve attention during Conway\u2019s gubernatorial campaign, which pits him against Republican Matt Bevin in the Nov. 3 election.\n\n\u201cAs I think most folks in Kentucky know, Fancy Farm is really the kickoff to people starting to tune in to the governor\u2019s race, and Jack Conway clearly has some policy stances that we want to make sure people are aware of because we think they\u2019re pointing Kentucky in the wrong direction,\u201d she said in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cThe video is really just to invite people across the state to join us at Fancy Farm and let Jack Conway know we don\u2019t want to go the wrong way.\u201d\n\nConway campaign spokesman Daniel Kemp accused the group of misleading voters on the Democrat\u2019s record.\n\n\u201cNo amount of false attacks from Matt Bevin\u2019s East Coast allies will distract from Bevin\u2019s own very real failure to pay his taxes, his refusal to release his tax returns and his opposition to early childhood education,\u201d Kemp said in a statement. \u201cHere in Kentucky, we know that Attorney General Conway is an independent leader who always puts Kentucky first, and that we can\u2019t trust an East Coast Con Man like Bevin to look out for us.\u201d\n\nCrigler countered that her group\u2019s message \u201cis very relevant\u201d in the election.\n\n\u201cAnd I think people in Kentucky deserve to know where he stands on issues such as Obamacare and cap and trade,\u201d she said. \u201cWe feel like he\u2019s turned towards Washington and away from Kentucky.\u201d\n\nThe Conway campaign also looked to make political hay out of AFP\u2019s entry in the governor\u2019s race, hoping to raise $5,000 in the next two days based on news of the attacks.\n\nIn a campaign email Saturday, Conway\u2019s campaign said the group, founded by billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch, is trying \u201cto bail out Matt Bevin by launching negative attacks ahead of Fancy Farm.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just found out that \u2014 ahead of Fancy Farm \u2014 the Koch brothers have launched attacks against Jack and Sannie,\u201d the campaign email reads. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to do whatever it takes to distract Kentuckians from Matt Bevin\u2019s failure to pay his own taxes.\n\n\u201cIf we want to ensure that Kentucky has a governor who puts people ahead of politics and leads with integrity, we have to raise $5,000 in the next 48 hours.
