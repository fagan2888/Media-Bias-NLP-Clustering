WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - Spirit AeroSystems says it will temporarily lay off up to 70 production workers in Wichita, Kansas, at the start of 2016.

The Wichita Eagle (http://bit.ly/1S6eav4) reports that while the duration of the layoffs remains murky, affected workers still will get benefits.

Spirit has roughly 11,000 employees in Wichita.

The company says the temporary layoffs come after fewer production workers retired or quit than were projected, and improvement in some production activities have led to a need for fewer workers.
