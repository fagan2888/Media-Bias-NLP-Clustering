Miller, Republican of Michigan, said she was at a peach festival parade last weekend in her district, an event that does not typically draw the type of constituent who is overly political. But as she made her way down the parade route, one person after another urged her to vote no on any authorization of force in Syria.\n\n\u201cIt was not a political event at all,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cBut there were a lot of people, older veterans especially in their hats, all saying, \u2018No on Syria!\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn the face of such overwhelming constituent opposition, Congressional Republican leaders are treading extremely lightly. Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, has come out strongly for military intervention in Syria, but in a one-on-one conversation with Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, he did not press the point, Mr. Chaffetz said.\n\nIn Mr. Cole\u2019s case, speaker after speaker at an evening town hall meeting questioned Mr. Obama\u2019s assertion that he has constitutional authority to strike on his own \u2014 and insisted that Congress not give him authority.\n\n\u201cWhere does he get this \u2014 a Cracker Jack box?\u201d asked Steve Byas, who teaches government at Hillsdale Free Will Baptist College in Moore, Okla. Criticizing Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cred line,\u201d Mr. Byas added, \u201cJust because the president made a statement he should not have made should not bind the Congress to go ahead and approve this.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nThe applause Mr. Byas received from the crowd of 150 people mirrored the flow of telephone calls Mr. Cole\u2019s office aides have fielded. \u201cNot one\u201d in favor of striking Syria, he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe majority of people Mr. Cole represents in this southwest Oklahoma district rarely support Mr. Obama on much of anything; two-thirds of voters here backed the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, in November. At the town meeting, which stretched beyond three hours in a Rose State College lecture hall, constituents derided Mr. Obama as a socialist, demanded that Republicans shut down the government to block his health care plan, and called for his impeachment. Many House Republicans have echoed those sentiments, seemingly making it difficult for them to back the president on his Syria plan despite their embrace of American military power.\n\nTinker Air Force Base, employing 8,000 soldiers and 15,000 civilians here, gives the area an affinity for the military. But that does not translate into reflexive support for the mission the commander in chief wants to order.\n\nPartly that reflects the military\u2019s traditional hesitance about hazy and circumscribed mission objectives. Before Mr. Obama decided to strike in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, warned Congress in a letter this summer that \u201cdeeper involvement is hard to avoid.\u201d\n\nBut wariness here is also a measure of years of strain on American forces, from conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and, lately, the budget squeeze at home.\n\nOver lunch at Tinker, Lt. Gen. Bruce Litchfield told Mr. Cole that the six furlough days caused by \u201csequester\u201d budget cuts had cost the base $77 million and degraded readiness. At the town meeting, a civilian employee at the base complained that workers who lost six days\u2019 pay have not had a raise for four years.\n\n\u201cThe American people are getting a little war weary,\u201d said Tom Hinkle, 58, an Army veteran who noted that some troops had faced four or five deployments. \u201cWho\u2019s guarding our backs?\u201d\n\nAmanda Miller, 30, an unemployed mental health worker, warned, \u201cThis could get ugly very quickly.\u201d Cheryl Cooper, an Air Force retiree, suggested that Congress calculate how much the administration has spent preparing for a Syria strike and \u201ctake it off the Obamacare.\u201d\n\nMr. Cole, chief of staff at the Republican National Committee before winning his House seat, has occasionally raised the ire of more aggressive Tea Party-style conservatives. One activist in the back of his town hall meeting handed out fliers casting him as disloyal to the Republican cause.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cole genially deflected talk of socialism and impeachment, and disappointed some of those on hand by telling them Republicans lack the power to repeal the health care law. He praised the administration\u2019s responsiveness after a tornado ravaged his hometown, Moore, in May.\n\nHe also praised Mr. Obama for seeking Congressional authorization of the Syria mission. But he rejected every argument the administration has made for it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a civil war, it\u2019s a proxy war between regional powers, and it\u2019s a religious war,\u201d Mr. Cole said in an interview. \u201cIs there any direct security threat to the United States here? No. There\u2019s really not.\u201d\n\nHe predicted the Democratic-controlled Senate would back the president. Mr. Obama has \u201ca good chance\u201d of prevailing in the House, Mr. Cole said, but it is no sure thing.\n\n\u201cIf I break with my district, I better have an awfully compelling reason,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to listen to that kind of expert opinion. But I\u2019m sure going to listen to opinion at the Starbucks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20130906060104, "twitter": {"description": "Fewer than a dozen House Republicans have publicly said they would back President Obama on a military strike, making the White House climb to a House majority steep.", "title": "House Republicans Say Voters Oppose Intervention", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/us/politics/house-republicans-say-constituents-are-strongly-opposed-to-a-syria-strike.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002422693"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/07/world/cong/cong-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/us/politics/house-republicans-say-constituents-are-strongly-opposed-to-a-syria-strike.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002422693", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/us/politics/house-republicans-say-constituents-are-strongly-opposed-to-a-syria-strike.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "House Republicans Say Voters Oppose Intervention", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 6, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/jonathan_weisman/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/section/us", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2016-01-01", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "published": "2013-09-06", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "keywords": "Syria,United States Defense and Military Forces,Middle East and North Africa Unrest (2010- ),House of Representatives,Cole  Tom,Oklahoma,Obama  Barack,Republican Party,United States Politics and Government", "description": "Fewer than a dozen House Republicans have publicly said they would back President Obama on a military strike, making the White House climb to a House majority steep.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "John Harwood and Jonathan Weisman", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "slug": "07cong", "byl": "By JOHN HARWOOD and JONATHAN WEISMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Fewer than a dozen House Republicans have publicly said they would back President Obama on a military strike, making the White House climb to a House majority steep.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/07/world/cong/cong-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Syria,Oklahoma", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 6, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Republican Party", "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Oklahoma", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160101191024, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/us/politics/house-republicans-say-constituents-are-strongly-opposed-to-a-syria-strike.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/07/world/cong/cong-videoLarge.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Fewer than a dozen House Republicans have publicly said they would back President Obama on a military strike, making the White House climb to a House majority steep.", "title": "House Republicans Say Voters Oppose Intervention"}, "pdate": 20130906, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "articleid": 100000002422693, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "House Republicans Say Voters Oppose Intervention", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/07/world/cong/cong-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06b3\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Obama has \u201ca good chance\u201d of prevailing in the House, Mr. Cole said, but it is no sure thing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a civil war, it\u2019s a proxy war between regional powers, and it\u2019s a religious war,\u201d Mr. Cole said in an interview.\nAt the town meeting, a civilian employee at the base complained that workers who lost six days\u2019 pay have not had a raise for four years.\nOver lunch at Tinker, Lt.
