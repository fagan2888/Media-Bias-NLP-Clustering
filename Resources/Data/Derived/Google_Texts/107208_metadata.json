That's a problem because diabetes and high blood pressure are key risk factors for kidney failure. According to a new study, that puts one in three Americans at risk.\n\nA March 7 fundraiser at The District Lounge in Sioux Falls aimed to change that. Doors opened at 5 p.m. for kid-friendly hors d'oeuvres and games.\n\nAdmission was $40, in return for which each guest received 100 \"Kidney Dollars.\" Kidney Dollars could in turn be wagered on games, accumulated, and spent in a raffle. There was also a silent auction featuring cakes by local bakeries.\n\nGuests not wishing to play could pay $10 to see musical group Goodroad take the stage at 8 p.m.\n\nThe Mardi Gras theme fit with the festive atmosphere, but the real spotlight was on kidney disease and a local family that's fighting back.\n\nJoann Sullivan is on the board of the National Kidney Foundation, and her daughter, Anne, is in need of a transplant.\n\n\"Annie spends three hours, three days a week on dialysis, hooked into a dialysis machine, to basically keep her alive. If anybody were to give Annie this most precious give of their kidney, it will mean [going] back to a normal life,\" Sullivan said.\n\nSullivan says her daughter was born with a rare immune disorder that caused her kidneys to fail.\n\nThe average wait time for a donor kidney today is six years. The National Kidney Foundation is working to improve that by providing kidney screenings and educating patients and professionals about the transplant process.\n\nAnne's blood type is O, but a donor doesn't have to be her type to make a difference. Volunteers of other blood types can be added to a donor \"pool\" for their chosen recipient.\n\nThe system works on reciprocity: if another waiting recipient should have a donor with blood type O, that donor's kidney would come to Anne, and the volunteer's organ would go to that other recipient. The pool system enables doctors to connect \"chains\" of recipients and their donors, helping the most people possible.\n\nModern laparoscopic kidney transplantations are considered safe and are only minimally invasive. Insurance and Medicare frequently pay for everything besides lodging for kidney donors, and in the Sullivan's case, the family says they would gladly cover that.\n\nDonors may expect to remain in the hospital around three days and may be unable to work for two weeks; other than that, Sullivan says the average, healthy person who donates a kidney can expect to continue their regular lifestyle without ever noticing a difference.\n\nYou can learn more about the Sullivan's story by visiting their Facebook page.\n\n2015 was the first year the National Kidney Foundation held this kind of fundraiser; it replaces another event known as the \"Feast of the Great Chefs.\"\n\nThe National Kidney Foundation holds its next fundraising event March 24 at 4:30 p.m. at Carnaval Brazilian Grill in Sioux Falls. The occasion is to feature a ribbon-cutting ceremony marking The National Kidney Foundation's partnership with the Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce and will also season of kidney walks across the region, including one in Sioux Falls on June 6. Sioux Falls will also host the National Kidney Foundation Golf Classic at Willow Run Golf Course on June 15.\n\nDoApp\n\nHealth News {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
