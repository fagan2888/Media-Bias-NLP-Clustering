Alan Grayson may be married to a bigamist. He\u2019s compared the Tea Party to the KKK. He also wants to replace Marco Rubio in the Senate\u2014and Republicans couldn\u2019t be more thrilled.\n\nAlan Grayson is prone to making the type of outrageous comments on cable television that would make you squirm if they came from your drunk uncle at a family dinner. He is currently in the middle of a trial to determine if his wife is a bigamist and if they were ever even legally married. The trial is being delayed because her breast implants are leaking. And, besides all that, Grayson is a United States congressman considering a run for Senate.\n\nGrayson, who was just elected to his third term on Capitol Hill, has cast himself as a progressive champion. The Orlando-area Democrat has spent much of his second stint in Congress\u2014he lost in the Tea Party wave of 2010 after his first election in 2008 and then won an open seat in 2012 after redistricting\u2014successfully pushing amendments to advance various left-libertarian issues. As Grayson told The Daily Beast on Wednesday, he passed 31 amendments in the last Congress, more than any other member. He also emphasized his national appeal, noting that he has 116,000 individual donors\u2014the most of any member of the House of Representatives\u2014and that he was able to raise $5 million for his re-election campaign in 2014.\n\nBut while Grayson boasts of his legislative successes, he is better known for making bombastic, controversial remarks. He has compared the Tea Party to the KKK, alleged that Ted Cruz was ineligible to run for president, and claimed that the Republican alternative to Obamacare was encouraging the sick to die quickly. He also ran an ad in 2010 in which he compared his Republican opponent to the Taliban.\n\nYet Grayson sees his history of controversy as an advantage in 2016. \u201cI think they are honest remarks,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cThe reason why my supporters are willing to crawl naked over hot coals to support my campaign and vote for me is because they like the fact that I call it like it is. They don\u2019t have to guess what\u2019s on my mind. When I make a promise, I keep it, and I\u2019m not afraid of anyone.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, for their part, seem positively giddy at the prospect of Grayson in a Senate general election. As Rick Wilson, a prominent Republican consultant in Florida, chortled, \u201cHe\u2019d be a mixture of Sharron Angle, Todd Akin, and Hannibal Lecter.\u201d While Wilson said Grayson would be nearly unbeatable in a Democratic primary, he gave him little chance in a statewide election in November. Wilson did add the caveat that he could see a path to victory for Grayson \u201cif all the other Republican candidates were found to be part of a child pornography ring.\u201d\n\nAndrea Bozak, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, offered a preview of how Republicans would attack the congressman in a general election: \u201cThe word extreme doesn\u2019t even do justice to explain Alan Grayson. Every Democrat candidate would have to answer for his insane statements. His candidacy would be a nightmare for Senate Democrats.\u201d\n\nGrayson, though, said he is confident he\u2019d be a good candidate in a general election with as much as 80 percent of the Hispanic vote. \u201cThere\u2019s no other Florida Democrat who has had more support from Hispanics than I have,\u201d he said, adding that he proved his political bona fides by winning by double digits in 2014, \u201cwhich was a horrible year for Democrats\u201d and by being the \u201conly Democrat to represent downtown Orlando in 40 years.\u201d\n\nThe most talked-about alternative for Democrats is second-term Rep. Patrick Murphy, who was elected to Congress in 2012 by beating Allen West on Barack Obama\u2019s coattails. The Palm Beach-area Democrat has built a relatively moderate if undistinguished record on Capitol Hill and would have real difficulty in a statewide primary against Grayson. Others include Gwen Graham, a newly elected congresswoman from north Florida whose father is a former senator and governor, as well as Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the current Democratic National Committee chairwoman. Grayson described Wasserman Schultz as the only other Democrat in Florida who has a \u201clarge fervent national support base.\u201d\n\nGrayson still has plenty of time to decide on a Senate bid, and he notes there are factors outside of his control, including whether Sen. Marco Rubio will run for re-election, as well as whom the GOP nominates for president. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that if Jeb Bush is running that he might have coattails in Florida,\u201d Grayson said.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "bencjacobs"}, "keywords": "Florida,United States, u.s. poli, United States Senate, Democratic Party", "publicationDate": 201502061045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Rep.
