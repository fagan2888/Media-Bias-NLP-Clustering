RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - More federal dollars are headed to Virginia to help consumers navigate the thicket of the federal health insurance marketplace.

The Department of Health and Human Services has announced $1.9 million in grants for Virginia. They are going to the Virginia Poverty Law Center and Advanced Patient Advocacy LLC, both located in the Richmond area.

The law center and Advanced Patient each operated navigation sites around the state last year during the rollout of the Affordable Care Act.

Virginia is among the states that defaulted operation of their insurance marketplaces under the act to the federal government.

More than 200,000 enrolled in the marketplace in Virginia in the first year of the program.
