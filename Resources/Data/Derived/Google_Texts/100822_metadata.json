Photo: Angela Wylie\n\nThe Napthine government's proposed 99-year lease of the Point Nepean Quarantine Station to a Sorrento-based developer for a luxury resort will see prime public land taken for private profit, opponents say.\n\nOn Sunday hundreds gathered at Point Nepean to demand the government dumps the plan, announced in July.\n\nPoint Leisure Group's proposal includes a 108-room hotel and geo-thermal spa facility, a well-being centre, \"safari-style\" tents for \"camping in style\", and a conference and wedding reception centre.\n\nThe proposal's boundaries will cover 60 hectares of the 600-hectare national park.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpponents say not enough detail has been released on the plan, but that what has been shown indicates it will severely curtail public access to parts of the national park.\n\n\"This place belongs to all of us and we mustn't let it become the plaything of one property developer,\" said Kate Baillieu on Sunday at Point Nepean.\n\nMs Baillieu was behind the campaign that in 2009 stopped the defence department selling the land on the open market. She said the Napthine government now appeared in a rush to sign this deal.\n\n\"There are sufficient people deeply concerned about this, and seeing it as a significant first step towards privatising other national parks,\" she said.\n\nPoint Leisure Group is owned by Sorrento-based couple Richard Shelmerdine and Trine Nilsen. The government has released some detail of the group's proposal in a \"concept overview\" document.\n\nOpponents say it is impossible to tell precisely what is being proposed. Despite this, a \"community consultation\" process commenced in July.\n\nThe state opposition also says the overview document does not provide enough detail, given a 99-year lease of public land is being offered.\n\n\"People have to know exactly what is proposed before the government signs off on this,\" Labor's Lisa Neville said. \"They have released lovely pictures of people enjoying spas ... but people should be able to see precisely what is proposed.\"\n\nEnvironment Minister Ryan Smith said the government was offering \"a sensitive and sensible approach to the management of Point Nepean\".\n\nAnd he said the consultation process had ensured \"all Victorians have had the opportunity to have their say\". Feedback gathered since the plan was released in July was now being incorporated into the final plan, he said.\n\nThe proposed plan would generate up to 220 jobs during construction and up to 390 more once the resort was in operation.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Victoria State Election 2014", "application-name": "The Age", "og": {"site_name": "The Age", "description": "The Napthine government's proposed 99-year lease of the Point Nepean Quarantine Station to a Sorrento-based developer for a luxury hotel and geo-thermal spa resort will see prime public land taken for private profit, opponents say.", "title": "Campaigners urge government to pull plug on Point Nepean luxury spa hotel", "url": "http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victoria-state-election-2014/campaigners-urge-government-to-pull-plug-on-point-nepean-luxury-spa-hotel-20141026-11c44f.html", "image": "http://www.theage.com.au/content/dam/images/3/i/x/8/6/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.11c44f.png/1414353493983.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.theage.com.au/content/dam/images/3/i/x/8/6/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.11c44f.png/1414353493983.jpg"}, "title": "Campaigners urge government to pull plug on Point Nepean luxury spa hotel", "description": "The Napthine government's proposed 99-year lease of the Point Nepean Quarantine Station to a Sorrento-based developer for a luxury hotel and geo-thermal spa resort will see prime public land taken for private profit, opponents say.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@theage"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Age", "fb": {"app_id": 230318243699378}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theage.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "The Napthine government's proposed 99-year lease of the Point Nepean Quarantine Station to a Sorrento-based developer for a luxury hotel and geo-thermal spa ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe01ee\"", "article_summary": "Environment Minister Ryan Smith said the government was offering \"a sensitive and sensible approach to the management of Point Nepean\".\nOn Sunday hundreds gathered at Point Nepean to demand the government dumps the plan, announced in July.\nThe proposed plan would generate up to 220 jobs during construction and up to 390 more once the resort was in operation.\n\"This place belongs to all of us and we mustn't let it become the plaything of one property developer,\" said Kate Baillieu on Sunday at Point Nepean.\nProtesters gather at the Point Nepean Quarantine Station on Sunday."}
