Honeywell\u2019s program included penalties for employees who refused to participate in a biometric testing regimen, raising the cost of their company-subsidized medical coverage.\n\nA U.S. District Court judge denied the EEOC\u2019s attempt to block the effort, but many companies are still worried they\u2019ll be slapped with a federal suit of their own as the EEOC seeks to clarify its position and the federal government moves forward to adopt new regulations governing the practice.\n\nTo figure out how businesses with wellness programs are responding, The Post sat down with Bryce Williams, president and chief executive of Healthmine, to talk about the company\u2019s new opening in its Washington office for a senior director of wellness compliance. Healthmine is a \u00adDallas-based company that manages wellness programs on behalf of employers, acting as a third party between a company and its employees.\n\nThe interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nWhy are you investing in a compliance officer? Why now?\n\nThe reason we\u2019re opening this position is we\u2019re trying to crack the code on \u201chow can we make wellness perform as well as the rest of your health plan.\u201d The Affordable Care Act is heavily incenting wellness spending, heavily protecting it, but there are almost no high-performing wellness plans out there.\n\nWe know that coming soon is a whole new set of wellness regulations that define what employers can and can\u2019t do. We need to get ahead of that and have someone in place to help us shape our strategy around the new regulations.\n\nWe think this is a really, really important position that is literally at the crossroads of where the ACA has brought us over the last three or four years \u2014 and the next three or four years of where it\u2019s going.\n\nApart from the obvious need to avoid a lawsuit, why do employers care about wellness programs? Why all the emphasis on cash incentives?\n\nFrom employers\u2019 perspective, they\u2019re spending probably well over a trillion dollars a year now for employer-sponsored plans. But because they\u2019re paying for a lot of Americans\u2019 health care, they want to have a say in how those dollars are being used, whether they\u2019re being used effectively. So there\u2019s a healthy tension between the government wanting to create a rational set of rules, a rational marketplace, and companies wanting to make sure that they can incentivize employees to take certain actions that they know will improve their health and therefore help the company control costs.\n\nSo is this a new position? What kind of person are you looking for?\n\nWe don\u2019t have anything like this right now. We want one person to manage [our compliance system], and it\u2019s probably someone who has federal experience. Someone who has come out of an agency or has experience on Capitol Hill and has experience working with employer lobbyists on their insurance.\n\nOur compliance officer will need to understand how all this works, and there\u2019s a fairly steep learning curve, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s a senior position. Hopefully we magically get the right person here who has the right combination of government and private sector experience.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "capbiztopnews", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Healthmine, a third-party manager of wellness programs, seeks a compliance director.", "title": "In response to EEOC lawsuit, health companies beef up compliance staff", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/in-response-to-eeoc-lawsuit-health-companies-beef-up-compliance-staff/2015/03/29/339c0a30-d404-11e4-8fce-3941fc548f1c_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Post_AG"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/in-response-to-eeoc-lawsuit-health-companies-beef-up-compliance-staff/2015/03/29/339c0a30-d404-11e4-8fce-3941fc548f1c_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "capbiztopnews", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "339c0a30-d404-11e4-8fce-3941fc548f1c", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Healthmine, a third-party manager of wellness programs, seeks a compliance director."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2d00\"", "article_summary": "Hopefully we magically get the right person here who has the right combination of government and private sector experience.\nApart from the obvious need to avoid a lawsuit, why do employers care about wellness programs?\nHealthmine is a \u00adDallas-based company that manages wellness programs on behalf of employers, acting as a third party between a company and its employees.\nTo figure out how businesses with wellness programs are responding, The Post sat down with Bryce Williams, president and chief executive of Healthmine, to talk about the company\u2019s new opening in its Washington office for a senior director of wellness compliance.\nWe want one person to manage [our compliance system], and it\u2019s probably someone who has federal experience."}
