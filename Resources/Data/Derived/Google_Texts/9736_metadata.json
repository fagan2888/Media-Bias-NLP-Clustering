The obvious flaw in this interpretation is that the word \u201conly\u201d does not appear in the provision.\n\nSo as part of its reasoning, the D.C. Circuit held that in a different portion of the ACA \u201ca qualified individual may\u201d shouldn\u2019t be read narrowly. In fact, Judge Griffith writes, we should read it broadly and allow \u201cnon-qualified individuals\u201d to enroll as well. So the court, quite emphatically, held that without the word \u201conly\u201d present, we shouldn\u2019t stick it in. Fair enough. But if so, how come \u201can exchange established by the State\u201d must mean \u201conly an exchange established by the State?\u201d This seems a bit self-contradictory.\n\nSecond, a more general problem: The Court reacted to arguments against its own narrow interpretation of the tax credit in completely piecemeal fashion. When the government pointed out that the ACA itself asserts that the federal exchange is equivalent to those of the states, the Court theorized that the ACA could, in theory, still preserve a difference regarding the tax credit. When the government pointed out that other pieces of the ACA assumed the existence of tax credits for federal exchanges, the Court performed some impressive gymnastics to show that alternative interpretations of these other passages were conceivable. And when the government asked how a coherent law could create federal exchanges while simultaneously rendering them obviously and completely unusable, the Court merely shrugged and said that Congress can sometimes do things that \u201cmay seem odd.\u201d Individually, each of the Court\u2019s counter-arguments is a stretch; in the aggregate, they\u2019re simply incredible. But in his opinion, Judge Griffith never engaged the question of these challenges\u2019 cumulative effect. That\u2019s a serious interpretive error.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the D.C. Circuit explained its acceptance of this cumulative absurdity (though it will only admit to \u201coddity\u201d rather than \u201cabsurdity\u201d) with the admirable language of judicial restraint. The Court explained that judges have a \u201climited role\u201d and must simply \u201cascertain the meaning of the words of the statute.\u201d In other words: The sentence says what the sentence says, even when it doesn\u2019t make much sense in context. After all, Congress does a lot of stuff that doesn\u2019t make much sense, and it can\u2019t be the courts\u2019 job to go around and improve bad congressional legislation.\n\nIn principle, the D.C. Circuit has a point. Much of what finally passes through Congress is poorly thought-out. Every piece of federal legislation must make its way through a gauntlet of shifting coalitions, conflicting interests, and partisan grandstanding. It\u2019s inevitable that we end up with legislation that is full of inefficient compromises and poor reasoning. So as long as there remains a genuine \u201calternative explanation\u201d beyond an \u201cunintentional drafting gap,\u201d it\u2019s the job of the courts to respect congressional foolishness.\n\nBut foolishness and compromise are not the same as obvious error. And sometimes, as in this case, an \u201cunintentional drafting gap\u201d is really the only explanation for the appearance of a given phrase.
