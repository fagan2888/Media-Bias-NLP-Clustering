For example, according to the Post, campaign emails are tweaked based on the personality of the recipient. If a potential supporter is considered a \u201cstoic traditionalist,\u201d the message will be very direct and to the point. If he or she is labeled \u201ctemperamental,\u201d the tone will be more inspiring. And so forth.\n\nNote to Cruz campaign: consider me a temperamental traditionalist.\n\nThe Post\u2019s story tends to confirm my sense that Ted Cruz is the shrewdest candidate in the GOP field. This impression stems from the way, in a very short time, he maneuvered himself to the head of the conservative class by spearheading a partial government shutdown over Obamacare; the way he stood with Rand Paul during his absurd filibuster on drones, thus making sure that, during a seeming lull in the threat of terrorism, the Kentucky man didn\u2019t get to Cruz\u2019s right; and the way he has refused to criticize Donald Trump, claiming that he doesn\u2019t believe in Republican-on-Republican violence even as he attacked Marco Rubio.\n\nIn a time when governing experience seems to be viewed as (if anything) a negative, shrewdness is perhaps the number one requirement of a successful presidential candidate. It was the key to Barack Obama\u2019s success. He and his team were shrewd enough to figure that Hillary Clinton was not virtually unbeatable; that he could gobble up delegates in caucus states, thus obviating his need to outperform Hillary in primaries; and that the public would fall for his vacuous \u201chope and change\u201d theme. In addition, his campaign made fabulous use of big data, the way the Cruz campaign seeks to do now.\n\nIs there any relationship between this sort of shrewdness and the ability to govern the United States? Arguably some. Obama has been shrewd about enhancing his power and circumventing Congress. Thus, he has implemented more of his left-wing agenda than might have been expected, given his lack of popularity and the lack of electoral success by congressional Democrats during his presidency.\n\nOverall, though, Obama is a poor advertisement for the statesmanship and leadership qualities of candidates who, having served less than one term in the Senate, rely on brilliant political calculation to make it to the top.\n\nIn fairness to Cruz, he\u2019s not just shrewd; he\u2019s very smart. Alan Dershowitz, the famous Harvard liberal law professor, says Cruz was \u201ca terrific student\u201d who had \u201cbrilliant insights and he was clearly among the top students.\u201d Lawrence Tribe, Dershowitz\u2019s even more liberal Harvard colleague, recalls that Cruz earned an \u201cA\u201d in his class and would always offer \u201can interesting counterpoint\u201d in discussions.\u201d Tribe added, \u201che was certainly smart.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s classroom contributions at Harvard reportedly consisted more of summarizing what others said and commending them for making good points than of offering brilliant insights of his own.\n\nIn any case, Cruz\u2019s smarts and cleverness, though certainly are assets, don\u2019t persuade me that he\u2019s prepared to be an effective U.S. president (I\u2019m agnostic on this question). However, they do suggest that, if nominated, he may be a stronger opponent for Hillary Clinton than many suppose him to be.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "The Washington Post reports on how the Cruz campaign\u2019s use of \u201cbig data\u201d is contributing to the candidate\u2019s success.
