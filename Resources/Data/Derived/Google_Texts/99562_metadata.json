The options available to him and his family via the Massachusetts Health Connector were limited and unaffordable. As a family of faith, there were also objections to many of the products and services conventional health insurance providers are mandated to cover.\n\nWillington and his wife learned of Liberty HealthShare from a friend and member of the non-profit health care organization that offers affordable medical cost sharing, an alternative way to fund healthcare. The family of six enrolled as members, received their membership cards, and began sending their monthly share amount of $449. The membership was put to the test several months later when their youngest son, Liam, became ill.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nHe was admitted to a local hospital with a potentially life threatening illness. Liam\u2019s doctors felt it necessary that his condition required a transfer to a hospital in Boston. Transporting Liam via an ambulance in Boston traffic was a risk that could not be taken and as a result a life flight was called in for transport.\n\nThe parents knew of Liam needing the flight, but had worries of the expenses. They were left with the choice of what was better for their son and put Liam on the flight.\n\nLiberty HealthShare members were there for the Willington family; members shared their medical costs 100 percent. This left the Willington\u2019s to concentrate on the health of their son, not medical costs. Here Liam received the specialized treatment needed for his illness and made a full recovery.\n\nThe Willington\u2019s show their appreciation by reciprocating each month when they send their monthly share to another member with expenses to pay. The family knows the feeling, first hand, when others across the nation extend their personal, financial and emotional support.\n\nThe health ministry consists of people who agree that liberty, freedom and the choice to choose an option that fits best for each individual is a person\u2019s God given right.
