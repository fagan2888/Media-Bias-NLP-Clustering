Rabbi Mark H. Levin of Congregation Beth Torah in Overland Park writes: “The slogan that ‘We do better deciding where to spend our own money’ is not only increasing poverty, causing people to die by ignoring their medical needs, destroying families and schools and costing more money than if we put available systems in place to solve all of these problems.”
