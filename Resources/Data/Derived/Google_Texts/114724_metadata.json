That increase is scheduled to take effect Dec. 1.\n\nNuss\u2019 first effort was to try to negotiate with the current insurance company, Humana. However, the company was not interested in reducing its rate increase.\n\n\u201cThey stuck to their guns,\u201d Nuss reported.\n\nA Humana representative told Nuss that the rate increase is primarily based on two factors \u2014 the general insurance trend, which accounts for 14.5 percent of the increase; and factors of the group\u2019s demographics, including the age and sex of the participants. Recent claims that indicate a higher future rate of claims made up the rest of the increase.\n\nNuss pointed out that the city has lost some younger male employees and replaced them with older workers. That trend may positively impact work experience, he said, but it negatively impacts insurance rates.\n\nNuss also noted the employee group has experienced some claims in the past year for longer-term health issues. Nuss said that by law, a company cannot penalize a group for its past claims, but it can increase rates based on expectation of future claims.\n\nIn discussing other options with the city council, Nuss first explained that he would be making comparisons between \u201capples\u201d \u2014 pre-Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans such as the city\u2019s current plan \u2014 and \u201coranges\u201d \u2014 ACA-compliant plans. If a customer elects either a new plan or a new carrier for health insurance, then an ACA-compliant plan is the only option.\n\nNuss said that, in general, an ACA plan will require higher deductibles and generally offer less coverage due to ACA coverage requirements.\n\nNuss also said he would not recommend new ACA cooperatives, such as Land of Lincoln, which have offered significantly lower premiums for ACA plans but now are either experiencing or are expected to experience significant financial difficulties.\n\n\n\nOther plan comparisons\n\nNuss said he sent the city\u2019s health plan out for quote with multiple companies \u201cto see what we could get.\u201d\n\nNuss confirmed that he is an independent broker and does not work for any particular insurance company.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking under every rock,\u201d Nuss said of his efforts.\n\nNuss said the most competitive plan overall came from Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS).\n\nNuss had prepared a comparison between Humana and BCBS policies, and it indicated that if the city changed its health plan, the deductible would rise from $500 to $1,000 per individual, and the out-of-pocket maximum would increase by $500 per year per individual. There would be a savings of $1,500 for total out-of-pocket costs with the BCBS plan, however.\n\nThe total new premium per month from Humana would be $14,752 and $14,587 from BCBS.\n\nNuss said the comparison showed what he had predicted of an ACA plan \u2014 lower overall benefits and not that large of a savings on premiums.\n\n\n\nQuestions addressed\n\nSeveral city council members asked if the employees understood the choices and which one they preferred. Nuss said that employees who attended a meeting on the subject were in favor of staying with the Humana coverage.\n\nNuss\u2019 statement was confirmed by two employees attending the meeting: Administrative Assistant Peg Stalter and City Superintendent Randy Stauffer.\n\n\u201cThey are upset about the increase, but they understand that staying with the current policy is the best option,\u201d Stalter said.\n\nEmployees pay 25 percent of the monthly premiums while the city pays the other 75 percent.\n\n\u201cIf they want it, that\u2019s important,\u201d said Alderman Barb Yergler.\n\nWhen asked if the budget could take the increase, Alderman and Finance Committee Chairman Scott Davis said that because a 15 percent increase had been factored into the current budget and the balance of the increase would not take place until Dec. 1 \u2014 with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016 \u2014 then existing appropriations would be sufficient.\n\nAlderman Jan Hall asked if city employees had access to local physicians and medical providers because her recent call to the hospital indicated that Humana did not have a contract with Gibson Area Hospital.\n\nNuss said that was true, but that employees gain local provider access through a third-party network known as Community Partners, which Human does have a contract with. Nuss said there is no change from past provider availability.\n\nNuss said the city will likely be able to renew its existing pre-ACA policy one additional year and perhaps two, but after that, a move to an ACA type of plan will likely be mandated by federal law.\n\nWhile the vote to stay with Humana was unanimous, comments showed that council members were not happy with the available choices.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stuck,\u201d said Hall, whose \u201cyay\u201d vote was clearly given reluctantly.\n\nDavis said the council chose \u201cthe best of the worst\u201d of the choices available to it.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Champaign,Urbana,Danville,Paxton,Rantoul,Mahomet,Monticello,Tuscola,East Central Illinois,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,News", "description": "GIBSON CITY \u2014 During a special meeting last Thursday, Gibson City Council members decided to renew the city\u2019s existing employee health insurance plan, but they were not happy about it.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2015 The News-Gazette, Inc."}, "article_summary": "GIBSON CITY \u2014 During a special meeting last Thursday, Gibson City Council members decided to renew the city\u2019s existing employee health insurance plan, but they were not happy about it.\nIf a customer elects either a new plan or a new carrier for health insurance, then an ACA-compliant plan is the only option.\nNuss said that, in general, an ACA plan will require higher deductibles and generally offer less coverage due to ACA coverage requirements.\nNuss said the comparison showed what he had predicted of an ACA plan \u2014 lower overall benefits and not that large of a savings on premiums.\nOther plan comparisonsNuss said he sent the city\u2019s health plan out for quote with multiple companies \u201cto see what we could get.\u201dNuss confirmed that he is an independent broker and does not work for any particular insurance company."}
