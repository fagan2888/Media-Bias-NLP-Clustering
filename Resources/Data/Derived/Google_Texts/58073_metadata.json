Even among critics of the law, including the Republican presidential candidates, there has been virtually no debate about employer coverage.\n\nAbout 155 million Americans have employer-based health insurance coverage in 2016, according to an analysis released by the Congressional Budget Office last month. The number will fall to 152 million people in 2019, the C.B.O. estimates, but will remain stable through 2026. Slightly more than half of people under 65 will be enrolled in employment-based coverage.\n\nEmployers seem to be staying the course even more strongly than they did before the law. The percentage of adults under 65 with employer-based insurance held firm for the last five years after steadily declining since 1999, according to an analysis of federal data released last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which closely tracks the health insurance market.\n\nThe health plans employees get to choose from also look much the same as before the law went into effect. The industry remains dominated by familiar names, like nonprofit Blue Cross plans or for-profit companies like UnitedHealthcare and Anthem.\n\n\u201cEmployer coverage is much more stable than anyone anticipated,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a senior executive at Kaiser.\n\nCompanies say they are responding to the realities of the labor market, but they also say the online marketplaces where individuals can more easily buy plans, a creation of the health care law, have not been an enticing alternative for workers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEmployers may feel differently if the economy turns down and the labor market is less robust or if there is a sudden spike in health care costs. Because workers can no longer be denied an insurance policy because of poor health, companies may be willing to drop coverage under the right circumstances, knowing that insurance is more available to everyone.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut there are no plans for a mass exodus.\n\n\u201cThe demise of employer-based coverage was definitely overstated,\u201d said Michael Thompson, the chief executive of the National Business Coalition on Health, which represents employers and other buyers of insurance.\n\nThe steepest declines in coverage have been in small businesses, which had been steadily dropping coverage before the law. The percentage of small employers offering health benefits decreased from 68 percent in 2010 to 56 percent in 2015, according to the annual Kaiser Family Foundation survey.\n\nBut those companies now seem less likely to exit than just a few years ago. In 2013, as many as a fifth of employers with fewer than 500 workers said they were likely to drop coverage in the next five years, compared with 7 percent today, according to a survey from Mercer, the benefits consultant.\n\nTracy Watts, a senior partner at Mercer, said the stabilization at small businesses was mostly a product of their health care costs staying the same or rising only modestly.\n\n\u201cThat will keep you in the game,\u201d Ms. Watts said.\n\nThe early tumult in the insurance marketplaces, including the troubled introduction of HealthCare.gov, the federally run insurance marketplace for the Affordable Care Act, also made dropping coverage less tenable, analysts said.\n\nThe law has resulted in more coverage for low-income people, as expected. But the unexpected exit by some of the start-up insurers has limited options on the marketplaces. And the plans on the exchanges remain less generous than those offered by many employers, with significantly higher deductibles and a significantly narrower choice of hospitals and networks.\n\nLowe\u2019s, by comparison, said it has tried to keep employee costs low by contributing about 70 percent of the cost of the annual premiums. It offers plans with deductibles as low as $1,000, versus several thousand dollars for many of the exchange plans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe exchanges have been less of a disrupter than I expected,\u201d said Thomas Buchmueller, a business professor at the University of Michigan.\n\nEmployers say there is less financial advantage to dropping coverage than first thought. The law penalizes large employers, about $2,000 per worker, when they do not offer health insurance. That is far less than the average cost of family coverage, now $12,600 a year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nBut those calculations do not figure in the sizable tax break that comes with providing coverage. In addition, if the employers do not provide insurance, they would almost certainly be pressured \u2014 especially in a strong labor market \u2014 to add enough money to workers\u2019 paychecks to cover the cost of buying insurance on the marketplace.\n\nSome employers, particularly the smallest businesses and those who employ low-income workers eligible for a subsidy, clearly favor moving employees to the exchanges. Other employers do not.\n\n\u201cThe math really worked in favor of providing coverage,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.\n\nWhile the C.B.O. predicts the employer market will be stable until 2026, 10 years is a long time and federal officials could be wrong .\n\n\u201cThey are taking their best guess, and I think it is a reasonable best guess,\u201d said Loren Adler, a health policy analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take it as gospel.\u201d\n\nIf the cost of providing coverage spikes, as it did through much of the late 1990s and early 2000s, employers might start talking about dropping coverage again, Mr. Adler said. Congress could also take steps to diminish the tax preference for employer-provided insurance.\n\nBut so far, employers like Mr. Ihrie of Lowe\u2019s say they do not feel compelled to change.\n\n\u201cPeople have concluded,\u201d he said, \u201cthat it\u2019s better to stay where we are.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160404191725, "twitter": {"description": "Employer-based insurance has held firm for the last five years, and federal officials predict it will continue to remain strong.", "title": "Despite Fears, Affordable Care Act Has Not Uprooted Employer Coverage", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/business/employers-keep-health-insurance-despite-affordable-care-act.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004298402"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/31/business/31employers1/31employers1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/business/employers-keep-health-insurance-despite-affordable-care-act.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004298402", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/business/employers-keep-health-insurance-despite-affordable-care-act.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business", "hdl_p": "Health Law Has Enticed Few Companies to Drop Insurance", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 4, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Employee Fringe Benefits,Labor and Jobs", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Reed Abelson", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/31/business/31employers1/31employers1-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By REED ABELSON", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Employer-based insurance has held firm for the last five years, and federal officials predict it will continue to remain strong.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/31/business/31employers1/31employers1-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Employer-based insurance has held firm for the last five years, and federal officials predict it will continue to remain strong.", "CG": "business", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 4, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/reed_abelson/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/index.html", "section": "Business Day", "modified": "2016-04-05", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "tag": "Labor and Jobs", "published": "2016-04-04", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "05employers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160405152702, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/business/employers-keep-health-insurance-despite-affordable-care-act.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/31/business/31employers1/31employers1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Employer-based insurance has held firm for the last five years, and federal officials predict it will continue to remain strong.", "title": "Despite Fears, Affordable Care Act Has Not Uprooted Employer Coverage"}, "pdate": 20160404, "des": "Labor and Jobs", "articleid": 100000004298402, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Despite Fears, Affordable Care Act Has Not Uprooted Employer Coverage", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "About 155 million Americans have employer-based health insurance coverage in 2016, according to an analysis released by the Congressional Budget Office last month.\nThe health plans employees get to choose from also look much the same as before the law went into effect.\n\u201cThe employer-based system is alive and well,\u201d said Jeff Alter, the chief executive of the commercial insurance business for UnitedHealthcare, one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurance companies.\nThe steepest declines in coverage have been in small businesses, which had been steadily dropping coverage before the law.\nEmployers say there is less financial advantage to dropping coverage than first thought."}
