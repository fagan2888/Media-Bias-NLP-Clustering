The temperature was near 70 degrees in Georgia Gould\u2019s bucolic backyard on the northwestern fringe of town Tuesday as the mountain-biking Olympic medalist, an avid beekeeper, showed off her hives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m such a geek about it,\u201d Gould said with amusement.\n\nFour chickens roamed nearby while Gould described the life cycle of the bee \u2014 a sad story for the male of the species because they mate and then die \u2014 and explained how bees convert the nectar of flowers into honey. One year, Gould got three gallons out of just one hive. It\u2019s a good hobby for an athlete who travels the world because bees can take care of themselves while she is away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like a glorified landlord,\u201d Gould said. \u201cI provide you a box, and you give me delicious honey.\u201d\n\nShe developed an interest in bees out of concern for America\u2019s decreasing bee population after seeing a TV documentary about \u201ccolony collapse disorder.\u201d Last Monday she watched a new adult bee tearing the wax seal on the honeycomb cell where it developed from an egg and was overjoyed \u201clike a parent at a birth,\u201d capturing the event on video and posting it on In stagram.\n\nWith the monster snowstorm due to strike overnight, a visitor wondered how her bees would weather it.\n\n\u201cTonight, they\u2019ll cluster inside (their hives),\u201d said Gould, 36. \u201cThe honey is there for them to get through the winter, but also if it\u2019s cold or raining \u2014 they just stay inside and eat honey, which is what all of us want to do when it\u2019s cold.\u201d\n\nFinding a niche\n\nOriginally from Baltimore, Gould got a psychology degree from the University of Montana in 2003. A former smoker, she quit the habit and began a running-based fitness program before discovering she had ability in mountain biking. In 2006 she turned pro, won the first of her four U.S. titles and moved to Colorado from Sun Valley, Idaho, preferring to train in a place with a more temperate climate. First she went to Boulder, a city brimming with elite endurance athletes.\n\n\u201cI just wasn\u2019t cool enough to live in Boulder,\u201d Gould joked. \u201cI lived there for a few months and I was like, \u2018I\u2019m too dorky to live here.\u2019 Fort Collins is a little bit more my style.\u201d\n\nShe dominated U.S. mountain biking, finishing eighth at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, capturing bronze at the 2012 London Games and taking bronze again at the world championships three weeks later.\n\nTwo difficult years followed. In February 2013, the cyclo-cross world championships would be held in the U.S. for the first time, and she really wanted to be on that team, so she didn\u2019t give herself enough of a break to recover from the rigors of 2012.\n\nAt cyclo-cross worlds, she was knocked down in a chain-reaction crash and finished 17th. She left there physically and mentally drained and took three weeks off, thinking that would be enough of a break. It wasn\u2019t. In mountain-biking World Cups that spring, she failed to crack the top 20.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018I thought I had cemented my place at the top, what\u2019s going on?\u2019 \u201d Gould said. \u201cEverything was going well in training, I\u2019d get to the race and it would be so hard. I didn\u2019t know what was wrong. Like, \u2018Did it always feel this hard? Am I just not as tough as I used to be?\u2019 \u201c\n\nShe finished sixth in the U.S. championships that July and 27th at the world championships in August. Wondering if a physical problem was causing her struggles, she had blood work done.\n\n\u201cThey were like, \u2018Bad news, you\u2019re totally healthy.\u2019 \u201c\n\nAnother tough season followed in 2014. After a race early that season, she decided to quit the sport, tired of being passed by women she thought she should be beating.\n\n\u201cAside from physically giving up the race, I totally gave up,\u201d Gould said. \u201cI came back to the team area and I just said, \u2018I\u2019m done. I\u2019ve worked too hard for this to be this miserable. I\u2019m doing worse than ever, I\u2019m trying harder than ever, I\u2019m done.\u2019 \u201c\n\nHer brother talked her out of retirement. \u201cSuck it up,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re a professional.\u201d\n\nTaking the sting out of \u201cshould\u201d\n\nTurns out bees can teach athletes lessons.\n\n\u201cPeople say you should re-queen your hives every year, (or) you should feed them,\u201d Gould said. \u201cHaven\u2019t they been doing this a long time without us? I found this one website, one of the tabs in his menu was, \u2018Lazy beekeeping.\u2019 That is me \u2014 just chill out, they know what they\u2019re doing. It does sort of resonate with me because that is kind of what I wasn\u2019t doing (in cycling). I was so trying to manage myself that I didn\u2019t relax, focus on doing my job. Go with it, trust your instincts.\u201d\n\nGould realized she had to stop clinging to expectations.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was doing: \u2018I\u2019m Georgia Gould, I\u2019m the top American, I should be winning.\u2019 The should is the thing that gets you every time. I came away feeling lucky that I get to go and toe the line, recognizing that in every race, you have to re-prove yourself.\u201d\n\nIn a better frame of mind now, Gould is one of eight American women who will be vying for four spots on the Olympic team this spring. Her bees, meanwhile, will be busy making her honey.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re harvesting, each one of those frames (in the hive) will be completely covered in capped honey,\u201d Gould said. \u201cYou take this electric knife, it\u2019s hot, you scrape off the caps. Then you put that frame in an extractor, which is this big drum. You turn the crank and it spins so the centrifugal force pulls the honey out of the comb and it drips down the side and out the bottom.\u201d\n\nIf only results came that easily in mountain biking.\n\n\u201cI just found out two teaspoons of honey would power a bee to go all the way around the world,\u201d Gould said. \u201cSo next time you\u2019re drowning something in honey, imagine what a bee could have done with that.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Georgia Gould has sights on making her third Olympic team", "title": "Georgia Gould has sights on making her third Olympic team", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/26/georgia-gould-has-sights-on-making-her-third-olympic-team/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-26T22:46:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-26T22:46:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat\u2019s what I was doing: \u2018I\u2019m Georgia Gould, I\u2019m the top American, I should be winning.\u2019 The should is the thing that gets you every time.\nI\u2019m doing worse than ever, I\u2019m trying harder than ever, I\u2019m done.\u2019 \u201cHer brother talked her out of retirement.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re harvesting, each one of those frames (in the hive) will be completely covered in capped honey,\u201d Gould said.\n\u201cI just found out two teaspoons of honey would power a bee to go all the way around the world,\u201d Gould said.\nAm I just not as tough as I used to be?\u2019 \u201cShe finished sixth in the U.S. championships that July and 27th at the world championships in August."}
