The report added or deducted points based on insurance costs, fleet restrictions and hostile regulations in each market.\n\nWashington, D.C., received the highest score nationwide, in part because of recent legislation that provided a legal foundation for ridesharing services to operate.\n\nMoylan said Washington\u2019s recent legislation could be a nationwide model, protecting consumer safety and encouraging competition.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to reach for solutions that are already on the shelf,\u201d said Moylan. \u201cThis is not an issue that is going away. We hope to promote some of the positive responses, like that of Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\n>>> Cab Drivers Hate It, Entrepreneurs Embrace It: The Rideshare Revolution\n\nLas Vegas falls at the bottom of the scorecard in large part because of its hostile regulatory climate for new ridesharing services.\n\nIn recent weeks, Uber\u2019s entrance into the Las Vegas transportation market has received national attention. Last month, Uber was issued a restraining order that would have temporarily barred the company from operating in Las Vegas.\n\nTeri Williams, public information officer for the Nevada State Department of Business & Industry, said current tension between taxi and ridesharing services is not a matter of competition, but of law.\n\n\u201cAny entity that wants to come into the state to provide a for-hire transportation service is welcome to do so, as long as they are able to take the necessary steps to comply with the laws,\u201d said Williams.\n\nThe future of competition in the transportation industry is dependent on the legal framework that regulates the services, Moylan said.\n\n\u201cWe are going to see more and more battles in cities across the country,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, the trend will move in favor of open regulatory climates for all these services.\u201d\n\nJason Snead, research associate at The Heritage Foundation, said these legal battles provide a silver lining for innovators trying to bring new services into the market.\n\n\u201cThis report makes clear how critical innovation is for the transportation sector,\u201d said Snead. \u201cBut the bottom line is that innovation is pointless if governments use their regulatory power to kill off competition.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: An executive of Heritage Action for America, a sister organization of The Heritage Foundation, is married to an executive of Uber.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new interactive scorecard grades 50 cities on their regulatory openness toward car services.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A new interactive scorecard grades 50 cities on their regulatory openness toward car services.", "title": "This Scorecard Grades 50 Cities on Their Regulatory Climate", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-4.58.13-PM.png", "updated_time": "2014-11-16T22:19:52+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xp3ApW"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A new interactive scorecard grades 50 cities on their regulatory openness toward car services.", "title": "This Scorecard Grades 50 Cities on Their Regulatory Climate", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-4.58.13-PM.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "minimum wage,regulations", "published_time": "2014-11-16T03:01:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-16T22:19:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A new interactive scorecard, created by the R Street Institute, grades 50 cities on their regulatory openness toward car services.\nAndrew Moylan, senior fellow at the R Street Institute, said the scorecard provides a snapshot of the current regulatory climates in transportation markets across the nation.\nThe future of competition in the transportation industry is dependent on the legal framework that regulates the services, Moylan said.\nWashington, D.C., received the highest score nationwide, in part because of recent legislation that provided a legal foundation for ridesharing services to operate.\nTeri Williams, public information officer for the Nevada State Department of Business & Industry, said current tension between taxi and ridesharing services is not a matter of competition, but of law."}
