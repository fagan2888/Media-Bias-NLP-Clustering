After 32 congressional hearings, in spite of zero findings of any wrongdoing or stand-down orders, some people still choose to believe that \u201cvaliant people died because of (the president\u2019s) inaction.\u201d\n\nSowell is a well-respected economist and journalist, a senior fellow at Stanford\u2019s prestigious Hoover Institute, but I, too, was surprised to see his nonspecific comment concerning the president\u2019s seven years of \u201cdisaster after disaster.\u201d\n\nIronically, each disaster mentioned by Mr. Martin \u2013 Obamacare, Eric Holder and Benghazi \u2013 has a link to Southern Orange County Congressman Darrell Issa. As former head of the House Oversight Committee, he chaired dozens of hearings and was known for his arrogance, suppression of defense witnesses and obvious politicking. He was criticized from both sides of the aisle and a true disaster for his party. Issa may well be the person that the GOP holds responsible for Hillary Clinton\u2019s election.\n\nRoger Iles\n\nRancho Santa Margarita\n\nA progressive resistance to change\n\nRe: \u201cMisguided attack on tenure sidetracked\u201d [Opinion, April 21]: Just a question, do the letter and commentary writers who protect the current education system ever offer up reasons other than \u201cwe don\u2019t have enough money\u201d? That\u2019s all I ever see. It\u2019s never about the current process needing reform, or a bloated administration structure, or misguided priorities or anything else.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like that with all government-centric services. It\u2019s never about how they go about their business, it\u2019s always we lack funds. We have it figured out; it\u2019s just not properly resourced. And any ideas to change the status quo, like charter schools or merit pay, are dismissed as counterproductive.\n\nFor a group that likes to label themselves \u201cprogressive\u201d they sure do resist change.\n\nBud Carbonaro\n\nLake Forest", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "commentary", "description": "Opinion: Letters: Obama 'disasters' overblown | disaster, change, benghazi, sowell, well, disasters, current, people, april, martin", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Re: \u201cObama\u2019s disasters\u201d [Letters, April 18]: Harald Martin listed classic Fox News sound bites, followed by exaggerated or untrue comments, in his support of Thomas Sowell. \u201cHow about Benghazi\u201d is a particularly annoying example.
