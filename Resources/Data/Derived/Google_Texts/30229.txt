The Oklahoma Department of Human Services is warning about a scam in Oklahoma and other states.

Officials say scammers are calling people and claiming to be with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. The scammers claim the Treasury Department can disperse large sums of money in exchange for a smaller amount of money initially sent to them.

The scammers have also asked people to provide personal banking information. The phone number the scammers are calling from is a 202 area code, which is a Washington D.C. area code.

They use phrases like “Affordable Care Act” and “American Recovery and Reinvestment Act” which are government services but are not related to the TANF program. The scam is targeting lower income and elderly people.

DHS wants the public to know they do not make calls asking people to sign up for the TANF program. You can apply for TANF assistance by signing up online or calling your local DHS office.

DHS will never ask you for money in order to receive assistance.

If you receive a call similar to this, please hang up and do not share any personal information with the caller.
