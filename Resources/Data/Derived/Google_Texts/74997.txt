Veterans Day is this Wednesday, November 11, and many businesses are offering freebies, discounts and deals for veterans and active duty service members in honor of the many brave sacrifices they've made for this country.

Remember, in order to receive these offers you may need to provide proof of military service. This can be done in the following ways:

Wear your uniform

Bring a picture of yourself in uniform

Present a US Uniform Services ID card

Present a current Leave and Earnings Statement

Present a Veterans Organization Card (American Legion or VFW)

Present discharge paperwork

Many establishments won't be very strict on this, but it's always best to be prepared. It's also a good idea to call ahead before redeeming a free meal or discount on Veterans Day.
