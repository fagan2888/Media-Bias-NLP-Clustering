Highmark Inc.: $155 million Moda Health Plan Inc.: $67 million SelectHealth Inc.: $58 million Humana Inc.: $51 million Health Net of Arizona: $36 million Health Net Life Insurance Co.: $34 million Source: A.M. Best; Trib research\n\nThe Obama administration promised it would cover financial losses for health insurance companies that were taking a risk by selling plans on the Affordable Care Act's untested insurance marketplaces.\n\nPolicyholders could be the ones on the hook for losses in coming years, though.\n\nConcern is growing among insurers, analysts and industry observers that the so-called Risk Corridor program set up under the 2010 health law to make selling Obamacare plans less risky for insurers \u2014 and entice carriers to keep their premium prices low \u2014 could backfire because it might run out of money.\n\nConsumers would pay the difference in higher premiums because insurers will raise prices in later years if they have to cover earlier losses, experts said.\n\n\u201cThere is a likelihood that premiums will go up\u201d if insurance companies can't recoup the money, said Deep Banerjee, an analyst with Standard & Poor's.\n\nFor instance, Downtown-based Highmark Inc., the state's largest health insurer, signed up 162,000 people in three states last year through the federal government's marketplace, HealthCare.gov.\n\nIt had some of the lowest-priced plans in the country, but it generated big losses on many of those new customers \u2014 many of whom were older and used more medical services than Highmark expected, the company has said.\n\nThe Blue Cross company this month said it expects to collect $155 million from the government's Risk Corridor program.\n\nIt was supposed to work by taking money from insurance companies that made more money than expected through marketplace sales and distribute it to companies that lost more than anticipated. The problem is, Banerjee said: \u201cMore insurance plans did worse than expected on their exchange business.\u201d\n\nHighmark spokesman Aaron Billger said the company is \u201cconfident that those funds will be fully recovered.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Risk Corridor will not be a determinant of rates,\u201d he said. \u201cOur rates will be set to cover the actual cost to administer and insure individuals.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, President Obama in December signed a short-term budget bill requiring that the Risk Corridor be budget neutral, meaning if the incoming funding doesn't cover the money going out, the government can't tap other sources to cover the shortfall.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate that Risk Corridors collections will be sufficient to pay for all ... payments,\u201d the Department of Health and Human Services said in guidance to insurers last year.\n\nThe temporary, three-year program plans to cover greater-than-expected losses in earlier years with payments from later years, the department said.\n\n\u201cInsurers that had worse-than-expected results will certainly get some money,\u201d said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization in California. \u201cBut they don't know if they'll get all that they hoped for.\u201d\n\nMost insurers haven't publicly detailed the amounts they expect to be reimbursed. UPMC Health Plan and Aetna Inc., which also sold plans on HealthCare.gov in Pennsylvania, declined to provide numbers.\n\n\u201cThere is uncertainty, and we prefer not to speculate,\u201d UPMC Chief Financial Officer Robert DeMichiei said. \u201cWe will continue to monitor and evaluate whether or not these payments will be realizable and paid going forward.\u201d\n\nA few have put out figures. Louisville, Ky.-based Humana, a national for-profit health insurer, said in its most recent financial report that it was owed $51 million from the Risk Corridor for 2014.\n\nIndianapolis-based Anthem Inc., the nation's largest Blue Cross company, told analysts in January it expected a \u201cvery slight\u201d payment from the program.\n\n\u201cOn the Risk Corridor, we had a very slight receivable,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt said on a conference call. \u201cOur concern is whether collectability will ultimately be there.\u201d\n\nThe company declined to provide exact numbers.\n\nA list compiled by insurance rating company A.M. Best looked at 10 health plans from across the country that had publicly disclosed Risk Corridor claims. The total amount due to those 10 companies was $240.7 million, according to A.M. Best.\n\n\u201cIf the government does not collect enough funds resulting in Risk Corridors payments being significantly reduced or eliminated, some carriers may face write-downs of the Risk Corridors receivable asset and subsequent deterioration of their capital position,\u201d A.M. Best noted in a March report.\n\nBanerjee has seen the numbers for about 90 percent of the insurers that sold Obamacare plans last year. And he said the amount owed insurers \u201cwas much higher\u201d than the amount the program stands to collect.\n\n\u201cThe difference is significant,\u201d he said, though he declined to provide any specific figures because the numbers have not been made public.\n\n\u201cIt was the first year of the exchange. There were a lot of things they (insurance companies) didn't know about,\u201d he said. \u201cThey needed to make assumptions and they turned out to not be correct.\u201d\n\nAlex Nixon is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
