Adam Wollner at NPR’s It’s All Politics blog reported that longtime “Price Is Right” host Bob Barker is endorsing a Republican for Congress in the special election to replace Rep. C.W. “Bill” Young, who recently died in office.



Barker, who's just turned 90 and retired from the popular CBS daytime show in 2007 after 35 years, appeared in a television ad Thursday on behalf of David Jolly, a lobbyist and former general counsel to Young in Florida’s 13th district.

"Folks, when you get to be as young as I am, you call it like you see it. That's why I'm supporting David Jolly for Congress," Barker says in the ad. To close out the spot, Barker says, "With Jolly, the choice is right."



Jolly, is running against Florida state Rep. Kathleen Peters in the January 14 Republican primary. The winner of that race is expected to run against Democrat Alex Sink in the March 11 general election.
