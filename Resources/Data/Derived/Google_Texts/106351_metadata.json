Thank goodness. I don\u2019t need all you guys taking pictures of me that way.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Rushing the floor in college basketball poses too many risks\n\nIt was an emotional week for the Buffs (21-9, 10-7 Pac-12). They upset No. 9 Arizona on Wednesday, a victory that added a huge bullet point to their NCAA Tournament r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Then came Sunday\u2019s ceremony, which also honored, in addition to Scott and Talton, reserves Eli Stalzer and Brett Brady.\n\nSo perhaps it was no surprise that Arizona State, coming off a 35-point loss to No. 22 Utah on Thursday, was a thorn in CU\u2019s side for much of the afternoon.\n\nThe hot-shooting Sun Devils (14-15, 4-12) used a 20-5 run to erase CU\u2019s 14-point lead in the first half, then tied the score midway through the second half after being down by eight points.\n\nBut the Buffs had enough firepower to keep ASU at an arm\u2019s length. CU hit 11-of-21 3-pointers. Josh Fortune (team-high 17 points), Tre\u2019Shaun Fletcher (13) and George King (nine) each hit three 3-pointers, and Dom Collier contributed two.\n\nIt all added up to a victory that left the Buffs with a nearly perfect record at home for the season. Their only loss in Boulder was by two points on a buzzer-beating basket by Utah in CU\u2019s home Pac-12 opener almost two months ago.\n\nThe Buffs visit the Utes on Saturday with a chance to set a program record for regular-season wins and potentially improve their seeding in the Pac-12 Tournament, which begins March 9.\n\n\u201cThis team could be the winningest team in the regular season in the history of Colorado,\u201d said coach Tad Boyle. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty special.\u201d\n\nStill, players suggested those are secondary missions to a more raw goal for the Buffs.\n\n\u201cThe word for us (against the Utes) is going to be payback,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThey beat us on our home court. We\u2019d like to get them back, and I\u2019m not going to shy (away) from saying that\u2019s something all of us want.\u201d\n\nFirst, the Buffs will have a couple days off to savor a special Sunday afternoon. Brady and Stalzer entered the game in the final seconds to the roar of the crowd, which numbered 10,325. After the game, Boyle introduced each player to the remaining fans.\n\nWhen he got to Scott, who has helped Boyle grow the Buffs into an almost perennial NCAA Tournament team, the coach kept his comments brief in order to hold off his own waterworks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a stud,\u201d Boyle said of Scott in the bowels of the building after the ceremony. \u201cI keep looking for other adjectives to describe him, but he\u2019s the kind of guy you want your son to grow up to be. He\u2019s also a (heck) of a player to boot.\u201d\n\nNick Kosmider: 303-954-1516, nkosmider@denverpost.com or @nickkosmider", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Josh Scott, Colorado Buffaloes hold on for win over Arizona State", "title": "Josh Scott, Colorado Buffaloes hold on for win over Arizona State", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/28/josh-scott-colorado-buffaloes-hold-on-for-win-over-arizona-state/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160228_043620_josh-scott.jpg", "height": 455}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160228_043620_josh-scott.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-28T16:34:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T03:16:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21f6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNo tears,\u201d said Scott, who finished with 15 points and six rebounds in a Pac-12 victory that gave CU a 16-1 record at home.\n\u201cThis team could be the winningest team in the regular season in the history of Colorado,\u201d said coach Tad Boyle.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a stud,\u201d Boyle said of Scott in the bowels of the building after the ceremony.\nWhen he got to Scott, who has helped Boyle grow the Buffs into an almost perennial NCAA Tournament team, the coach kept his comments brief in order to hold off his own waterworks.\nThen came Sunday\u2019s ceremony, which also honored, in addition to Scott and Talton, reserves Eli Stalzer and Brett Brady."}
