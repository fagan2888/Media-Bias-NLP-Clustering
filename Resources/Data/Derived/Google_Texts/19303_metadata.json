(Photo: AndreyPopov, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nWith all the new rights and benefits same-sex married couples can look forward to after the Supreme Court's big decision on Friday, there are some potential downsides, as well.\n\nExperts were quick to note potential downsides for same-sex married couples in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling. Yes, you'll be able to file joint income tax returns, but now the so-called marriage penalty comes into play, says Lee-Ford Tritt, a professor at the University of Florida Levin College of Law in Gainesville, Fla.\n\nFor instance, Tritt says same\u00ad-sex married couples with children who previously could file separately as single and head of household could possibly see increased taxes as a result of joint filing, he says. And couples might also lose some credits such as the adoption credit.\n\nPlus, some same-\u00adsex married couples may discover that Social Security benefits that were once tax-\u00adfree are taxable due to required hitting income thresholds, says Tritt.\n\nSays Alan Gassman, an attorney with Gassman, Crotty & Denicolo, in Clearwater, Fla.: \"The day has arrived for same-sex couples to do the math and make the hard decisions on whether to take advantage of this new opportunity in the face of well over a dozen important legal, tax, social benefit and other planning factors. There will doubtlessly be many errors made, and estate plans distorted by well-meaning new married couples who thought with their hearts, but not with their accountants, lawyers and wallets.\"\n\nTritt did warn of some serious unresolved issues that will affect the finances of same-sex married couples. For instance, the bans on same-sex marriages have been held unconstitutional \u2014 they are \"void ab initio\" \u2014 which means that at no time in history were these bans legally valid (it is as if these bans have never even existed).\n\nThis will create, says Tritt, legal issues among the states. For instance, there will be issues, and most certainly lawsuits, concerning the effective dates (retroactive or prospective) of the marriages of same-sex couples who married before the Supreme Court decision but were living in non-recognition states. \"These couples might have been deprived serious property rights concerning a host of issues, including inheritance rights, elective shares, spousal support, co-ownership of real estate, tax deductions and credits, just to name a few,\" says Tritt. \"If these bans on same-sex marriage 'never existed,' these spouses, or their estates, might be entitled to these rights retroactively.\"\n\nHowever, these marriages and the corresponding rights might be applied prospectively and not retrospectively, says Tritt. \"There is ample legal precedent that will provide sound jurisprudential arguments for all sides of these forthcoming legal debates,\" he says. \"These issues and many others are yet to be determined.\"\n\nRobert Powell is editor of Retirement Weekly, contributes regularly to USA TODAY, The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch.
