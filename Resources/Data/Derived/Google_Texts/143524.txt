Billy Long, a gigantic floating head U.S. Congressman from Springfield, Missouri, suspected of representing the 7th District of Missouri, even though nobody can seem to find him, is damn fed up with all these campaign ads on the airwaves. They're everywhere this time of year! Real Americans don't need to hear about how Billy Long didn't sign a single bill passed into law last year. Or about all that money he spends on meals. Not important! Stop attacking the man and let him get back to Ebola scaremongering and complaining about Obamacare.

Long says as much in his new...campaign ad? "Fed up with all these political ads? Probably as fed up as you are with Obama's agenda," begins Billy Long's campaign ad about campaign ads.

"I'm Billy Long, and I voted 56 times to repeal or defund Obamacare," Long brags, in his campaign ad.

"I'm Billy Long and I approve this message, because I'm still fed up with Obama's agenda, and all these ads!" Long exclaims, at the conclusion of his campaign ad.

Watch it here.
