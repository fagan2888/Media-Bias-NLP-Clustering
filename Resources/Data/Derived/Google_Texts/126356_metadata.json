In other words, previous owners were able to do without using the Native face on the team's logo.\n\nRELATED NYT Article Asks Who Came Up With the \u2018Redskins\u2019 logo?\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the team\u2019s uniforms from the past (from HeritageSportsArt.com).\n\n1. 1933\n\nIn 1933 -- with George Preston Marshall at the helm as the team\u2019s owner -- the team\u2019s helmet was a burgundy color. But only a few years later, it would change to a gold color. The helmet remained that way until the early 60s.\n\nRELATED Before Judging NFL's Redskins Name, Consider the 'Racist' Who Chose It\n\n2. 1937\n\nIf you look closely, you\u2019ll notice that there are face patches on the sleeves, which profile the right side of the face.\n\n3. 1942\n\nThis jersey was produced in Ray Flaherty\u2019s final season with the team. No trace of the offensive face logo here.\n\n4. 1948 & 1956\n\nAccording to HeritageSportsArt.com, \u201cthe 1948 jersey marks the most unusual number styling the \u2018Redskins\u2019 have ever seen \u2013 making them the only NFL team to use this unique style.\u201d\n\nIn 1956, the home uniform was styled to include vertical gold-white-gold stripes on the shoulders.\n\nThere\u2019s no trace of the face logo on either of these jerseys.\n\n5. 1962\n\nAcross the center of the helmet, the team added a multi-colored feather and in the middle of the sleeves, numbers were added.\n\n1962 was the first season that Marshall finally integrated the team.\n\n6. 1966\n\nThe home jersey reverts to a stripe-less look and its sleeves are shortened. The team also added a spear to the helmet. It\u2019s very similar to FSU\u2019s helmet logo.\n\n7. 1969 & 1970\n\nThe NFL celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1969 and the patch on the left shoulder was added to commemorate that milestone. All NFL teams wore the patch.\n\nThe team removes the spear and adds a giant \u2018R\u2019 on each side of the helmet in 1970. Then another feather is added as a tail the \u2018R\u2019.\n\n8. 1973\n\nThe offensive \u201cIndian face\u201d logo finally shows up on the helmet. They\u2019d done so well without adding it.\n\n9. 1982\n\nThe sleeves on the jersey match the stripping of the burgundy pants and the stripes on the jersey sleeves are noticeably larger.\n\n10. 1994\n\nThe \u201994 season marked the NFL\u2019s 75th anniversary. To celebrate this, most teams wore a \u2018throwback\u2019 sweater. The diamond patch (squint to see it) was added to the collar of the jersey.\n\n11. 2005\n\n12. 2014\n\nWho knows what it\u2019ll look like.
