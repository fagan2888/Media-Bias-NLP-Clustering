Some think he\u2019s Muslim; thirty-nine percent think he\u2019s Christian.\n\nThough the media consistently uses this suspicion as a political tool to marginalize Republican and conservative voters and politicians, the only person to blame for the continuing suspicion of Obama\u2019s religious faith is President Obama.\n\nThe president has claimed repeatedly and obligatorily that he\u2019s Christian. He\u2019s proud to have been a member of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago for more than 20 years. He and Michelle were married at Trinity and his daughters were baptized at Trinity. At one time, President Obama was proud of his mentor \u2014 \u201cGod damn America\u201d pastor Jeremiah Wright, Trinity\u2019s pastor emeritus \u2014 and he defended Wright\u2019s confrontational brand of black theology.\n\nThe president has also admitted that he\u2019s used the Bible and his religious faith as sources of strength and guidance when making tough political decisions. He\u2019s even had a number of spiritual advisors \u2014 including liberal evangelical Jim Wallis, founder and editor of Sojourners magazine, and Daily Beast columnist and author Joshua Dubois. President Obama is even close with \u201cReverend\u201d Al Sharpton, a man who by definition does considerable and demonstrable damage to all things Christian, including the integrity of all the decent men and women who share the title \u201creverend\u201d with him.\n\nSo, yes, the president has said that he\u2019s Christian, and it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s familiar with Christianity (being familiar with Christianity doesn\u2019t make one Christian).\n\nMore to the point, a problem for President Obama is that he\u2019s knowingly said so much that simply hasn\u2019t been true.\n\nObama repeatedly assured Americans they could keep both their doctor and health care plan under Obamacare knowing full well that was a lie. He told the country that Obamacare would reduce premiums, cut the deficit and create jobs, none of which was true. He, pressed to act after his self-imposed ultimatum regarding Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons had come, dishonestly claimed that he hadn\u2019t given Syria an ultimatum. He said that he was powerless and couldn\u2019t unilaterally alter the country\u2019s immigration process, then circumvented the Constitution by unilaterally changing the country\u2019s immigration system. These are but a few examples.\n\nEven more problematic is that the president has done so much that simply doesn\u2019t square with (small-\u201co\u201d) orthodox Christianity. In other words, the glaring disconnect between what the president has said about being a Christian and what he\u2019s done, supposedly, while being Christian is what leads people to correctly question his religious sincerity.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that President Obama is an enthusiastic supporter of abortion. He once said, \u201cOn this fundamental issue [abortion], I will not yield, and Planned Parenthood will not yield.\u201d In addition to stating his unyielding support for killing unborn children, Barack Obama has also voted against the Born Alive Infant Protection Act as a state senator, four times. The bill would\u2019ve granted personhood and legal protections to all babies fortunate enough to be born alive during the abortion process.\n\nThink about that. A self-identified Christian refused to grant civil rights and legal protections to babies who survived attempted murder.\n\nSpeaking to an audience at Planned Parenthood\u2019s National Conference in 2013, the president thanked and extended God\u2019s blessing to them. Even after the release of morally disturbing videos showing the extent to which Planned Parenthood and their affiliates will go to procure organs from aborted babies, President Obama promises to veto any spending bill that seeks to strip the abortion provider of federal funding.\n\nAs a self-identified Christian, President Obama\u2019s signature legislation, Obamacare, has also sought to force his fellow Christians \u2014 religious business owners, corporations and various religious institutions \u2014 to provide contraception and abortifacients in employee and student health insurance plans, which violates sincerely held religious convictions of those under coercion.\n\nIn 2008, President Obama told Rick Warren \u2014 in church no less (though David Axelrod later admitted that Obama intentionally lied) \u2014 that marriage was a sacred union between a man and a woman. Obama noted that for him, as a Christian, \u201cGod\u2019s\u2026 in the mix.\u201d\n\nAnd as we know, Obama cited both his religious faith and the Golden Rule as instrumental in his \u201cevolution\u201d away from God and toward gay marriage, contradicting what he told Rick Warren (and America) in 2008, and a Chicago public television audience in 2004. Both times Obama used his religious faith to affirm natural marriage.\n\nHe\u2019s also pursues the subjugation of religious liberty in favor of gay rights. This past Sunday at a Democratic National Committee LGBT event, Obama said, \u201cWe affirm that we cherish our religious freedom and are profoundly respectful of religious traditions. But we also have to say clearly that our religious freedom doesn\u2019t grant us the freedom to deny our fellow Americans their constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nSame sex marriage isn\u2019t a Constitutional right (it\u2019s literally not in the Constitution) nor is it a law (Congress has yet to pass legislation permitting same sex marriage), but the freedom of religious expression certainly is.\n\nAgain, President Obama wants fellow Christians to subordinate their faith in favor of redefining the institution of marriage.\n\nThe president also showered the White House in rainbow colors celebrating the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to redefine marriage.\n\nAs a Christian, President Obama has seemingly ignored the persecution and slaughter of Christians throughout the Muslim world. Though he\u2019s reluctantly acknowledged what ISIS has subjected Yazidi men and women to, he\u2019s silent when it comes to acknowledging and condemning the hell his fellow brothers and sisters in Christ are enduring under the same evil.\n\nFurther, our Christian President, Barack Obama, has also been rightly criticized for ignoring, or not using his influence, to free Christian pastor Saeed Abedini, who\u2019s been imprisoned in Iran for three years.\n\nAnd then there was his lecturing of Christians to avoid their \u201chigh horse\u201d at the National Prayer Breakfast as he morally equated current Islamic radicalism and terrorism with the Inquisition and the Crusades of the past; his sympathies toward Islam and refusing to use the word \u201cjihad\u201d or the phrase \u201cradical Islam\u201d; his preferring the euphemistic phrase \u201creligious extremism\u201d and \u201cworkplace violence\u201d as opposed to stating the truth about Islamic terrorism, and on and on and on\u2026\n\nJesus said, \u201cEven so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit\u201d (Matt. 7:17). Again, the incongruity between the president\u2019s words and actions about being a Christian continue to breathe life into the questions surrounding his true religiosity.\n\nI don\u2019t believe President Obama is a Muslim. Though he claims to be Christian, I don\u2019t necessarily believe that either \u2014 his actions speak for themselves.\n\nI believe Barack Obama\u2019s true religion is found in being a disciple of progressivism. His religion is Leftism, period. He will use any instrument, including appropriating Christianity \u2014 and the confusion that\u2019s created regarding his belief in it \u2014 to advance, implement, and morally justify his sincerely held Leftist convictions.\n\nThe questions surrounding the authenticity of the president\u2019s religiosity isn\u2019t the fault of politicians or American citizens. The only one to blame \u2014 and the only person obligated to defend President Obama\u2019s faith, is President Obama.\n\nNo one else.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The only one to blame \u2014 and the only person obligated to defend President Obama\u2019s faith, is President Obama.\nThough the media consistently uses this suspicion as a political tool to marginalize Republican and conservative voters and politicians, the only person to blame for the continuing suspicion of Obama\u2019s religious faith is President Obama.\nAs a Christian, President Obama has seemingly ignored the persecution and slaughter of Christians throughout the Muslim world.\nAgain, President Obama wants fellow Christians to subordinate their faith in favor of redefining the institution of marriage.\nThe president has also admitted that he\u2019s used the Bible and his religious faith as sources of strength and guidance when making tough political decisions."}
