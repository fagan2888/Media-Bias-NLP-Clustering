Andrew Cuomo says.\n\nCuomo called for a system of Empire State weather stations even as he issued an apology for accusing forecasters of not sufficiently warning of the impending snowstorm that would slam Buffalo.\n\nExplaining the state government\u2019s lack of preparedness for the historic storm that left 13 dead, the Democratic governor blamed the National Weather Service and its forecasters in a Saturday press conference in Alden, N.Y.:\n\nOn the first phase of the snowfall, no one had an idea that it was going to be that much snow that fast. Snow coming down at the rate of about five inches per hour; no one had an idea.\n\nProblem is, the federally funded weather forecasters in Buffalo had begun issuing warnings of the severe snowstorm as early as Sunday, Nov. 16, two days before it hit.\n\nMeteorologists are not happy that Cuomo blamed them for the Buffalo snow disaster: http://t.co/WqepYAQrTw pic.twitter.com/MGDLGe5RTp \u2014 Daily Intelligencer (@intelligencer) November 24, 2014\n\nBy Nov. 17, meteorologists were predicting what they called an \u201chistoric\u201d lake-effect snow event, with snowfall at rates of three to five inches per hour.\n\nThe Weather Channel\u2019s Sam Champion addressed the governor\u2019s comments on his \u201cAMHQ\u201d show by compiling the National Weather Service\u2019s advisories into a segment.\n\nMonday, following a backlash from meteorologists, Cuomo apologized.\n\n\u201cTo the extent any forecaster felt that they were criticized, that was not the intention,\u201d Cuomo told reporters in Cheektowaga, N.Y., adding:\n\nIt\u2019s not that the National Weather Service failed us. It\u2019s that the NWS has a certain number of weather stations and they get that information from those weather stations, and they perform the best they can with the information that they have.\n\nCuomo used the crisis to pitch a multimillion-dollar, state-run weather service network, which he first announced in January.\n\n\u201cIf you want to have a more accurate prediction of weather, you need more weather stations. You need more centers that are detecting changes in weather and communicating it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe project, headed by SUNY Albany and the state Homeland Security Office, is estimated to cost more than $23 million.\n\nCuomo predicted a state-run service would be \u201cthe most sophisticated weather detection system, where we have hundreds of weather-detection stations all in one state.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "He calls for state weather stations while apologizing for accusing forecasters of insufficiently warning of disastrous snowstorm.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He calls for state weather stations while apologizing for accusing forecasters of insufficiently warning of disastrous snowstorm.", "title": "Storm-Tossed Gov's Sunny Outlook for Own Weather Service", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141127_Cuomo_Harkness.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-27T08:19:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1yiNsVQ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He calls for state weather stations while apologizing for accusing forecasters of insufficiently warning of disastrous snowstorm.", "title": "Storm-Tossed Gov's Sunny Outlook for Own Weather Service", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141127_Cuomo_Harkness.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "government waste", "published_time": "2014-11-27T03:01:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-27T08:19:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "cuomo weather, gov cuomo, new york weather, cuomo State-Run Weather Service, snow, Andrew Cuomo, weather channel"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf544\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s that the NWS has a certain number of weather stations and they get that information from those weather stations, and they perform the best they can with the information that they have.\n\u201cIf you want to have a more accurate prediction of weather, you need more weather stations.\nThe Weather Channel\u2019s Sam Champion addressed the governor\u2019s comments on his \u201cAMHQ\u201d show by compiling the National Weather Service\u2019s advisories into a segment.\nIt\u2019s time New York had its own state-run weather service to predict severe storms such as the one that has battered Buffalo, Gov.\nCuomo used the crisis to pitch a multimillion-dollar, state-run weather service network, which he first announced in January."}
