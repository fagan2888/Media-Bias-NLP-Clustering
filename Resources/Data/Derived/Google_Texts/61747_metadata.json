The question the court will decide is whether families in business are free to honor their faith at work or government is empowered to punish family businesses for refusing to submit to its coercive mandates.\n\nThe cases involve Obamacare\u2019s mandate that requires employers to provide insurance coverage for abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization and contraception at no cost to the employee. There is currently only a narrow religious exemption for churches and an illusory \u201caccommodation\u201d for some religious nonprofits.\n\nWhy can\u2019t family business owners \u2014 Conestoga Wood Specialties and Hobby Lobby in these cases \u2014 have the same freedom from government coercion as other exempt parties? Because the government says they can\u2019t.\n\nNot only is the government arbitrarily selective in how it doles out exemptions, it\u2019s also arbitrary in its argument that business owners can\u2019t exercise religious freedom. During the oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts honed in on that point: \u201cEvery court of appeal to have looked at the situation has held that corporations can bring racial discrimination claims as corporations. Now, does the government have a position on whether corporations have a race?\u201d The government\u2019s answer through Solicitor General Donald Verrilli was, \u201cYes. We think those are correct and that this situation is different.\u201d\n\nHow is it different, though, other than the fact that race is something the Obama administration is willing to respect, but religion is not? The solicitor general wouldn\u2019t say.\n\nWhat is the price for failure to comply with the government\u2019s edict? Staggering fines \u2014 from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 which would cripple any business. Or they can instead be fined less (\u201cmere\u201d millions) if they decide to harm their employees by dropping all health plans. No family business should have to face such a choice in America.\n\nWhat does this option say about the mandate and the administration\u2019s supposed interest in forcing employers to pay? If it is vitally important for employers to pay for their employees\u2019 abortion-inducing drugs, why is there a lower fine associated with dropping all coverage than with maintaining insurance plans minus these few items? Why do smaller employers face no fine for dropping coverage?\n\nIf people lack insurance, they can turn to the government\u2019s exchanges. (That\u2019s going well, isn\u2019t it?) Why can\u2019t the government use the exchanges or many existing programs to provide these objectionable items without bullying family businesses into getting involved?\n\nThere is more. If forcing employers to pay was indeed essential, why has the government already offered grandfathered exemptions to companies that employ tens of millions of women, allowing those companies to avoid the mandate?\n\nThe government refers to this grandfathering as a perpetual \u201cright\u201d as long as there are no major changes to coverage. Why allow businesses to opt out on such a massive scale for secular and political reasons, but not for religious and constitutional reasons? Are we to believe that the system can tolerate these tens of millions of exemptions to the mandate but not a miniscule percentage more for a small number of family businesses?\n\nSince the administration acknowledges the mandate\u2019s harm to religious freedom by providing the church exemption, why not include other conscientious mandate objectors? That is what Congress required in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act: exemptions for \u201cany\u201d exercise of religion, not just the \u201cgovernment-approved\u201d sort.\n\nKeep in mind that Congress did not even require this coverage and allowed for broad exemptions. An administrative agency concocted the unjust and unnecessary mandate. Justice Anthony Kennedy took note of that during oral argument in questioning the government: \u201cNow, what kind of constitutional structure do we have if the Congress can give an agency the power to grant or not grant a religious exemption based on what the agency determined ? [W]hen we have a First Amendment issue of this consequence, shouldn\u2019t we indicate that it\u2019s for the Congress, not the agency to determine that this corporation gets the exemption on that one ?\u201d\n\nInstead of Congress, the agency\u2019s mandate itself created the \u201cright\u201d to force employers to pay for abortion-inducing drugs and the supposed \u201charm\u201d arising from the lack of this particular freebie. This is not the enduring \u201cright\u201d that opposition activists are pretending it is. No one has ever been harmed because an employer didn\u2019t pay for these drugs. No one seems to have trouble obtaining them.\n\nPlanned Parenthood president Cecile Richards unwittingly proved that point by claiming recently that 99 percent of women use the drugs covered under the mandate. It doesn\u2019t seem like a crisis at all, much less one requiring massive government intrusion into the lives of families in business. Since nearly everyone can already get the drugs \u2014 and most of them are fairly inexpensive \u2014 why is this issue even before the Supreme Court?\n\nBottom line: There is a greater harm not only to women employees, but to all employees, if businesses are forced to choose between heavy penalties or submitting to unlawful government demands. If the government\u2019s mandate is allowed to stand, people might be out of a job, have no insurance coverage and have less or no money to pay for these items should they choose to buy them.\n\nIn short, everyone loses if the government wins.\n\nDavid Cortman is senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents the Hahn family and Conestoga Wood Specialties in their Supreme Court challenge to the Obamacare abortion-drug mandate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Supreme Court heard two of the most important and contentious religious freedom cases of this term on Tuesday.
