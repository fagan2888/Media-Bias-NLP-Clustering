Respecting others is better \u2014 Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) December 5, 2015\n\nChristakis explained her decision to quit in a statement to The Washington Post:\n\n\u201cI have great respect and affection for my students, but I worry that the current climate at Yale is not, in my view, conducive to the civil dialogue and open inquiry required to solve our urgent societal problems,\u201d she said in an email to The Washington Post.\n\nAnd Dean thinks that\u2019s a good thing?\n\nLook, \u201crespecting others\u201d is a perfectly noble goal, but it\u2019s entirely subjective. I would argue that Christakis was showing respect for her students when she opined that perhaps they were mature enough to make their own judgments about Halloween costumes without administrative guidance. There\u2019s nothing respectful about the regime of emotional coddling and feelings-protection some students want administrators to create on their campuses; infantilization is not dignifying.\n\nWhen \u201crespecting others\u201d is a higher priority than defending free speech on campus, administrators are given license to punish students and faculty for the stupidest things. They also wall themselves off from legitimate criticism. People with institutional power\u2014like campus administrators\u2014simply have the most to gain from restricting speech rights. Is that what Dean wants: more coercive power for the powerful?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Erika Christakis was respecting her students when she told them the truth.", "title": "Howard Dean Is Glad That Yale Prof Is Done Teaching, Because \u2018Respecting Others\u2019 Trumps \u2018Free Speech\u2019", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/12/07/howard-dean-is-glad-that-yale-prof-is-do", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14495082506267.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Erika Christakis was respecting her students when she told them the truth.", "creator": "@robbysoave", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14495082506267.jpg", "title": "Howard Dean Is Glad That Yale Prof Is Done Teaching, Because \u2018Respecting Others\u2019 Trumps \u2018Free Speech\u2019", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-12-07T17:20:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, is quite satisfied that Erika Christakis\u2014the Yale University professor who mildly defended offensive Halloween costumes\u2014has decided to quit teaching.\nOn Twitter, he wrote:Yale faculty member at center of protests will leave teaching role https://t.co/vums1UlRAl Free speech is good.\nWhen \u201crespecting others\u201d is a higher priority than defending free speech on campus, administrators are given license to punish students and faculty for the stupidest things.\nPeople with institutional power\u2014like campus administrators\u2014simply have the most to gain from restricting speech rights.\nIs that what Dean wants: more coercive power for the powerful?"}
