And, of course, it\u2019s not just any Super Bowl ring, as though there is such a thing, but one presented to the man who shared Most Valuable Player honors with another immortal member of the Doomsday Defense, Randy White.\n\n\u201cThe fact that it comes from the co-MVP of the game makes it really special,\u201d says Heritage\u2019s Chris Ivy of the jewelry earned after Dallas toppled Denver at the Louisiana Superdome by a score of 27-10 on January 15, 1978. That, and the fact it belonged to Harvey Martin \u2014 South Oak Cliff\u2019s own, the Too Mean man who was beloved, troubled and redeemed over the course of a celebrated, turbulent life.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear where the ring comes from: Says Ivy via email, \u201cThe ring is originally sourced from the family, but they are not the consignors.\u201d Our Tom Fox photographed it on January 13, 2010, at Valley Ranch. I never saw Martin wear the ring during the final three years of his life, when we became friendly following a stint in rehab that saved his life and kept him out of prison. For all I know he sold it long ago; in 1998 he told me he still had his Super Bowl MVP trophy, but never mentioned the ring.\n\nBut, of course, it doesn\u2019t really matter. Martin, who remains absent from the Ring of Honor, died Christmas Eve 2001 at Baylor Medical Center in Grapevine. He was felled by pancreatic cancer at the age of 51.\n\nHere is how Heritage describes the ring in its catalog.\n\nTwin stars on the ring face represent two trips to the NFL mountain top, each sporting a genuine diamond nucleus and blue sapphire spokes and set against a field of smaller diamonds. \u201cDallas Cowboys World Champions\u201d stands in raised lettering at the perimeter of the face. Left shank reports Martin\u2019s surname and jersey number on either side of a Cowboys helmet, while right shank features a Lombardi Trophy in miniature with text reading, \u201cSuper Bowl XII, 1977, 27-10.\u201d\n\nThis will not be the first ring from Super Bowl XII to go up for auction. Thirty-one years ago Thomas \u201cHollywood\u201d Henderson had to part with his. He had no choice. The Internal Revenue Service made him do it. And it was an absolute steal at $11,000.\n\nMartin\u2019s ring goes on the block at the end of February, during one of Heritage\u2019s Platinum events in New York City. Also being offered: a 1947 New York Yankees World Series ring, a Willie Mays-swung bat, Ali\u2019s fight-won gloves, a Jordan jersey that still smells of Chicago Bull sweat. Says Ivy, director of sports auctions at the Oak Lawn-based Heritage, Harvey\u2019s ring is guesstimated at $40,000. It will open at $10,000 and be sold without reserve.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAxL2RhbGxhcy1jb3dib3lzLWdyZWF0LWhhcnZleS1tYXJ0aW4td29uLWhpcy1zdXBlci1ib3dsLXJpbmctbmV4dC1tb250aC15b3UtY2FuLWJ1eS1pdC5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "A late-Friday browse through Heritage Auctions' virtual stack of catalogs turned up a surprising offering: the Super Bowl ring that once belonged to Dallas Cowboy Harvey Martin.
