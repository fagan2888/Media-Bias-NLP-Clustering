With little but a desk, a laptop, and monitor, it looks barren, like someone just moved out.\n\nBut DelBene, a longtime Microsoft executive, moved in six weeks ago. He came from the other Washington, after President Barack Obama named him HealthCare.gov\u2019s new fix-it guy \u2014 the successor to \u201ctech-surge czar\u201d Jeff Zients. DelBene is here to shore up the famously flawed Obamacare website, not decorate an office. The most telling evidence of DelBene\u2019s arrival hangs on the wall to the right of his workstation: A large whiteboard, covered with scribbled notes about databases, security features, website capacity, and the like. It\u2019s a big list of lists.\n\nHis move east is symbolic of government\u2019s growing need to reach beyond the Beltway for the sort of technical expertise honed over years in the private sector\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a list guy. I like to make lists of everything. It\u2019s a great thought process for me if I can write the list over and over again,\u201d says the 53-year-old DelBene in his first detailed interview since taking the job. \u201cThe process\u2026is therapeutic.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a strategy that has served DelBene well in the past, as he rejiggered Microsoft Office from a desktop application into an online service. He\u2019s taking a similar approach here as he helps define the next stage in the reinvention of HealthCare.gov, after its disastrous debut rocked the Obama presidency. In a sense, his move east is symbolic of government\u2019s growing need to reach beyond the Beltway for the sort of technical expertise honed over years in the private sector. HealthCare.gov proved it: Consumers expect websites to work, and they get mad when they don\u2019t.\n\nAmong the tasks high on the list: upping the capacity of the website, improving security, and fixing the back end of a system still having trouble sealing enrollees\u2019 deals with insurers. His job is about triage, curing the sickest parts first. And like any good triage doc, he\u2019s meticulous, purposeful, and pragmatic \u2014 plus he likes to move fast. The job may last just six months.\n\n\u201cHe creates a very high sense of urgency. In the tech industry, speed is of the essence, and sometimes we all collectively need to stop and prioritize as opposed to trying to solve every problem at once,\u201d says Jeff Teper, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for Office servers and services, who worked under DelBene at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that he was micromanaging us \u2014 that was just not his style, but he was leading with a commitment to attention to detail and excellence.\u201d\n\nUnderlings say DelBene has ensured the team always has a clear strategy \u2014 something critics say was sorely lacking in the initial buildup to HealthCare.gov\u2019s October 1 launch. As early as May 2010, members of the National Economic Council had urged the White House to bring on an adviser with management, insurance, and tech know-how to help build the website. Instead, the policy wonks took over, an ill-fated decision that resulted in a botched website.\n\nDelBene isn\u2019t a healthcare guy, but his business and tech savvy run deep. A former consultant at McKinsey & Co., he joined Microsoft in 1992 and rose to Office division chief, helping it grow from less than $5 billion in revenue to more than $22 billion. His lists kept his team of executives and 6,000 engineers focused, accountable and on track to deliver products used by millions. He led the software giant\u2019s shift to the cloud, a massive overhaul for a company traditionally focused on desktop software. \u201cThat\u2019s something that took a huge amount of push to make happen,\u201d says Tara Roth, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for Office Test. \u201cIt changed everything.\u201d\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nA software engineer by training, DelBene (his name is pronounced Del-BEN-ay) has a long history of fixing things that don\u2019t quite work. He has long enjoyed restoring British cars from the 1960s in the garage at his home in Medina, a Seattle suburb. As a kid, he watched James Garner drive a Formula One car in the 1966 movie Grand Prix, and he\u2019s been obsessed ever since.\n\nAt five, he jacked up the rear of a car, just to figure out how. About 10 years ago, he bought himself an old Formula One car, a prop from Grand Prix. And, eventually, he began competing in vintage car races. Today, he drives a 1967 Mini Cooper he hot-rodded himself. Ken Glass, who has known DelBene since they met at AT&T\u2019s Bell Labs in 1982, says the ex-Microsoft man especially loves cars that don\u2019t work. \u201cIt\u2019s about the hunt of solving a problem,\u201d he says of DelBene.\n\nFor years, he\u2019s been restoring British clunkers from the 1960s in the garage at his home in Medina, a Seattle suburb\n\nNow, he\u2019s using that fix-it philosophy to help usher a traditional \u2014 some might say antiquated \u2014 industry like health care into the internet age, where simplicity and ease-of-use are critical. \u201cYou should be able to use software without an instruction manual. I think it\u2019s great to have online help, but the goal should be to never have to use that help,\u201d he says.\n\nHis road to this job was a long one. It began in July \u2014 about 12 weeks before the launch of HealthCare.gov \u2014 when Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced a massive reorganization. Ballmer offered DelBene a new role, but DelBene turned it down \u2014 \u201camicably,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was an important role, but it wasn\u2019t one that I could get passionate about,\u201d DelBene says, keeping mum on the specifics. He agreed to stay on until the end of 2013, then considered advising budding startups or working for tech companies and nonprofits.\n\nIn mid-November, as even Democratic senators started complaining about HealthCare.gov\u2019s failings, his wife of nearly 17 years, Suzan DelBene, a freshman Democratic U.S. Representative from Washington, told the Obama administration her husband might be able to help. Zients was moving on to lead the National Economic Council. \u201cIt seemed like there was a natural time to move from somebody who\u2019s more business oriented to someone who\u2019s more balanced between the business and the tech side of things,\u201d DelBene says.\n\nDelBene called Zients, and a few days later, he was on a plane to Washington to meet with HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. On December 17, the White House announced DelBene would succeed Zients, pointing to his expertise in building consumer and enterprise software. (DelBene, who earned roughly $7.6 million last year at Microsoft, is donating his salary to the government.)\n\nHis lack of healthcare experience didn\u2019t seem to matter. \u201cHe will be surrounded by healthcare policy experts,\u201d says Bob Kocher, a partner at Venrock and a former special assistant to the President for healthcare on the National Economic Council. \u201cWe know that technology experience is what has been lacking thus far in D.C.\u201d\n\nOn the Job\n\nDelBene, who has two grown kids, splits his time between his home in Medina and an apartment he and his wife rented about a mile away from the Capitol. His days start early, around 7:30 am, sometimes with a cafeteria run for coffee, which he totes from one meeting to the next. As he talks \u2014 in calm, measured, Tom-Brokaw-like tones \u2014 he checks his lists, taking his glasses on and off.\n\nIn meetings last week with Secretary Sebelius and Marilyn Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \u2014 the agency overseeing HealthCare.gov \u2014 he discussed optimizing software, booting up new servers, and adding more computing power to existing ones to raise the system\u2019s capacity.\n\nOne of his top priorities, he says, is making the back-end system for transferring customer information to insurers more reliable, even as customer data changes.\n\nEveryone at CMS is focused on the run-up to March 31, when open enrollment for 2014 is set to close. In the days and weeks beforehand, traffic is expected to surge. DelBene is mindful of the problems that sank HealthCare.gov\u2019s initial launch \u2014 insufficient testing and myriad glitches that caused the system to move glacially or crash.\n\nHe worries, he told Tavenner on Thursday, that contractors like Optum/QSSI are waiting too long to test the new configuration. \u201cWe should really push them to do incremental testing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to turn things on at the new capacity level and expect it all to work.\u201d And he stressed the importance of \u201cbug triage\u201d \u2014 resolving code problems that make the system stall.\n\nOne of his top priorities, he says, is making the back-end system for transferring customer information to insurers more reliable, even as customer data changes. That entails building an interconnected system that can beam customer information correctly to insurance companies.\n\nSo far, that data transfer has been riddled with errors. And the payment systems that send federal subsidies to insurance companies to cover customers aren\u2019t running, critics say. \u201cThe fact remains: neither the law nor the website are ready for prime time,\u201d says Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn), the vice chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. \u201cAnyone and everyone involved in \u2018fixing\u2019 the completely flawed and still incomplete HealthCare.gov has a tall task.\u201d\n\nOthers say it\u2019s unfair to expect such a complex system to work immediately. DelBene is pushing to make HealthCare.gov\u2019s development more fluid, in line with how web giants Google and Facebook do things. The days of the \u201cbig bang release\u201d are mostly past. Systems are rolled out and improved over time.\n\n\u201cAs we found, it is hard to get things right on day one,\u201d says Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger, who does not know DelBene. \u201cThe discipline around understanding what the problems are, fixing them really quickly, testing them ahead of time, admitting you\u2019re wrong\u2026all that is pretty embedded in the culture for someone who is scaling a startup.\u201d But, in government, he says, \u201cit\u2019s probably more difficult.\u201d\n\n\u2018The New Guy\u2019\n\nDelBene\u2019s process is collaborative and open, his colleagues say \u2014 which is important in his new role. \u201cYou can see him evolve his positions as he gets more data. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s established his positions and [listening] is just a formality \u2014 just Kabuki ritual theater,\u201d says U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park.\n\nIt\u2019s DelBene\u2019s job to observe, digest, and persuade Washington bureaucrats that his vision for making sure HealthCare.gov works is sound, all in a politically charged environment in which he doesn\u2019t call the shots. CMS and its many contractors are ultimately driving the decisions. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a role of leading by influence and networking,\u201d DelBene says. \u201cSo I had obvious apprehensions about that.\u201d\n\nWhatever his apprehensions, he tries not to take himself too seriously. In the White House\u2019s Roosevelt Room, DelBene recently gave President Obama his first briefing on the website\u2019s progress. \u201cHe was very engaged,\u201d says DelBene of the President, \u201cand [he] liked the direction we were taking things.\u201d\n\nAfter finishing up his part of the presentation to the President, DelBene felt a \u201ctingle\u201d at the back of his throat, as though he was going to start coughing. He didn\u2019t want to disturb anyone, so he headed for the door to the hallway \u2014 or so he thought. \u201cI started opening the door to the closet!\u201d he recalls. As he realized his mistake, there was laughter all around. \u201cOh! The new guy!\u201d the President said.\n\nAdditional reporting by WIRED Senior Editor Cade Metz\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
