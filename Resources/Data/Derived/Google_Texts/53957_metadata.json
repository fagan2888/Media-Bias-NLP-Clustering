Not once,\u201d said Chuck Henderson, a Tea Party activist in Manhattan, Kan., who mocked the notion of the senator\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d residence here.\n\nMr. Roberts\u2019s race highlights the divisions within the Republican Party that are playing out in primaries across the country at a time when anti-Washington animus is running high and moderate voices have been displaced by lawmakers with conservative positions on abortion, taxes and education.\n\nMr. Roberts has suddenly begun aligning himself with the most conservative elements of the Senate, after a career in the mainstream conservative tradition of fellow Kansans like Bob Dole and Nancy Kassebaum.\n\nHe opposed a major spending project at his beloved alma mater, Kansas State University, that he had sought for a decade, because it was tied to a larger appropriations measure. And he called for the resignation of the health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, the daughter-in-law of his former boss, Representative Keith Sebelius, over the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t personal,\u201d Mr. Roberts said of demanding that Ms. Sebelius quit. \u201cWas it tough? Sure, it was tough.\u201d\n\nWhen Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, took to the Senate floor last fall for 21 hours to protest the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Roberts joined him in the early morning.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe also opposed a United Nations treaty banning discrimination against people with disabilities after being personally lobbied to support it by his predecessor, Ms. Kassebaum, and by Mr. Dole, who uses a wheelchair. (Mr. Roberts said he did not trust the United Nations.)\n\n\u201cI have to say I\u2019m disappointed in Pat,\u201d said Ms. Kassebaum, referring to both the treaty vote and his larger reluctance to stand up to his party\u2019s right wing. \u201cYou\u2019re not sent there just to go whichever way the polls tell us.\u201d\n\nMr. Dole, who supports Mr. Roberts, acknowledged that his old friend\u2019s vote had irritated him \u201ca little bit.\u201d \u201cMy view is we need to be a party of inclusion, and that includes moderates as well as conservatives,\u201d Mr. Dole said.\n\nMr. Roberts\u2019s aides candidly acknowledge that the moves are an effort to ensure that he will not suffer the same fate as Mr. Lugar, who was criticized for staying in hotels when he returned home and listed on his voter registration an Indianapolis address at which he did not reside.\n\nMr. Roberts moved his address from a rental property he owned in Dodge City but had long since leased to tenants, and got a new driver\u2019s license giving the golf course home as his address.\n\nHe began paying the Rosses $300 a month to allow him to stay overnight with them occasionally. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get Lugared,\u201d said David Kensinger, an adviser to Mr. Roberts.\n\nMr. Ross said in a telephone interview that he could not remember how many times the senator had stayed at the family\u2019s home since October. \u201cI would say several,\u201d he said. Asked when the last time was, he said he could not remember, and the senator\u2019s staff also declined to provide dates, but said he had stayed there \u201ca few\u201d times.\n\nJob security has rarely been an issue for Mr. Roberts, who has tended to his state\u2019s agricultural needs and delivered projects. He won with 60 percent of the vote in 2008, before the rise of the Tea Party, with its anti-establishment ethos, suspicion of long-term Washington tenure and emphasis on ideological purity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think career politicians are changed by Washington,\u201d said Mr. Wolf, Mr. Roberts\u2019s opponent, who is a radiologist and a second cousin of President Obama on the president\u2019s maternal side.\n\nPhoto\n\nKansas has not had a Democratic United States senator since 1939, but the Republican Party here no longer embraces the consensus-minded centrist-style politics of its most famous son, Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nThe national Tea Party-versus-establishment battle has become particularly vivid in Kansas, where conservatives, including Gov. Sam Brownback, have ousted their party\u2019s old guard from power in the State Capitol after decades in which a coalition of center-right Republicans and Democrats had effective control.\n\n\u201cPat\u2019s very cognizant of what\u2019s happened to the party,\u201d said Mr. Brownback, who served alongside Mr. Roberts in the Senate until being elected governor in 2010.\n\nGiven the changing political climate, Mr. Brownback says that Mr. Roberts is doing precisely what he needs to do to win another term. \u201cBeing active, being aggressive, being conservative,\u201d the governor said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to get through a Republican primary, and people are pretty fired up about what\u2019s going on at the federal level.\u201d\n\nNowhere is mistrust of Washington more evident than in the Capitol. There are two statues of Eisenhower in the building, but conversations with the new vanguard of conservatives here seem to reflect the Capitol\u2019s gripping mural of a zealous-looking John Brown more than the even-tempered Eisenhower.\n\n\u201cI believe that to really turn the country around there will have to be some political martyrs out there,\u201d said State Representative Marty Read, a rancher and auctioneer who is one of the few state legislators backing Mr. Wolf.\n\nStill, Mr. Wolf\u2019s obstacles are formidable. He has only $179,000 in the bank, compared with Mr. Roberts\u2019s $2.2 million, but his aides are hoping to win over deep-pocketed outside groups such as the Club for Growth by demonstrating viability before the primary.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn policy, though, Mr. Wolf is already having an impact. The latest reminder came this week, when Mr. Roberts opposed the five-year, nearly $1 trillion farm bill, which was prized by leaders of the Kansas farm lobby but opposed by Tea Party activists. Mr. Roberts, who had written an earlier version of the measure, said the final legislation included too many subsidies.\n\nIn the interview, Mr. Roberts conceded that \u201ceverything\u2019s changed\u201d about politics since he began working as a staff member. He arrived in Washington in 1967, and was first elected in 1980, in an era when finding a new house and school for the children in the capital area was as much a part of coming to Congress as learning how to cast a vote, and when he was rarely questioned back home.\n\nNow, connectedness to the home state is more important than ever in an election climate with Congress\u2019s approval ratings at record lows and conservative activists seeking purity, not pork-barrel spending. The new political reality helps explain his extraordinary efforts to establish voting residency and be seen back in the state \u2014 in the last year, he has visited 72 of the state\u2019s 105 counties, several of them more than once.\n\nSitting in his Senate office, across from a painting of a covered wagon and from photographs and totems from Kansas, Mr. Roberts said his loyalty to the state where his ancestors settled in the 1800s was beyond question. \u201cI\u2019ve been to every county in Kansas more than anybody else,\u201d he said, pausing for a moment before noting that only Mr. Dole \u201cmight quarrel with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenators have a tendency to get involved in their committees and important works,\u201d Mr. Roberts said, recalling Mr. Lugar. \u201cYou get involved in that, and you\u2019re not out there touring 105 counties like I am. We get out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140207144502, "twitter": {"description": "As the Republican mainstream has been threatened by the Tea Party, Senator Pat Roberts is desperate to re-establish ties to Kansas and adjust his politics to fit the rise of the right there.", "title": "Lacking a House, a Senator Is Renewing His Ties in Kansas", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/us/senator-races-to-show-ties-including-an-address-in-kansas.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002695354"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "jmartnyt", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/08/us/ROBERTS-3/ROBERTS-3-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/us/senator-races-to-show-ties-including-an-address-in-kansas.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002695354", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/us/senator-races-to-show-ties-including-an-address-in-kansas.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Lacking a House, a Senator Is Renewing His Ties in Kansas", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 7, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Roberts  Pat,Republican Party,United States Politics and Government,Kansas,Tea Party Movement,Elections  Senate", "news_keywords": "Kansas", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jonathan Martin", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Roberts, Pat", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By JONATHAN MARTIN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "As the Republican mainstream has been threatened by the Tea Party, Senator Pat Roberts is desperate to re-establish ties to Kansas and adjust his politics to fit the rise of the right there.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/08/us/ROBERTS-3/ROBERTS-3-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "description": "As the Republican mainstream has been threatened by the Tea Party, Senator Pat Roberts is desperate to re-establish ties to Kansas and adjust his politics to fit the rise of the right there.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 7, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/jonathan_martin/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2014-03-19", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Elections, Senate", "published": "2014-02-07", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Kansas", "slug": "08roberts", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140319143128, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/us/senator-races-to-show-ties-including-an-address-in-kansas.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/08/us/ROBERTS-3/ROBERTS-3-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "As the Republican mainstream has been threatened by the Tea Party, Senator Pat Roberts is desperate to re-establish ties to Kansas and adjust his politics to fit the rise of the right there.", "title": "Lacking a House, a Senator Is Renewing His Ties in Kansas"}, "pdate": 20140207, "des": "Elections, Senate", "articleid": 100000002695354, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Lacking a House, a Senator Is Renewing His Ties in Kansas", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/08/us/ROBERTS-3/ROBERTS-3-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc4bd\"", "article_summary": "Not once,\u201d said Chuck Henderson, a Tea Party activist in Manhattan, Kan., who mocked the notion of the senator\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d residence here.\nGiven the changing political climate, Mr. Brownback says that Mr. Roberts is doing precisely what he needs to do to win another term.\nIn the interview, Mr. Roberts conceded that \u201ceverything\u2019s changed\u201d about politics since he began working as a staff member.\nMr. Roberts, who had written an earlier version of the measure, said the final legislation included too many subsidies.\nJob security has rarely been an issue for Mr. Roberts, who has tended to his state\u2019s agricultural needs and delivered projects."}
