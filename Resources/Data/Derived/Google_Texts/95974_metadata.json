Paul LePage has suspended all payments to a consultant group after revelations surfaced that the group lifted information from other sources without attribution.\n\nAccording to a plagiarism expert who studied the Alexander Group\u2019s report on Maine\u2019s public assistance programs this week, the authors took information from as many as five other sources, without attribution or with improper citations of the original source.\n\nThe new examples, revealed Friday, come on the heels of revelations this week that the report used extended passages from a 2011 report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities without proper attribution.\n\nAsked to comment on those additional instances Friday afternoon, Gary Alexander said his agency already had conducted an internal investigation this week after the initial reports of plagiarism surfaced. He said he was aware of other \u201canomalies\u201d and attributed them to one employee who has been disciplined and removed from the project.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed in our own efforts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have high standards and, in this particular case, we failed.\u201d\n\nLePage was not satisfied by that explanation and acted swiftly. Within an hour of being told about the allegations, the governor released a statement announcing that he was suspending payments totaling more than $400,000. He did not address the $500,000 that the Alexander Group has already been paid.\n\nAdrienne Bennett, LePage\u2019s spokeswoman, said the governor takes the latest allegations seriously and plans to contact the plagiarism expert cited by the Press Herald to learn more.\n\nShortly after the statement came out, Bennett said in a follow-up phone call that LePage had actually suspended payments to the Alexander Group on Wednesday, after the initial plagiarism reports, even though his health and human services commissioner Mary Mayhew downplayed those allegations the same day, saying that \u201cthe media and Democrats have chosen to politicize punctuation over policy.\u201d\n\nAlexander did not return another call late Friday for comment on the suspension of payments.\n\nMike Smit, an assistant professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, used plagiarism detection software and simple Google searches to identify instances where the Alexander Group copied from other documents published by Mathematic Policy Research, Pew\u2019s Stateline news service, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Commonwealth Fund and the University of Southern Maine\u2019s Muskie School of Public Service.\n\nSmit did the work at the request of Mike Tipping, communications director for the Maine People\u2019s Alliance, who wrote about the instances in a column for Saturday\u2019s Portland Press Herald.\n\n\u201cThis is a level of plagiarism that is unacceptable in academia and certainly in government policy,\u201d said Tipping. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon (Gov. Paul LePage\u2019s) administration to cancel this contract and ask for our money back.\u201d\n\nAl Tompkins, a senior faculty member at the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank in Florida, said he\u2019s never heard of an instance in which a policy consultant group lifted whole chunks of information without proper attribution.\n\n\u201cAttribution is important for two reasons: One, it\u2019s fair. And two, it adds validity to what you\u2019re trying to say,\u201d he said.\n\nSmit, the Dalhousie professor, said that with today\u2019s technology, it\u2019s easier than ever to plagiarize, but it\u2019s also easier than ever to uncover plagiarism.\n\n\u201cThe things I caught in this report were really just the dumbest cases of copying and pasting,\u201d he said.\n\nLePage last fall commissioned a no-bid $925,000 contract with The Alexander Group, headed by Alexander, the former Pennsylvania secretary of public welfare, to evaluate Maine\u2019s welfare systems and suggest improvements.\n\nThe contract has been under political fire ever since. Democrats criticized the fact that LePage handpicked, without discussion, a group with a history of promoting policies about welfare that directly align with the governor\u2019s own conservative beliefs. They later criticized the group for missing deadlines spelled out in the contract and th assessing the cost of expanding Medicaid in Maine.\n\nSo far, four of the five commissioned reports or studies have been submitted. In April, DHHS agreed to amend the contract to give the Alexander Group an extension to submit the remaining reports. Those are now due July 15.\n\nAlexander said six people worked on the report. He declined to identify the employee who he said was responsible for the lifted passages, which were first reported in an editorial in the Bangor Daily News.\n\nHouse Speaker Mark Eves, D-North Berwick, said the state should ask for a refund.\n\n\u201cMaine taxpayers deserve a full refund. It\u2019s not enough to suspend payments for this flawed and controversial contractor,\u201d Eves said. \u201cIt\u2019s fraudulent work. No amount fraud should be tolerated. The contract should be canceled like we have been saying since day one. This has been an egregious waste of taxpayer dollars meant only to boost the Governor\u2019s election campaign.\u201d\n\nLawmakers did attempt during the recently concluded legislative session to pass a bill that would nullify the contract. The bill passed through the Democratic-controlled House and Senate but was vetoed by LePage and failed to receive the two-thirds majority of votes needed to overturn that veto.\n\nAlexander, in an apology sent to DHHS on Wednesday, acknowledged footnoting problems that escaped a review process. He also indicated that he intended to contact any organizations whose material was borrowed \u201cto apologize to them directly and to let them know it was not intentional.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Alexander took a similar tone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed and we\u2019re going to fix it and deliver back a better product,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we believe the report contains a lot of good recommendations and we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a one-sided document.\u201d\n\nLePage\u2019s opponents in the governor\u2019s race criticized the latest allegations and the Alexander Group in general.\n\n\u201cThe deeply flawed and controversial Alexander report is a case study in government waste,\u201d said Democrat Mike Michaud. \u201cIt has never been anything more than a political document meant to further Gov. LePage\u2019s re-election.\n\nAdded independent Eliot Cutler, \u201cThe Alexander Report is a joke and waste of taxpayer money. This administration makes one bad mistake after another, and gives us bad management decision after bad management decision.\u201d\n\nLePage was decisive Friday but his support of the Alexander Group had been steadfast until this week.\n\nIn January, the portion of the group\u2019s report that was released dealt with the feasibility of expanding Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act, an issue that raged throughout the legislative session.\n\nLePage has been a vehement critic of Medicaid expansion, vetoing five different expansion bills. His administration used the $108,000 feasibility study released by Alexander to bolster its opposition. However, that effort was complicated by the controversy surrounding the procurement of the contract, Alexander\u2019s track recorda, and flaws in the Medicaid study.\n\nIn February, the effects of the criticism were highlighted in a series of emails obtained by the Portland Press Herald. In those emails John Martins, the communications director for the DHHS, acknowledged that the Alexander controversy was complicating the administration\u2019s anti-expansion message.\n\n\u201cWe are succeeding on all fronts on getting the expansion message out and the focus on the (Alexander Group) report has died down,\u201d Martins wrote in a Feb. 14 email to Mayhew and senior staff.\n\nHe concluded, \u201cWe haven\u2019t lost anything \u2013 we have this (memo) ready for the next salvo \u2013 but I think if we have data, especially data that we can report as new, Commissioner, we can accomplish your message objective without tying it to the (Alexander Group) report.\u201d\n\nAlexander\u2019s hiring has also put LePage on the defensive. In December, the governor sought to distance himself from the no-bid contract, telling WABI-TV in Bangor, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t hire him (Alexander), DHHS did \u2026 I don\u2019t know much about what they did, so.\u201d\n\nEmails obtained by the Press Herald through a Freedom of Access Act request show that the governor personally endorsed the contract.\n\nOn Sept. 25, Mayhew notified LePage\u2019s assistant that the contract had been finalized. In a hand-written note atop the email, the governor wrote, \u201cGo for it!\n\nStaff writer Steve Mistler contributed to this story.\n\nEric Russell can be contacted at 791-6344 or:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @PPHEricRussell", "article_metadata": {"description": "An expert finds uncredited information from five other sources in the Alexander Group\u2019s welfare report, as the consultant admits \u2018anomalies.\u2019", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "An expert finds uncredited information from five other sources in the Alexander Group\u2019s welfare report, as the consultant admits \u2018anomalies.\u2019", "title": "LePage suspends payments as more plagiarism found in Maine welfare study - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20140524_549511.xml-AP505018042394.jpg", "height": 670}, "updated_time": "2014-06-05T10:14:25-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/05/23/more_plagiarism_found_in_maine_welfare_study_/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An expert finds uncredited information from five other sources in the Alexander Group\u2019s welfare report, as the consultant admits \u2018anomalies.\u2019", "title": "LePage suspends payments as more plagiarism found in Maine welfare study - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20140524_549511.xml-AP505018042394.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Elections", "tag": "state", "published_time": "2014-05-23T14:58:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-05T10:14:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa95\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe deeply flawed and controversial Alexander report is a case study in government waste,\u201d said Democrat Mike Michaud.\nHe did not address the $500,000 that the Alexander Group has already been paid.\nLePage last fall commissioned a no-bid $925,000 contract with The Alexander Group, headed by Alexander, the former Pennsylvania secretary of public welfare, to evaluate Maine\u2019s welfare systems and suggest improvements.\nAdded independent Eliot Cutler, \u201cThe Alexander Report is a joke and waste of taxpayer money.\nIn April, DHHS agreed to amend the contract to give the Alexander Group an extension to submit the remaining reports."}
