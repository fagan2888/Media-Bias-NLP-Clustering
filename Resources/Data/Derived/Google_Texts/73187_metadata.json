Alex Witt and various guests spent a good deal of time discussing Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s Friday appearance on The Tonight Show, and Witt seemed to take issue with this Cruz sound bite:\n\n\n\n\"I mean, I think the biggest divide we have is not between Republicans and Democrats. It is between entrenched politicians in both parties in Washington and the American people.\"\n\n\n\nWitt asked Lauren Fox of U.S. News & World Report for her take on that comment. The sly Fox twisted the meaning of Cruz\u2019s words: \u201cWell, I think what's interesting here is he's saying the biggest problem in Washington are those who are dug in on both sides.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat is almost certainly not what Cruz meant by \u201centrenched politicians.\u201d He would never suggest that someone who is \u201cdug in,\u201d like himself, is the problem in Washington. Fortunately, the rest of the Tonight Show interview gives us clues about what Cruz meant. In a segment that Witt didn\u2019t play, Cruz said this to Jay Leno: \u201cWell look, what I'm entrenched about is fighting for 26 million Texans... And you've got too many career politicians in Washington that want to just keep going down this road of more and more spending and taxes and regulation.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt seems apparent that Cruz was referring to career politicians when he referenced \u201centrenched politicians.\u201d But if that\u2019s not clear enough, here is another Cruz quote, as reported in a November 8 Bloomberg article: \u201cThe greatest divide we have in Washington is not between Republicans and Democrats. It\u2019s between entrenched career politicians in both parties and the American people.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat is almost identical to what he told Jay Leno, with one important difference: the reference to \u201centrenched career politicians\u201d rather than simply \u201centrenched politicians.\u201d The meaning is surely the same.\n\n\n\nBut Fox misconstrued Cruz\u2019s comment in order to slam him, which is what MSNBC loves to do, after all. She complained, \u201cBut if we look what Ted Cruz has meant for the U.S. Senate even among his Republican colleagues who have tried to moderate him a little bit, he is one of those entrenched politicians. So I think it's hard for him to strike a populist tone.\u201d\n\n\n\nGiven the true meaning of Cruz\u2019s words, Fox\u2019s analysis was reduced to a straw man argument.\n\nBelow is a transcript of the segment:\n\nALEX WITT: Well, let\u2019s listen to a little more of what he did say on the show. Lauren, let\u2019s take a listen.\n\n\n\nTED CRUZ: I think Americans are deeply frustrated that Washington is broken. And I think it's a bipartisan problem. I mean, I think the biggest divide we have is not between Republicans and Democrats. It is between entrenched politicians in both parties in Washington and the American people.\n\n\n\nWITT: Lauren, this is a man who is a champion of, the face of the Tea Party. He's trying to strike what sounds like a populist tone to me, an everyman tone. Does that resonate or fall flat?\n\n\n\nLAUREN FOX: Well, I think what's interesting here is he's saying the biggest problem in Washington are those who are dug in on both sides. But if we look what Ted Cruz has meant for the U.S. Senate even among his Republican colleagues who have tried to moderate him a little bit, he is one of those entrenched politicians. So I think it's hard for him to strike a populist tone. I think that he's got an incredible story and he's got an incredible message that really resonates with some Tea Party folks but when we're talking about poor Americans and when we\u2019re talking about striking a populist tone, I don't necessarily think that Ted Cruz is the guy to carry that message through. Although we'll see as we get closer to 2016. Maybe he'll be able to broaden his base and maybe this will be his message.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "Sometimes it\u2019s convenient for a journalist to misinterpret someone else\u2019s words in order to push his or her own narrative, and that was clearly what happened on Saturday\u2019s edition of Weekends with Alex Witt on MSNBC.
