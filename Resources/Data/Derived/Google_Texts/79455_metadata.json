Considering Homer\u2019s affinity for couches and anything donut-related, finding insight into Americans\u2019 psychological relationship with exercise and fitness also seems unlikely. But Northwestern researchers Hajo Adam and Adam Galinsky did just that. In \u201cTeam Homer,\u201d an episode from the series\u2019s seventh season, Springfield Elementary\u2019s newly-instituted drab grey uniform (instituted after Bart\u2019s \u201cDown With Homework\u201d tee causes an uproar) pushes the students into a zombie-like funk until a freak rainstorm washes off the dye, revealing the true color of the t-shirts: tie-dye. The students riot, and fun returns\u2014all because of their clothes. Researchers coined the term \"enclothed cognition\" to describe the mental changes we undergo when we wear certain clothing. \u201cWould this actually happen in the real world?\u201d Adam wondered. \u201cDoes the clothing we wear influence our own behavior and the way we think and act?\u201d According to their 2012 study, the answer is a firm yes. The two researchers coined the term \u201cenclothed cognition\u201d to describe the mental changes that we undergo when we wear certain clothing. Volunteers for the study were either outfitted in a lab coat or given nothing special to wear, and then performed attention-related tasks\u2014at which those wearing lab coats proved significantly more successful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the symbolic meaning that you associate with a particular item of clothing,\u201d Adam said. And he thinks the study\u2019s results can be applied to many more fields, including activewear and fitness. \u201cI think it would make sense that when you wear athletic clothing, you become more active and more likely to go to the gym and work out.\u201d Fitness apparel megalith Lululemon would seem to agree. Their endeavor to outfit the world in their $82 Wunder Unders has been incredibly successful. They certainly deserve a chunk of the credit for the recent activewear explosion, though the company did alienate some of its potential clients when its founder said its clothes aren\u2019t meant for some women\u2019s bodies. Wearing yoga pants on the sidewalk, to the grocery store, to class\u2014wherever\u2014used to be a thing to be mocked. No longer. Now, it\u2019s commonplace. On the surface, it looks like groupthink\u2014which is true, in part. \u201cYou think other people will think, if you\u2019re wearing those clothes, you\u2019re a workout woman! You must be really good at it,\u201d psychologist and personal trainer Susan Rudnicki says. \u201cI see girls at hatha yoga wearing Lululemon clothes, and they look the part, and I think: They must be really good. They have their life together. I\u2019m an instructor, and even I feel that.\u201d The activewear market grew 7 percent over the past year. In the same time, the general apparel market grew only 1 percent. When tops start at $42 a pop for a simple, Lycra/nylon blend tank, Lululemon is certainly doing a fantastic job convincing consumers that their brand is what they need. But the field is growing exponentially\u2014as of August, according to an NPD report, the activewear market had grown 7 percent over the previous year. In the same time, the general apparel market grew only 1 percent. More companies than ever now understand that women want both fashion and function in their gym clothing, and affordably-priced alternatives are everywhere. Donna Burke started scouting small, independent, below-the-radar fitness brands as a hobby after moving back to Atlanta after college and helping her sister open apparel store Atlanta Activewear. \u201cWe found these amazing quality independent brands that were based more on fashion and function than just function,\u201d she said. Soon, Burke turned her eye for high-quality, high-function apparel into a career, founding both her blog Yoga in Heels, where she blogs about trends in workout fashion, and online retailer ActivewearOutlet.com.\n\nIt\u2019s a big change from her days playing soccer in high school, \u201cback before they made uniforms for women, in the days where we had to wear the boys uniforms and everything hung off us. That was never fun,\u201d she says. It\u2019s no secret she\u2019s not a fan of Lululemon\u2014in one blog post condemning the brand for last March\u2019s see-through fabric fiasco, she writes, \u201cFor a company [whose] mantra states that friends are more important than money, the latest saga of the Lululemon brand shows otherwise.\u201d So Burke focuses on quality over big names, promoting small, high-fashion, high-tech apparel brands like MPG Sport and 15love, a line started by Nancie Tripodi, former director of The Gap. But just because it\u2019s not Lululemon or Athleta, Gap\u2019s high-end entry into the activewear field, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s cheap. Quality, long-lasting, butt-squeezing, sweat-wicking materials can be very expensive, but lower-cost imitators will do just fine if you\u2019re on a budget. And if you\u2019re seeking out activewear\u2019s positive psychological effects, anything that amps up your confidence will do. \u201cI think it doesn\u2019t matter as far as price point, if you feel good about yourself,\u201d Burke said. The desire to look good at the gym is nothing new\u2014just look to the neon leggings of Jazzercise yore. But athletic clothing today does more than make your butt look good at the gym: It\u2019s carefully designed to fit into your lifestyle, inside and outside the gym. Sure, wear it to workout. Then to the grocery store, where they promise you won\u2019t look out of place. If the trend holds, soon you\u2019ll never change out of your gym clothes, throwing on compression leggings for work and for trips to the mall. Rudnicki says the change is stark\u2014fitness classes today are much more fashionable compared to the first ones she taught five years ago. But if you\u2019re buying more into the brand than yourself, it might be a matter of fitting in, not getting fit. Lululemon has been called \u201ccult-like.\u201d In one interview with Business Insider, an employee says new employees are indoctrinated with motivational CDs and Malcolm Gladwell books, and to succeed, \u201cYou have to drink the Kool-Aid a bit, and if you're not going to drink it, you won't do well and you probably won't like it.\u201d Even their approach to commission is communal, with every employee getting their share of the store\u2019s sales. Enclothed cognition isn't a substitute for intrinsic motivation. Controversies aside\u2014and there have been many\u2014the business model has been immensely successful. Lululemon is the first company to figure out how to wheedle athletics into the lifestyle of your average Jane. And as it turns out, your average Jane likes feeling sporty. Gym clothes are no longer hidden away in a bag, they\u2019re proudly on display in your street, your office, your grocery store. Granted, just because you\u2019ve stocked up on tight pants and breathable tees doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll become a robot, slave to the gym. Rudnicki advises just picking up a few items at a time. \u201cPeople who get a totally new wardrobe\u2014that\u2019s never a really good sign. Too much, too fast to accommodate your routine and lifestyle,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Does expensive athletic wear actually incline us to work out? \"Enclothed cognition\" proposes that the clothes you wear directly affect how we think and what we do.", "author": "Jamie Wiebe", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Does expensive athletic wear actually incline us to work out? \"Enclothed cognition\" proposes that the clothes you wear directly affect how we think and what we do.", "title": "Psychology of Lululemon: How Fashion Affects Fitness", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/RTX10WCT/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/psychology-of-lululemon-how-fashion-affects-fitness/281959/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd6ac\"", "article_summary": "More companies than ever now understand that women want both fashion and function in their gym clothing, and affordably-priced alternatives are everywhere.\nGym clothes are no longer hidden away in a bag, they\u2019re proudly on display in your street, your office, your grocery store.\n\u201cYou think other people will think, if you\u2019re wearing those clothes, you\u2019re a workout woman!\n\u201cI see girls at hatha yoga wearing Lululemon clothes, and they look the part, and I think: They must be really good.\nIf the trend holds, soon you\u2019ll never change out of your gym clothes, throwing on compression leggings for work and for trips to the mall."}
