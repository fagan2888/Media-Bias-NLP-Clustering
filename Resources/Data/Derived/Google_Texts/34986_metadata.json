Ad Policy\n\nThe president won\u2019t be able to look to organized labor. Unions are overwhelmingly opposed to a deal that Communications Workers of America posters refer to as \u201cNAFTA on Steroids.\u201d\n\nThe president won\u2019t be able to look to major environmental organizations. The Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth and other green groups are outspoken in their opposition.\n\nThe president won\u2019t be able to look to progressive farm groups. The National Farmers Union is explicitly opposed to using a fast-track approach that would allow trade agreements to move through Congress with limited debate and without amendments.\n\nIn fact, if Obama decides to ramp up his advocacy for a free-trade strategy that progressive Americans tend to see as a threat to workers, farmers, the environment, human rights and democracy, he won\u2019t be able to count on many traditional allies to stir up grassroots support in the states. That\u2019s one of the reasons there remains considerable uncertainty about whether the president really will\u2014in a speech that is expected to focus on income equality\u2014spend substantial time talking up a trade agenda that has drawn broad opposition from House and Senate Democrats and so much of his base.\n\nIf the president does go all in for the TPP, he will find himself in strange company\u2014with groups that promote policies that critics argue are responsible for the growing gap between a wealthy few and an increasingly impoverished many.\n\nThere is, for instance, one group that maintains an extensive network of political connections in states across the country and is enthusiastically on board for \u201cthe expedited conclusions and approval of the TPP.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/alec_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "John Nichols", "description": "The American Legislative Exchange Council is circulating a \"Model Policy\" resolution endorsing the Trans-Pacific Partnership.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "The American Legislative Exchange Council is circulating a \"Model Policy\" resolution endorsing the Trans-Pacific Partnership.", "title": "Who Backs the TPP and a \u2018NAFTA on Steroids\u2019?
