Associated Press\n\nBy Dave Caldwell\n\nThe start of the first hockey game to be played at Yankee Stadium was delayed Sunday afternoon because of glare on the ice that created unsafe playing conditions, the NHL announced.\n\nThe start of the game was to be delayed by about an hour, with the puck now slated to drop at 1:38 p.m. The opening faceoff between the Rangers and Devils was to be at 12:30 p.m.; the NHL said the teams will start warmups at 1 p.m.\n\nThe temperature at the scheduled game time in the Bronx was 23 degrees, with a wind-chill factor of 14 degrees. But it was also sunny, which prompted the grounds crew to delay pulling a sheet of plastic off the rink built on the Yankee Stadium diamond. The conditions didn\u2019t stop youth players in Rangers and Devils jerseys from playing a pickup game on a smaller rink in front of the main rink.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The start of the first hockey game to be played at Yankee Stadium was delayed Sunday afternoon because of glare on the ice that created unsafe playing conditions, the NHL announced.", "title": "Yankee Stadium Hockey Game Delayed by Glare", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/01/26/yankee-stadium-hockey-game-delayed-by-glare/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BG048_012614_P_20140126122909.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Yankee Stadium Hockey Game Delayed by Glare", "description": "The start of the first hockey game to be played at Yankee Stadium was delayed Sunday afternoon because of glare on the ice that created unsafe playing conditions, the NHL announced.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Carrie Melago", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "The start of the first hockey game to be played at Yankee Stadium was delayed Sunday afternoon because of glare on the ice that created unsafe playing conditions, the NHL announced.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-01-26T17:50:02-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/01/26/yankee-stadium-hockey-game-delayed-by-glare/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-19693", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The start of the first hockey game to be played at Yankee Stadium was delayed Sunday afternoon because of glare on the ice that created unsafe playing conditions, the NHL announced.", "title": "Yankee Stadium Hockey Game Delayed by Glare", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/01/26/yankee-stadium-hockey-game-delayed-by-glare/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BG048_012614_P_20140126122909.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-19693", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-01-26T17:52:22-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf138\"", "article_summary": "Associated PressBy Dave CaldwellThe start of the first hockey game to be played at Yankee Stadium was delayed Sunday afternoon because of glare on the ice that created unsafe playing conditions, the NHL announced.\nThe rink is covered to protect the ice before an NHL outdoor hockey game between the New Jersey Devils and the New York Rangers at Yankee Stadium on Sunday.\nBut it was also sunny, which prompted the grounds crew to delay pulling a sheet of plastic off the rink built on the Yankee Stadium diamond.\nThe start of the game was to be delayed by about an hour, with the puck now slated to drop at 1:38 p.m.\nThe conditions didn\u2019t stop youth players in Rangers and Devils jerseys from playing a pickup game on a smaller rink in front of the main rink."}
