In just a few short weeks, hundreds of people will descend upon Capitol Hill to advocate for the needs and interests of people living with HIV and AIDS.

AIDSWatch, presented by the Elizabeth Taylor Foundation, is an opportunity for people living with, and affected by, HIV to educate Members of Congress on the important issues facing the community. Held every year in Washington, D.C., AIDSWatch is the “nation’s largest annual constituent-based national HIV/AIDS advocacy event.”

While we have recently seen tremendous progress in the realms of HIV prevention, treatment, and care, several challenges still exist for people living with HIV and AIDS. From state and local issues such as HIV criminalization, to the preservation of critical federal health programs like the Ryan White Care Program and the Affordable Care Act, it is incumbent upon each and every one of us to lend our support to these important efforts, which is why HRC is proud to co-sponsor the event.

Organizers of AIDSWatch 2015 are calling on people nationwide to join them in Washington, D.C. from April 13-14, especially fair-minded Americans living in Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

With more than 300 registrants, it is critically important every member of Congress hears directly from constituents in their district or state.
