It's been more than a week since Sandy Meekins was found dead after being shot at a Graceville apartment.

Sunday, many throughout the community came out to support her family with a fundraiser,as they prepare for the future.

For Rod Adams and Sam Gordon, their memories of Meekins are those of a mom dedicated to her children.

"She was just a loving, a loving woman," Adams said. "She loved kids, and was always helping out at the ballpark."

"She was always smiling and just a great person to be around," Gordon said. "She was our dugout mom and sideline coach for football."

But after Meekins' death, they said the recovery has been tough.

"It's just been real hard. I'm feeling for the family and the loss they're going through," Adams said. "There's no way we can know what they're actually going through."

But since then, they decided to help.

Sunday's fundraiser featured barbecue lunch plates served for $7, along with raffles for several items, with all proceeds going towards Meekins' funeral expenses and her children.

"Both the kids have a wonderful future ahead of them," Gordon said. "Anything we can do to help prepare for their future is what we want to do."

As they prepare to move forward, Meekins' family say they're grateful for the community's response.

"All I can say is just I thank them from the bottom of my heart," Cleao Meekins, Sandy's mother, said. "I just can't believe the turnout and how everybody just helped. I'm so proud of them for helping us out."

"It shows the love that's in this community," Adams said. "There's a lot of good people around here, and to come together like this for the family, is just what needs to be done."

Gordon says they ended up making more than 400 plates at the fundraiser.

According to Adams and Gordon, people can either drop off or mail donations to the Sandy Meekins Memorial Fund at People's Bank of Graceville located at 5306 Brown St., Graceville, FL 32440.
