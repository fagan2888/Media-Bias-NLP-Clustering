They\u2019re so afraid to hear people disagree with them. Instead of ignoring it or providing their own arguments in return, they say \u2018Shut up!\u2019\n\nBaldwin, who is not related to the acting Baldwin brothers, had 230,000 Twitter followers. He deleted his entire Twitter history Monday except for a tweet calling for the dismissal of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and a disbanding of the new Trust and Safety Council.\n\nHi @Twitter: Fire @jack and disband the 'Trust and Safety' Council. Here's why:https://t.co/TwHxVGr429 \u2014 Adam Baldwin (@AdamBaldwin) February 22, 2016\n\nTwitter announced earlier this month it was forming a Trust and Safety Council to provide input on \u201ctools and policies\u201d that will help users \u201cexpress themselves freely and safely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis group-think, Orwellian, so-called Safety Council is really killing the wild West of ideas that Twitter was,\u201d Baldwin told Independent Journal Review.\n\nA statement on the Trust and Safety Council\u2019s homepage says:\n\nTo help give your voice more power, Twitter does not tolerate behavior intended to harass, intimidate, or use fear to silence another user\u2019s voice. Working together, we will ensure Twitter is a platform where anyone, anywhere can express themselves safely and confidently.\n\nTrust and Safety Council members include liberal groups such as the Dangerous Speech Project, the LGBT advocacy group GLAAD, and the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nFeminist and activist Anita Sarkeesian, who sparked controversy with her critique of how women are portrayed in video games, is also a member of the council through her charity Feminist Frequency.\n\n\u201c[Screenwriter-director] Joss Whedon got off Twitter and that really shocked me \u2026 Sarkeesian had a big hand in Joss leaving,\u201d Baldwin, who starred in Whedon\u2019s science fiction TV show \u201cFirefly,\u201d said.\n\nIn a 2015 Buzzfeed interview, Whedon denied claims he left Twitter because of \u201cmilitant feminists\u201d and lauded Sarkeesian for her effort to \u201cstay on Twitter and fight back the trolls.\u201d\n\nMike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at The Heritage Foundation and frequent Twitter user, told The Daily Signal he has \u201creservations about this, especially because there are liberal groups on it but no conservatives.\u201d\n\nGonzalez wrote about the council for The Daily Signal in a piece headlined \u201cIs Twitter Censoring Non-Politically Correct Viewpoints?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a private company, Twitter can do what it wants, but in a country fairly split down the middle, it doesn\u2019t make good business sense to alienate one half,\u201d Gonzalez said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Firefly\" actor deletes his entire Twitter history except for a single tweet aimed at Twitter's new Trust and Safety Council.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The \"Firefly\" actor deletes his entire Twitter history except for a single tweet aimed at Twitter's new Trust and Safety Council.", "title": "Why Twitter Is 'Dead' to Adam Baldwin", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160223_TweetBaldwin_Barillas.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-24T13:08:25+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1p195to"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The \"Firefly\" actor deletes his entire Twitter history except for a single tweet aimed at Twitter's new Trust and Safety Council.", "title": "Why Twitter Is 'Dead' to Adam Baldwin", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160223_TweetBaldwin_Barillas.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "individual freedom", "published_time": "2016-02-23T13:30:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-24T13:08:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "adam baldwin, quits, twitter, protest, free speech, council, Trust and Safety Council, Joss Whedon, Robert Stacy McCain, Anita Sarkeesian"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7331\"", "article_summary": "Twitter is dead to me,\u201d Adam Baldwin told Independent Journal Review.\nBaldwin told Independent Journal Review:It\u2019s really a shame that so-called \u2018liberal thinkers\u2019 and the so-called \u2018tolerant crowd\u2019 [are] intolerant of varying viewpoints.\nHe deleted his entire Twitter history Monday except for a tweet calling for the dismissal of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and a disbanding of the new Trust and Safety Council.\nHi @Twitter: Fire @jack and disband the 'Trust and Safety' Council.\n\u201c[Screenwriter-director] Joss Whedon got off Twitter and that really shocked me \u2026 Sarkeesian had a big hand in Joss leaving,\u201d Baldwin, who starred in Whedon\u2019s science fiction TV show \u201cFirefly,\u201d said."}
