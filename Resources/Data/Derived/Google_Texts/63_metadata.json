Even the Washington Post noted last year that the president \u201cfalls short\u201d of delivering on his ambitious vow of an \u201cunprecedented level of openness.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama, however, now has an opportunity to make progress in this realm by releasing 28 pages of previously classified documents from the bipartisan congressional investigation into 9/11. The Bush administration withheld the papers from the final report, citing a concern that they could compromise intelligence gathering methods.\n\nMore likely, they were kept from the American public in an effort to appease Saudi Arabia, which many suspect of having at least indirectly funded some of those involved in the terror attack.\n\nRecent news reports indicate that President Obama has asked intelligence officials to review the documents to determine whether they can be declassified. \u201cWhen that is done, we\u2019d expect that there will be some degree of declassification that provides more information,\u201d Ben Rhodes, the president\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said last week.\n\nThe move is long overdue.\n\n\u201cI hope the decision is to honor the American people and make it available,\u201d Bob Graham, a former Democratic senator from Florida who co-chaired the 9/11 panel, said over the weekend on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nWhile no documents, testimony or historical perspective can ever squelch the fervor and fantasies of the most rabid conspiracy theorists, release of the papers might help dispel the unfortunate and unfounded notion that the federal government was somehow complicit in the tragedy or has something to hide. A continued resistance to providing this information to the public will only further fuel skepticism and distrust.\n\nThose who have seen the papers indicate they may prompt questions about the relationship some Saudi officials had with the 19 hijackers, 15 of whom were Saudi nationals. \u201cWe did not discover \u2026 Saudi government involvement at the highest level of the 9/11 attacks,\u201d former congressman Tim Roemer, a member of the 9/11 panel, told the Associated Press. But \u201cwe certainly did not exonerate the Saudis. \u2026 Saudi was a fertile ground for fundraising for al-Qaida.\u201d\n\nThe AP reports that the Saudis claim they welcome the release of the documents as a means to \u201callow us to respond to any allegations in a clear and credible manner.\u201d Fine, but who cares? At this point, the Obama administration should be more concerned about providing Americans access to relevant papers offering insight into the country\u2019s deadliest terror attack than about shielding an ally from potential embarrassment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "American public deserves to know", "parsely-tags": "Editorials,Editorials,Opinion", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-declassifying-911-documents", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-2183121"}, "author": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "parsely-title": "Editorial: Declassifying 9/11 documents", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-declassifying-911-documents", "title": "Editorial: Declassifying 9/11 documents", "description": "American public deserves to know", "card": "summary", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=6252691", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=6252691", "app_name": "review-journal", "app_store_id": 540820524}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Editorials,Editorials, Opinion,", "parsely-section": "Editorials", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-25T21:00:08-07:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "American public deserves to know", "title": "Editorial: Declassifying 9/11 documents", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-declassifying-911-documents", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/defaultimage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/defaultimage.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-04-26T04:00:08Z"}, "article_summary": "The Obama administration has a lackluster track record when it comes to transparency and open government.\nRecent news reports indicate that President Obama has asked intelligence officials to review the documents to determine whether they can be declassified.\n\u201cWe did not discover \u2026 Saudi government involvement at the highest level of the 9/11 attacks,\u201d former congressman Tim Roemer, a member of the 9/11 panel, told the Associated Press.\nThe Bush administration withheld the papers from the final report, citing a concern that they could compromise intelligence gathering methods.\nAt this point, the Obama administration should be more concerned about providing Americans access to relevant papers offering insight into the country\u2019s deadliest terror attack than about shielding an ally from potential embarrassment."}
