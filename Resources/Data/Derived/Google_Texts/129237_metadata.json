Shortly after the Sebelius letter, however, the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight released guidance discouraging provider and payers from making any premium payments on behalf of individuals enrolled in QHPs operating in state and federal exchanges.\n\nSince last fall, there has been a lingering question over whether a third-party can pay premiums for individuals enrolled in health plans offered on state and federal insurance exchanges. An interim final rule that recently arrived at the Office of Management and Budget for review soon might help answer that question. While the contents of the final rule (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Third Party Payment of Qualified Health Plan (QHP) Premiums) are unknown, it can hopefully alleviate provider uncertainty. Under Executive Order 12866, issued in September 1993, all significant regulatory actions have to be reviewed by the OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs prior to taking effect.\n\nYour HR and Payroll compliance and policy solution!
