“Saturday Night Live” took a swing at “Fox & Friends” this weekend, relentlessly mocking the news program for its coverage of the Affordable Care Act and global warming.

“And, now that the deadline has passed, the White House is ‘claiming’ that they met their goal,” the actor playing the show’s Steve Doocy said.

“But, look at our Fox News chart,” SNL’s Elisabeth Hasselbeck said. “As you can see Obama needed to get 7 million new subscribers and he only got 7.1 million. Not even close.”

The actor playing host Brian Kilmeade then showed off his version of a “pie chart.”

Later in the segment, the “Fox & Friends” crew welcomed Neil DeGrasse Tyson as the “science guy,” who insisted to the hosts that science has unequivocally determined the globe is warming.

“It is an indisputable fact that the earth is getting warmer,” he said.

SNL’s Doocy quickly dismissed him, however, citing the polar vortex and Coca-Cola’s happy, soda-drinking mascot.
