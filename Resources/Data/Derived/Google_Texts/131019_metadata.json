At least a dozen sentinel chickens have tested positive throughout the county.\n\nHuard said West Nile is serious, but there are there are multiple mosquito-borne viruses to be concerned about\n\n\"There's five different arbo-viruses currently circulating in our community and that's why we put an advisory out,\u201d Huard said.\n\nOf the 80 species of mosquitoes that live in Florida, two species are container breeders.
