NEWARK - Newark police officials say a cyberattack shut down some of their computer systems for three days last week.

But they say the attack didn’t disrupt the delivery of emergency services. And there’s no indication that any information stored on the affected servers was compromised.

Acting Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose told NJ.com (http://bit.ly/23NRHam) that department staffers couldn’t access the various systems while crews worked to clear servers of a virus implanted during the attack.

The virus temporarily locked down the servers, blocking access to the program used to track and analyze crime data and another used to dispatch police and emergency officers.

A backup system was used for dispatch services.

Department officials wouldn’t say what security measures failed during the attack. But they say additional safeguards have been implemented to “reduce the likelihood” of another attack.
