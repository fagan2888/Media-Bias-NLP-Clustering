The person puts a bag down on a shopping cart, pulls out what appears to be a gun, steps outside and then points the apparent weapon. As another person runs by, the first person shuffle-steps to keep pace, apparently still pointing the gun.\n\nIn the other, the gunman is seen shooting outside. Nearby, but not in the path of the shooting, alarmed patrons who were in what appeared to be an establishment\u2019s outdoor seating area hurry away.\n\nTwo Israeli nationals were killed, Rosenfeld said. Four other people were seriously injured, and three were moderately injured, he said.\n\nPolice said the attack took place at 130 Dizenghof Street. The business at that location is called Sidewalk Cafe.\n\nIsrael has recently been hit by a wave of stabbings and other kinds of attacks on civilians and soldiers, a wave apparently not directed by any particular organization.\n\nTwo witnesses told Israeli news outlets that someone dressed all in black, with a black mask, carried out the attack with what looked like a military-style assault rifle, CNN\u2019s Ian Lee reported. Police have not confirmed witness accounts about what the attacker was wearing.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "32.085300;34.781768", "description": "TEL AVIV, Israel\u00a0--\u00a0A gunman sprayed bullets from an automatic weapon near a pub in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv on Friday afternoon, killing two people and injuring at least seven others before fleeing, sparking a massive manhunt, police said.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "6234caa106890daf4037e63d88245e14"}, "og": {"site_name": "FOX6Now.com", "description": "TEL AVIV, Israel\u00a0\u2014\u00a0A gunman sprayed bullets from an automatic weapon near a pub in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv on Friday afternoon, killing two people and injuring at least seven others befo\u2026", "title": "Police: Two killed, at least seven wounded in Tel Aviv pub shooting", "url": "http://fox6now.com/2016/01/01/police-two-killed-at-least-four-wounded-in-tel-aviv-pub-shooting/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/s058087922.jpg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/s058087922.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox6now", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox6now"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=334682375", "fb": {"pages": 7010901522}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox6now.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/6c174f1af90d3de8afc154eb8bcd6c4a?s=16", "application-name": "FOX6Now.com", "ICBM": "32.085300, 34.781768", "keywords": "news, israel, tel aviv", "google-site-verification": "iXLB9DCJ8o44w3SHddEhtmvCXRUfxQCVRXXMHkyL6jI", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox6news", "published_time": "2016-01-01T16:14:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-01T17:43:07+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox6news"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u00d7 Police: Two killed, at least seven wounded in Tel Aviv pub shootingTEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 A gunman sprayed bullets from an automatic weapon near a pub in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv on Friday afternoon, killing two people and injuring at least seven others before fleeing, sparking a massive manhunt, police said.\nMore than 15 rounds were fired in \u201ca number of different directions\u201d on a sidewalk and in the pub on Dizenghof Street, Rosenfeld said.\nIn one video, the apparent gunman stands in a store moments before the shooting.\n\u201cThe Israeli national police \u2026 are still investigating and trying to determine whether it is a terrorist attack or a criminal \u2026 incident,\u201d Rosenfeld said.\nAs another person runs by, the first person shuffle-steps to keep pace, apparently still pointing the gun."}
