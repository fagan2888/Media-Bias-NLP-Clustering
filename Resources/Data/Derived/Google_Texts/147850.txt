Medical inflation has remained remarkably low for the past several months, but that may change as 2014 wears on, according to Goldman Sachs analyst Alec Phillips.

In a note to clients issued Tuesday, Phillips points out that Medicare reimbursement cuts have kept medical inflation to a minimum, as judged by the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, or PCE. That measure examines nearly all health spending, while the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, looks only at expenditures for consumers and suggests medical costs are rising at a faster pace.

He says low inflation could linger because insurers have been basing their reimbursement rates on Medicare. But those Medicare cuts came about due to sequestration measures initiated in April that will soon fall out of year-on-year comparisons. Further, the effect of Medicare payment reductions initiated under Obamacare won’t be as great this year as they have been in the past two years, Phillips says.

“Medical price inflation has been unusually restrained over the last several months, reaching a near-record low 1.1% year-on-year increase in August, and hovering just above that level since. While some of this reflects low inflation in the broader economy and it is possible that some of the slowing could signal an easing of medical price inflation for other reasons, we believe that much of the recent trend is also clearly due to exogenous policy influences,” such as the sequestration impact, Phillips says.
