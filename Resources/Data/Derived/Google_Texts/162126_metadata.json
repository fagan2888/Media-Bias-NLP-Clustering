It has its share of fans who boast its ability to clear users' bodies of impurities, but with no scientific evidence backing the product\u2019s beauty claims, some experts aren\u2019t so sure if activated charcoal's popularity is based on actual results or simply the bandwagon effect.\n\nWendy Brooks, the director of global product developments at the beauty company, Origins, told the NY Daily News that charcoal \u201cis known to absorb 100 to 200 times its weight in impurities.\u201d Due to this, she believes that activated charcoal is \u201can excellent natural ingredient to help purify and deep-clean skin.\u201d The oxygenated carbon is crushed into and blended into a soft black mixture that can be applied to one\u2019s face and body. The treatment isn\u2019t cheap, however, with one upscale New York City spa offering the Charcoal Facial for $260.\n\nThe toxin absorption abilities of activated charcoal have long been recognized by the medical world. Health professionals use the substance to treat conditions such as poisonings, GI tract infections, and nausea. As for scientific proof of beauty benefits, at this point there isn\u2019t any. Dermatologist Craig Kraffert suggests that the product\u2019s success may be slightly due to human\u2019s natural fascination with the strange or unknown. \u201cUsing a pitch-black product to purify the skin sounds both intriguing and cool \u2026 the uniqueness of the ingredient itself, especially its color, is likely the main driver behind the recent surge in popularity of activated charcoal facial cleansers and masks,\u201d Kraffert told the Daily News.\n\nDespite the lack of empirical evidence, the world seems to love their activated charcoal treatments. A WhaTech press release reported that the global market for activated carbon is expected to reach $5,305 by the year 2020, with the Asian Pacific market forecasted to be the fasted growing regional market.\n\nIn the digital age, it\u2019s not hard to find a wide assortment of blogger\u2019s praising the charcoal\u2019s abilities. \u201cIt makes your face dark, but it draws out impurities from your pores,\u201d said blogger Shiva Rose on her site The Local Rose. Rose also ingests the charcoal in the form of a capsule to help with an internal cleanse. Nutritionist Lisa Cimperman, although not exactly denying charcoal\u2019s cleansing abilities, suggests that taking the capsules for something other than a medical emergency may not be necessary. \u201cThe human body is already well-equipped to remove toxins,\u201d explained Cimperman to the Daily News. \u201cEverybody has everything that they need to remove toxins as it is, so no supplement or juice is going to improve upon that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "activated, charcoal, beauty, now, latest, health, fad, clinical, benefits, still, unknown", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Activated charcoal is the newest beauty trend, but not all experts are so sold on its skin and teeth purification claims.", "title": "Activated Charcoal More Popular With Beauty Bloggers Than With Scientists", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/activated-charcoal-beauty-now-latest-health-fad-clinical-benefits-still-unknown-296352", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/04/charcoal.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Activated charcoal is the newest beauty trend, but not all experts are so sold on its skin and teeth purification claims.", "title": "Activated Charcoal More Popular With Beauty Bloggers Than With Scientists", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/activated-charcoal-beauty-now-latest-health-fad-clinical-benefits-still-unknown-296352", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/04/charcoal.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/04/charcoal.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-08-04T14:00:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-04T14:00:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Activated charcoal is the newest beauty trend, but not all experts are so sold on its skin and teeth purification claims."}, "article_summary": "Activated charcoal is one of the newest must-have beauty products to hit the market.\nDespite the lack of empirical evidence, the world seems to love their activated charcoal treatments.\nThe toxin absorption abilities of activated charcoal have long been recognized by the medical world.\nIn the digital age, it\u2019s not hard to find a wide assortment of blogger\u2019s praising the charcoal\u2019s abilities.\nThe treatment isn\u2019t cheap, however, with one upscale New York City spa offering the Charcoal Facial for $260."}
