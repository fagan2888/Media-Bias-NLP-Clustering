(AP) - There is a summer camp where campers climb to the top of a mountain, then descend to the shores of the sea over the course of five days.\n\nExperience The Wild is a free day camp for 8- to 12-year-olds. It is sponsored by the Pacific Northwest Trail Association and the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nCampers participate each day in hiking, outdoor safety and hands-on projects to learn about the forest and build skills for safe recreation in the outdoors. The camp is focused on getting outside - exploring, learning, doing and experiencing the wild.\n\n\u201cThis is the third year we have offered the camp,\u201d said Samantha Hale, marketing and communications manager for the trail association. \u201cIt\u2019s funded by the Forest Service. Camps run for three consecutive weeks, so we try and mix things up for those kids who attend more than one week.\u201d\n\nOne such kid was 9-year-old Calvin Howard. The fifth-grader at Mount Vernon\u2019s Washington Elementary School was wrapping up his second consecutive week at the camp.\n\n\u201cThis has been really cool,\u201d said Howard of the camp. \u201cIt\u2019s been so much fun. I like everything we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nDeb Wyman, who led the camp, said kids come back year after year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a great camp for the kids,\u201d Wyman said. \u201cIt\u2019s structured just enough to go with the flow. We can change it up dependent on the kids. The kids just love it and it doesn\u2019t matter what their background is. They all end up making friends, having a lot of fun outside and learning about nature.\u201d\n\nThe camp\u2019s focus was clear.\n\n\u201cStewardship is what this is all about,\u201d Hale said. \u201cThe camp is centered around this big trail. A big, big trail from the mountains to the sea. We want them to learn how it is all connected. And, of course, to gain some understanding of what we at the PNTA do and what it takes to build and maintain trails.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the final day of the camp, the group gathered at the Samish Overlook on the flanks of Blanchard Mountain to learn about the tools used in trail-building.\n\nPNTA member Christian Warman unloaded numerous tools used on trails, then explained the proper and safe use of each as the group of hard hat-wearing campers looked on. Grub hoes, McLeods, rock bars, Pulaskis and shovels were passed around so campers could get a feel for what they would soon be wielding.\n\n\u201cYou throw the brush to the downhill side,\u201d Warman said. \u201cWe want it to look as natural as possible.\u201d\n\nThe group then put what it learned into practice, improving a short section of the Pacific Northwest Trail.\n\nOnce on the trail, campers such as Emily Southard got to work. The La Conner third-grader was finding it a bit difficult to cut branches using the pair of loppers she\u2019d be given. But undeterred, she managed to get the best of the stubborn branch.\n\n\u201cThis is my first time at this camp,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to other camps, but none like this.\u201d\n\nAnd what did Southard think about the trail-building portion of camp?\n\n\u201cI like to help,\u201d she said. \u201cI work my butt off at home and do a lot of yard work. This is like that.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, campers hiked the Beaver Lake Trail in Darrington and were taken on an interpretive hike by a ranger. In earlier weeks, campers climbed to the summit of Sauk Mountain and hiked along the East Baker Lake Trail.\n\nOn Wednesday, they visited Taylor Shellfish Farm.\n\nWhile at the farm, campers were given a tour by Nicole Gilmore, who earned her money as rain fell and the tide was in, all but submerging the farm. She still managed to keep the kids enthralled, detailing the aspects of growing, harvesting and selling bivalves such as oysters, clams, mussels and, of course, the geoduck.\n\nGilmore disappeared inside a refrigerated container and returned with said geoduck. Right on cue, the mollusk spewed saltwater out the top of its elongated siphon as it attempted to cram its oversized appendages into its small shell.\n\nOf course, the group erupted in a chorus of giggles and laughs.\n\nAs the six-pound geoduck was passed around, Gilmore said the average age of a Puget Sound geoduck is 39. The oldest on record lived to 165.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t drop it,\u201d she said as kids fumbled to grasp the awkward sea creature. \u201cThey are expensive, weighing in at $30 per pound.\u201d\n\nThe tour ended with a walk out to the only lighthouse in the world constructed solely of oyster shells.\n\nThe group toured the Marblemount Fish Hatchery on Tuesday, and started the week Monday at the Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve with a side trip to Washington Park in Anacortes.\n\n\u201cI love the outdoors,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI really like to hike. Last week, we got to climb a mountain. That was a lot of fun. I have learned so much. Now I want to get out and build trails.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Skagit Valley Herald, http://www.skagitvalleyherald.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "There is a summer camp where campers climb to the top of a mountain, then descend to the shores of the sea over the course of five days.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "There is a summer camp where campers climb to the top of a mountain, then descend to the shores of the sea over the course of five days.", "title": "Kids get outdoors in \u2018Experience The Wild\u2019 camp", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/16/kids-get-outdoors-in-experience-the-wild-camp/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/16/d7e09660109aeb247e0f6a706700dd0c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/16/d7e09660109aeb247e0f6a706700dd0c.jpg", "description": "There is a summer camp where campers climb to the top of a mountain, then descend to the shores of the sea over the course of five days.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Kids get outdoors in \u2018Experience The Wild\u2019 camp"}, "Author": "VINCE RICHARDSON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf98\"", "article_summary": "I like everything we\u2019ve done.\u201dDeb Wyman, who led the camp, said kids come back year after year.\nExperience The Wild is a free day camp for 8- to 12-year-olds.\nThe fifth-grader at Mount Vernon\u2019s Washington Elementary School was wrapping up his second consecutive week at the camp.\n\u201cThis is the third year we have offered the camp,\u201d said Samantha Hale, marketing and communications manager for the trail association.\nThe camp is focused on getting outside - exploring, learning, doing and experiencing the wild."}
