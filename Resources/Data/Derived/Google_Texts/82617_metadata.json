WellCare, which specializes in supervising Medicaid and Medicare programs, says the fee will likely end up costing between $125 million and $135 million but does not include state Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nThat\u2019s on top of as much as $1.19 in additional expenses WellCare anticipates during the year, such as corporate infrastructure investments, growth initiatives and interest expense increases. WellCare says its capital expenditures will jump as much as 50% during the year.\n\nWellCare says it now expects full-year adjusted earnings to wind up between $3.75 to $4.05 a share, more than a dollar lower than the $5.08 projection from analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nFor the quarter, the company said net income was $42.9 million, or 97 cents a share, compared with $48.8 million, or $1.11 a share, for the same period a year ago. Adjusted income of $1.09 a share was off from the $1.15 forecast.\n\nRevenue, however, was up to $2.44 billion from last year\u2019s $1.99 billion, and slightly beat the $2.42 billion FactSet forecast.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw.\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog.\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nThe Onion gets planted in Land of Lincoln to promote Obamacare\n\nWalgreen\u2019s record move a mystery; talk centers on London meetings\n\nMolina tumbles on earnings, but analysts say reaction is premature", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-02-12T11:17:17-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "An earnings miss and expected losses related to Obamacare sends managed care provider WellCare Health Plans Inc. shares tumbling.", "title": "WellCare shares tumble on profit miss, expected Obamacare costs", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/12/wellcare-shares-tumble-on-profit-miss-expected-obamacare-costs/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU483_health_MG_20140212110514.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "earnings,Medicaid,Medicare,Obamacare,WellCare Health Plans Inc.", "article.headline": "WellCare shares tumble on profit miss, expected Obamacare costs", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "earnings,Medicaid,Medicare,Obamacare,WellCare Health Plans Inc.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "An earnings miss and expected losses related to Obamacare sends managed care provider WellCare Health Plans Inc. shares tumbling.", "article.published": "2014-02-12T11:17:17-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/12/wellcare-shares-tumble-on-profit-miss-expected-obamacare-costs/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "An earnings miss and expected losses related to Obamacare sends managed care provider WellCare Health Plans Inc. shares tumbling.", "title": "WellCare shares tumble on profit miss, expected Obamacare costs", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/12/wellcare-shares-tumble-on-profit-miss-expected-obamacare-costs/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU483_health_MG_20140212110514.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2066", "article.updated": "2014-02-12T11:17:47-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8d6\"", "article_summary": "An earnings miss and expected losses related to Obamacare sent managed-care provider WellCare Health Plans Inc.\u2019s shares tumbling Wednesday, with the stock falling by more than 7% at one point in early trading.\nAdjusted income of $1.09 a share was off from the $1.15 forecast.\nWellCare /quotes/zigman/341770/delayed /quotes/nls/wcg WCG was off $4.10 to $58.12 in recent action, a drop of more than 6.5%.\nRevenue, however, was up to $2.44 billion from last year\u2019s $1.99 billion, and slightly beat the $2.42 billion FactSet forecast.\nWellCare says it now expects full-year adjusted earnings to wind up between $3.75 to $4.05 a share, more than a dollar lower than the $5.08 projection from analysts polled by FactSet."}
