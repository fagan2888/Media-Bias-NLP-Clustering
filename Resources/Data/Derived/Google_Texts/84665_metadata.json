This is particularly challenging if an employer's workforce includes employees whose hours vary from week to week, like a substitute teacher or nurse,\" said Susan Relland, vice president of AFAS.\n\nLarge employers (with 50 plus full-time equivalent employees) that fail to offer adequate and affordable coverage to all full-time employees could trigger a Free Rider Penalty. This requires employers to know who their full-time employees are and how many of them are eligible for coverage during any given month. AFAS has partnered with WorxTime, a leading-edge eligibility management system, to offer employers a solution for tracking hours and managing eligibility in connection with the Free Rider Penalty.\n\nWorxTime monitors employee hours in real time and sends automated alerts to the employer when action is required. It also offers several other features, including calculating whether an employee will be considered full time; providing affordability testing, rate of pay safe harbor testing and a penalty calculator; and capturing information that will need to be reported to the IRS. AFAS is currently offering WorxTime at a discounted rate to customers, and customers who sign up by Jan. 1, 2014, will receive two free months of WorxTime. Anyone interested in learning more may sign up for a free webinar offered on Oct. 30 and Nov. 14, 2013.\n\n\"Our goal is to provide an end-to-end solution for employers to help them deal with the ongoing challenges created by Health Care Reform. Our suite of services and consulting assistance can relieve the administrative burden for employers as they navigate the developing law,\" said Relland.\n\n\"American Fidelity's timely, informative and accurate information in the ever-changing world of Health Care Reform is critical business intelligence for U.S. school systems. American Fidelity has identified both the challenges and opportunities school districts will be presented with to be in compliance with the Affordable Care Act, and they are unmatched in the delivery of that information,\" said John D. Musso, executive director of the Association of School Business Officials International.\n\nAFAS is already providing health and welfare benefit plan consulting and a variety of other services in light of Health Care Reform to employers across the U.S. AFAS consultants are located in California, Washington D.C., Indiana, Colorado and Oklahoma and are available to provide consulting on retainer and keep employers on top of the changing Health Care Reform rules. AFAS can also provide assistance with certain administrative requirements such as variable hour employee billing which eliminates the hassle of billing and collecting insurance premiums from variable hour employees whose required premium contributions may exceed their pay for certain payroll periods.\n\nAbout American Fidelity Administrative Services, LLC\n\nAFAS provides employee benefits support services for employers and specializes in Health Care Reform solutions.
