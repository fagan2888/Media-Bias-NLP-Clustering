I was certainly taken aback, as she knows my background of writing and teaching. But her declaration also reminded me of a student comment from my teaching days that spurred an ongoing curiosity for me. He simply asked, \u201cWhy do we have to read this stuff?\u201d\n\nWe used his comment to further class conversation. This was a composition class of college-age students, and many of them said they simply saw no point in narrative. Their time was short; they were busy. They did not care about the writer\u2019s experiences. They wanted facts and figures.\n\nNot long after, I ran across a 2010 University of Michigan study on the decline in compassion among college students. Apparently since the 1980s, and specifically after 2000, the ability of young people to empathize with others had dropped by 40 percent. The reason behind the change was unknown, but theories included electronic communication, desensitization via violent media, and \u2014 as my students said \u2014 lack of time to care.\n\nAlthough I\u2019m certain there are many layers involved in this devolution, I couldn\u2019t help but consider my students\u2019 comments and wonder how their lack of interest in reading and narrative might play into this decline.\n\nThe correlation between literature and empathy is becoming increasingly strong as researchers examine the issue. In \u201cThe Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence has Declined,\u201d Steven Pinker states that the \u201chuman capacity for compassion is not a reflex that is triggered automatically by the presence of another living thing.\u201d But he goes on to discuss how being exposed to the stories \u2014 both fictive and non \u2014 of others does encourage adopting those people\u2019s vantage points. And it\u2019s that adoption, that understanding of such, that breeds compassion and empathy.\n\nPinker concludes, \u201cTechnological advances in publishing, the mass production of books, the expansion of literacy \u2026 all preceded the major humanitarian reforms of the 18th century.\u201d\n\nSwitching fields of study, according to an NPR report in November 2007, neuroscientists have found correlations between those who read fiction and those carrying a higher number of mirror neurons, which they believe to be the \u201cbiological key to empathy.\u201d And this is where I think the relatable theories begin.\n\nThere has been a considerable decline in the ability of our country\u2019s citizens to read over recent years. Reasons given are many, from socio-economic status to the exponential increase of access to electronic gadgets. Either way, Americans are not reading, not taking in the stories of others. Thus, I\u2019m wondering if we may be facing a severe breach in our ability toempathize.\n\nBack in the late \u201990s, I was asked to teach a new class called Social Issues in Contemporary Literature for the criminal justice department at our university. Law enforcement officials were concerned that street officers would lack an understanding of the neighborhoods they would be patrolling. Yet they didn\u2019t want factual, cultural accounts of history or food or such. They wanted me to teach them stories.\n\nIf law enforcement, one the most notably conservative entities of our society, is open to story-telling to increase empathy among people, I think it\u2019s certainly a theory worth considering.\n\nShawna Bethell is a freelance writer in Silverton.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Stories foment empathy", "title": "Stories foment empathy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/10/stories-foment-empathy/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140110__fictionp1.jpg", "height": 481}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140110__fictionp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-10T15:14:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T01:04:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bbd\"", "article_summary": "And it\u2019s that adoption, that understanding of such, that breeds compassion and empathy.\nThis was a composition class of college-age students, and many of them said they simply saw no point in narrative.\nLaw enforcement officials were concerned that street officers would lack an understanding of the neighborhoods they would be patrolling.\nNot long after, I ran across a 2010 University of Michigan study on the decline in compassion among college students.\nHe simply asked, \u201cWhy do we have to read this stuff?\u201dWe used his comment to further class conversation."}
