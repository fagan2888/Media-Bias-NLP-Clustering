The CNBC anchor and New York Times columnist admitted he and a producer helped make Rick Perry\u2019s infamous \u201coops\u201d moment even worse. In a November 13, 2011 New York Times column Harwood bragged:\n\n\u201cAs he [Perry] scoured his memory, awkwardness drifted into levity. Mr. Perry smiled; I chuckled along with the audience. When Mr. Romney helpfully offered, \u2018E.P.A.?\u2019 Mr. Perry repeated it with a joshing wave of his hand. Since our tasks as moderators included keeping the conversation moving, Maria began asking a new question. But our senior producer, who communicated with us throughout the debate through our earpieces, recognized the moment faster than we did. \u2018DON\u2019T STOP!\u2019 the producer, Sandy Cannold, called out. So I asked whether the Environmental Protection Agency was in fact the third department on Mr. Perry\u2019s list. He acknowledged that it wasn\u2019t. When I offered him another chance, Mr. Perry glanced at notes but couldn\u2019t find the answer (the Department of Energy).\u201d\n\nHarwood\u2019s past takes on Republicans versus Democrats also reveal the potential for biased questioning at Wednesday night\u2019s debate. A Harwood interview with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul was so one-sided it actually caused the Paul to press back: \u201cDon\u2019t you have something better to read than crap from people who don\u2019t like me?\u201d Harwood predicted Florida Senator Marco Rubio would look like a \u201cschoolboy\u201d compared to Hillary Clinton in a debate.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, he has sucked up to Barack Obama (he was actually impressed by Obama\u2019s ability to swat a fly) and sounded like a House Democrat when he asked the President if he thought his re-election would \u201cbreak the fever\u201d of Republicans. Harwood also spun for Hillary Clinton as he sought to excuse her use of a personal email server while she was Secretary of State as merely \u201cexcessive caution\u201d on her part.\n\n\n\nThe following are just some of Harwood\u2019s most biased moments from the MRC\u2019s archive:\n\nRubio Will Look \u201cLike a Schoolboy\u201d Compared to Hillary\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Kernen, co-host: \u201cHe [Marco Rubio] looks really young too.\u201d\n\nJohn Harwood: \u201cWell, that\u2019s the thing. I think \u2013 \u201d\n\nAndrew Ross Sorkin, co-host: \u201cMost voters are older.\u201d\n\nHarwood: \u201cNew generation \u2013 you know, fresh face, that \u2013 that has some appeal and some power and Rubio has that going for him. On the other hand, you put Marco Rubio up on a debate stage with Hillary Clinton, he looks like a schoolboy.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Exchange on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, May 29, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Pounds Harwood: \u201cDon\u2019t You Have Something Better to Read Than Crap From People Who Don't Like Me?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Harwood: \u201cWell, let me read you something that The Economist, the political magazine, the British magazine wrote a few weeks ago and get you to react to it. \u2018The only notable libertarian-leaning politicians to generate real excitement among conservative voters have risen to prominence through alliances with racist and nativist movements.\u2019\u201d\n\nRand Paul: \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything better, don't you have something better to read than a bunch of crap from people who don't like me? I mean, that won\u2019t make for much of an interview if I have to sit through, you know, reading after recitation of people calling me a racist. I don\u2019t accept all of that. I don\u2019t really need to or spend the time going and talking about that. If want to talk about issues and what I stand for, I\u2019m happy to, but I\u2019m not going to really go through an interview reciting and responding to every yahoo in the world who wants to throw up a canard.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Exchange with Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul on NPR\u2019s On Point, August 6, 2013.\n\nTime for a Surgeon General Warning Against Profits?\n\n\n\n\u201cShould average Americans think about big Wall Street institutions the way that some have come to think about tobacco companies, that is, companies whose core activities are harmful to the country?\u201d\n\n\u2014 CNBC\u2019s John Harwood to President Obama in an interview segment aired on NBC\u2019s Today, April 20, 2010.\n\nAwed that Obama Can Swat a Fly\n\n\n\nCorrespondent John Harwood: \u201cHe had this fly that was persistently buzzing around him....He swatted his hand and he said, \u2018I got the sucker.\u2019 He threw it onto the ground. It was a, you know, Dirty Harry \u2018make my day\u2019 moment\u201d ...\n\nMSNBC anchor David Shuster: \u201cAmazing...An amazing interview....It never fails - great weather, rainbows, incredible speeches, and three-point basket. A fly and he nails it. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Exchange on MSNBC shortly after Harwood\u2019s CNBC interview with President Obama concluded, June 16, 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarwood Tweets: \u201cGovt-on-Citizen Crime\u201d of Bridgegate \u201cDurably Damaging\u201d to Christie\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat makes NJ scandal so durably damaging: it\u2019s direct govt-on-citizen crime - not indirect like graft, not personal (sex). Extremely rare.\u201d\n\n\u2014 John Harwood tweet published on January 10, 2014.\n\n\n\nHoping Obama Breaks the Tea Party \u201cFever\u201d Within the GOP\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore the election last year, you said you thought there was a possibility your re-election would break the fever within the Republican Party. Didn\u2019t happen. Do you see this moment as a chance, through this political confrontation, to break the fever now?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Washington correspondent John Harwood interviewing President Obama on CNBC\u2019s Closing Bell, October 2, 2013.\n\nHarwood Spins: Clinton Using Personal E-Mail May Have Just Been \u201cExcessive Caution\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe regulations on this have changed over time. The State Department indicated today that John Kerry was the first Secretary of State to use completely a official State Department email address. So this is something that\u2019s been evolving and Hillary Clinton was serving during that evolution. But it is not 100 percent clear to me whether or not this was a clear violation or excessive caution on her part.\u201d\n\n\u2014 John Harwood on CNBC\u2019s Closing Bell, March 3, 2015.\n\nBenghazi Scandal \u201cProlonged\u201d Because of Campaign \u201cBitterness\u201d\n\n\n\nErica Hill, co-host: \u201cAs we look at everything that\u2019s happening in Washington, you look at this hearing, two parties, as we heard, two very different takes on that testimony yesterday. Is anyone going to be satisfied here?\u201d\n\nJohn Harwood: \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think this is \u2013 what we\u2019re seeing in the Petraeus scandal and the Benghazi issue being prolonged is an extension of some of the conflict and the bitterness that we had during the election campaign.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Exchange on NBC\u2019s Today, November 17, 2012.\n\nBenghazi: Already a \u201cRidiculous\u201d Scandal Like Lewinsky?\n\n\n\nHost Gwen Ifill: \u201cBut Ed, why is this \u2014 why is this stuck? Why is this [Benghazi] a story that never went away?\u201d\n\nWashington Post\u2019s Ed O\u2019Keefe: \u201cIt never went away because House Republicans especially believed that there was always something more. And now that they have these emails, the fact that we\u2019re talking about it at all, to them is a victory....The big problem, just real quick, is that now House Republican leadership is saying, despite their genuine concerns and interests in this, \u2018Be careful. Don\u2019t overreach. Don\u2019t turn this into a Lewinsky-like scandal, where we begin to look ridiculous for doing some things and saying things. Let\u2019s do a measured response.\u2019\u201d\n\nCNBC\u2019s John Harwood: \u201cI think we\u2019re already there.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Keefe: \u201cWell, some would say.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Exchange on PBS\u2019s Washington Week, May 17, 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarwood: Public Doesn\u2019t Know Enough to Make Judgment on ObamaCare\n\n\n\nJoe Kernen, co-host: \u201cIf you can\u2019t figure out at this point that the public didn\u2019t want this, [ObamaCare] John. Come on.\u201d\n\nJohn Harwood: \u201cJoe, how much do you think the public knows about what\u2019s in this health stuff.\u201d\n\nKernen: \u201cDon\u2019t start talking down to the public - \u2018the public doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s in there\u2019 again, John.\n\nHarwood: \u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nKernen: \u201cWell, if they don\u2019t, it\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t done in an open setting and nobody knows what\u2019s in it because it was all done behind closed doors.\u201d\n\nHarwood: \u201cJoe, that is ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Exchange on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, January 22, 2010.\n\nLiberal Critics of ObamaCare \u201cIdiotic;\u201d \u201cOn Drugs\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo much of the commentary I\u2019ve heard has been really idiotic. Liberals who want universal health care ought to be thanking Harry Reid for getting this thing done rather than talking about what\u2019s inadequate in the bill. I\u2019m not saying the bill is a good bill, but if you\u2019re a liberal and you want universal coverage in this country and think that you could do better \u2013 that Harry Reid can do better than what he\u2019s done, or the White House can do better, they ought to lay off the hallucinogenic drugs because we have had a vivid demonstration of the limits of political possibilities on this issue.\u201d\n\n\u2014 John Harwood on MSNBC live coverage, December 21, 2009.\n\nBiden\u2019s Racially-Insensitive Gaffes \u201cA Strength\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe is not somebody who is infused with political correctness, the verbal equivalent of putting his pinky up when he opens his mouth. So this is what, the way ordinary voters are as well. They\u2019re not always worried about sort of calibrating every single word by \u2018ooh, is this racially insensitive?\u2019 That\u2019s something that Joe Biden brings as an asset to the ticket. The gaffes actually show one of his strengths.\u201d\n\n\u2014 MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, August 23, 2008.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.mrc.org/media-reality-check/watch-shenanigans-cnbc-debate-moderators-most-biased-moments", "image": "http://www.mrc.org/sites/default/files/HarwoodDebate.JPG", "site_name": "Media Research Center", "description": "The RNC may regret its approval of John Harwood as lead moderator for Wednesday night\u2019s GOP presidential debate on CNBC if past history is any guide.
