McClatchy-Tribune Information Services\n\nMay 25 --First Baptist Church of Marco Island had grand plans in 2005, two years after its new pastor took the helm.\n\nSenior Pastor Tim Neptune's vision was to build a Christian counseling center and school on the island, get involved in missions -- and \"plant\" 20 more churches in Southwest Florida by 2018.\n\nHis first step: tear down the small, 27-year-old church at 1450 Winterberry Drive and replace it with a contemporary 500-seat sanctuary, with high-tech lights, stages and TV monitors. Now called Family Church , it opened in 2008, with the school and counseling center.\n\nSix years later, after buying a Christian radio station and expanding to East Naples , church leaders found themselves $15 million in debt. The church sold the station and this month, a Naples man purchased the East Naples property for $3.8 million .\n\nNow, despite pleas for tithing and pledges, the church is facing a $9.12 million foreclosure lawsuit four years after defaulting on a $6.9 million loan provided by a longtime member, its former comptroller.\n\nMary Traudt , 76, trustee of Marco Vision and Stewardship Trust , is asking Collier Circuit Judge Fred Hardt to appoint a receiver to collect the church's profits and rents and review its books.\n\n\"The plaintiff has tried for years to negotiate a resolution with the church and has been unsuccessful,\" said Donald R. Kirk , a Tampa attorney representing Traudt and her trust. \"Consequently, this is the lender's only recourse at this point.\"\n\nTraudt, a member since 1988, several church leaders and pastors did not return calls for comment.\n\n\"It's just a sad situation,\" said Pastor Casey Nowlin , a pastor there since 2009.\n\nNowlin, who said the church has 350 to 400 members, declined to speak about the lawsuit or whether Traudt is still involved with the church.\n\nPat Kase , a project consultant for Cogun Inc. , a South Carolina firm that specializes in church expansions and construction, called the number of loans \"irresponsible\" for a church of that size if it didn't have another source of income beyond its expected amount of annual giving. It would never have passed his company's feasibility analysis, he said, let alone a lender's qualifications.\n\n\"The first question a church has is 'What can we afford?' \" Kase said, adding that it should be three to four times annual giving, plus cash on hand, then subtract debt. \"Even if you made it past my financial feasibility analysis, you would never stick a shovel in the ground because a lender wouldn't allow it.\"\n\nMODEST BEGINNINGS, NEW VISION\n\nThe church began in Goodland in the 1960s and moved to Marco in 1978. Nine years later, it opened a learning and day care center with a focus on children and teens.\n\nIn 2005, after two years there, Neptune announced his vision for expansion to 20 more churches and mounted a successful capital campaign.\n\n\"There are not a lot of Baptist churches in Southwest Florida , and the growth of communities is at a rate much faster than having churches to accommodate them,\" Neptune told Marco Magazine in 2007.\n\nTraudt had been hired as the administrative assistant two years earlier, but rose to office administrator, treasurer and comptroller based on her years of experience as a treasurer for charities. In August 2007 , her trust gave the church the $6.9 million promissory note and $200,000 more in June 2008 . That allowed construction to begin on the new church, its 500-seat sanctuary and state-of-the-art audio, video, lighting and stage sets.\n\nIn summer of 2008, the high-tech church was completed.\n\nThe contemporary, Spanish Mission -style church is impressive, with its manicured lawns, stage lighting and theater-style seats. A large pavilion features a stone brick- and quartz Jacuzzi-like baptismal pool. Fbcmarco.com allows members to watch sermons, read the current newsletter and donate.\n\nThe opening came just months after its Learning Center ended day care for 2- and 3-year-olds after enrollment dwindled from 150 children to 45 over four years. Church leaders blamed increased costs and the economic downturn, which prompted families to leave Marco .\n\nStill, the church continued fulfilling Neptune's vision in 2008, when it also opened Winterberry Christian Academy , which offered prekindergarten through 12th-grade classes, and Oasis Counseling Center . It also opened \"The Well,\" a trendy caf\u00e9 that offered everything from cappuccinos to smoothies. Months later, a bookstore and library opened.\n\nDEBT STRUGGLES\n\nMeanwhile, the church was $1.76 million past due on payments to Traudt, the lawsuit says, causing it to default in April 2010 . Still, the church continued expanding and incorporated the nonprofit Family Christian Broadcasting Network that August, with Traudt as a director and treasurer.\n\nThree months later, the church and network paid $5 million to buy Praise-FM 89.5 (WSRX), an adult contemporary-Christian music radio station and its 43-acre church property, 8882 Collier Blvd. , near Rattlesnake Hammock Road .\n\nTo help fund the purchase, Traudt, Neptune and others signed a $4.5 million balloon mortgage provided by SGD Investments Inc. of Omaha , a company headed by Allan Lozier . Years earlier, Traudt had retired from Lozier Corp. , a store shelving supplier, as its administrative vice president. As collateral for that loan, Family Christian Radio Network gave SGD WSRX's FCC license, its profits, leases, music equipment and furnishings.\n\nTraudt's trust purchased the rear 23.65 acres of the property, leasing it to the church with a $2.24 million option to purchase the multifamily zoned parcel.\n\nFamily Church planned to use the church property to build a second campus. The property had been owned by First Assembly Ministries, which was foreclosed on a year earlier, forcing it to move while its church was being built.\n\n\"It's been amazing to watch God orchestrate all of the events necessary for us to acquire this property and radio station,\" Neptune told the Marco Eagle. \" Our desire is to reach out to our community, to share the love of Christ and to create a new and unique church.\"\n\nAs construction proceeded in East Naples , Winterberry Christian Academy shut down in June 2011 , citing a lack of funding after educating 80 students. Days later, Family Church leased that space to Marco Island Academy .\n\nThat September, Family Church Naples opened its doors.\n\n\"We hope to expand the ministry of the Marco campus to the Naples campus, reaching out to adults, children, youth and the Hispanic community,\" Neptune told the Marco Eagle at the time.\n\nMonths later, in February 2012 , the church sold Family Christian Broadcasting Network (Praise-FM) to Colorado -based WAY-FM for $1.5 million . Some proceeds, including a $300,000 promissory note, went to SGD, county records show.\n\nHowever, the church was still struggling and a year later, real estate listings show, it began advertising the 24,000-square-foot East Naples church and 67 acres for $7.75 million . A July 2013 letter to congregants shows how much debt the church was saddled with, and attempts to whittle down its $17,401.70 monthly payments.\n\n\"We see from our financial statements that our tithing and offering income is just enough to meet current needs, without taking into consideration the $6.9 million note,\" the pastors' letter says of Traudt's loan, noting they were paying pastors, staff, utilities, insurance and loans.\n\nBy this past November, a letter to members shows, the church had lowered the asking price to $6.85 million and received a $6.5 million offer from a new East Naples church, Redemption Baptist Church . Pastors and church leaders unanimously accepted the offer, which included two $50,000 deposits in December, with a closing scheduled for this January.\n\nBut the deal fell through and church leaders began advertising the 43-acre church property for $3.85 million , pointing out the rear 23.65-acre parcel also was available.\n\nBy this January, the lawsuit says, the church owed $135,000 on Traudt's smaller loan and $6.9 million , late fees and interest on the other. A church newsletter said they'd only made \"13 sporadic\" monthly payments and never paid the larger payments due every April. As a result, the trust \"accelerated\" the loan, adding penalties and interest, bringing the amount owed to $9.12 million as of Dec. 1, 2013 .\n\nTraudt asked for a receiver to protect her collateral.\n\nThis January, pastors wrote to members, asking for pledges by Jan. 28 to negotiate a settlement with Traudt. Her attorney needed an answer within days, the pastors said, citing a verse from First Corinthians that appealed to members \"to unite.\"\n\n\"We as a church could easily be divided over something as simple as a building or location, just as these New Testament believers were,\" the pastors wrote. \" May we continue to bring God glory, even in the midst of this difficult situation.\"\n\nLast month, county records show, the church sold the East Naples property for $3.8 million to BLC Naples LLC , a company incorporated that same day by Naples multimillionaire Douglas Bartholomew .\n\nBartholomew, who leased the church's radio and cell towers this month to Sprint, didn't return calls about the purchase. However, Pastor Paul Heier , a missionary, said Bartholomew, a longtime friend, purchased the property to enable him to expand his bilingual church on 10th Street North in Naples to the Anglo community, as Bible Life Church .\n\n\"We were looking to expand and offer this English service,\" Heier said. \"We just want to reach everybody in East Naples -- not only the Hispanic community, but the Anglo and Haitian communities.\"\n\nThe church also assigned Bartholomew the ground lease for the radio station towers. The deal enabled Family Church to pay off its $4.5 million SGD loan. By doing that, a letter from pastors says, SGD promised to donate $1 million within six months, if all loan payments were timely. SGD's president declined to comment.\n\nNEPTUNE, TRAUDT LEAVE CHURCH\n\nDuring the financial turmoil, Neptune left the church last year and Traudt followed. Neptune now heads Leadership Outreach in Naples , which helps churches and ministries grow. Traudt is treasurer and a director.\n\nFamily Church leaders met this year to discuss negotiating a financial settlement with Traudt. Pastors told members in a letter that the church attempted to borrow from a local bank, but the church only qualified for a portion of that debt.\n\nThe church's weekly bulletin, updated Sunday, shows it brought in roughly $11,301.69 last week from about 200 members, down from $31,196.50 a week earlier. As a church, it's exempt from filing taxes, so its 990 Forms showing income are not available on Guidestar, which tracks nonprofits.\n\nKase, the church expansion consultant, wasn't surprised Family Church struggled financially. Based on its 350-400 members, he said, what it could afford would be a roughly $2 million loan -- an amount pastors were aware of because they detailed it in a church newsletter. Kase said the more than $17,000 in monthly payments it was paying after defaulting on the $6.9 million loan wasn't usually feasible for a church that small.\n\n\"There's no way a church of that size could amortize that amount of debt,\" Kase said of the more than $6.9 million . \" ... It's a sad story. The community deserves better. We hear of church train wrecks, but usually they're not so egregious.\"\n\nCollier Supervisor of Elections Jennifer Edwards, a member since 1992, blamed the problems on an overexpansion.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we were unable to maintain both properties,\" Edwards said. \"We're a church body and wherever we hold our services will be our church. We're all committed to the Marco property and hope that we're able to maintain it.\"\n\nStaff writer Eric Staats contributed to this story\n\nFinancial timeline of Family Church on Marco Island\n\nAug. 31, 2007 : Mary Traudt , trustee of Marco Vision and Stewardship Trust , loans the church $6.9 million to improve and construct a church. The promissory note, with a 5.4 percent interest rate, requires Pastor Tim Neptune to purchase a $5 million , 10-year life insurance policy with Traudt as the beneficiary and to maintain accurate financial records. Payments vary, with monthly payments increasing each year, starting with $14,000 in April 2008 up to $14,727.50 , when the church defaulted in April 2010 . A $150,000 principal payment was required every April.\n\nJune 9, 2008 : Marco Vision and Stewardship Trust loans the church $200,000 .\n\nApril 16, 2010 : The church defaults on Traudt's $6.9 million loan after \"13 sporadic monthly payments,\" but never making any yearly $150,000 payments due every April.\n\nNov. 10, 2010 : The Family Church borrows $4.5 from Omaha -based SGD Investments Inc. The balloon mortgage is to purchase Praise-FM in East Naples , its 44-acre property at 8882 Collier Blvd. and First Assembly Mission church, which was partly built and in foreclosure.\n\nFebruary 2012 : Family Church negotiates to sell Family Christian Broadcasting Network, known as Praise-FM and WSRX, to WAY-FM in Naples for $1.5 million .\n\nJune 2012 : Colorado -based Way Media paid Family Christian Broadcasting Network $1.5 million for \"Praise FM\" WSRX (89.5). The deal enables the church to reduce the principal on SGD's $4.5 million balloon mortgage by $1.2 million .\n\nFeb. 1, 2013 : The trust records the $5.85 million balloon mortgage with the county, paying $37,950 in filing fees. The church had since borrowed $372,500 more under terms of the original $6.9 million promissory note.\n\nFeb. 21, 2013 : Pastor Neptune , who left the church, incorporates Naples -based Leadership Outreach to help churches and ministries grow. Traudt is on the board of directors and is treasurer.\n\nJune 13, 2013 : Marco Vision Stewardship Trust makes a settlement offer, saying it would accept $2 million from the church, clear title to the East Naples campus, an assignment of the radio station's note, tower rights and rental income and contents of all buildings. The trust, with Neptune as co-trustee, asks for the most current appraisal on that property and purchase offers received in the past six months. Conditions include the church securing a $5.3 million first mortgage on the Marco campus, paying the trust $2 million for the East Naples campus and releasing its $2 million option to purchase the rear 24 acres; the option expires this month. Traudt gives the church 30 days from June 13, 2013 , to accept.\n\nJuly 2013 : Pastors Casey Nowlin and Terry Hoskins write to the church \"family,\" detailing the board's business meeting and revealing the church is paying $17,401.70 in monthly payments. If they accept the trust's offer, they would have to give up the WAY-FM promissory note that generates $3,330 in monthly income.\n\nDec. 12, 2013 : Carlton Fields , the law firm hired by Traudt's trust, sends a letter to attorney Fred Mundie , a member of the church's financial committee who signed the loans. It demands payment of the $200,000 trust loan and threatens legal action.\n\nJan. 20 : Pastors send members a letter about pledge cards handed out that Sunday, urging them to pledge by Jan. 28 , days before a deadline by Traudt's trust, which has demanded a new payment proposal.\n\nJan. 27 : Carlton Fields law firm mails another letter to Mundie, demanding payment of the $6.9 million trust loan.\n\nMarch 11 : Traudt's trust sues the church, demanding payment of both loans and asking Collier Circuit Judge Fred Hardt to appoint a receiver to collect all the church's rents, payments and profits.\n\nApril 9 : Naples multimillionaire Douglas Bartholomew incorporates BLC Naples LLC . That same day, the newly formed limited liability corporation purchases the East Naples property for $3.8 million and Family Church pays off SGD Investments Inc. , which promised to donate $1 million in six months if all payments were made on time.\n\n___\n\n(c)2014 the Naples Daily News (Naples, Fla.)\n\nVisit the Naples Daily News (Naples, Fla.) at www.naplesnews.com\n\nDistributed by MCT Information Services\n\nWordcount: 2561\n\n[jetpack-related-posts]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Now called Family Church, it opened in 2008, with the school and counseling center.
