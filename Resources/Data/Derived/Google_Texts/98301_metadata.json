Devine Road, Suite B, Vancouver.\n\nHours: 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday.\n\nContact: 360-952-4457, www.rosemedicalgroups.org\n\nClark County Medicaid clients struggling to find a medical provider may now be able to find some relief.\n\nA new urgent care and family practice clinic aimed at serving the local Medicaid population opened in Vancouver last week. Dr. Matthew Rose opened the Rose Urgent Care and Family Practice, 650 N. Devine Road, after operating a private practice in East Vancouver for more than two years. In that time, he received hundreds of calls from Medicaid clients looking for care.\n\n\u201cI saw that there was a large unserved and underserved population here with Medicaid,\u201d Rose said. \u201cSo I wanted to do something about it.\u201d\n\nRose knew his private practice wouldn\u2019t be able to make much of a dent. He only had the ability to take on about a dozen Medicaid clients.\n\n\u201cWe decided to go big and start a practice specifically to serve this population,\u201d Rose said.\n\nIn Clark County, more than 110,000 adults and children are enrolled in the Medicaid program. Vancouver-based Columbia United Providers is the Medicaid managed care plan serving about 50,000 of those clients.\n\nShrinking Medicaid reimbursement rates and increasing client numbers \u2014 a result of the Medicaid expansion implemented under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 make primary care access a challenge in Clark County and many other areas across the state.\n\nRose reached out to CUP to pursue a contract with the plan. Rose worked with CUP officials to identify an underserved area of Vancouver that could benefit from a new clinic.\n\nRose opened the doors to that clinic, which sits across the street from McLoughlin Middle School, on Feb. 2. The clinic, which has eight exam rooms and a small lab, is open for appointments and walk-in care in the evenings and Saturdays. Rose and the four nurse practitioners and physician assistants on staff should be able to provide care for about 8,000 patients, Rose said.\n\nThe clinic currently only has a contract to provide services for CUP clients but is working to develop contracts with other Medicaid managed care and private insurance plans, Rose said.\n\nThe goal, Rose said, is to provide the same level of care patients would receive in his private practice.\n\nEach patient will be assigned to a primary care provider and will see the same provider each time they come in. Children will receive education from a nutritionist about basic nutrition and the importance of exercise.\n\nThe clinic also has a policy against prescribing opiates and benzodiazepines and will instead focus on non-narcotic pain management. Rose is working with CUP to develop a drug-free rehab program that will integrate social and psychosocial services, rehab, pain management and physical medical care, Rose said.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s an approach that will offer long-term benefits,\u201d Rose said.\n\nColumbia United Providers is assigning patients to Rose\u2019s clinic as they lose coverage elsewhere or are added to the Medicaid program. If the need continues, Rose said he\u2019s prepared to open additional clinics.\n\n\u201cThis clinic is just the beginning,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Clark County Medicaid clients struggling to find a medical provider may now be able to find some relief.", "application-name": "", "og": {"site_name": "The Columbian", "description": "Clark County Medicaid clients struggling to find a medical provider may now be able to find some relief.", "title": "New Vancouver practice caters to Medicaid patients", "url": "http://www.columbian.com/news/2015/feb/13/east-vancouver-practice-caters-medicaid-patients/", "image": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/columbian_c_200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "columbian.com", "creator": "MarissaHarshman", "site": "@thecolumbian", "card": "summary", "title": "New Vancouver practice caters to Medicaid patients"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3A5B7C", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 1256005586, "app_id": 122928857737763}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/windows-tiles/square-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thecolumbian", "section": "Carousel,East Vancouver,Health,Latest News,Life,Local News,News", "published_time": "2015-02-13 00:00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5967\"", "article_summary": "A new urgent care and family practice clinic aimed at serving the local Medicaid population opened in Vancouver last week.\nDr. Matthew Rose opened the Rose Urgent Care and Family Practice, 650 N.
