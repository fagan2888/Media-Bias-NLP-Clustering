There would have been the shootout at the OK Corral. And you would have had death, but it would have been their death.\u201d\n\nThe entire Republican field quickly recalibrated toward foreign policy after Friday\u2019s attack. In addition to the usual retinue of TV interviews, Trump has spent the intervening days in SEC Primary country, drumming up conservative support in the Southern states voting March 1. He started Saturday night in Texas and continued tonight in Tennessee.\n\nTrump has weaved Paris into the message he\u2019s delivered for months. A pledge for military brawn now includes this salty line about how he would deal with ISIS: \u201cI\u2019m going to bomb the s\u2014 out of them.\u201d\n\nOn Syrian refugees \u2014 increasingly denounced in Georgia and elsewhere \u2014 Trump incorporates the issue into his well-known seal-the-borders mantra. In so doing he inflated President Barack Obama\u2019s pledge to take in 10,000 refugees:\n\n\u201cSo we have a president who wants to take hundreds of thousands \u2014 hundreds of thousands \u2014 of people and move them into our country. And we don\u2019t even know who they are. There\u2019s no paperwork. There\u2019s no anything. And all you have to do is look at the website for Obamacare to know that we\u2019re never going to figure everything out. \u2026 \u201cI have a tremendous heart. I want to take care of people. But you look at this migration and I said to my wife the other day they seem like so many men, so strong. They\u2019re strong-looking guys \u2014 not as strong as you [speaking to someone in the audience] but that\u2019s OK. They\u2019re strong-looking guys. And I say: Why aren\u2019t they back fighting for their country? That\u2019s No. 1. Is this a Trojan horse?\u201d\n\nThe Trump plan instead involves seizing a large chunk of land from Syria, \u201cwhich, believe me, you get for the right price.\u201d The displaced people go there, Trump said:\n\n\u201cKeep \u2019em in Syria. You build a tremendous safe zone. It will cost you tremendously much less, much less. And they\u2019ll be there, and the weather\u2019s the same. Everything\u2019s the same. \u2026 When it\u2019s all over, they move back. And they move back into their cities.\u201d\n\nThe night of the attacks, conservative commentator Ann Coulter said on Twitter \u201cDonald Trump was elected president tonight.\u201d\n\nTrump mentioned that, too, and plugged Coulter\u2019s book.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2015/11/16/donald-trump-in-tennessee-armed-parisians-would-have-caused-shootout-at-the-ok-corral/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/496673602.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON --\u00a0Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump sauntered into SEC Primary territory tonight and told a Knoxville, Tenn., rally that if Friday's Paris terrorist attacks had happened in a Second Amendment-loving area, it would have been \"a different story.\"\r\n\r\nTrump led his swaggering stump speech with his take on...", "title": "Donald Trump in Tennessee: Armed Parisians would have caused \u2018Shootout at the OK Corral\u2019 | Political Insider blog"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "AJC blog about Atlanta politics, Georgia politics, Georgia and metro Atlanta election campaigns.
