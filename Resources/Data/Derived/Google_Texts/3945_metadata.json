According to a study by a Virginia Tech Professor, what matters more to patients than anything else is the quality of the connection patients have with their doctors.\n\nRobbie Harris reports\n\nOf course, the most important thing is getting better after you see your doctor...\n\n\u201cBut we found out that it matters how the medical care is given. It matters, the care that the care provider shows.\u201d\n\nRobin Russell is professor of Business Information Technology at Virginia Tech\u2019s Pamplin College of business. Her team surveyed patients about their doctors\u2019 appointments. They report that the most important factor is\u2026 well, the \u2018care\u2019 in health care.\n\n\u201cFor example, what concern did your care provider show you? How well did they explain your diagnosis? Did they go over medications with you? Were you able to ask questions?\u201d\n\nAnd she says, it\u2019s more than just a feel good thing; that kind of attention and care actually feeds back into positive outcomes for patients.\n\n\u201cIf a care provider, whether it\u2019s a Physician or Physician\u2019s Assistant, is being evaluated on these things, those are some boxes they want to check before they leave that room. They want to make sure you understand it. They want to go over things with you. So that improves the quality of care overall.\"\n\nThe study found that feel of being cared for affects how well patients follow through with what the caregivers prescribed. And this was nothing like those surveys that ask you to rate your doctor or like the practice on Facebook. Russell conducted the survey under specific guidelines aimed at something that can be quite elusive: quality. Let\u2019s call it, the excellence of a thing; the essence of what makes something good, great, or not.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking questions about whether the furniture in the waiting room was comfortable, but we are asking questions like how long did you wait at this stage...how long did you wait at this stage? Were you able to get an appointment in a reasonable amount of time? Did the group show concern for your privacy? And there were some questions about how friendly and considerate the staff is.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s one finding that might surprise you: they noticed that in recent years, the time doctors have to spend with each patient has grown shorter\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a strong correlation between the amount of time the physician spent with you and your estimate of the amount of time that they spent, because if they were more caring when they were in there the perception is that they connected with you more and that was what was important.\"\n\nUnder the affordable care act, hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies are required to administer these surveys. It\u2019s a way to ensure that Medicare and Medicaid are reimbursing doctors for high quality care. Survey results are posted online. You can also put in your zip code and compare different hospitals, nursing facilities and long term care providers.\n\nAnd you might think it\u2019s a no brainer that the \u2018care\u2019 in health care is of utmost importance to providers. But Professor Russell\u2019s paper on Patient Satisfaction in Medical Clinics proved it. The Quality Management Journal named it the paper that made the largest single contribution last year to the extension and understanding of the philosophy of quality management.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "One of the requirements under the Affordable Care Act is that data must be gathered and analyzed to determine what\u2019s working well and what\u2019s not.
