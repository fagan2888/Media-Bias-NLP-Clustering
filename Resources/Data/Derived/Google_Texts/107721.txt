JASNA, Slovakia — Mikaela Shiffrin won a women’s World Cup slalom by a massive 2.36-second margin on Sunday while Frida Hansdotter of Sweden finished 10th to wrap up the discipline title.

In tough conditions due to snowfall and rain, the Olympic champion from the United States posted the fastest time in both runs to finish ahead of Wendy Holdener of Switzerland. Veronika Velez-Zuzulova of Slovakia was 2.77 back in third.

Hansdotter, 4.13 seconds off the pace, holds a 105-point lead over Velez-Zuzulova with only the season-ending race in St. Moritz, Switzerland, remaining. It’s the Swede’s first discipline title after Shiffrin won it the past three seasons.

Shiffrin is unbeaten in slalom racing since February 2015 but can’t win the discipline title this season having missed five races during a two-month injury layoff.
