The Treasury Department might grab a piece of your money before you ever see it.\n\nThanks to a one-line provision slipped into the 2008 Farm Bill, a 10-year statute of limitations was removed from old debts to the government. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is taking advantage of that, garnishing tax refunds, including from children of people whom the SSA claims were overpaid benefits in the distant past.\n\nMary Grice\u2019s father died in 1960. She, four siblings and her father\u2019s first wife, whom she never knew, received survivors\u2019 benefits, according to The Washington Post. Now, 54 years later, Grice is being held responsible for a $2,996 debt the SSA claims is tied to her father\u2019s Social Security number. Treasury officials say an agency must show evidence of a debt before it can hold up a tax refund. But SSA officials can\u2019t point to any records explaining the debt.\n\nSocial Security officials say that if children benefitted even indirectly from an overpayment, they\u2019re liable for the debt and the policy is to go after the siblings in birth order to clear it. This doesn\u2019t explain why Treasury went after Grice; she has older and younger siblings, none of whom have been contacted about the debt.\n\nGrice filed suit against the SSA last week. And now similar cases have come to light. Brenda and Mike Samonds of Glenarm, Illinois, have been trying to reclaim the $189.10 tax refund the government seized a year ago, claiming that Mike\u2019s mother, who died 33 years ago, had been overpaid on survivor\u2019s benefits after Mike\u2019s father died in 1969.\n\nTwo senators have joined the call to urge the SSA to stop trying to collect the money from children of debtors. \u201cWhile this policy of seizing tax refunds to repay decades-old Social Security overpayments might be allowed under the law, it is entirely unjust,\u201d senators Barbara Boxer (D-California) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Maryland) wrote to Social Security\u2019s acting commissioner, Carolyn Colvin. \u201cGarnishing taxpayers\u2019 refunds to pay for debts that are more than a decade old\u2014and incurred through no fault of their own\u2014is a policy that cannot be continued in good conscience.\u201d\n\n-Steve Straehley\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nSocial Security, Treasury Target Taxpayers For Their Parents\u2019 Decades-Old Debts (by Marc Fisher, Washington Post)\n\nSenators Ask U.S. To Stop Garnishing Tax Refunds To Pay For Old Debts (by Marc Fisher, Washington Post)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks to a one-line provision slipped into the 2008 Farm Bill, a 10-year statute of limitations was removed from old debts to the government.
