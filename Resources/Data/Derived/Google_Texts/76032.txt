TRENTON — Tom MacArthur, a millionaire former insurance executive, will be the Republican nominee in South Jersey’s 3rd Congressional District.

He beat Steve Lonegan, a conservative firebrand who ran a heated primary against MacArthur, according to projections by the Associated Press.

In his victory speech tonight, MacArthur thanked Lonegan and his supporters “for a hard-fought race.”

“I pledge today to be a different kind of Congressman,” MacArthur said. “One who will care more about solutions than finger-pointing and bring people together to restore our country and get America working again.”

Lonegan said he was "proud of the campaign we ran and the effort that my team put forth.

"Unfortunately, we could not overcome the millions of dollars spent against us in negative attack ads," he said in a statement. "We may have lost tonight, but the fight for our conservative values continues.

"We must hold those nominated by the Republican party accountable," Lonegan added. "That means voting like a conservative not a liberal and it means repealing Obamacare not replacing it with Obamacare light."

Both MacArthur and Lonegan moved to the district from North Jersey this year to run. MacArthur until last year was the mayor of Randolph, in Morris County.

MacArthur poured more than $2 million into the race from his own pocket and drastically outspent Lonegan.

This was the sixth unsuccessful run for state or federal office by Lonegan, who served as mayor of Bogota in Bergen County for 12 years. Just last year, he ran unsuccessfully against Cory Booker for U.S. Senate.

The race was one of the most hotly contested in the state this year, and by far the nastiest. Lonegan at one point called MacArthur a “monster” over allegations that his insurance company played a part in shortchanging California wildfire victims, while MacArthur characterized Lonegan as bitter.

MacArthur in November will face Democrat Aimee Belgard, who easily prevailed in her party’s primary.
