Winners, losers, questions and conclusions for South Florida and beyond after Election 2014:

--My number one question after last night's Republican onslaught: When does Debbie Wasserman Schultz tender her resignation as Democratic National Committee chair? The Congresswoman from Weston coasted to another term (by a 63-37 margin over Joe Kaufman) but there are sure to be plenty of recriminations for the shellacking Democrats took nationally.

Republicans seized control of the U.S. Senate, widened their majority in the House to levels not seen since the 1940s and shockingly captured governorships in blue states such as Massachusetts, Illinois and Maryland. And Republicans held onto governorships in key 2016 battleground states Florida and Texas. Even vulnerable Republican governors in Kansas and Wisconsin staged comebacks to win.

Tuesday was the worst nightmare possible for Dems, and somebody's going to have to take the fall. It looks like it's going to be our Debbie. With plenty of whispers about her performance leading up to the election (and that devastating hit piece on Politico), there's just no way she can maintain her leadership post heading into 2016.

--For the second straight time, Republican Rick Scott won an election without a majority. In 2010, Scott became Florida governor as a relative unknown with 48.9 percent of the vote, beating Democrat Alex Sink by 60,000 votes. This time, Scott captured just 48.2 percent of the vote, beating Democrat Charlie Crist by 70,000 votes. Republicans were more motivated, with a slight uptick in statewide turnout translating to more raw votes for Scott (2.85 million votes this time, 2.6 million in 2010). Statewide turnout was 50.3 percent in 2014, 49 percent in 2010.

--Has Charlie Crist run his last race? It certainly appears the Republican-turned independent-turned Democrat might be out of political gas. He lost his bid for U.S. Senate in 2010 and now his bid to reclaim the governor's mansion. What went wrong for Crist? He simply failed to get the turnout he needed in Democrat-rich South Florida, especially among the minority communities that propelled Barack Obama to victories in 2008 and 2012.

The magic number I kept hearing before the race: Crist needed to get turnout over 48 percent in Broward and over 50 percent in Palm Beach to have a chance. Broward's turnout was 43.5 percent, Palm Beach County's 49.1 percent. And Miami-Dade's turnout was dismal, 40.7 percent (down from 41.5 percent in 2010. In 2010, Broward's turnout was 41 percent and Palm Beach's 47.5 percent)

--For President Barack Obama and the Dems, "Hope and Change" has become "Mope and Cringe." Obama is now officially a lame duck, and he has to make calculated decisions about whehter he wants to play nice with the Republican Congress or stridently go-it-alone by flexing his muscle through fiat and executive order. It's amazing that the Republican reward for two years of obstructionism (including that government shutdown) is to get the keys to the car. Will Obama let them drive it over a cliff heading into 2016?

--Medical marijuana went up in smoke in Florida, failing to reach the 60 percent approval threshold needed. It was a high bar (no pun intended). The measure got over 57 percent support from voters (with 3.3 million votes, much more than Scott). The cruel irony: The approval threshold to change Florida's constitution went from a simple majority (50.1 percent) to 60 percent last decade, thanks to a constitutional amendment that passed with only 57 percent of the vote.

--Chief medical marijuana supporter John Morgan has indicated he might launch another amendment bid in 2016, a presidential year when more young voters are likely to turn out. But it's a tough, expensive haul, especially if there will be well-funded opposition again (from Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson).

--Pot fizzled in Florida, but measures legalizing recreational marijuana passed in Oregon and Washington, D.C. That means the next time Congress does something completely outrageous, we can ask, with complete seriousness, "What are these guys smoking?"

--Voters in Broward and Palm Beach counties chose kids over their wallets, easily approving measures to re-authorize tax-funded Children's Services Councils in each county, along with giving local schools more money from property taxes. In Broward, voters approved an $800 million bond measure to help repair schools. In Palm Beach, voters approved an extension of a temporary property-tax hike to fund supplemental programs (art/music) in schools. So the scoreboard from Tuesday reads: Kids 4, Selfishness 0.

--Our national electorate fluctuates wildly - but predictably - every two years: Left-right-left-right. That sums up the last four elections. In 2008, Obama won the White House and Dems swept the House and Senate. In 2010, Republicans took back the House amid the Tea Party surge. In 2012, Obama won re-election and pundits wondered if the silly, self-destructive Republicans would ever recover. They recovered. In a big way.
