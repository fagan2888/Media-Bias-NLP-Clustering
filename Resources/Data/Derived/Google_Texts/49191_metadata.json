AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEB\n\n4258760\n\nThe Obama administration issued yet another waiver to get out of Obamacare \u2014 for all the U.S. territories.\n\nThe exemption, posted Thursday on a Department of Health and Human Services website, frees U.S. territories from a host of Obamacare regulations on health insurance markets. The territories already weren\u2019t subject to much of the health care law \u2014 the individual mandate doesn\u2019t apply to the territories and premium subsidies aren\u2019t available.\n\nWhat did apply were a host of regulations on the health insurance markets operating in the territories. Obamacare\u2019s rules for insurance companies \u2014 providing mandated health benefits to all customers, limits on insurer profits, and guaranteed coverage for those with pre-existing conditions \u2014 all force insurers to take a hit, but in the territories, the sweeteners that make Obamacare a great deal for insurance companies in the states don\u2019t apply.\n\nThe individual mandate and premium subsidies were supposed to bring healthy and young customers into the insurance market. Even in the states, that\u2019s not working nearly as well as the Obama administration had hoped. But without either provisions, the insurance markets in the territories were tanking due to the influx of sick patients and the new benefits insurers were required to provide.\n\nThe U.S. territories have been pleading with the Obama administration to exempt them from the regulations, but HHS officials had refused until now.\n\n\u201cHHS is not authorized to choose which provisions\u2026might apply to the territories,\u201d top HHS official Gary Cohen wrote last year, The Washington Post reported.\n\nNow HHS believes it has the authority after all. The Public Health Service Act\u2019s definition of the term \u201cstate\u201d has led HHS to belatedly determine that most of Obamacare\u2019s regulations don\u2019t apply to the territories.\n\nThe territories will be exempted from guaranteed coverage, community rating, single risk pools, rate review, the medical loss ratio, and essential health benefits.\n\nThe evolved interpretation of the Public Health Service Act\u2019s application to the territories came after representatives continued to protest that Obamacare was \u201cundermining the stability\u201d of the insurance markets in the territories.\n\nA spokesman for Obamacare administrator the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the territories were a special circumstance, the Post reports.\n\n\u201cWe are providing additional flexibility to the territories in order to implement the law in a way that recognizes their unique situations.\u201d\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "More 'flexibility'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Obama administration issued yet another waiver to get out of Obamacare -- for all the U.S. territories.\u00a0    The exemption, posted Thursday on a Department of Health and Human Services website, fr", "title": "The Obama Admin Just Exempted US Territories From Obamacare", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/17/the-obama-admin-just-exempted-us-territories-from-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/witless_shrugged-e1331500273180.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More 'flexibility'", "title": "The Obama Admin Just Exempted US Territories From Obamacare Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/17/the-obama-admin-just-exempted-us-territories-from-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/witless_shrugged-e1331500273180.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-17 18:11:01", "sailthru.title": "The Obama Admin Just Exempted US Territories From Obamacare", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare", "sailthru.description": "The Obama administration issued yet another waiver to get out of Obamacare -- for all the U.S. territories.\u00a0    The exemption, posted Thursday on a Department of Health and Human Services website, fr", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/witless_shrugged-e1331500273180.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd87\"", "article_summary": "AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEB4258760The Obama administration issued yet another waiver to get out of Obamacare \u2014 for all the U.S. territories.\nThe exemption, posted Thursday on a Department of Health and Human Services website, frees U.S. territories from a host of Obamacare regulations on health insurance markets.\nThe U.S. territories have been pleading with the Obama administration to exempt them from the regulations, but HHS officials had refused until now.\nEven in the states, that\u2019s not working nearly as well as the Obama administration had hoped.\n\u201cHHS is not authorized to choose which provisions\u2026might apply to the territories,\u201d top HHS official Gary Cohen wrote last year, The Washington Post reported."}
