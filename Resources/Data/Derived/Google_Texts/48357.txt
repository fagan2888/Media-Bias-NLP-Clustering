Romney McDaniel previously served as a Michigan committeewoman for the Republican National Committee. She helped out with the former Massachusetts governor’s failed presidential campaign in 2012 as well, heading the Women for Mitt Michigan Coalition.

During her acceptance speech, she vowed to try to help a Republican to win the state in the 2016 presidential election.

"We might not agree on everything, but we can agree that seven years of liberal Obama policies have a destructive effect on our nation and we need to get a Republican in the White House through Michigan in 2016," McDaniel said, according to the newspaper.

Republicans control the governor’s office and both chambers of the state legislature in Michigan. But the state has not chosen a Republican president since 1988. President Obama defeated Romney in the state with 54 percent of the vote.
