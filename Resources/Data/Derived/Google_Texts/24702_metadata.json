You\u2019ll probably be on the schedule within days. But what if you\u2019re an asthmatic whose breathing is deteriorating, or a diabetic whose medicines need adjustment, or an elderly patient who has unusual chest pain and needs a cardiology consultation? In much of the country, you can wait a week or weeks for such office appointments \u2014 or longer if you need to find a doctor who accepts your insurance plan or Medicare.\n\nAnd those waits are likely to get longer as the Affordable Care Act brings tens of millions of newly insured patients into a system that is often already poorly equipped to provide basic care. \u201cI fully expect wait times to be going up this year for Medicaid and Medicare and private insurance because we are expanding access to care, but we\u2019re not really expanding the system of providers,\u201d said Steven D. Pizer, a health care economist at Northeastern University in Boston.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs, which is reeling from revelations of long patient wait times at its hospitals, is actually one of the only health care systems in the nation that openly tracks waiting times and has standards for what they should be. \u201cThe V.A. does have some deficiencies which are being exposed right now, but compared to what?\u201d said Dave A. Chokshi, a former White House Fellow with the Veterans Affairs Department and a professor at NYU Langone Medical Center. \u201cThere aren\u2019t really accepted benchmarks for what\u2019s reasonable in the private sector.\u201d\n\nLike the V.A. system, many national health programs abroad are required to keep track of wait times because they are spending government money. But such systems also have medical and financial incentives to curb wait times and dispense preventive care in a timely manner: If people with relatively routine problems can\u2019t see a doctor or a specialist for an office visit, their problems often fester and require more expensive hospital treatment.\n\nFor that reason, Britain\u2019s National Health Service stipulates a standard that patients should wait in an emergency room no more than four hours if they are to be admitted to a hospital. The organization also tracks how many patients wait more than six weeks for needed diagnostic tests (1 percent recently). Canada, for its part, tracks wait times province by province and procedure by procedure.\n\nAnd as the Department of Veterans Affairs discovered, when wait times are public, there is often heavy pressure for improvement. \u201cThe U.K. puts a lot of effort into reducing wait times because it\u2019s a huge political issue \u2014 it wins or loses elections,\u201d Dr. Osborn of the Commonwealth Fund said. \u201cIn the U.S., compared to other countries, wait times have been less of a national conversation.\u201d\n\nTo reduce waits, countries have tried various interventions, such as assigning more medical staff members to trouble spots, redesigning scheduling algorithms to prioritize certain appointments and requiring at least one medical office in a given region to be open nights and weekends so patients don\u2019t have to visit emergency rooms. In the Commonwealth Fund report, 39 percent of insured Americans and 48 percent of the uninsured had visited an emergency room in the past two years, compared with less than 25 percent of Germans and Dutch.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the United States, Dr. Pizer said, shorter waits could be achieved by allowing nurses and physician assistants more leeway to open their own practices and perform simple diagnoses and procedures. Medical schools could be better motivated to turn out doctors in needed fields like primary care. The Merritt Hawkins survey found that Boston, the city with the most doctors per capita, had some of the longest wait times, because the city is flush with specialists.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth remembering that waiting for medical care can be either harmful or beneficial, depending on circumstances, doctors say.\n\nWait times for office visits are certainly \u201cbad for the old and frail who have conditions that require frequent monitoring\u201d like heart problems and diabetes, Dr. Chokshi said. And they can be deadly if a depressed person waits months for a first therapist\u2019s appointment.\n\nBut patience can pay off for many other conditions, like joint pain and viral infections, where \u2014 given a little time \u2014 the body often heals on its own.\n\nThere is widespread agreement that Americans receive unnecessary treatment when it is profitable to do so. For example, they are far more likely to get steroid injections or surgery for back pain than people in other countries, even though medical guidelines suggest six weeks of conservative treatment before other interventions are tried; backs often heal on their own, and there are risks to the procedures.\n\nSometimes, it would seem, a little more waiting would do us some good.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140705143007, "twitter": {"description": "We think we get medical appointments quickly, but that\u2019s not always true.", "creator": "nytrosenthal", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/sunday-review/long-waits-for-doctors-appointments-have-become-the-norm.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002981229"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Long Waits for Doctors\u2019 Appointments Have Become the Norm", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/06/sunday-review/0706ROSENTHAL/0706ROSENTHAL-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/sunday-review/long-waits-for-doctors-appointments-have-become-the-norm.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002981229", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/sunday-review/long-waits-for-doctors-appointments-have-become-the-norm.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "sundayreview", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sunday-review/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 5, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/elisabeth_rosenthal/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html#sundayreview", "section": "Sunday Review", "modified": "2014-07-10", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sunday-review/index.jsonp", "tag": "Medicine and Health", "published": "2014-07-05"}, "keywords": "Doctors,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Veterans Affairs Department,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Medicine and Health", "description": "We think we get medical appointments quickly, but that\u2019s not always true.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Elisabeth Rosenthal", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/06/sunday-review/0706ROSENTHAL/0706ROSENTHAL-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "06rosenthal", "byl": "By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "We think we get medical appointments quickly, but that\u2019s not always true.", "tom": "News Analysis", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/06/sunday-review/0706ROSENTHAL/0706ROSENTHAL-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Doctor", "CG": "sunday-review", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "July 5, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News Analysis", "org": "Veterans Affairs Department", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140710170019, "hdl_p": "The Health Care Waiting Game", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/sunday-review/long-waits-for-doctors-appointments-have-become-the-norm.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/06/sunday-review/0706ROSENTHAL/0706ROSENTHAL-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "We think we get medical appointments quickly, but that\u2019s not always true.", "title": "Long Waits for Doctors\u2019 Appointments Have Become the Norm"}, "pdate": 20140705, "des": "Medicine and Health", "articleid": 100000002981229, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Long Waits for Doctors\u2019 Appointments Have Become the Norm", "col": "News Analysis", "PST": "News Analysis"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd990b\"", "article_summary": "Finally, it\u2019s worth remembering that waiting for medical care can be either harmful or beneficial, depending on circumstances, doctors say.\nAnd as the Department of Veterans Affairs discovered, when wait times are public, there is often heavy pressure for improvement.\nThe organization also tracks how many patients wait more than six weeks for needed diagnostic tests (1 percent recently).\nIn our market-based system, patients can get lucrative procedures rapidly, even when there is no urgent medical need: Need a new knee, or an M.R.I., or a Botox injection?\nThe Merritt Hawkins survey found that Boston, the city with the most doctors per capita, had some of the longest wait times, because the city is flush with specialists."}
