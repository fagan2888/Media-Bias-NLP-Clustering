Nor is the office releasing the name of the driver, whom police have not charged.\n\nThe family declined to comment when reached at their home by the Asbury Park Press Thursday afternoon. Phone calls made to the family Saturday afternoon were not returned.\n\nRELATED: No charges in Lakewood toddler driveway death\n\nWolfson, the second toddler killed by a vehicle in Lakewood this year, died as the celebration of Hanukkah drew to a close.
