Now it appears Scott Brown is ready to ride the 2014 wave.\n\nThe Associated Press reports the former Republican senator from Massachusetts is expected to announce as early as Friday that he will form an exploratory committee to challenge New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.\n\nBrown\u2019s stunning victory in the January 2010 Massachusetts special election to replace the late Sen. Edward Kennedy foreshadowed troubles to come for congressional Democrats in that year\u2019s midterm elections, driven in large part by the backlash to President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul. With his potential Granite State run this year, Brown would once again be looking to capitalize on voter discontent with the plan.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act took center stage in this week\u2019s special election in Florida, where the winner, Republican David Jolly, hammered Democrat Alex Sink for her support of the law. Jolly\u2019s victory bolstered the GOP\u2019s strategy to focus on the health care law and has raised hopes about the party\u2019s chances of expanding their majority in the House and taking back control of the Senate from Democrats.\n\nSenate Democrats must defend seven seats in states that the president lost in the 2012 campaign, with six of those defeats coming by double-digit margins. New Hampshire is not on that list, as the president bested Romney there by nearly six percentage points. But if Republicans were able to put the Granite State in play it would signal a surge in the party\u2019s direction.\n\nRecent polling gives Shaheen an early advantage, with a Suffolk University survey showing her up 13 points on Brown, 52 percent to 39 percent. That comes even as the poll has the president\u2019s approval rating at 40 percent, and 52 percent of New Hampshire voters saying they believed the health care law was \u201cgenerally bad\u201d for the state.\n\nBrown also faces the challenge of running against an established New Hampshire political brand while he just recently relocated to the state from neighboring Massachusetts. In the Suffolk poll 11 percent of respondents offered the term \u201ccarpetbagger\u201d when asked for the first word or phrase they associated with Brown\u2019s name.\n\nBrown is scheduled to address the Northeast Republican Leadership Conference in Nashua on Friday afternoon, the latest move in his courtship of New Hampshire conservatives.\n\nThe Associated Press\u2019 Steve Peoples details Brown\u2019s recent outreach to Granite State Republicans:\n\nBrown spent much of the past two weeks calling key New Hampshire Republican officials and influential GOP activists, saying he was going to run and seeking their support. At the same time, Brown\u2019s camp has quietly begun offering paid positions to Republican operatives for a prospective New Hampshire campaign. Several people involved in the discussions said some in the GOP establishment remain skeptical given the former Republican senator\u2019s recent track record. The 54-year-old Brown angered Massachusetts Republicans last year after indicating he would run in the state\u2019s special U.S. Senate election, only to change his mind late in the process.\n\nThe New Hampshire Union Leader\u2019s John DiStaso, meanwhile, notes that Brown has doled out $29,000 to various GOP committees in advance of his appearance Friday:\n\nWe\u2019ve learned Brown has issued contributions from his The People\u2019s Seat PAC of $5,000 to the state party, $5,000 to the state Senate Republican PAC, $5,000 to the House Republican PAC, $1,000 to each of the 10 county committees and $1,000 each to the Manchester, Nashua and Concord Republican committees. This is in addition to $15,000 Brown donated to the NHGOP in 2013 and 2014.\n\nFor Republicans, Brown\u2019s possible entry into the New Hampshire Senate contest would give the party a high-profile candidate in a state that currently favors Democrats. Whether his candidacy would genuinely expand the map for Republicans is an open question, but at the very least it might force Democrats to move additional resources into the Granite State to help protect Shaheen; money that could be used to help red state Democrats in Arkansas, Louisiana and Alaska.\n\nA note to our readers: The Morning Line will take a brief hiatus next week and return Tuesday, March 25.
