After a nationwide search, the board named three finalists, but they all dropped out.\n\nTomasino had applied for the position, but was not initially named as a finalist. In the end, however, the commissioners said he was the best person for the job.\n\nHis contract included a base salary of $230,000 in addition to benefits and educational expenses.\n\nWallin said he suspects that the board will have an easier time finding qualified candidates this time around.\n\n\u201cThere are more former CEOs available as so many small hospitals are being absorbed by large ones,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity for the hospital with all the CEOs available.\u201d\n\nTomasino\u2019s tenure as CEO has been very eventful, especially with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBy a supermajority, voters last year approved a $50-million bond proposal to expand Whidbey General Hospital; the bond narrowly failed a couple of years prior, but Tomasino and others returned with a vigorous effort to present the proposal to the community.\n\nIn announcing his retirement, Tomasino told the board that the hospital has had \u201ca phenomenal change with employee satisfaction and the community,\u201d according to minutes of the meeting.\n\nThere have also been controversies over the year. Most recently, the head nurse was charged by the Island County prosecutor with assaulting a patient, but Tomasino came to her defense and claimed that the allegations were unfounded before the criminal investigation was complete.\n\nTomasino could not be immediately contacted for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whidbey General Hospital commissioners are putting together a list of criteria to help them find the perfect chief executive officer, according to Commissioner Ron Wallin.", "og": {"site_name": "South Whidbey Record", "description": "Whidbey General Hospital commissioners are putting together a list of criteria to help them find the perfect chief executive officer, according to Commissioner Ron Wallin.", "title": "Whidbey General Hospital CEO to hang up hat - South Whidbey Record", "url": "http://www.southwhidbeyrecord.com/news/267726631.html", "image": "http://image.issuu.com/160521001438-9dc8299ada6a42f9bcdd2c8642722715/jpg/page_1_thumb_large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@whidbeyrecord", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 118866555376}, "msvalidate.01": "87E5B723352F7F19F9D4F82B38A4E2DB", "verify-v1": "xp46D8SohxCVm32IcD0J/9dlxOyum45B4gGBJuzIPBI=", "viewport": "width=1228"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb509\"", "article_summary": "Current CEO Tom Tomasino announced his plans during a board meeting last month to not renew his contract and retire in October of 2015.\nWhidbey General Hospital commissioners are putting together a list of criteria to help them find the perfect chief executive officer, according to Commissioner Ron Wallin.\n\u201cThe board really appreciates that he gave us a year to find a replacement,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt means a new CEO can come in and work with Tom before he leaves so we have a really smooth transition.\u201dThe hospital board had some difficulty in finding a CEO in 2009.\n\u201cHe is announcing this now to give the board ample time to mount a search to find a new CEO,\u201d wrote hospital spokeswoman Trish Rose, in an email."}
