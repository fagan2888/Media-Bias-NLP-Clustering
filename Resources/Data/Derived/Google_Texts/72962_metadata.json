Rob Calabrese, a Canadian radio DJ, recently launched a website called Cape Breton if Donald Trump Wins which jokingly advertises the sleepy, rustic, and beautiful island community of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, on Canada\u2019s east coast, as a haven for Americans serious about fleeing America if Trump becomes president. And it appears that they are \u2014 Google searches have skyrocketed for \"how to move to Canada\" since Trump's big wins on Super Tuesday.\n\nThe only walls you\u2019ll find here, the website jokes, \u201care holding up the roofs of our extremely affordable houses.\" A pithy shot at Trump\u2019s questionable immigration policies, and his plan to build a wall on the Mexican-American border. Though \u201cCape Breton if Donald Trump Wins,\u201d was created as a joke, the possibility of Trump becoming the next leader of the free world is not, and some Americans say they\u2019re serious about taking the Canadian plunge.\n\nIn case you\u2019ve never visited the Great White North, here are 7 things you should know, and will probably love, about Canada if you decide to move there.\n\n1) Healthcare\n\nForget Obamacare, the premiums, and the paperwork. Healthcare in Canada is free and simpler than in the U.S. To Canadians, their healthcare system is dear to their hearts and a symbol of national pride \u2014 and it even has a Hollywood twist: Actor Kiefer Sutherland\u2019s grandfather, Tommy Douglas, a Canadian politician, was largely responsible for building Canada\u2019s healthcare system.\n\n2) Justin Trudeau\n\nHe\u2019s young, he\u2019s handsome, and he\u2019s a former snowboarding instructor. Trudeau is Canada's newest Prime Minister, and some have likened him to a Canadian version of John F. Kennedy Jr. Trudeau is a self-proclaimed feminist and will also be the first PM to attend Toronto's Pride parade. Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre, was one of Canada\u2019s most enduring and outspoken leaders and a bleeding-heart liberal who mingled in the Hollywood limelight, once even dating Barbara Streisand.\n\n3) Fewer Guns\n\nGuns are legal in Canada, but it\u2019s a lot more difficult \u2014 and in some cases illegal \u2014 to purchase pistols and automatic firearms. In America, deaths by shooting rose to 13,397 in 2015 according to the Gun Violence Archive. By comparison, Canada recorded just 172 firearm-related homicides in 2012 (the most recent statistics available).\n\n4) Vancouver Island\n\nSituated off the coast of Vancouver, this densely forested island is Cape Breton\u2019s warmer, more temperate, western cousin. Although there has been a lot of buzz about Americans moving to Cape Breton, Vancouver Island is arguably a much more livable place \u2014 at least climate-wise. Cape Breton is beautiful, but it\u2019s a frigid place in winter. Similar to Seattle\u2019s climate, Vancouver Island stays warm, albeit rainy, year-round. Plus, you\u2019ve got orcas, wild salmon, and the mountains. In other words: bliss.\n\n5) French Culture\n\nMost Americans who visit Canada come to Montreal \u2014 and braver tourists will tackle the more authentically French Quebec City \u2014 but most don\u2019t know about St. Pierre and Miquelon, an island off the south coast of Newfoundland that is actually owned by France. Although not technically a part of Canada, St. Pierre and Miquelon are literally in the nation\u2019s backyard, and just short a ferry-ride away. But don\u2019t forget to bring your Euros.\n\n6) Saskatoon Berries\n\nCanada\u2019s take on the blueberry and more of a Western Canadian prairie delicacy, this fruit is one of the country\u2019s best-kept secrets. They\u2019re bright purple, packed with vitamin C, and a tiny delicious super fruit. And they're a lot of fun to say. The fruit\u2019s name is derived from the Indigenous Cree word Mis-sask-quah-too-mina, which simply means, \u201cberry.\u201d\n\n7) Honorary Newfoundlander\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador, the most dialectically distinct region of Canada, next to French-speaking Quebec, will swear you in as an honorary citizen, or a \u201cNewfie,\u201d as the locals say, in what\u2019s known as a \u201cScreeching Ceremony\u201d. But there\u2019s a catch: you have to kiss a dead cod fish. Gross, but it might be worth it depending on how this election goes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From French culture to free healthcare, here are 8 reasons to move to Canada if Trump becomes the next U.S. president.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2016", "author": "Dorian Geiger", "og": {"site_name": "Teen Vogue", "description": "Reason 1: Justin Trudeau.", "title": "7 Extremely Compelling Reasons to Move to Canada Since the 2016 Election Is a Trashfire", "url": "http://www.teenvogue.com/story/7-reasons-to-move-to-canada-donald-trump", "image": "http://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/56d8fb3dbfd2c77212838c04/3:2/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/moving-to-canada-trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "teenvogue.com", "description": "Reason 1: Justin Trudeau.", "title": "7 Extremely Compelling Reasons to Move to Canada Since the 2016 Election Is a Trashfire", "image": {"src": "http://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/56d8fb3dbfd2c77212838c04/master/pass/moving-to-canada-trump.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@teenvogue", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 108943, "app_id": 1013284322017473}, "version": "1.28.0", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "keywords": "Canada,Donald Trump,2016 Election", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c71\"", "article_summary": "Though \u201cCape Breton if Donald Trump Wins,\u201d was created as a joke, the possibility of Trump becoming the next leader of the free world is not, and some Americans say they\u2019re serious about taking the Canadian plunge.\nCanada, the quiet northern neighbor of America, has been receiving plenty of publicity of late all thanks to presidential hopeful and billionaire reality star Donald Trump.\nAnd it appears that they are \u2014 Google searches have skyrocketed for \"how to move to Canada\" since Trump's big wins on Super Tuesday.\nAlthough there has been a lot of buzz about Americans moving to Cape Breton, Vancouver Island is arguably a much more livable place \u2014 at least climate-wise.\nSimilar to Seattle\u2019s climate, Vancouver Island stays warm, albeit rainy, year-round."}
