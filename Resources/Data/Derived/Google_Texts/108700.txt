MSNBC ratings plummet to lowest in 10 years

Wednesday was a terrible day for MSNBC, though in fairness there hasn’t been a good day for a long, long time. The Comcast-controlled cable news outlet had its worst day in ten years. Mediaite (hat tip: Powerline) provides charts for the prime demo (25-54) and total ratings, demonstrating how bad things have gotten for the out and proud leftist outlet: Watching Morning Joe today, there is no evidence that MSNBC has learned its lesson. A panel discussing the impact of George Stephanopoulos’s undisclosed donations to the Clinton Foundation solemnly agreed that the real problem now was going to be hard tough he would have to be interviewing Democrats, to prove his lack of bias.

Of course Comcast can afford to carry a low performing cable news subsidiary based on its rich profits from as a cable provider, so MSNBC may continue it course.
