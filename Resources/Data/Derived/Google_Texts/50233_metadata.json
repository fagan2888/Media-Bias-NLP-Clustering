Credit: Mark Hoffman\n\nSHARE Affordable Care Act\n\nSpecial Section: Videos, interactive maps, summaries and local coverage of Obamacare\n\n\n\nBy of the\n\nJon Rauser of The Rauser Agency, an insurance broker, senses an opportunity in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe law is expected to increase the demand for insurance sold directly to individuals and families, many of whom will be eligible for tax credits to help offset the cost. Rauser is betting that more than a few people will want help sorting through their options and picking a health plan.\n\nThe Rauser Agency, which specializes in selling health insurance to small employers, has opened two storefront locations \u2014 one in downtown Milwaukee, the other in Mequon \u2014 to reach that market.\n\n\"I am absolutely having great fun making lemonade out of lemons,\" Rauser said.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Inc., the parent of UnitedHealthcare, has used storefront offices to sell Medicare Advantage plans. And other insurance companies open kiosks at shopping malls to sell their plans during the annual open enrollment period.\n\nMany brokers sell insurance directly to individuals and families, but relatively few focus on that part of the market.\n\nThat segment of the health insurance market is relatively small. Estimates range from 10 million to 19 million people, compared with more than 150 million people who get health insurance through an employer.\n\nBut the market could more than double in the future because of the Affordable Care Act. Many people will turn to brokers and agents to help them understand deductibles, co-insurance, networks, prescription drug plans and other health insurance details.\n\n\"It's complicated, and it continues to be complicated,\" said David Romoser, a board member of Siebert Lutheran Foundation, a client of the Rauser Agency.\n\nRomoser recently referred two employees of Serenity Inn, a nonprofit organization that the foundation helps support, to the agency. The employees spent two hours with Chris McArdle going through health plans.\n\n\"Chris McArdle's patience and insight was invaluable,\" Romoser said.\n\nBoth people qualified for tax credits to help offset the cost, and ended up with better coverage at a lower cost, he said.\n\nThe Rauser Agency has sold supplemental insurance for people covered by Medicare, as a service for its clients and as an additional source of revenue, Rauser said. It also occasionally sold individual policies, typically to people who were self-employed.\n\nReducing rejections\n\nThe Affordable Care Act will make it easier to sell those policies by prohibiting insurers from turning away people with pre-existing health problems, eliminating the frustration of having an insurance company reject an application.\n\n\"Now at least we have a pretty good certainty of making a sale,\" Rauser said.\n\nThe requirement that everyone have health insurance or pay a penalty is likely to increase the size of the potential market. The penalty is relatively small next year \u2014 1% of family income or a minimum of $95 \u2014 but increases to 2.5% of income in 2016.\n\nAt the same time, health insurers reduced commissions on policies sold to individuals and families in recent years, after the Affordable Care Act required that at least 80 cents of each dollar in premiums be spent on medical claims.\n\nOther insurance brokers and agents also are likely to put more focus on the market for individual insurance in coming years.\n\nRauser will continue to sell health insurance to small employers, and he expects his existing clients to continue to offer health benefits to their employees.\n\nHis new strategy also is a hedge: Selling 12 policies to individuals and families a week is the equivalent of adding a small business as a client each week.\n\nHe hopes eventually to open storefronts to the south and west of the Milwaukee metropolitan area.\n\n\"I want to be between the Walgreens and the Pick 'n Save,\" Rauser said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Affordable Care Act creates niche for Rauser Agency", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/business/affordable-care-act-creates-niche-for-rauser-agency-b99171097z1-237205591.html", "image": {"width": 1067, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99171097z.1_20131224200012_000_gfp43me0.1-1.jpg", "height": 672}, "type": "article", "description": "Jon Rauser of The Rauser Agency, an insurance broker, senses an opportunity in the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Affordable Care Act creates niche for Rauser Agency"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99171097z.1_20131224200012_000_gfp43me0.1-1.jpg", "description": "Jon Rauser of The Rauser Agency, an insurance broker, senses an opportunity in the Affordable Care Act.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Affordable Care Act creates niche for Rauser Agency"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf1a\"", "article_summary": "Credit: Mark HoffmanSHARE Affordable Care ActSpecial Section: Videos, interactive maps, summaries and local coverage of ObamacareBy of theJon Rauser of The Rauser Agency, an insurance broker, senses an opportunity in the Affordable Care Act.\nBut the market could more than double in the future because of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Rauser Agency has two storefront locations, with one in downtown Milwaukee and another (right) at the Mequon Pavilions Shopping Center in Mequon.\n\"It's complicated, and it continues to be complicated,\" said David Romoser, a board member of Siebert Lutheran Foundation, a client of the Rauser Agency.\nMany brokers sell insurance directly to individuals and families, but relatively few focus on that part of the market."}
