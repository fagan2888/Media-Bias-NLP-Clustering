Ted Cruz notched another victory in Maine's Republican caucus late Saturday evening, edging out current GOP front-runner Donald Trump by 13 points.\n\nCruz earned about 46 percent of the vote, with Trump coming in second with about 33 percent of the vote. Ohio Gov. John Kasich came in third with approximately 12 percent of the vote and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio trailed with just 8 percent of the vote.\n\nCruz will receive 12 delegates, Trump nine, and Kasich two.\n\nTrump had gained some support from the state's party leadership last month, when Maine Gov. Paul LePage endorsed him, shortly after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced his backing of the billionaire. But the nod from LePage -- himself a bombastic governor who has drawn criticism over inflammatory, off-the-cuff remarks -- was not enough to tamp down Cruz's base.\n\nThree other states weigh in Saturday for the Republican primary race: Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana.\n\nEarlier in the day, Cruz won in a landslide victory in Kansas, trouncing Trump by double digits. Cruz won 48 percent of the vote, Trump earned 23 percent, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio had 17 percent and Ohio Gov. John Kasich had 11 percent.\n\nSaturday's states have a total of 155 delegates up for grabs.\n\nMaine will award 23 delegates in the Republican primary race.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Ted Cruz earned about 46 percent of the vote, with Donald Trump coming in second with about 33 percent of the vote.
