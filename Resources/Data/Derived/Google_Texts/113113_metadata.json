CNN reports:\n\nJames Holmes will spend the rest of his life in prison for killing 12 people and wounding 70 more at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater.\n\nA jury was unable Friday to reach a unanimous sentencing verdict, which results in life in prison without parole instead of the death penalty for Holmes, who had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in the 2012 shootings. He was convicted last month of 24 counts of first-degree murder \u2014 two for each of the slain victims. The 12-member jury reached a decision after deliberating almost seven hours since late Thursday. As they walked back into the courtroom shortly after 5 p.m. (7 p.m. ET), they made no eye contact with anyone. Some had a grim face. Some were ashen.\n\nThe site goes on to discuss Holmes\u2019 demeanor in the courtroom, and more:\n\nHolmes stood with his hands in his pockets as Judge Carlos Samour read the sentencing verdicts. One female juror later told reporters that there was no way to resolve the disagreement on what the sentence should be. \u201cThere was one firm holdout against the death penalty and two \u2026 who were on the fence,\u201d said the juror, who would not give her name. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they could have been swayed or not.\u201d She said the graphic nature of the evidence made the 15-week trial very difficult. She called it a life-changing experience.\n\nWe hope that the victims and their families are able to find peace now.
