Plus we have two kids. You don\u2019t want to go without.\u201d\n\nTHE STATE\u2019S Health Plan Finder is Washington\u2019s response to the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, a federal law requiring that all Americans have health care coverage.\n\nObamacare includes several provisions that help low-income residents get coverage for their medical bills.\n\nWhile the official closure of the open enrollment period is March 31, applicants must qualify for a program or pay their initial premium by March 23 in order to be covered by the deadline.\n\nONE OF the biggest changes is the provision that state Medicaid programs can be extended to wider demographic of people. In Washington state, the extended Medicaid program is called Apple Health, which is offered at no cost if the applicant or family has low or no income. It now includes dental.\n\nTo date, more than 1,800 Island County residents have enrolled in the Apple Health program and hundreds more have found insurance through the Health Plan Finder.\n\nRodgers said that without the new health programs, and the help from local advisors, their health care prospects would have been a \u201cnightmare.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a big help,\u201d Rodgers said.\n\nNOT ALL applications handled by the Opportunity Council have been resolved this quickly.\n\nShelby Welch, a 22-year-old with a pet-sitting business, spent months trying to enroll in a health care plan starting in October.\n\nWelch estimates she spent four to five hours at a time on the phone trying to get though on the Health Plan Finder\u2019s 800 number. She also was unable to get through to a real person at the Opportunity Council because they were initially short staffed and untrained.\n\nThe Opportunity Council originally looked into the new insurance plans as an additional service to add to the council\u2019s many programs, according to Lisa Clark, director of the Island County Opportunity Council.\n\n\u201cWe attended an interest meeting, and then figured out that we were the only ones from Island County who attended,\u201d Clark said.\n\nFor that reason, the Opportunity Council suddenly became the lead agency on the project and two staffers went through a Sept. 17 training \u2014 just a couple weeks before open enrollment began Oct. 1.\n\nTRYPHENA ADAMS, who was hired in early October, became the Opportunity Council\u2019s lead in-person assister and has since helped hundreds of people through the application process.\n\nIn keeping with national reports, Clark and Adams initially experienced numerous errors and system problems, causing delays and requiring applicants to reschedule appointments numerous times.\n\nWhile she watched her friends get \u201cright in\u201d and complete their applications, Welch seemed to experience every problem imaginable.\n\nThis included system errors, computer slow downs and staffing issues.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most frustrating and stressful things,\u201d Welch said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a story of a glitch.\u201d\n\nAFTER BECOMING extremely frustrated with the process, Welch went to the council\u2019s walk-in hours and camped out until she could make an appointment. That\u2019s when she met Adams.\n\n\u201cThe only positive thing was Tryphena,\u201d Welch said of Adams.\n\nWelch said despite her frustrating experience, she has seen the state and local agencies improve staffing and problem solving, making the process increasingly easy. On a recent phone call to the state\u2019s 1-800 number, Welch said she waited under five minutes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ten times better than October through January,\u201d Welch said.\n\nBased on her income, Welch qualified for Apple Health which now includes dental.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stoked about dental,\u201d Welch said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just a huge relief off your shoulders.\u201d\n\nLONGTIME SOUTH Whidbey resident Denise Hubert was uninsured the last time she had a medical emergency and ended up paying costly medical bills out of pocket.\n\nSo the Affordable Care Act was good news for Hubert.\n\nAn avid reader, Hubert had picked up bits and pieces from the news about Obamacare, but she still had a lot of questions and was unsure how to proceed.\n\n\u201cI was delighted to go to the public meeting,\u201d Hubert said. \u201cWhen I heard you could get in-person assistance, I thought that was even better.\u201d\n\nDuring an appointment with Adams, Hubert also experienced a series of errors on her application and it took a little work before Hubert was able to view what types of insurance she might be eligible for.\n\nWHEN AN Island County resident logs onto the Health Plan Finder, he or she will have three insurance options if he or she doesn\u2019t qualify for Apple Health. These plans are LifeWise, the Group Health Cooperative and Premera Blue Cross. Each available insurance offers three tiers of coverage \u2014 gold, silver and bronze \u2014 with a variety of deductible and premium levels.\n\nDepending on the applicants income and family size, they may be eligible for tax credits that can be applied to qualified plans.\n\nBased on the information entered into the system, the Health Plan Finder will direct applicants to the areas that apply, including Apple Health and the tax credit program.\n\nHUBERT, WHO describes herself as a patient person, said the delays were understandable given that it was a new program that the country is figuring out as it goes. Hubert who works as a contractor for a small firm, was able to qualify for Apple Health.\n\n\u201cIt was a little frustrating but it\u2019s not related to any one person,\u201d Hubert said. \u201cAnd it had a good ending. I\u2019m certainly glad to see it for this country. Health care has not been extended to everyone and it does my heart good to see that.\u201d\n\nTHIS WEEK, Clark said that the state has worked out a lot of the errors that were initially popping up and that the Opportunity Council, which has since partnered with Whidbey General, has more staff and is better equipped to deal with difficult cases.\n\nWhile the learning curve has been sharp, feedback from the community has made the process worthwhile.\n\nThe Opportunity Council has helped more than 600 residents and families through the application.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been almost overwhelming to see the response from people who have not had health insurance before,\u201d Clark said.\n\n\u201cThe profound relief and excitement \u2026 it has been pretty amazing.\u201d\n\n\u2022 For information, visit www.wahealthcarefinder.org, call toll-free at 855-923-4633, or contact the Opportunity Council at 360-679-6577.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Until this past September, when he was laid off from his information technology job, Rob Rodgers and his family of four were covered by health insurance.\n\nAfter he lost his job, he turned to the Washington Health Plan Finder in search of coverage available under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSimilar to national reports, he didn\u2019t have much success.\n\n\u201cWe tried the website and had a horrible, horrible time,\u201d Rodgers said.\n\nAFTER ATTENDING a public meeting on the Affordable Care Act held by the Island County Opportunity Council last year, Rodgers and his wife were able to connect with staff and get signed up for one of the low-cost health plans through the Health Plan Finder.", "og": {"site_name": "Whidbey News-Times", "description": "Until this past September, when he was laid off from his information technology job, Rob Rodgers and his family of four were covered by health insurance.\n\nAfter he lost his job, he turned to the Washington Health Plan Finder in search of coverage available under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSimilar to national reports, he didn\u2019t have much success.\n\n\u201cWe tried the website and had a horrible, horrible time,\u201d Rodgers said.\n\nAFTER ATTENDING a public meeting on the Affordable Care Act held by the Island County Opportunity Council last year, Rodgers and his wife were able to connect with staff and get signed up for one of the low-cost health plans through the Health Plan Finder.", "title": "Whidbey Island residents navigate Obamacare - Whidbey News-Times", "url": "http://www.whidbeynewstimes.com/news/247580011.html", "image": "http://media.bclocalnews.com/images/17427whidbey02-27-2014-obamacare-whidbey-island.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://media.bclocalnews.com/images/17427whidbey02-27-2014-obamacare-whidbey-island.jpg"}, "site": "@whidbeynews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 158867167511445}, "msvalidate.01": "87E5B723352F7F19F9D4F82B38A4E2DB", "verify-v1": "xp46D8SohxCVm32IcD0J/9dlxOyum45B4gGBJuzIPBI=", "viewport": "width=1228"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc5eb\"", "article_summary": "To date, more than 1,800 Island County residents have enrolled in the Apple Health program and hundreds more have found insurance through the Health Plan Finder.\nThe Opportunity Council has helped more than 600 residents and families through the application.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been almost overwhelming to see the response from people who have not had health insurance before,\u201d Clark said.\nYou don\u2019t want to go without.\u201dTHE STATE\u2019S Health Plan Finder is Washington\u2019s response to the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, a federal law requiring that all Americans have health care coverage.\nThe Opportunity Council originally looked into the new insurance plans as an additional service to add to the council\u2019s many programs, according to Lisa Clark, director of the Island County Opportunity Council."}
