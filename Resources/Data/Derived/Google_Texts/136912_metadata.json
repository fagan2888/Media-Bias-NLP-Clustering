That\u2019s on top of an estimated $446,000 the Roanoke-based health care system lost during the first two years of the program.\n\nWhen the program began, the maximum penalty was 1 percent of federal funding that hospitals receive for all Medicare patients. Starting with the current fiscal year that began Oct. 1, and continuing in the years after that, the maximum penalty will be 3 percent.\n\nOther changes to the program are tightening the financial squeeze on hospitals.\n\nPreviously, the government tracked Medicare patients with heart failure, heart attacks and pneumonia in calculating the penalties. This year, patients getting hip and knee replacements and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have been added to the mix.\n\nOther measures will likely be included in the future, according to the American Hospital Association, which calls the program \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d\n\nAt Carilion, the larger penalty this year was the result of the higher maximum percentage cut of Medicare payments, combined with a slight increase in readmission rates from July 2010 to June 2013, the time period used in calculating the cuts.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the readmission numbers for the hospitals are decreasing,\u201d Earnhart wrote in an email.\n\nThe payment reductions at Carilion hospitals this year were all less than 1 percent of their Medicare funding, while those at four hospitals run by LewisGale Regional Health System ranged from 1.34 percent to 2.85 percent, according to an analysis of U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data by Kaiser Health News, an affiliate of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nCarilion hospitals in Lexington and Giles County are not subject to the penalties because they fall under a different Medicare reimbursement system as critical access hospitals, a designation that includes smaller and rural hospitals. Numbers for Carilion Roanoke Community Hospital are included with those from Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital.\n\nAt LewisGale, officials attributed a number of factors to an across-the-board increase in penalties from the year before.\n\nThe new maximum penalty of 3 percent and additional categories of health conditions measured were part of the reason, Dr. Richard Embrey, chief medical officer at LewisGale, said in a written statement. In addition, he said, \u201ccollectively our health system had a very slight increase in a readmission category at select hospitals.\u201d\n\nReadmissions were down among pneumonia patients at LewisGale Medical Center and those treated for heart attacks at the system\u2019s Blacksburg and Pulaski hospitals. In other areas, \u201cwe are continuing to make progress by implementing new strategies and programs,\u201d Embrey said.\n\nNew programs include adding nurse navigators to identify high-risk patients and improving the way patients are informed of what they need to do for a quick recovery once they leave the hospital.\n\nLewisGale did not release dollar figures on the amount of penalties at its four hospitals.\n\nAt Carilion, officials say they are taking a number of steps to reduce readmissions. Among them: morning \u201chuddles\u201d held by both inpatient and outpatient treatment providers to discuss at-risk patients, flagging those patients in the health system\u2019s electronic medical record system, and intense efforts after patients are released to have them follow up with their primary care physician or other providers.\n\nAt many hospitals, previous post-release efforts were limited to a few pages of written instructions that patients took home with them.\n\nSubstantial losses\n\nNationally, about one in five Medicare patients were readmitted to a hospital within 30 days of their initial stay in 2010, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That cost the program $17.5 billion \u2014 a sum the government hopes to trim by making it financially advantageous for hospitals to find ways to prevent readmissions.\n\nAbout 2,600 hospitals across the country are being penalized this fiscal year, for a total payment reduction of approximately $428 million, CMS spokesman Alper Ozinal said.\n\nThat\u2019s about 400 more hospitals than were penalized last year, and the total dollar amount has nearly doubled.\n\nEven as the penalties have increased, readmissions have actually gone down about 1 percentage point for Medicare patients treated for heart failure, heart attacks and pneumonia, according to Nancy Foster, vice president of quality and patient safety policy for the American Hospital Association.\n\nTougher penalties, more health conditions added to the formula and increasing multipliers used to calculate the payment reductions are all part of the reason for the increase.\n\nWhile a 1 percent or\n\n2 percent cut in Medicare payments may not sound like a lot for health care systems that reap billions in revenue, the loss is substantial when viewed in a larger context, Foster\n\nsaid.\n\n\u201cMany hospitals are operating on razor-thin margins, or even operating on a deficit,\u201d she said. Medicare is one of the largest sources of funds for hospitals, and the total reductions they face are closer to 10 percent when other quality-enhancement programs are taken into account, the hospital association contends.\n\nAnd in Virginia, which has opted not to expand its Medicaid program as called for by the Affordable Care Act, there are even more cuts for hospitals to absorb.\n\nCarilion, for example, is likely to get about\n\n$20 million less in other forms of Medicare funding next year \u2014 a loss that was expected to be largely offset by more Medicaid payments for indigent patients the health care system has been treating for free or at discounted rates through its charity care program.\n\nWhen Virginia decided not to expand Medicaid, as it was allowed to do by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that came down after the Affordable Care Act was passed, hospitals were left in a pinch.\n\nIn the view of the American Hospital Association, Medicare\u2019s program to reduce readmissions is \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, the association says, patients readmitted within 30 days for reasons unrelated to their first hospital stay \u2014 a pneumonia patient who goes back to the hospital with a broken hip, for example \u2014 are counted against the hospital.\n\nAnother concern is that the program unfairly punishes hospitals that treat the largest number of low-income patients. Those patients are more likely to be readmitted because they often live in communities where there\u2019s less access to pharmacies, transportation and other services needed for a speedy recovery.\n\n\u201cWe are gravely concerned that the program has a disproportionate effect on the hospitals seeing the most vulnerable patients in the country,\u201d Foster said.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced that all hospitals are in dire financial straits.\n\nA recent study by the Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, an organization that backs free markets and limited government, found that the finances of Virginia hospitals \u201care in pretty good shape overall.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hospitals may \u2018want\u2019 to have more Medicaid dollars roll in, but do they really \u2018need\u2019 those taxpayer funds?\u201d Institute President Michael Thompson wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cThe figures in this new report certainly question the hospitals\u2019 call for financial help.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.roanoke.com", "description": "Eight hospitals from Roanoke to Tazewell County will see their Medicare payments docked this fiscal year under a federal program that penalizes hospitals for having too many readmissions of certain patients.", "title": "Southwest Virginia hospitals feel pinch from Medicare readmission penalties", "url": "http://www.roanoke.com/news/virginia/southwest-virginia-hospitals-feel-pinch-from-medicare-readmission-penalties/article_bc7b806f-3f7c-5a37-a2bd-252db4743f6c.html", "image": {"width": 228, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/eb/7eb21411-ac37-5b9d-a44f-0960f84bca62/54399623c9a57.preview-200.jpg?resize=228%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@roanoketimes", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "Eight hospitals from Roanoke to Tazewell County will see their Medicare payments docked this fiscal year under a federal program that penalizes hospitals for having too many readmissions of certain patients.", "fb": {"app_id": 251357365028982}, "keywords": "virginia,med_beat", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/roanoketimes"}, "news_keywords": "virginia,med_beat"}, "article_summary": "When the program began, the maximum penalty was 1 percent of federal funding that hospitals receive for all Medicare patients.\nPreviously, the government tracked Medicare patients with heart failure, heart attacks and pneumonia in calculating the penalties.\nThat\u2019s on top of an estimated $446,000 the Roanoke-based health care system lost during the first two years of the program.\nCarilion hospitals in Lexington and Giles County are not subject to the penalties because they fall under a different Medicare reimbursement system as critical access hospitals, a designation that includes smaller and rural hospitals.\nSubstantial lossesNationally, about one in five Medicare patients were readmitted to a hospital within 30 days of their initial stay in 2010, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services."}
