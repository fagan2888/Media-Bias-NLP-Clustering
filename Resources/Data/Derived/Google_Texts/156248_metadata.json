They say the same things time and again to Fox\u2019s mostly white, badly informed audience which is in danger of dying off; the median age of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s viewers is seventy-two. However, when it comes to religion, much of what they say reflects tacit anti-rationalist assumptions shared by far too many people from all walks of life \u2013 assumptions that must be challenged and refuted.\n\nA case in point: on April 2, O\u2019Reilly opened his show with a segment entitled \u201cThe War on Christianity Getting Even Worse.\u201d In it, he provides a distressing video overview of recent terrorist attacks against and executions of Christians in Africa and Pakistan, and declares that \u201cChristians are being slaughtered all over the place.\u201d He segues to the United States, where \u201cverbal attacks against Christians are the headline,\u201d and \u201csome far-left people . . . are smearing Americans who oppose things like abortion and gay marriage,\u201d from which he concludes that \u201cit is open season on Christians.\u201d\n\nThe evidence? \u201cWell-known religion hater\u201d Bill Maher (shown calling religions \u201cstupid and dangerous\u201d) has a \u201cfree pass to bash people of faith,\u201d with his \u201cvicious behavior toward Christianity largely ignored in the press.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly presents results from an Associated Press \u2013 Gallup poll according to which 57 percent of Americans favor letting \u201cwedding-related businesses with religious objections\u201d opt out of serving gay marriages, as well as a Public Religion Research Institute survey showing that 54 percent of Americans believe their religious liberty is under threat. \u201cMost Americans get\u201d what\u2019s going on, he says. Nevertheless, \u201csecular progressives have succeeded in putting people of faith on the defensive,\u201d with a prime example of this being the pizzeria in Walkerton, Indiana, which, in a report aired by a local television channel, declared it would refuse to bake pizzas for a gay wedding.\n\n(The shop\u2019s owner added that \u201cWe\u2019re not discriminating against anyone. It\u2019s just that\u2019s our belief, and everybody has the right to believe anything.\u201d Her internally inconsistent statement went unchallenged by the reporter.)\n\nO\u2019Reilly informs us that \u201call hell descended on the store, as secular zealots threatened all kinds of things.\u201d He then flashes a clip of Newt Gingrich denouncing \u201clynch mobs.\u201d (No \u201clynch mobs\u201d besieged the pizzeria, which, following its homophobic proclamation, managed to rake in donations of more than $50,000 from supporters. O\u2019Reilly omits mentioning this.) Who\u2019s to blame for the mounting perils Christianity faces in America? Religious leaders, both Catholic and Protestant, for failing to \u201cpush back\u201d against the secular onslaught.\n\nIt hardly takes a journalistic sleuth to ferret out the simultaneously ludicrous and lamentable false equivalency that O\u2019Reilly has drawn here between the horrific, all-too-real massacres of Christians underway in countries afflicted with terrorism abroad, and the barbs, criticisms, and, yes, insults about religion coming from some vocal atheists, including Maher, in the United States. The death toll from the former stands in the hundreds; from the latter: zero. I\u2019m unaware of a single atheist who, motivated by his or her nonbelief, has called for or committed acts of violence against Christians anywhere, at any time. Obviously, nonbelievers possess no \u201csacred text\u201d with which they could justify harming anyone, let alone people of faith. (NB to those who will take to the comments section and rant about Stalin and Mao. Murderous dictators both, they ordered their atrocities not on account of their atheism, but to \u201cdefend the revolution\u201d and secure their power.)\n\nBut facts rarely hinder O\u2019Reilly. To deepen his audience\u2019s (mis)understanding of the (non-existent) war on Christianity, he then turns to Ann Coulter. As one might expect, Coulter blames the liberal media and progressives for \u201chating on\u201d the Christians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Christianity that the Left hates most of all,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause that is the foundation of our country . . . and all of our freedoms come from that, freedom of association, freedom of speech.\u201d In this, \u201cthe most consequential nation on earth,\u201d she says, Christians would prefer to change \u201cthe bedpans of Ebola patients in Nigeria rather than stand up to the New York Times and stand up against abortion and fight against these bullies.\u201d The dastardly liberals and their media are trying to \u201ctear down the heart of this country by going directly at the heart of America, which is Christianity.\u201d\n\nWhere to start here? Nigeria suffered only a handful of Ebola cases and has been free of the hemorrhagic fever for almost six months now; the worst-hit countries have been to its west. Religion as the source of free speech? The three Abrahamic faiths, with their \u201crevealed\u201d truths against which \u201cblasphemy\u201d (that is, any behavior supposedly disrespectful of God) is forbidden (and punishable by death in the Bible), have historically fought against free speech, the most lethal opponent of their bizarre, improbable doctrines. Few need reminding that the Vatican formalized the suppression of free speech with its infamous Index Librorum Prohibitorum (List of Prohibited Books), which included the works of the Enlightenment\u2019s key luminaries and many other intellectual giants, and which was abolished only in 1966.\n\nAnd Christianity as the \u201cfoundation of our country?\u201d Coulter, formerly a constitutional lawyer, could knowingly pronounce such a monstrous untruth only to mislead further the already historically illiterate \u2013 that is, Fox\u2019s audience, dumbed-down by watching shows such as O\u2019Reilly\u2019s and taking them seriously. That Christian zealots initiated the mass European migration to North America no one disputes. They did not, however, found the country; the secularist Founding Fathers, who mostly regarded religion with deep suspicion, did. Check no further than Jefferson\u2019s \u201cwall of separation between church and state\u201d and, obviously, the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment (which protects free speech from faith by forbidding Congress from establishing a state religion), as well as the more obscure Article VI, which declares that \u201cno religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\u201d If Christianity really were the \u201cfoundation of our country,\u201d by Coulter\u2019s logic the Founding Fathers would have included an amendment making Bible study mandatory for all aspirants to public office.\n\nO\u2019Reilly then asks Coulter how it is that the 80 percent of Americans who consider themselves Christians \u201care getting thumped, they\u2019re losing . . . . How did that happen?\u201d\n\nFor Coulter, the answer lies in pusillanimous Christian leaders (abetted by spineless Republicans). Their cowardice is, she says, \u201cridiculous,\u201d because \u201cthe one thing every Christian should have is courage. The most important thing in your life, eternity, is already taken care of. Go out and fight. You\u2019re afraid of being sneered at by the New York Times?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "What flabbergasts O\u2019Reilly & Coulter is nonbelievers are no longer keeping mum about Christianity's rank stupidity", "title": "Bill Maher terrifies Bill O\u2019Reilly: An atheist has the Fox News host running scared", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "What flabbergasts O\u2019Reilly & Coulter is nonbelievers are no longer keeping mum about Christianity's rank stupidity", "title": "Bill Maher terrifies Bill O\u2019Reilly: An atheist has the Fox News host running scared", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/12/bill_maher_terrifies_bill_oreilly_an_atheist_has_the_fox_news_host_running_scared/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/maher_oreilly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What flabbergasts O\u2019Reilly & Coulter is nonbelievers are no longer keeping mum about Christianity's rank stupidity", "title": "Bill Maher terrifies Bill O\u2019Reilly: An atheist has the Fox News host running scared", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/maher_oreilly.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jeffrey Tayler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ann Coulter, Bill Maher, Bill O'Reilly, Editor's Picks, Religion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Ann Coulter, Bill Maher, Bill O'Reilly, Editor's Picks, Religion, NewsRefuting the likes of Fox News\u2019 popular talk-show host Bill O\u2019Reilly and the razor-tongued television pundit and spewer-out of bestsellers Ann Coulter may seem pointless.\nReligion as the source of free speech?\nO\u2019Reilly then asks Coulter how it is that the 80 percent of Americans who consider themselves Christians \u201care getting thumped, they\u2019re losing .\nare smearing Americans who oppose things like abortion and gay marriage,\u201d from which he concludes that \u201cit is open season on Christians.\u201dThe evidence?\n\u201cIt\u2019s Christianity that the Left hates most of all,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause that is the foundation of our country ."}
