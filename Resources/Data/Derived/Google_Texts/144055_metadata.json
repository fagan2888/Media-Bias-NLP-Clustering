The more interesting and profound changes will be qualitative, not quantitative.\u201d\n\nThe study\u2019s authors analyzed state and national health care data and conducted in-depth interviews with health care leaders from across California. The leaders agreed that ACA implementation in California has increased the demand for services and is driving the need for new models of care. The leaders also see the ACA as driving change from a clinic- and hospital-based fee-for-service model of care to a model that emphasizes preventive care and positive patient outcomes.\n\n\u201cThere is a new focus on measurement \u2013 of quality of care, cost of care and patient satisfaction,\u201d said co-author Susan Chapman, RN, PhD, FAAN, a professor in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the UCSF School of Nursing. \u201cAs a result, health care organizations need to be attuned to patient interests and satisfaction as never before. This means that current and future health care workers will need better training in customer service skills, as well as more education in the use of technology to interpret data.\u201d\n\nThe study also found that:\n\nThe rate of technological innovation, such as remote health care and the use of mobile health apps, will continue to increase.\n\nBehavioral health services will need to be better integrated into primary care.\n\nCare navigators and coordinators will be in high demand to guide patients through the health care system \u2013 a role that could potentially be filled by medical assistants or licensed vocational nurses if they receive the right training.\n\nEmployees will need to work to the full extent permitted by their licenses, which may mean that contracts will have to be renegotiated and regulations will need to change.\n\nLinda Zorn, statewide sector navigator of the Health Workforce Initiative funded by the California Community Colleges Chancellor\u2019s Office, said, \u201cThis research is vital to the California Community Colleges as we work to rapidly respond to health care workforce needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmployers are focused on educating and training the workforce of the future,\u201d said Cathy Martin, vice president of workforce policy for the California Hospital Association, one of the funders of the study. \u201cOur educational institutions must engage employers early and often when developing programs in order to ensure the programs meet current industry demand for workers and that they produce health professionals with the skills needed in the evolving health care field,\u201d said Martin.\n\nLabor-management partnerships will also play a role in developing innovative programs to help workers learn new skills, according to Rebecca Miller, director of workforce development for SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. \u201cAs a labor union, we partner with the industry and help lead the retraining of current workers for the jobs of the future and help develop programs to bring new workers into the health care field with the skills that match the changing landscape,\u201d said Miller. \u201cOur union education fund is already heading in that direction and adapting to the changes we know are coming.\u201d\n\nFinally, said Spetz, \u201cLeaders will have to adapt to this changing world, and health care workers at all levels will have to learn new leadership skills, including critical thinking, decision-making and providing constructive feedback. We\u2019re looking at a world in which LVNs and medical assistants do care management, clerks move along the implementation electronic health record systems, and RNs become leaders and champions of these new systems.\u201d Physicians will have to learn new collaborative skills as well, said Spetz, \u201csuch as working in teams and giving constructive feedback to colleagues.\u201d\n\nCo-authors of the study are Shelley Oberlin of Health Systems Innovation Network and Renae Waneka, MPH, of UCSF.\n\nThe study was supported by funds from the California Community Colleges Chancellor\u2019s Office, the California Hospital Association, the California Workforce Development Board, SEIU-UHW and the SEIU-UHW Joint Employer Trust.\n\nThe study can be viewed in its entirety at http://rnworkforce.ucsf.edu/publications/impact-2010-affordable-care-act-california-health-care-labor-force.\n\nUC San Francisco (UCSF) is a leading university dedicated to promoting health worldwide through advanced biomedical research, graduate-level education in the life sciences and health professions, and excellence in patient care.
