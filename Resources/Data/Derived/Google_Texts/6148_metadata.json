That came against the Colts, who shut out the Bengals 27-0 the previous week.\n\nBackground: Roethlisberger was a huge winner early in his NFL career, going 13-0 as a rookie, then leading the Steelers past the Broncos in the AFC championship game in Denver and Super Bowl title in his second season (2005). Big Ben won two Super Bowls in his first five seasons, then played in a third to cap his seventh season (2010). But his Steelers haven\u2019t won a playoff game since the 2010 AFC championship game against the Jets \u2014 and they have gone only 8-8 and 8-8 each of the past two seasons.\n\nKlis\u2019 take: This game against the Ravens will determine whether Roethlisberger and the Steelers are back to playoff caliber again. Big Ben started 4-0 against Ravens QB Joe Flacco in head-to-head meetings but since has gone 1-4, including a 26-6 loss in Week 2. Now 32, Roethlisberger is within range of having a Hall of Fame career. The only QBs with at least two Super Bowl appearances not in the Hall of Fame are Jim Plunkett, Craig Morton and Joe Theismann. Plunkett is the only QB with two Super Bowl wins not in the Hall (the Giants\u2019 Eli Manning may join him). All QBs with at least three Super Bowl appearances have been immortalized except Kurt Warner, who is eligible for the first time. If Big Ben wins one more Super Bowl in the next five years, he\u2019s a first-ballot Hall of Famer, while the two quarterbacks drafted ahead of him in 2004 \u2014 Manning and Philip Rivers \u2014 might fall short.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ben Roethlisberger,NFL,Steelers", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Roethlisberger was a huge winner early in his NFL career, going 13-0 as a rookie, then leading the Steelers past the Broncos in the AFC championship game in Denver and Super Bowl title in his second season (2005).", "title": "Ben Roethlisberger: Spotlight on the Steelers quarterback", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/11/01/ben-roethlisberger-spotlight-steelers-quarterback/30710/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2012/01/ben-roethlisberger-pittsburgh-steelers.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Roethlisberger was a huge winner early in his NFL career, going 13-0 as a rookie, then leading the Steelers past the Broncos in the AFC championship game in Denver and Super Bowl title in his second season (2005).", "creator": "@mikeklis", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/11/01/ben-roethlisberger-spotlight-steelers-quarterback/30710/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2012/01/ben-roethlisberger-pittsburgh-steelers.jpg", "title": "Ben Roethlisberger: Spotlight on the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Roethlisberger was a huge winner early in his NFL career, going 13-0 as a rookie, then leading the Steelers past the Broncos in the AFC championship game in Denver and Super Bowl title in his second season (2005)."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8b1\"", "article_summary": "Spotlight on\u2026 Ben Roethlisberger, quarterback, SteelersWhen: 6:30 p.m. Sunday vs. the Baltimore Ravens at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh.\nAll QBs with at least three Super Bowl appearances have been immortalized except Kurt Warner, who is eligible for the first time.\nBig Ben won two Super Bowls in his first five seasons, then played in a third to cap his seventh season (2010).\nKlis\u2019 take: This game against the Ravens will determine whether Roethlisberger and the Steelers are back to playoff caliber again.\nPlunkett is the only QB with two Super Bowl wins not in the Hall (the Giants\u2019 Eli Manning may join him)."}
