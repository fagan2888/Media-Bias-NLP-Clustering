The 50-pound baby will eventually join the herd of four other eastern bongos in the river exhibit, zoo spokeswoman Lydia Jennings said in the zoo\u2019s blog Dallas ZooHoo.\n\nAmara has a chestnut coat with thin white lines and will eventually have tilted horns that can grow to be 40 inches long and are used for clearing brush out of the way in dense forests, she said.\n\n\u201cAntelope are generally very skittish, but bongo are one of the most easygoing,\u201d mammal curator Keith Zdrojewski said in a statement. \u201cThey\u2019re very laid-back, with personalities almost as big as they are.\u201d\n\nThe calf is the zoo\u2019s 24th since the start of a breeding program in 1975.\n\nThere are about 300 eastern bongo left in Association of Zoos and Aquariums zoos, but only about 100 remain in parts of Kenya\u2019s mountain forests as a result of poaching, Jennings said.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExL2Vhc3Rlcm4tYm9uZ28tY2FsZi1ib3JuLWF0LXRoZS1kYWxsYXMtem9vLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Claire Z.
