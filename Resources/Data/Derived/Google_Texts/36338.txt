It has begun, 2016 has finally arrived! Nevermind Hillary’s perpetual side-stepping and Jeb’s confused exploration. Ted Cruz, my fellow former Canadian (unfortunately I have to claim him) is running for President of the United States.

As expected, there was a lot of small-government, repeal-Obamacare, and self-pontificating talk. What’s more interesting, however, is how Ted chose to make the announcement — during a mandatory assembly at Liberty University, a Christian school in Virginia that apparently doubles as a pit stop for Republicans trying to capture the evangelical vote. Cruz prepared for his speech extensively in a stage rehearsal that included kissing practice with his wife.

This bizarre campaign behavior prompted Jon Stewart to apologize to an old friend last night. “Even the Mitt Romney-tron 3000 didn’t have to practice waving and kissing,” he said.

What’s more baffling is that after Cruz railed against the dangers of big government and metadata, he repeatedly asked the literally captive audience to text the word “Imagine” or “Constitution” to the number 33733 without explanation. Which begs the question: What planet is Ted Cruz really from? You can’t be Texan after you’ve been Canadian!
