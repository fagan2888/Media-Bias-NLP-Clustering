Known on the street as \u201ckrokodil,\u201d the caustic homemade opiate is made from over-the-counter codeine-based headache pills mixed with iodine, gasoline, paint thinner or alcohol. When it\u2019s injected, the concoction destroys a user\u2019s tissue, turning the skin scaly and green like a crocodile. Festering sores, abscesses and blood poisoning are common.\n\nKrokodil is utterly terrifying. From Time\u2019s investigation into how the drug has devastated Russia:\n\nPredictably, it has spread the fastest in the poorest and most remote parts of the country, like Vorkuta, Pavlova\u2019s hometown, a former Gulag prison camp about 100 miles (161 km) north of the Arctic Circle. The winters there last eight months of the year, and as Pavlova recalls, the young people are in a constant state of boredom. Most of them drink and few of them work, the same as in hundreds of towns and villages across Russia\u2019s frozen north. Besides her, Pavlova says there were about a dozen krokodil addicts she hung around with, including her brother. \u201cPractically all of them are dead now,\u201d she says. \u201cFor some it led to pneumonia, some got blood poisoning, some had an artery burst in their heart, some got meningitis, others simply rot.\n\nNote well in the Time story that Russian Evangelicals and Pentecostals, with no state support, have established a network of rehab homes for these addicts. God bless them.\n\nI cannot imagine the state of mind that would drive someone to inject a drug that does this to one:\n\n[UPDATE: I\u2019ve moved the image to below the jump, per Erin\u2019s request. \u2014 RD]\n\nNobody starts out saying, \u201cGosh, I\u2019d love for my flesh to rot away! Can I have some of that stuff?\u201d Can any of you readers with experience of the psychology of drug addiction help me understand how someone gets to the point where one injects krokodil? I mean, I understand someone using cocaine and heroin, because nobody thinks that their lives are going to be ruined by doing so. But krokodil\u2019s effects are so horrifying, and so swift, that it seems impossible for a potential user to lie to himself about the fate that awaits him. Right? What am I not seeing? Help me understand.\n\nWe humans are so perverse and self-destructive. And hey, anti-drug war folks, surely fighting krokodil is a drug war even you think is worth waging. Yes?\n\n[See the image below the jump.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Conservative", "description": "Here's a Russian import we could do without: A powerful heroin-like drug that rots flesh and bone has made its first reported appearance in the United States,", "title": "<i>Krokodil</i> Is Here", "url": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/krokodil-is-here/", "image": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/imgres1.jpeg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here's a Russian import we could do without:A powerful heroin-like drug that rots flesh and bone has made its first reported appearance in the United States, an Arizona health official says.Know", "title": "Krokodil Is Here", "image": {"src": "http://theamericanconservative.com/images/logo-for-twitter-card.jpg"}, "creator": "@amconmag", "site": "@amconmag", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "maisie.allison"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc77\"", "article_summary": "And hey, anti-drug war folks, surely fighting krokodil is a drug war even you think is worth waging.\nWhen it\u2019s injected, the concoction destroys a user\u2019s tissue, turning the skin scaly and green like a crocodile.\nBesides her, Pavlova says there were about a dozen krokodil addicts she hung around with, including her brother.\nThe winters there last eight months of the year, and as Pavlova recalls, the young people are in a constant state of boredom.\nMost of them drink and few of them work, the same as in hundreds of towns and villages across Russia\u2019s frozen north."}
