Bruce Braley, the Iowa Democrat running for one of the most contested Senate seats, stressed his commitment Thursday to protecting the entitlement programs.\n\n\u201cKeep your hands off Social Security and Medicare\u2014we need to strengthen them, not destroy them through risky Tea Party schemes,\u201d Braley said at a rally sponsored by the country\u2019s biggest labor unions.\n\nFew Republicans in hotly contested races have been openly running on Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s budget, but Democrats are determined to hold the party accountable for backing it.\n\nRyan\u2019s budget, which passed the GOP-led House of Representatives, would effectively turn Medicare in a voucher program by replacing defined benefits with premium support. Ryan has also supported private accounts for Social Security, price-indexing benefits, and raising the retirement age in past budgets, though such reforms weren\u2019t included in his latest budget.\n\nDemocrats have done backflips to tie Braley\u2019s opponent, GOP state Sen. Joni Ernst, to Ryan\u2019s plan in attack ads, on the basis that she refused to support a symbolic resolution in the Iowa Statehouse denouncing Ryan\u2019s Medicare and Medicaid reforms.\n\nIn fact, both Democrats and Republicans insist that their political opponents are the ones trying to gut the broadly popular entitlement programs.\n\nIn Iowa, Braley and Ernst have accused each other of trying to gut Social Security. Ernst insists that Braley wants to raise the Medicare age and points to an old interview in which he indicates his willingness to consider the possibility, according to The Des Moines Register. In Arkansas, Karl Rove\u2019s Crossroads GPS has similarly attacked incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor for wanting to raise the retirement age; Republicans have also attacked Obamacare for making cuts to Medicare.\n\nBraley seemed to respond directly to such attacks at Thursday\u2019s event. \u201cIt\u2019s not raising the retirement age\u2014that\u2019s why I have voted for the last four Congresses to not raise the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare,\u201d he said. Instead, Braley said he wanted to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 and create new jobs through infrastructure spending\u2014both core Democratic priorities\u2014to shore up the entitlements\u2019 finances.\n\nBraley has previously attacked Ernst for embracing the privatization of Social Security; Ernst says that she\u2019s simply considering it as an option and says she would protect current retirees\u2019 benefits, according to the Register. But when msnbc asked Braley where he believes Ernst stands and what she would do in Congress, he declined to respond, and an aide cited his need to get to a House vote.\n\nDemocrats have also raised the ire of progressives by backing entitlement cuts. President Obama proposed using a different inflation index for Social Security that would ultimately cut benefits in the long term, but backed off after the prospect of a grand bargain for deficit reduction died on Capitol Hill.\n\nMinnesota Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison, head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, credited activists for convincing the White House to back off the cuts. But Democrats and their outside allies focused their ire on Republicans, insisting the whole party is synonymous with entitlement cuts.\n\nFor Republicans, \u201cthe answer is just push those costs off on the families that are already struggling,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren said at Thursday\u2019s rally. She went on to laud Social Security and called for an expansion, not a cut, to the program. \u201cWe built it together, we made promises to ourselves and to each other. And if Republicans want to break those promises, we are here to say, we will fight you ever inch of the way,\u201d she concluded.\n\nDemocrats are praying that message will draw voters to their side.\n\n\u201cIf we want to keep Medicare and Social Security, what we do have to do in November?\u201d Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, asked the union members and activists at the rally.\n\n\u201cVote!\u201d the crowd shouted.\n\n\u201cAnd who do have to vote for?\u201d Weingarten continued.\n\n\u201cDemocrats!\u201d the crowd cheered.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Democrats are ratcheting up their attacks on Republicans for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare, hoping the issue will resonate with voters in 2014.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/democrats-try-tie-republicans-entitlement-cuts", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Democrats are ratcheting up their attacks on Republicans for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare, hoping the issue will resonate with voters in 2014.", "title": "Democrats try to tie Republicans to entitlement cuts", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/democrats-try-tie-republicans-entitlement-cuts", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/455664828.jpg?itok=cp9VufbE", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/democrats-try-tie-republicans-entitlement-cuts", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/455664828.jpg?itok=MCuBBnqV", "title": "Democrats try to tie Republicans to entitlement cuts", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Democrats are ratcheting up their attacks on Republicans for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare, hoping the issue will resonate with voters in 2014."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-09-18T17:39:53-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "suzykhimm", "tags": "democrats,election-2014,elections,health,health-care-reform,iowa,medicare,social-security", "title": "Democrats try to tie Republicans to entitlement cuts", "published": 1, "date": "09/18/2014 17:39:53 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/democrats-try-tie-republicans-entitlement-cuts"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Democrats are ratcheting up their attacks on Republicans for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare, hoping the issue will resonate with voters in 2014.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Democrats, Elections, Election 2014, Health, Health Care Reform, Iowa, Medicare, Social Security"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b0c\"", "article_summary": "But Democrats and their outside allies focused their ire on Republicans, insisting the whole party is synonymous with entitlement cuts.\nIn fact, both Democrats and Republicans insist that their political opponents are the ones trying to gut the broadly popular entitlement programs.\nCongressional Democrats are ratcheting up their attacks on Republicans for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare, hoping the issue will resonate with voters in the midterm elections.\nShe went on to laud Social Security and called for an expansion, not a cut, to the program.\nDemocrats have also raised the ire of progressives by backing entitlement cuts."}
