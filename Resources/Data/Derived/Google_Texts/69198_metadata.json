At which stage in the process do we hold responsible the people who spent $400 million in three and a half years, and who assured everyone all along the way that things were going swimmingly?\n\nProbably 39th. Let\u2019s not raise expectations too high (via Andrew Johnson at The Corner):\n\nDean went on to blame the Republican governors who wisely decided not to tempt fate with their own exchange systems:\n\n\u201cThe problem is they shouldn\u2019t have done a single-size-fits-all for the 36 states,\u201d he continued. \u201cPartly, I have to say, they had to do that because the Republican governors refused to accept exchanges.\u201d Dean went on to downplay the problems facing the websites, saying the glitches are \u201cnot big.\u201d\n\nDean suggests that the White House should have built regional systems rather than national systems in order to make the process less complicated. How exactly would that have helped? HHS couldn\u2019t even build one system that connects the consumers to the insurers and the IRS properly, but they could have built four or five simultaneously? That sounds like the kind of thinking that went into the Obama administration\u2019s reform policies and managerial efforts on ObamaCare all along.\n\nDemocratic Senator Bill Nelson isn\u2019t quite buying the blame-Republicans-first strategy. He wonders why no one\u2019s been fired over the fiasco, and laments the lack of accountability in the Obama administration (via the Daily Caller):\n\nNelson said that someone may need to be fired once the problem-plagued federal Healthcare.gov website is up and running. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem in government today. People are not held to account,\u201d he said.\n\nNot if Howard Dean has anything to say about it, they aren\u2019t.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cThat\u2019s the problem in government today.
