From his handling of the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East to his failed economic policies to the disastrous roll out of Obamacare, it has been a year of train wrecks for the President.\n\nOpponents of President Obama have plenty of ammunition to use in their criticism of his second term agenda. Almost all of the reputable critics of President Obama have focused their attention on his policies, not his race. Nevertheless, the facts never stop the President\u2019s defenders from using the race card to invalidate criticism from his opponents.\n\nThe latest example of this tactic comes from left wing personality, actress and television icon Oprah Winfrey. She is among a horde of celebrities who have defended President Obama against \u201cracists.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Oprah is on a worldwide tour to promote her movie, \u201cThe Butler.\u201d During a recent BBC interview, Winfrey blasted U.S. Congressman Joe Wilson (R-SC) who called the President a \u201cliar.\u201d She also said that \u201cThere\u2019s a level of disrespect for the office that occurs and that occurs in some cases and maybe even many cases because he\u2019s African American. There\u2019s no question about that and it\u2019s the kind of thing nobody ever says but everybody\u2019s thinking it.\u201d\n\nObviously, these comments are pure hogwash. Regarding Obama, race is often at the forefront of the discussion, usually from his supporters, not his adversaries. His fans are always claiming that he is being subjected to racism, when the evidence shows just the contrary. The President has received preferential treatment from the media because of his race and liberal policies.\n\nIt is hard to dispute that recent Republican presidents have been subjected to immense ridicule from liberal activists, reporters and the Hollywood left. For example, the effigy of Ronald Reagan was regularly burned by left wing crazies. Liberals subjected George W. Bush to unrelenting criticism and regularly referred to him as a fool and an idiot. There was even a movie about the assassination of George W. Bush.\n\nIn the case of Obama, he is continually defended by Hollywood stars who claim he is some sort of a victim. In reality, he has been given the type of positive media treatment that Reagan and Bush never received.\n\nThere is no question that President Obama has received an abundance of criticism, but it is based on his disastrous policies, not his skin color.\n\nIt is very disingenuous for Obama lovers to attempt to invalidate his critics by labeling them \u201cracists.\u201d This is pure demagoguery as polls consistently show that Americans are upset with President Obama not because of his race but because of his poor leadership and poor performance.\n\nBased on a variety of new poll data the President\u2019s approval rating hovers between 37-41%. This negative rating is the worst of his presidency and is mostly due to the nightmarish launch of Obamacare, his signature program. In his news conference yesterday, the President even admitted that he \u201cfumbled\u201d the rollout of Obamacare. Clearly, he did not fumble because of racism in the country; it was due to his administration\u2019s utter incompetence, and the waste, fraud and abuse that characterize Obamacare and every other government program.\n\nOf course, it is the right of every American to be upset when their government lies to them or misuses their tax dollars. If this type of disaster had occurred in the previous administration, the media would be in an uproar. Today, Obama is getting kid glove treatment from the media that exposes true racism that is unfair to the President and all African Americans. Obama should be held to the same standard as every other President, treated no better and no worse.\n\nOprah is living in a dream world if she truly believes that Obama is a victim of racism. If anything, he has not been harmed by his race; instead he has received irrefutable benefits.\n\nDo you believe that Obama's critics are motivated by his race? Do you believe plays any factor at all?
