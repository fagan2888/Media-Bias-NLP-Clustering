Nick Gillespie on why this is an unfortunate and expensive mistake.\n\nOn Monday, the same day President Obama gave a poorly received speech defending the glitchy Obamacare rollout, there was another unfortunate development in health-care reform: Ohio expanded Medicaid.\n\nIn a controversial (and possibly illegal) move, Ohio\u2019s Controlling Board voted to expand Medicaid coverage in the state to adults that were not previously eligible by way of accepting billions in federal funds. That means 25 states, plus the District of Columbia, have now signed on to take part in an aspect of the Affordable Care Act that is both optional and ill-considered. More states are expected to follow suit, even some that, like Ohio, have Republican governors and conservative legislatures.\n\nThis is bad news. Medicaid, the nation\u2019s health care program for low-income citizens and those with certain disabilities, is expensive. States are not required to participate in the program, but all do, though eligibility requirements differ from state to state. In 2011, states devoted nearly 24 percent (PDF) of total spending to Medicaid\u2014the single largest state expense\u2014despite the fact that there\u2019s little evidence that it actually improves the health outcomes of its beneficiaries.\n\nIn 2011, Washington covered about 64 percent of the $413 billion in costs associated with Medicaid, with the states kicking in the rest. As it stands, Medicaid provides health care to low-income children, pregnant women, parents with young children, seniors, and disabled adults but does not cover all low-income adults. The Medicaid expansion option in Obamacare extends health-care coverage to many people in households that earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line. The feds will cover all of the costs of those covered by the expansion for three years, then 90 percent of the costs started in 2020 (for those who qualify for Medicaid under pre-expansion rules, the feds will pay about 60 percent of costs and states will pick up the rest). In the case of Ohio, about 275,000 people will be newly eligible for Medicaid coverage and the state will receive about $2.5 billion in extra federal funds the first year.\n\nMedicaid expansion is central to Obamacare\u2019s effort to reduce the number of uninsured. The Kaiser Family Foundation (PDF) says that 40 percent of the 25 million people who could gain insurance by 2016 would do so via Medicaid coverage. A 2012 Kaiser study (PDF) indicated that given the level of federal support, only eight states would ultimately save money until 2022 by signing on for Medicaid expansion\u2014more than half would see cost increases of under 5 percent, and the rest would see totals costs rise by between 5 percent and 11 percent.\n\nTo supporters of Medicaid expansion, the prospect of boatloads of \u201cfree\u201d federal money renders any objection not simply idiotic but morally depraved. \u201cRed states seem more willing to let low-income people die than get healthcare,\u201d seethed political columnist Michael Cohen recently in the Guardian, writing that Republicans won\u2019t be able to \u201crehabilitate their image\u201d from that of heartless bastards as long as \u201cthey operate as though saving money\u2026is more important than reducing suffering and saving lives.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem with that argument: there\u2019s little evidence that Medicaid coverage improves the health and longevity of beneficiaries. For instance, a major 2010 University of Virginia study found that for patients undergoing major surgical procedures, those on Medicaid were 93 percent more likely to die than patients with private insurance, while the uninsured were just 74 percent more likely to die. Such awful outcomes for Medicaid patients are found in a variety of studies looking at cancer, heart problems, and other maladies.\n\nEvidence from the widely respected Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, which compared the health of Medicaid recipients to a control group, found \u201cthat Medicaid coverage generated no significant improvements in measured physical health outcomes in the first 2 years.\u201d Such results are broadly consistent with findings that insurance status has little or no impact on longevity. In 2009, for instance, Columbia economist Frank Lichtenburg published a study looking at longevity in states between 1991 and 2004 and concluded that \u201cgrowth in life expectancy was uncorrelated across states with health insurance coverage and education.\u201d\n\nEven the lead author of a 2012 study that found decreases in mortality rates after some states voluntarily expanded Medicaid acknowledged that the data he worked with was too crude to make definitive statements: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you for sure that this is a cause-and-effect relationship,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Oregon study did find that Medicaid recipients self-reported less depression and \u201cnearly eliminated catastrophic out-of-pocket medical expenditures.\u201d Those are good things, but the Oregon study also found that people with Medicaid consumed more health care, which may be a reason why the program is so costly.\n\nLike Medicare, Medicaid has for a long time posted year-over-year spending increases. Between 2000 and 2011 (PDF), the average increase was 6.8 percent and total expenditures on the program came to $432 billion in 2011 (PDF). The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that annual increases will average about 6.4 percent until 2021, when the federal government and states will spend $795 billion on the program.\n\nBy that time, too, the states will be on the hook for 10 percent of costs for the Medicaid expansion on top of other increases in the program; if past projections of the cost for federal health care programs are any indication, expect the estimates for the cost of the Medicaid expansion\u2014and Obamacare more generally\u2014to be way short. Indeed, in 2012 the CBO doubled its cost estimate for the first full decade of Obamacare, from $938 billion to $1.76 trillion.\n\nTo be sure, the prospect of a $9 federal match for every $1 of state spending seems like a win-win proposition for states. But the Cato Institute\u2019s Michael Cannon notes that the match is only \u201ctheoretically\u201d perpetual. Given increasing amounts of federal debt and other entitlement spending, argues Cannon, \u201cIt is wildly unrealistic to assume the federal government will maintain the Medicaid expansion\u2019s nine-to-one matching rate.\u201d As Mercatus Center economist Veronique de Rugy reminds us, increases in federal spending to the states don\u2019t reduce state-level spending. More begets more, and spending tends to stick at higher levels, which is why the phenomenon is known as \u201cthe flypaper effect.\u201d Research indicates that for every dollar of federal aid that disappears from state coffers, states raise their future taxes by between 33 cents and 42 cents.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "nickgillespie"}, "keywords": "Obamacare, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201310240945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "On Monday, Ohio became the 25th state to expand Medicaid thanks to new provisions in Obamacare.
