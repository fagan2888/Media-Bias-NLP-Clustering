But some tax professionals are skeptical, citing the administration\u2019s iffy track record on being able to meet other deadlines in the massive health overhaul law.\n\n\u201cIt really strains credulity to think 1095A is not going to be a big problem,\u201d said George Brandes, vice president for health programs at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service.\n\nFilers need the forms to calculate whether they received the correct subsidy from the government, or if they owe money to cover a difference.\n\nThe forms are supposed to be issued around the same time employers issue W-2 forms to their workers detailing their earnings for the year. But some businesses provide their W-2s before the Jan. 31 deadline, and analysts said taxpayers may go ahead and file at that point, not realizing they still need to account for how Obamacare affects their overall earnings.\n\nMark Ciaramitaro, vice president for health care at H&R Block, said it is \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d that Obamacare customers have the form in hand before they do their returns, but he has not seen any evidence there will be a delay in getting them out.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that the exchanges could beat the deadline and issue the forms earlier in January, keeping pace with W-2s.\n\nTax professionals have speculated about the state and federal insurance exchanges that struggled to implement their web system and their ability to issue the forms, although the Obama administration and states that encountered technical hiccups told The Washington Times they are on track.\n\n\u201cCMS is working to develop the technical processes necessary to ensure the forms are generated accurately and timely,\u201d said Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the federal exchange.\n\nTyler Klimas, a spokesman for Nevada\u2019s exchange, which decided to ditch its web platform and rely on the federal HealthCare.gov site for the 2015 enrollment period, said his state will not need help from the federal government to issue the forms.\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of creating 1095A forms and will issue them to our enrollees in a timely manner,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been no request for assistance with this process.\u201d\n\nChuck Lovelace, vice president for affordable care at Liberty Tax Service, said he is not too worried about the forms\u2019 distribution for now.\n\n\u201cOur concern is more that the customer knows what to do with the 1095,\u201d Mr. Lovelace said.\n\nThe IRS has released drafts of the forms taxpayers will see next year, but stakeholders are still waiting on instructions that explain how to calculate subsidy amounts to see if they correctly match up with a person\u2019s income.\n\n\u201cSome people will get money back, and some will owe money, which will be an unpleasant surprise,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University.\n\nThe IRS is handling most of Obamacare\u2019s tax issues, but the 1095A forms are being issued by the federal health marketplace and the 15 state-run health exchanges.\n\nThe web rollout of the federal website, HealthCare.gov, was a disaster last fall and several state-run exchanges had to scrap their web platforms, feeding into concern about what\u2019s next as the second year of enrollment in the exchanges looms.\n\n\u201cAs we know, not everything has happened on schedule the way it was supposed to happen,\u201d Mr. Jost said, noting the tax forms will be \u201cvitally important.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope it happens on time,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"description":
