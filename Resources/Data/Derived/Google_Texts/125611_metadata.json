Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp said that no Kansans had signed up for Obamacare on the first day of the rollout. California\u2019s Obamacare network failed to enroll even one person because of poor staff training.\n\nDemocratic Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes acknowledged that one-half of one percent of the few visitors to the Nutmeg State\u2019s exchange had managed to apply for insurance.\n\nToday, the CT health exchange @AccessHealthCT received 28k visitors, and took 167 applications for health insurance. Day 1. \u2014 Jim Himes (@jahimes) October 2, 2013\n\nSarah Kliff of the Washington Post reported that it took Henderson three hours to sign up for coverage. He logged onto the Obamacare website shortly after midnight on October 1st.\n\nHenderson \u201cdescribes himself as a supporter of President Obama who has anxiously awaited Obamacare\u2019s rollout,\u201d wrote Kliff.\n\nBut Henderson\u2019s support of the President extends further than that. According to Henderson\u2019s LinkedIn profile, the 21 year-old Florida native has been a volunteer at Organizing for America \u2014 the forerunner to Organizing for Action \u2014 since 2007.\n\nHenderson\u2019s goal with OFA was to \u201chelp elect Barack Obama as our 44th President and to continue his agenda.\u201d\n\nReached by The Daily Caller News Foundation, Henderson said that his volunteer work at OFA did not help his story go viral.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been accused of that all day and I can assure you I just simply sent a tweet and it went crazy from there,\u201d said Henderson.\n\nHenderson did confirm that he volunteers for OFA but said \u201cIt\u2019s totally irrelevant to my situation.\u201d\n\nAsked if other users would wait around as long as he did to sign up for insurance, Henderson told TheDCNF he \u201ccan see why someone would give up instead of waiting for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe young colossus of communal medicine added, \u201cSomething needs to be fixed on the website for sure.\u201d\n\nHenderson also seems to have mixed feelings about his new status as the Greatest Living American.\n\n\u201cWow. Who knew my story would cause so much hatefulness towards me,\u201d the new voice of his generation wrote on his Facebook page Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ve received many criticizing comments and Tweets directed at me just because I shared my story with national reporters. How rude! It\u2019s time for a vacation\u2026. which I am taking tomorrow to Ohio! Excited for King\u2019s Island!\u201d\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
