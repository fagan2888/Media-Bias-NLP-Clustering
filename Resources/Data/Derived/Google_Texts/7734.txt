(KTVI)- Is Obamacare causing people who are self-insured or who run small businesses to lose their current health insurance? In many cases, the answer is yes. That’s because the Affordable Care Act requires policies to cover things like mental health and maternity and because it says people can't face more than $6,400 a year in out of pocket medical expenses. Policies that don’t meet those standards are being cancelle , mostly for individuals who are self-insured.

We've known something like this was coming since 2010 when the law was passed, but the reality of higher prices and fewer doctor choices are angering a lot of people.
