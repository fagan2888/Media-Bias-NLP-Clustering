Alaska State Troopers say a man died after being caught in an avalanche while skiing.

Troopers say the victim of the avalanche that was reported Saturday evening is tentatively identified as 35-year-old Eric Peterson of Delta Junction.

Troopers say 63-year-old Michael Hopper was skiing with Peterson when they were caught in the avalanche in the Rainbow Mountains near the Richardson Highway.

Hopper told authorities it took him 2-to-3 hours to dig himself out and once he was free, he found Peterson's glove. He then dug into the snow and found Peterson dead.

According to troopers, Hopper flagged down a passing motorist on the highway and contacted troopers.

Troopers were among responders to the scene, where conditions are unstable with heavy snow.

Conditions will be evaluated before a body recovery is attempted.
