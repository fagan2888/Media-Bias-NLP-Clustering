The pizza chain has been rolling out new ways to engage its customers. The \u2018Easy Order\u2019 button is the next step.\n\nIt joins the ability to customize your pizza with an iPad, tweeting your order with an emoji and the gimmicky drone delivery. Or you could just use the app or heaven forbid, call and place your order.\n\nWait, my phone actually makes calls?\n\nDomino\u2019s Easy Order Button\n\nIt is kind of cool looking. A mini Domino\u2019s box with a button inside. It connects via Bluetooth with an app that sends your order along. Make sure you have your address and payment info save on the app or Domino\u2019s website or the button becomes a pain in the ass.\n\nHow does it work? Just press the button and wait for your pizza. It doesn\u2019t get much simpler than that.\n\nNow if we could just get a button for healthy food. Who am I kidding? When it\u2019s 10 pm and time for second dinner, you want pepperoni goodness, not a salad.\n\nHow Do You Get Domino\u2019s Easy Order Button\n\nNo love for America on the new initiative from Domino\u2019s. It is available in the UK only to start. Delivery in the UK is set for December with a second wave in February.\n\nWhat about other regions? Domino\u2019s is radio silent on the issue. It\u2019s a pilot program that it\u2019s market testing. If it finds traction, more territories will be announced when the button is ready for primetime.\n\nIf you need a push to order right now, you can use the app on your phone. Same functionality without mini pizza box. Don\u2019t worry, the regret of knocking out a large pie by yourself is always available.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "domino's easy order button, domino's pizza, domino's uk easy order button, apps, domino's, pizza", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "News Ledge", "description": "Domino's is entering the world of the 'easy buttons.'
