It is unimaginable,\u201d she told KXAS-TV.\n\nWalls believes they will find the 34-year-old hairdresser and mother of three.\n\n\u201cWe started looking for her on [December] 29, the day of her disappearance,\u201d Walls told KXAS-TV. \u201cWe have not given up.\u201d\n\nThe family is grateful for the support from Texas EquuSearch, a group of trained volunteers that travel nationally to help find missing people, KXAS-TV reported.\n\n\u201cPolice resources are limited, and detectives are very busy on the investigative end,\u201d said Tim Miller, the group\u2019s founder. \u201cSo we\u2019ll go ahead and help out.\u201d\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, the group had not found anything at Lawnview Park. Miller said he met with Dallas police detectives who provided additional locations they\u2019d like his team to search, KXAS-TV reported.\n\nPolice were still classifying Espinosa\u2019s disappearance as a missing persons case as of Thursday and have not named a person of interest.\n\nEspinosa\u2019s house caught fire in mid-December, and at the time of her disappearance, she was living with her mother and three children at her ex-boyfriend\u2019s home in the 7700 block of Aurora Avenue.\n\nHer family now suspects her ex-boyfriend, Faustino Valdez, may have caused the fire.\n\nA judge granted Espinosa\u2019s mother, Rosemary Espinosa, temporary custody of her three grandchildren last week and prohibited their father from contacting them. Valdez, who is the father of Espinosa\u2019s two younger children, did not attend the hearing and has not been seen since Jan. 3.\n\nRosemary Espinosa fears that Valdez may have killed her daughter and that he could target the rest of the family. She said she had once seen Valdez try to choke Espinosa during an argument.\n\nAnyone with information about Espinosa\u2019s disappearance may call Dallas police at 214-671-4268.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzAxL3JlcG9ydC10ZXhhcy1lcXV1c2VhcmNoLWpvaW5zLXNlYXJjaC1mb3ItbWlzc2luZy1kYWxsYXMtbW90aGVyLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Claire Z.
