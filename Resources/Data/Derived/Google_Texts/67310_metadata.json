The site surveys conducted by the Defense Department are a key component of the plan.\u201d\n\nSix weeks ago, the administration said it was in the \u201cfinal stages\u201d of drafting the plan, which is a crucial part of a potential deal with Congress to close the detention facility. Some reports indicated the White House could send the plan to Capitol Hill as soon as this week.\n\nNow, the official said, \u201cWe want to ensure our plan to safely and responsibly close Guantanamo has all bases covered. We don\u2019t have a timeline on when the plan will be delivered to Congress.\u201d\n\nBut the delay over the survey will complicate the already-difficult negotiations over Guantanamo as Congress returns this week to hammer out the annual defense authorization bill.\n\nThe Inventory\n\nFresh off recent Defense Department visits to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas and the Naval Consolidated Brig in Charleston, S.C. \u2014 which were met with early cries of \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d from lawmakers and state representatives \u2014 the Pentagon official gave Defense One new details about the survey.\n\n\u201cAll the sites, certainly within the Department of Defense, that we could get to a maximum security standard we would consider,\u201d the official said, adding that there\u2019s no final list yet. \u201cThere\u2019s an inventory, and we\u2019re going through the inventory to narrow down probable, good locations.\u201d\n\nThat inventory includes the U.S. military\u2019s five regional prisons: Leavenworth and Charleston; the Naval Consolidated Brigs in Chesapeake, Va., and Miramar, Calif.; and the Northwest Regional Correctional Facility at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Tacoma, Wash., the official said. No additional trips are scheduled at this time.\n\nThe Defense Department has also asked the Justice Department, which houses the Bureau of Prisons, to come up with preliminary sites that fit its requirements, working off civilian facilities that were also examined early in President Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cBOP and DOJ are still looking through what they have,\u201d the Pentagon official said. Justice Department spokesman Patrick Rodenbush declined to comment.\n\nUntil recently, a civilian prison \u2014 Thomson Correctional Center in Illinois \u2014 was considered the best bet. Of the major changes during the administration\u2019s six-year effort to close Guantanamo, the Defense Department official said, \u201cThe big one was Thomson.\u201d\n\nAnother site in earlier studies was the \u201csupermax\u201d in Florence, Colo. It already holds one former Gitmo detainee who was transferred to New York for trial and convicted. \u201cThat complex makes sense to go see,\u201d the official said.\n\nOn the site surveys, a team of Defense Department engineers, military service representatives and correctional experts examine the facilities to determine what modifications may be necessary to prepare a site for high-level detainees \u2013 and the troops that would watch over them.\n\n\u201cBefore I was going to buy tickets and we\u2019re gonna go look at locks on doors and things, there was a lot of work to do here \u2026 to look and say, \u2018We have a brig at Miramar but could we even consider it? Does it have enough space? What would be displaced by doing this? Does it have a place for troops to live?\u2019\u201d the Pentagon official said. \u201cA big piece for me is any place we go, we\u2019re looking at how do we treat the detainees humanely inside the walls, and how do we make sure nothing gets inside or outside those walls?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still at step one of what\u2019s available and what would it take to modify it to be able to take on this mission,\u201d the official said.\n\nFeeling the Pressure\n\nBut the administration may be stepping too slowly. Obama\u2019s last, best chance to work with Congress to close Guantanamo is through the fiscal 2016 defense bills on its docket this fall.\n\n\u201cI definitely feel the pressure of the congressional calendar and from my bosses. There is a desire to have a compelling, accurate plan put out,\u201d the official said. \u201cI\u2019m being as deliberate as they\u2019ll let me be \u2026 so we don\u2019t have to go back out, too \u2014 that would be disastrous \u2014 or we don\u2019t give a plan over to the secretary, to the president, or to the Armed Services Committee that they don\u2019t find useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how that tension is going to resolve itself \u2026 at some point my boss might say, \u2018You\u2019ve done enough and give me what you\u2019ve got,\u2019\u201d the official said. \u201cWe could look at the list and say, \u2018None of these are going to work for whatever reason,\u2019 then we go with the data that we have \u2026 and we assume some risk in the analysis, and ultimately in the decision making.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a marked shift from the administration\u2019s initial reluctance to provide Congress with a plan, a requirement it called \u201cunnecessary and overly restrictive.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt definitely is onerous \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong,\u201d the official laughed, saying the administration determined, \u201c\u2018If it gets us to a place where we can all succeed \u2026 get on the airplane [to do site visits]; it\u2019s not that onerous.\u2019\"\n\nAll of these sites have been studied in the past as part of a push to fulfill the order Obama gave on his first day in office to close Guantanamo. But Congress has passed legislation that prevents transfers to the U.S. and the modification or construction of facilities here to hold Guantanamo detainees, in addition to restrictions that make it more difficult to transfer them to other countries.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., who supports closing the facility, is lobbying to preserve a provision in the NDAA that could lift the ban on moving detainees to the U.S. and give Obama the authority to close the prison \u2013 if lawmakers approve the plan.\n\nOf the 116 detainees remaining at Guantanamo, 52 have been cleared for transfer to other countries. The administration has continued to chip away at the number that would need to be moved to the U.S. through these transfers \u2014 but the plodding pace is a point of tension between the Pentagon, Congress, State Department and White House.\n\n\u201cWe could be in a position to move a significant number by the end of the year,\u201d a State Department official recently told Defense One on background, but added, \u201cI\u2019ll put it this way: for anybody in the administration who is a proponent of the policy [of closing Guantanamo], of course there is frustration that we are not further along.\u201d\n\nRelated: Beyond Guantanamo\n\nMany who would be transferred from Cuba to the U.S. have never been charged, and a number of their cases may never go to trial.\n\nThe administration\u2019s goal is to transfer as many as possible to get to an \u201cirreducible minimum,\u201d which could range from several dozen to more than 50. They would be moved to the U.S., put into indefinite detention and held by the Defense Department as law of war enemy combatants under the decade-old authorizations for the use of military force that serve as the legal foundation for the war on terror \u2014 same as they are at Guantanamo, leading critics and opponents alike to refer to the potential U.S. site as \u201cGuantanamo North.\u201d\n\nLast Tuesday, Defense Secretary Ash Carter indicated tepid support for moving Guantanamo detainees to a U.S. facility. \u201cSome of the people who are there at Guantanamo Bay have to be detained indefinitely ... if they\u2019re not locked up in Guantanamo Bay they need to be locked up somewhere, so we are looking at places in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they're detained at Guantanamo, fine. I would prefer to find a different place for them.\u201d\n\nNot In My Backyard\n\nAssembling a list of suitable prisons is one thing; persuading the member of Congress who represents a site to accept Guantanamo prisoners is another.\n\nRep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., whose district contains Miramar, told Defense One in a statement he wouldn\u2019t support using the facility. \u201cThe prison at Guantanamo Bay is literally crumbling, and it costs almost $3 million per prisoner per year,\u201d he said. \u201cI supported giving our military commanders the flexibility to come up with a plan for moving prisoners from Guantanamo Bay, only if the proposed new location is a maximum security facility in a remote prison. I would oppose moving terrorists to the Miramar Brig; it does not fit that criteria.\u201d\n\nThe offices of Sens. Cory Gardner, R-Colo.; Michael Bennet, D-Colo.; Patty Murray, D-Wash.; Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.; Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.; and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., did not respond to requests for comment on whether they would support transfers from Guantanamo to their states.\n\nThe offices of Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Virginia Democrats, said they hadn\u2019t been contacted about any potential consideration of the Chesapeake brig, and declined to comment on whether they would support moving detainees there.\n\n\u201cThey are representing their states and their states\u2019 interests, that is what they\u2019re supposed to do,\u201d the senior Defense Department official said of these responses. \u201cI appreciate knowing those concerns; they\u2019re factors.\u201d\n\nStill, the official pointed to the difficulty of balancing those concerns with requests from lawmakers for the information they need to make what could be the final decision on Guantanamo. \"This is kind of my job, to be able to go look at a facility and take things off the table.\u201d\n\n\"We\u2019re not at a decision point. No decision has been made. I\u2019m going out with a team of engineers with slide rulers and calculators to measure things and then put numbers to it,\u201d the official said, quipping, \u201cIt\u2019d be great if a state offered.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Molly O'Toole", "description": "As weeks slip away, Pentagon officials say they\u2019re only on \u2018step one\u2019 of a crucial survey of alternate locations for the detainees.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "As weeks slip away, Pentagon officials say they\u2019re only on \u2018step one\u2019 of a crucial survey of alternate locations for the detainees.", "title": "Obama Administration Delays Plan to Close Guantanamo While Searching for Domestic Alternative", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/defense/2015/09/obama-administration-delays-plan-close-guantanamo-while-searching-domestic-alternative/120515/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/08/090815gitmo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As weeks slip away, Pentagon officials say they\u2019re only on \u2018step one\u2019 of a crucial survey of alternate locations for the detainees.", "creator": "@mollymotoole", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/08/090815gitmo/open-graph.jpg", "title": "Obama Administration Delays Plan to Close Guantanamo While Searching for Domestic Alternative", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-08T20:56:51Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/08/090815gitmo.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Obama Administration Delays Plan to Close Guantanamo While Searching for Domestic Alternative", "keywords": "guantanamo", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/08/090815gitmo/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "guantanamo,channel-defense,type-story,length-long,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "As weeks slip away, Pentagon officials say they\u2019re only on \u2018step one\u2019 of a crucial survey of alternate locations for the detainees."}, "article_summary": "Now, the official said, \u201cWe want to ensure our plan to safely and responsibly close Guantanamo has all bases covered.\nA White House official, speaking on background because the drafting is ongoing, said, \u201cWe've been diligently working on a plan to close Guantanamo.\n\u201cThey are representing their states and their states\u2019 interests, that is what they\u2019re supposed to do,\u201d the senior Defense Department official said of these responses.\nObama\u2019s last, best chance to work with Congress to close Guantanamo is through the fiscal 2016 defense bills on its docket this fall.\nThe White House plan to close the military prison in Guantanamo Bay \u2014 once described by the administration as imminent \u2014 now looks like it\u2019s not coming anytime soon."}
