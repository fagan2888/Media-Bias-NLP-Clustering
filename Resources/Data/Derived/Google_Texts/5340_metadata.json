It seems Chimerix /quotes/zigman/14956180/delayed /quotes/nls/cmrx CMRX has encountered this question before regarding Brincidofovir, the drug that the boy\u2019s family seeks to help fight a life-threatening viral infection.\n\nShutterstock\n\nOn its site, Chimerix says it has received \u201chundreds\u201d of requests for \u201ccompassionate use\u201d of the drug, a situation that it says requires the company to work closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It has offered up the drug for patients who have requested it in the past, but only in conjunction with ongoing tests, which are in a lull right now.\n\n\u201cMaking an experimental drug available outside of controlled clinical trials has the potential to slow or derail the approval of that drug,\u201d the company\u2019s Website says. \u201cProviding Brincidofovir in any of these situations, where there is currently limited evidence to suggest that our experimental medicine would be helpful, could very likely place the entire development program at risk.\u201d\n\nThe company even has an email address set aside for compassionate use requests of Brincidofovir: compassionateuserequest@chimerix.com.\n\nFurther, it points to a paper from the trade group Biotechnology Industry Organization, which outlines the history of cases like those involving Josh. In its April 2010 paper, the group agrees that early access to program could create a conflict between the needs of a few against those of large patient populations and their need to have the drug approved swiftly.\n\nThe paper says: \u201cA patient\u2019s right to treatment based on his or her autonomous decision-making ability does not supersede a company\u2019s ethical responsibility to develop and market safe and effective products as fast as possible.\u201d\n\nSpokespersons from Chimerix or Biotechnology Industry Organization did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTo recap, Josh has survived four bouts with cancer, but his weakened immune system contracted a life-threatening virus after he underwent a bone-marrow transplant. His parents are pleading with Chimerix to provide Brincidofovir to their boy but the company is reluctant because it has received hundreds of requests for compassionate use of the drug, which would delay development and approval for it. Chimerix says it\u2019s unlikely to gain approval before 2016.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw.\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog.\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nPresident finds a new way to tout Obamacare \u2014 trading comic insults\n\nChimerix under pressure to provide dying boy with experimental drug\n\nLa Jolla Pharmaceutical shares surge on test results", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-03-11T14:23:38-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "If Chimerix's contention that it can't interrupt the testing and approval process to help save a 7-year-old boy doesn't hold water for you, a glance at the biotech's Website might be of interest.", "title": "Chimerix says it\u2019s had \u2018hundreds\u2019 of requests for early use of virus drug", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/03/11/chimerix-says-its-had-hundreds-of-requests-for-early-use-of-virus-drug/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU300_pharma_MG_20140210105102.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Biotechnology Industry Organization,Chimerix Inc.,compassionate use,Josh Hardy", "article.headline": "Chimerix says it\u2019s had \u2018hundreds\u2019 of requests for early use of virus drug", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Biotechnology Industry Organization,Chimerix Inc.,compassionate use,Josh Hardy", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "If Chimerix's contention that it can't interrupt the testing and approval process to help save a 7-year-old boy doesn't hold water for you, a glance at the biotech's Website might be of interest.", "article.published": "2014-03-11T14:23:38-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/03/11/chimerix-says-its-had-hundreds-of-requests-for-early-use-of-virus-drug/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "If Chimerix's contention that it can't interrupt the testing and approval process to help save a 7-year-old boy doesn't hold water for you, a glance at the biotech's Website might be of interest.", "title": "Chimerix says it\u2019s had \u2018hundreds\u2019 of requests for early use of virus drug", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/03/11/chimerix-says-its-had-hundreds-of-requests-for-early-use-of-virus-drug/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU300_pharma_MG_20140210105102.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2214", "article.updated": "2014-03-11T14:23:38-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc97a7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMaking an experimental drug available outside of controlled clinical trials has the potential to slow or derail the approval of that drug,\u201d the company\u2019s Website says.\nShutterstockOn its site, Chimerix says it has received \u201chundreds\u201d of requests for \u201ccompassionate use\u201d of the drug, a situation that it says requires the company to work closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nIt seems Chimerix /quotes/zigman/14956180/delayed /quotes/nls/cmrx CMRX has encountered this question before regarding Brincidofovir, the drug that the boy\u2019s family seeks to help fight a life-threatening viral infection.\nHis parents are pleading with Chimerix to provide Brincidofovir to their boy but the company is reluctant because it has received hundreds of requests for compassionate use of the drug, which would delay development and approval for it.\nTo recap, Josh has survived four bouts with cancer, but his weakened immune system contracted a life-threatening virus after he underwent a bone-marrow transplant."}
