Invariably scheduled for the weekend before the presidential primary, the dinner is held in a far larger venue than is customary: The national (and global) press corps swarms in, and, above all, the Democratic presidential candidates and their supporters turn out in force.\n\nOn Friday night, the party repaired to the Verizon Wireless Center in the heart of Manchester. The ice hockey arena featured the standard shell-out-the-bucks tables of ten festooning the floor where the ice normally sits. The presidential partisans and party faithful filled the thousands of low-dollar spectator seats: The Hillary supporters on one side of the arena and the Bernie backers on the other.\n\nThe evening held potential, then, for an ugly clash. In essence, two separate candidate rallies would be held in a venue filled with supporters of both candidates. Clinton partisans plainly feared that the Sanders kids might boo, heckle, and Lord knows what else, when Clinton spoke. Introducing Clinton, New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen adjured the crowd, saying, \u201cI hope everyone here will be respectful of whatever choice we make\u201d in this election.\n\nThen Clinton came out to give her speech and\u2014everything was fine. No heckling. No booing. The kids were alright.\n\nMore than that, the event demonstrated that the divisions that have appeared in the party this year aren\u2019t all they\u2019re cracked up to be. More precisely, in a year when the Democrats are said to be divided by an ideological chasm, the evening showed that that chasm isn\u2019t nearly as wide as it may appear from afar.\n\nIndeed, the evening\u2019s program presented a kind of real-time, visual poll that revealed more consensus than discord. It was easy enough to see what the Bernie brigade supported: They came armed with \u201cthundersticks,\u201d orange plastic cylinders that they hoisted and banged together to great noise-making effect. Likewise, on the opposite side of the arena, the Hillary hordes brandished thundersticks of their own, with glowing lights at the tip, like some kind of Jedi lightsaber which they, too, raised and waved around when sufficiently thrilled by a speaker\u2019s comment.\n\nThe response to Sanders\u2019s speech was a revelation. Even as the Bernie kids erupted in a thunderstick-banging cacophony as Sanders emphatically delivered one progressive pledge after another, so, too, did the Hillary backers raise theirs and wave them about as Bernie unveiled his platform. Raise the minimum wage to $15, Sanders said. Up went the lightsabers (though Clinton\u2019s preferred level is $12). Lift the cap on the payroll tax to increase Social Security benefits, he bellowed. Lightsabers up! Health coverage is a right not a privilege: Lightsabers galore! Voted against the Iraq War resolution: Lightsaber madness!\n\nTo be sure, Sanders has modified his stump speech to make clear he\u2019s not the all-or-nothing guy depicted by the Clinton campaign. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act has done extraordinarily good things,\u201d he said, before vowing to go beyond the ACA with Medicare for all. Speaking before a crowd that included the entire state Democratic establishment, he was clearly not at his most confrontational. Nonetheless, when he spelled out positions that were at odds with Clinton\u2019s\u2014not pointing out they were at odds, but before a crowd that knew they were\u2014the Clinton backers responded rapturously to most of them.\n\nOne prominent former party leader (who asked his name not be used because he\u2019s a sitting judge) explained the enthusiasm to me this way on his way into the arena: \u201cBernie says all the right things. His program appeals to me very much, appeals to most of us. But I\u2019m voting for Hillary. If Bernie wins [the nomination], he\u2019ll get clobbered in November.\u201d\n\nThe judge\u2019s is not a surprising response, but helps illuminate what the entire evening made clear: While there are real divisions among Democrats this year, they are not chiefly ideological or programmatic. Taken by themselves, Sanders\u2019s positions, even those that are not Hillary\u2019s\u2014the $15 wage, free tuition, lifting the cap to increase Social Security payments\u2014are widely popular across Democratic ranks.\n\nTo the extent that there is a division on ideology, it probably comes when Sanders\u2019s proposals are considered in aggregate, which means that the total amount of taxing and spending that his program would entail is indeed a likely point of division. To that extent, some of his Democratic opponents fit the description that political scientists have given the American people more generally: Philosophically conservative (or in this case, centrist), programmatically liberal.\n\nThere was one other kind of division on display in the arena on Friday night: The Sanderistas are not, or not yet, party people. This distinction began at the top: While both candidates opened their remarks by acknowledging their institutional supporters (unions, progressive groups, and so on), Hillary also went on to give shout-outs to various New Hampshire Democratic leaders and party activists. Sanders did none of that.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because the overwhelming majority of New Hampshire party leaders and activists are backing Clinton, and because the Clintons have deep relationships in New Hampshire dating back to 1992. But that\u2019s also because Sanders has not been a party guy at the state level, though he is functionally that in Congress.\n\nAs with the candidates, so with their supporters: Some of the older Bernie backers have certainly been party people, and cheered when notable state party workers and local elected officials were acknowledged (which is a required rite at any state party\u2019s annual do). Most of Bernie\u2019s backers, however, had no idea who those people were, and the kids who\u2019d come from out of state to precinct walk for the final weekend were thoroughly and understandably uninterested.\n\n(They reminded me of an 18-year-old staffer on Eugene McCarthy\u2019s 1968 insurgent presidential campaign\u2014me\u2014who sat through such events in several states with an equivalent lack of interest in the roll call of local notables.)\n\nBut in talking with a group of students from Hartwick College, a small liberal arts college in upstate New York, who\u2019d crossed the Adirondacks to walk for Bernie and who\u2019d been among the loudest noise-makers during Sanders\u2019s talk that night (and who sat respectfully, if not enthusiastically through Clinton\u2019s), I got the clear impression that, like the kids who\u2019d once volunteered for McCarthy, Bobby Kennedy, and George McGovern, they\u2019d stick around, reshape, and take over the Democratic Party in years to come.\n\nThe three students\u2014all political science majors\u2014understood that the Sanders \u201crevolution\u201d was many years in the making, not the product of just of one campaign, and that with or without Bernie in years to come, as one said, \u201cwe\u2019ll be inspired to carry on his ideals.\u201d \u201cThis is a learning experience,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re learning how the system works.\u201d\n\nAmerican socialists, as the great sociologist Daniel Bell once observed, failed to understand that with power came the necessity of compromise; they were, in his famous phrase, \u201cin but not of the world.\u201d Bernie\u2019s kids are in but not of the party, in but not of the system\u2014which, in American politics, means they\u2019re on track to somewhat alter and eventually take over both the party and the system, too.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Prospect", "description": "The Bernie kids and the Hillary regulars meet\u2014and sparks don't fly.", "title": "In But Not Of the Party", "url": "http://prospect.org/article/not-party", "image": "http://prospect.org/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/nh_hillary_supporters_1.jpg?itok=E-BWrYOv", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "4dItj6FrXn-I63uD7pcvQKf3n3Qc6AIxiwwzo0_G4zk", "fb": {"admins": 431364, "app_id": 107113422697949}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0, width = device-width"}, "article_summary": "As with the candidates, so with their supporters: Some of the older Bernie backers have certainly been party people, and cheered when notable state party workers and local elected officials were acknowledged (which is a required rite at any state party\u2019s annual do).\n(Photo: AP/Matt Rourke) Supporters of Hillary Clinton cheer during her speech at the New Hampshire Democratic Party McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club Celebration dinner on February 5, 2016, in Manchester, New Hampshire.\nThe presidential partisans and party faithful filled the thousands of low-dollar spectator seats: The Hillary supporters on one side of the arena and the Bernie backers on the other.\nThat\u2019s partly because the overwhelming majority of New Hampshire party leaders and activists are backing Clinton, and because the Clintons have deep relationships in New Hampshire dating back to 1992.\nBut that\u2019s also because Sanders has not been a party guy at the state level, though he is functionally that in Congress."}
