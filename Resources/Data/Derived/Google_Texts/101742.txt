Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio is once again being criticized by other candidates for playing hooky from his day job as the junior senator from Florida while he’s out on the campaign trail.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, once seen as Rubio’s mentor and as the GOP establishment’s favored nominee, has hit Rubio particularly hard over his poor attendance record in the Senate.

Bush, whose own campaign has been floundering, first went after Rubio during the Oct. 28 primary debate, an exchange that was largely viewed as a miss by Bush. On Tuesday, Right to Rise USA, a super PAC supporting Bush’s efforts, released a television spot in Iowa targeting Rubio on the same topic.
