The bird was covered in water and ice from Monday night\u2019s snow. (Photos courtesy Barb Rutschow)\n\nWhile out for a walk near their Hay Creek home Tuesday morning, Barb and Craig Rutschow came across an eagle hopping on the ground. As Barb held back the couple\u2019s two dogs, Craig approached the bird to investigate.\n\n\u201cI was a little reluctant myself,\u201d Barb said, well aware of how dangerous it can be to handle an eagle without the right gear. Thankfully, Craig was bundled up for the walk and wearing a pair of leather gloves.\n\nThe eagle began to hiss as Craig got near, but he managed to get ahold of its feet and wrap its wings in a vest.\n\nThe Rutschows, both lifelong birders, brought the eagle to their home and put it in a box in the dark \u2014 something Barb said they learned to calm birds they\u2019ve raised.\n\nThey called the University of Minnesota Raptor Center and a volunteer arrived a couple hours later to take the bird for treatment.\n\nStaff told the Rutschows Thursday that it is a female bald eagle around 3 years old suffering from a high amount of lead in its system. The likely cause is eating prey that was wounded by buckshot pellets.\n\nWhen it\u2019s ready, the eagle will be released back to Hay Creek.\n\n\u201cThis was a wonderful experience for us because everything went right,\u201d Barb said. She recommends people visit the Raptor Center website, www.raptor.cvm.umn.edu, to learn what to do if they encounter an injured bird.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,Red Wing,Outdoors", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Michael Brun", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "While out for a walk near their Hay Creek home Tuesday morning, Barb and Craig Rutschow came across an eagle hopping on the ground.
