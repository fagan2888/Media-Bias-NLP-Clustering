President Obama was in Baltimore, Md. yesterday to talk up his new proposal to guarantee paid sick leave to millions of American workers, when this happened at Charmington’s Cafe:

“President Obama stopped at my local coffee shop and took a selfie with the baristas.” https://t.co/PEzqbEcMPO pic.twitter.com/tnXZQ6yQbT — OmniMeme (@omnimeme) January 16, 2015

Nope, not Photoshop. That adulation is real.

And official White House photographer Pete Souza posted this image of the president then checking himself out on the barista’s phone:

Don’t worry Mr. President, you look fabulous!

Some tweeters, however, think the president probably has better things to do than take selfies at diners:

@petesouza this makes up for not going to Paris. — katt (@katt48) January 16, 2015

@petesouza @greta cause taking selfies makes him a good president…. — Josh Wilson (@JoshJkwilson831) January 16, 2015

@petesouza @greta that he can do but stand up against terrorists in Paris no ! — Anne. boleyn (@Deadqueen2) January 16, 2015

.@petesouza @lrozen was that before or after he let #terrorists go today? — Scott Mastic (@smastic) January 16, 2015

Oh, well. At least this wasn’t a selfie at a funeral…
