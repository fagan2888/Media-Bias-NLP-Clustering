Emily\u2019s List, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d that supports pro-abortion-rights women candidates, has seized on comments made by Republicans, including an operative\u2019s likening Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Senate candidate from Kentucky, to an \u201cempty dress.\u201d\n\nSome of the top Democratic women \u2014 including Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York, Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Senator Patty Murray of Washington \u2014 joined Mrs. Clinton on the panel, titled \u201cWhy Women\u2019s Economic Security Matters.\u201d The event was hosted by the progressive think tank Center for American Progress.\n\nMs. Gillibrand, who has promoted legislation in the Senate to address the sexual assault of women in the military, has lately homed in on other women\u2019s issues, including her personal challenges with weight loss and child rearing, as she promotes her new book \u201cOff the Sidelines: Raise Your Voice, Change the World.\u201d On Thursday, she delivered an impassioned case for paid sick leave for working women.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only industrialized country in the world that doesn\u2019t have paid leave,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said. \u201cPakistan and Afghanistan that don\u2019t even educate their girls have more paid leave. That is outrageous.\u201d\n\nMs. Pelosi tried to put the issue into a broader context. \u201cIt\u2019s about women, it\u2019s about their families, it\u2019s about their retirement, but it\u2019s also about our economy,\u201d she said.\n\nWomen\u2019s issues have emerged as a consistent theme in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s post-State Department speeches, especially in recent weeks as she has shifted gears from promoting her memoir, \u201cHard Choices,\u201d to campaigning and fund-raising for midterm candidates.\n\nOn Friday, Mrs. Clinton is expected to deliver a speech on similar topics at the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Women\u2019s Leadership Forum here, where President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will also speak.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the Clinton Global Initiative, a gathering related to the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in New York next week, Mrs. Clinton will participate in several speeches and panels related to advancing women\u2019s rights, as part of the foundation\u2019s \u201cNo Ceilings\u201d initiative.\n\nThe events allow Mrs. Clinton to focus on issues affecting women and girls that she has worked on throughout her career, and they also allow the potential 2016 candidate to lay the groundwork for what could be a campaign message focused on elevating women in order to advance the economy.\n\nNeera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and the policy director for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, moderated the event, and told the story of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supportiveness when Ms. Tanden was trying to balance a demanding campaign job with raising small children.\n\nThe panel also included working mothers. Rhiannon Broschat talked about losing her job at Whole Foods after she had to take a day off work to care for her young son because his school had closed for a snow day, as the politicians on the panel nodded understandingly. \u201cIt\u2019s our lowest income workers who are the most vulnerable,\u201d Ms. Tanden said.\n\nMrs. Clinton tried to tie her work abroad to her domestic efforts. \u201cWhere women are not given the opportunity to pursue their economic well being, their children suffer, their community suffers, indeed,\u201d she said, and \u201ctheir countries suffer.\u201d",
