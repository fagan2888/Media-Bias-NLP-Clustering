That\u2019s the reason why we left Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nHe added:\n\nBefore 1997 there was a worry something like this could happen. It was the major reason the majority of people left Hong Kong. They foresaw in the future that Hong Kong would lose it\u2019s democracy rights and just be absorbed by China as another Chinese city.\n\n>>> China-Controlled Gangs Incite Violence in Hong Kong Demonstrations\n\nChan, 33, who still lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, is a partner in a Hong Kong-based textile company that does business in China.\n\nHe says he has more than 30 friends who are participants in the demonstrations, which entered a new phase Friday when opponents of the protest movement assaulted protest sites, tearing down encampments and attacking demonstrators.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed feeling,\u201d Chan said, adding:\n\nThere\u2019s a huge population in Hong Kong that does not support the protests. There\u2019s a huge population that feels it\u2019s gotten out of control. Some are telling people to go home, that we need to go to work, we need to go to school. The world is looking at this and the outcome.\n\nHong Kong, a city of 7.2 million, returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 after more than 150 years of British rule.\n\nThe city maintains an independent judiciary, and residents enjoy greater civil liberties than residents of mainland China. It has a strong tradition of free speech.\n\nBut under China President Xi Jinping, Beijing has reined in those freedoms, imposing a measure proposed last month that would limit voting reforms.\n\nChina had promised free elections for Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive\u2013its top official \u2013in 2017.\n\n>>> Commentary: Will Hong Kong Be Scene of Next Tiananmen Square?\n\nDemonstrators have demanded that current city leader Leung Chun-ying resign and that his successors be elected democratically, without prior vetting of candidates by Beijing.\n\n\u201cWithin the protesters, there are mixed groups, doctrines and agendas,\u201d Chan said.\n\nSome are anti-China and anti-government. They are directly protesting to the China government. Others just feel their democracy is being stripped away and want a chance to vote in the leadership of Hong Kong. We\u2019ve been waiting and waiting for that, and then the announcement is totally different.\n\nChan says his family anticipated that Beijing would struggle to cede democratic power to Hong Kong, especially as the city evolved and began to live out basic freedoms granted by its mini-constitution, the Basic Law.\n\n>>> Commentary: Crackdown in Hong Kong Would Signal End to China\u2019s Economic Miracle\n\nChan\u2019s parents, uncles, aunts and cousins all emigrated to Canada, and he no longer carries Hong Kong identification. But his business operates out of Hong Kong and many in his large, extended family still live there.\n\nHe remains deeply in sync with the Hong Kong story \u2014 how the city rose to become a sophisticated financial center with one of the world\u2019s highest gross domestic products per capita.\n\n\u201cHong Kong people have a very good international sense,\u201d Chan said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "His family fled Hong Kong when he was 10, but his business is based there and he feels a connection to pro-freedom protests of Chinese heavy-handedness.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "His family fled Hong Kong when he was 10, but his business is based there and he feels a connection to pro-freedom protests of Chinese heavy-handedness.", "title": "Businessman Born in Hong Kong Identifies With Freedom Fight", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericaseleven437804.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-06T12:06:09+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tqvNG2"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "His family fled Hong Kong when he was 10, but his business is based there and he feels a connection to pro-freedom protests of Chinese heavy-handedness.", "title": "Businessman Born in Hong Kong Identifies With Freedom Fight", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericaseleven437804.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Asia", "published_time": "2014-10-06T03:01:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-06T12:06:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Hong Kong, protests, Canada, China, Xi Jinping, Beijing, Leung Chun-ying, Basic Law, universal suffrage, Operation, Occupy Central"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb569\"", "article_summary": ">>> Commentary: Crackdown in Hong Kong Would Signal End to China\u2019s Economic MiracleChan\u2019s parents, uncles, aunts and cousins all emigrated to Canada, and he no longer carries Hong Kong identification.\nIt was the major reason the majority of people left Hong Kong.\nOthers just feel their democracy is being stripped away and want a chance to vote in the leadership of Hong Kong.\nThat\u2019s the reason why we left Hong Kong.\u201dHe added:Before 1997 there was a worry something like this could happen.\nHong Kong, a city of 7.2 million, returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 after more than 150 years of British rule."}
