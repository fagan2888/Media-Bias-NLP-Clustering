An earnings miss and expected losses related to Obamacare sent managed-care provider WellCare Health Plans Inc.’s shares tumbling Wednesday, with the stock falling by more than 7% at one point in early trading.

WellCare /quotes/zigman/341770/delayed /quotes/nls/wcg WCG was off $4.10 to $58.12 in recent action, a drop of more than 6.5%.

The company said in its fourth-quarter earnings report that it expects to see an impact of $1.17 to $1.26 a share to adjusted net income during 2014 due to health insurer fees stemming from the Affordable Care Act. WellCare, which specializes in supervising Medicaid and Medicare programs, says the fee will likely end up costing between $125 million and $135 million but does not include state Medicaid reimbursements.

That’s on top of as much as $1.19 in additional expenses WellCare anticipates during the year, such as corporate infrastructure investments, growth initiatives and interest expense increases. WellCare says its capital expenditures will jump as much as 50% during the year.

WellCare says it now expects full-year adjusted earnings to wind up between $3.75 to $4.05 a share, more than a dollar lower than the $5.08 projection from analysts polled by FactSet.

For the quarter, the company said net income was $42.9 million, or 97 cents a share, compared with $48.8 million, or $1.11 a share, for the same period a year ago. Adjusted income of $1.09 a share was off from the $1.15 forecast.

Revenue, however, was up to $2.44 billion from last year’s $1.99 billion, and slightly beat the $2.42 billion FactSet forecast.
