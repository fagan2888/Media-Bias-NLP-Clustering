New York will allow some illegal immigrants to teach and practice medicine throughout the state beginning June 1, the Associated Press reported.



The state’s licensing board – the Board of Regents – voted Tuesday to accept applications from people with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status.



The Obama administration implemented the DACA policy in 2012. It applies to illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. before age 16. While it does not make them legal U.S. citizens, it puts off deportation and allows them to be legally employed. In some places, they are even allowed to receive in-state tuition rates at state colleges.

In New York, some professional licenses were previously only available to people who are U.S. citizens or have legal immigration status. The new policy allows those with DACA to be licensed as long as they meet all the license’s educational requirements.



Attorney General Eric Schneiderman called the Regents' decision "another critical step toward addressing our broken immigration system."
