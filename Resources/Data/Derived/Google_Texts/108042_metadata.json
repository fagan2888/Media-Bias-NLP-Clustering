But they scored six consecutive goals \u2014 two by senior midfielder Nick Ossello of Wheat Ridge \u2014 to take command 14-9 with 5:45 to play.\n\nAlbany freshman Connor Fields had a game-high six goals, including three in the Great Danes\u2019 dominant third quarter. Field\u2019s sixth tally came with 27 seconds remaining, Albany\u2019s only goal in the final 16 minutes.\n\nNotre Dame , an 11-9 loser to Duke in the 2014 national championship, will play the Denver-Ohio State winner in Friday\u2019s Final Four semifinals in Philadelphia.
