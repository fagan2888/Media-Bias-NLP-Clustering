Ted Cruz (R-TX). While praise from this sort of Republican on what would have been President Reagan\u2019s 103rd birthday isn\u2019t surprising, it is somewhat ironic. Though Reagan was extremely conservative (often terribly so), he bucked the sort of hardline conservative line the Tea Party has become synonymous with repeatedly throughout his career in politics. Here are 7 Reagan moves that may well have led to his excommunication from today\u2019s Republican Party if he were alive today:\n\n1. Paved the way for Obamacare\n\nCREDIT: Wikimedia Commons\n\nReagan\u2019s health policy previewed Obamacare in three major ways. First, Reagan signed Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), the law barring hospitals from turning away patients on grounds of their insurance or citizenship \u2014 a preview of Obamacare\u2019s ban on insurance discrimination against individuals with preexisting conditions. Second, Reagan doubled the size of Medicaid over the course of his presidency to pay for all of those new uninsured patients \u2014 a huge Obamacare-style Medicaid expansion. Third, Reagan pushed something called Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs), which essentially had the government set the prices Medicare was willing to pay for each Medicare admission rather than pay for reimburse doctors per cost. DRGs cut Medicare costs by $49 billion by 1986, proving a promising trial for the sorts of Medicare payment reform policies you can find in Obamacare.\n\n2. Amnesty for undocumented immigrants\n\nImmigrant sailors being naturalized aboard the USS Ronald Reagan.

Simpson-Mazzoli is now referred to by some conservatives as the \u201cReagan amnesty,\u201d and came up during both the 2007 and 2013 immigration reform debates.\n\n3. Successfully pushed for an assault weapons ban\n\nBefore the National Rifle Association became what it was today, Reagan worked with them to ban guns. Specifically, automatic weapons: civilians were legally allowed to own fully automatic rifles until 1986, when Reagan signed the Firearm Owners\u2019 Protection Act banning them. After his Presidency, Reagan backed the Brady gun law establishing many of the major restrictions on gun purchases today. His support for the 1994 Assault Weapon Ban pushed the ban to its two vote margin of victory \u2014 according to two of the Congressmen who made the difference.\n\n4. Grew the federal government, big time\n\nCREDIT: Ezra Klein\n\nReagan\u2019s record belies his reputation as a huge foe of government. Reagan built a progressive tax system to fund Social Security, and funded the creation of a new federal department (the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs). Much of Reagan\u2019s spending, including his defense buildup, was funded by deficit spending. If Obama spent like Reagan, the deficit would be much, much higher.\n\n5. Dealt with Russia to build a world free of nuclear weapons\n\nCREDIT: Wikimedia Commons\n\nBack when there was an actual Soviet Union, Reagan kicked off negotiations aimed at reducing the nuclear threat \u2014 negotiations that eventually morphed into the START treaty. In his memoir, Reagan wrote that \u201c[m]y dream\u2026became a world free of nuclear weapons.\u201d After START expired in 2009, its replacement (NEW START) was ratified over the bitter objections of a majority of Senate Republicans.\n\n6. Wanted to make millionaires pay more in taxes\n\nCREDIT: Wikimedia Commons\n\nReagan despised tax loopholes that allowed millionaires to skate around their tax obligations. \u201cTax loopholes,\u201d according to the Gipper, \u201csometimes made it possible for millionaires to pay nothing, while a bus driver was paying ten percent of his salary, and that\u2019s crazy.\u201d It\u2019s crazy, he said, because the \u201ctruly wealthy\u201d were avoiding \u201cpaying their fair share.\u201d\n\n7. Passed environmental regulations that are now being used to fight climate change\n\nCREDIT: Ron Frehm/AP Images\n\nMake no mistake \u2014 Reagan bears significant responsibility for the climate emergency. But he also negotiated the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement got the whole world to clamp down on pollution that was tearing holes in the ozone layer. Today, the Montreal Protocol is being used to clamp down on the technology that replaced the ozone-depleting kind, which turned out to be a fairly significant contributor to climate change.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Ronald Reagan's surprisingly impressive record on 7 issues.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Ronald Reagan's surprisingly impressive record on 7 issues.", "title": "7 Things Republicans Would Be Shocked To Learn About Ronald Reagan", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/02/06/3258121/reasons-tea-party-hated-ronald-reagan/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Reagans-military.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ronald Reagan's surprisingly impressive record on 7 issues.", "creator": "@zackbeauchamp", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Reagans-military-321x214.jpg", "title": "7 Things Republicans Would Be Shocked To Learn About Ronald Reagan", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Reagans-military.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Reagans-military.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-06T12:24:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Politics 7 Things Republicans Would Be Shocked To Learn About Ronald Reagan CREDIT: Ron Frehm/AP Images\u201cHappy birthday to Ronald Reagan!\u201d Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) tweeted on Thursday, swiftly followed by his Tea Party compatriot Sen.
