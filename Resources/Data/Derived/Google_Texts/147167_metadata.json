Ted Lieu and Republican District Attorney Elan Carr may be competing to fill longtime Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman\u2019s seat in November, but in an era in which the two parties rarely work together, the similarities between these two candidates are one of this race\u2019s greatest distinctions.\n\nTed Lieu\n\nBoth men are sons of immigrants (Lieu came with his family to the United States from Taiwan when he was 3; Carr\u2019s mother is from Iraq and his father was born in Bulgaria and moved to Israel). Both have assisted Iraqis while serving in the military: In 1996, Lieu was a JAG captain in the Air Force and, in Guam, helped process thousands of Kurds who were airlifted by the military from Iraq after facing mass murder by Saddam Hussein. In 2003, Carr was an anti-terrorism operative in Iraq, helping secure neighborhoods following Hussein\u2019s ouster.\n\nBoth oppose repealing the Affordable Care Act, the signature Democratic health care act widely known as ObamaCare (although Carr wants to significantly reform it). Both oppose deporting law-abiding foreigners who entered the United States illegally, and both, at least when it comes to foreign policy, sound a lot like, well, each other.\n\nIn June, when Carr was asked by the Journal how the Obama administration should respond to ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), the terrorist organization that has been closing in on the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, Carr cautioned against any U.S. military involvement unless the White House commits to destroying the group. In an Aug. 4 interview, Carr held that position.\n\nLieu\u2019s immediate take on ISIS during a recent interview in Beverly Hills?\n\n\u201cI want to crush them,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cISIS is an incredibly extreme and dangerous organization that uses violence to achieve its goals.\u201d\n\nBut when asked how he would go about doing that, Lieu chuckled, paused and said he supports, for now, President Barack Obama\u2019s current tactic of providing a few hundred military advisers to the Iraqi government:\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. is going to get involved in Iraq again, I think it needs to figure out what its objectives are\u201d before launching a major military operation, Lieu said.\n\nAnd as much as Lieu feels a connection with the Kurds of Iraq \u2014 both because of his work with them in 1996 and because of their warm feelings toward America \u2014 he still holds out hope for a unified Iraq, one that sees Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds coexisting peacefully, or at least not submerged in civil war.\n\n\u201cThis is what Iraq could be,\u201d Lieu said, describing the northeastern part of the country, which is heavily Kurdish and would likely comprise part of any autonomous Kurdish state. \u201cIt\u2019s got open-air shopping centers, amusement parks, they\u2019ve got nice hotels.\u201d\n\nOn the topic of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Lieu struck a more conservative tone than that coming out of the White House, calling Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against Hamas \u201cabsolute\u201d and casting a skeptical eye on international efforts to pressure Israel into a cease fire.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how the U.S. or the international community could impose any sort of agreement [on Israel],\u201d Lieu said. \u201cThey should read the charter of Hamas. I don\u2019t think many of them have. It doesn\u2019t just talk about Israel, it talks about killing all Jews.\u201d\n\nLieu also spoke skeptically of the United Nations and the \u201cinternational community,\u201d which he said \u201chas no teeth\u201d when it comes to keeping hostile countries or terrorist groups in line.\n\n\u201cCountries and organizations respond primarily to two things,\u201d said Lieu, a graduate of Air War College and a major in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. \u201cForce or economic sanctions \u2014 or the threat of those two things.\u201d\n\nAsked about recent data suggesting that Democratic and Republican voters may, for the first time in decades, have significantly different views on Israel, Lieu said that the gap may be due more to age than political affiliation. The data, pulled from a Pew Research Center poll released on July 28, says that 60 percent of Republicans blame Hamas for the violence, a view shared by only 29 percent of Democrats.\n\n\u201cI do believe that Democrats and Republicans share the same views on Israel,\u201d said Lieu, who supported emergency funding for the Iron Dome missile defense system that has shot down most rockets fired by Hamas that pose threats to Israeli population centers. On Aug. 1, the House of Representatives approved a Senate bill providing $225 million in emergency funds for the Iron Dome. Obama has approved the measure.\n\nEven on immigration, a wedge issue between Democrats and Republicans, there is little air between Lieu\u2019s and Carr\u2019s stated views. Lieu supports increased border security but is not confident a fence would efficiently secure the border, and he wants to reunite those living here illegally with their families, whether that means sending them to Latin America or keeping them here.\n\nCarr, in a recent interview with the conservative publication Weekly Standard, said he opposes deporting law-abiding undocumented immigrants when it is the U.S. government that created the problem, a position that puts him at odds with more conservative factions of the Republican-led House.\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we embrace them and welcome them when we are the ones who didn\u2019t secure our borders?\u201d Carr asked, clarifying, though, that he does support securing the southern border to stem the tide of illegal immigration from Central and South America.\n\nHowever, as much as the two might appear similar now, how either would govern in the House could evolve, depending upon which committees the winner might join, as well as the issues that either would prioritize.\n\nLieu is an outspoken advocate of alternative forms of energy and views global warming as an existential threat to humanity. Much of his work in the California Legislature has reflected his overriding concern with environmental issues and his belief in the government\u2019s role in growing the economy, creating jobs and helping workers \u2014 all core issues for the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal wing.\n\nCarr told the Journal in an Aug. 4 interview that his priorities would include support for Israel, education, public safety issues, and tax and regulatory policies that he said encourage companies to hire workers outside of California and the United States.\n\nOn Israel, for example, Carr contrasted what he said is providing a reliable vote on Israel \u2014 which Lieu would likely consistently provide \u2014 versus assuming a leadership role on pro-Israel legislation, much like former Sen. Joseph Lieberman and former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.\n\n\u201cWhat we need now is leaders,\u201d Carr said. \u201cNot simply votes that may be reliable votes on Israel, but leaders on the issue.\u201d\n\nAs Lieu noted, though, in 2007 he was a co-sponsor of AB221, which called on state pension funds to divest from companies that do business in Iran's energy and nuclear sectors.\n\nAlthough the two candidates have not yet held a public debate, a spokesman for the Lieu campaign said that at least one can be expected as Election Day nears.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nView our privacy policy and terms of service.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/nation/article/in_race_for_congress_how_different_are_candidates_elan_carr_and_ted_lieu", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/featured/com_elan-carr_080814.jpg", "site_name": "Jewish Journal", "title": "In race for Congress, how different are candidates Elan Carr and Ted Lieu? | Nation"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 23102350, "title": "In race for Congress, how different are candidates Elan Carr and Ted Lieu? | Nation", "url": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/nation/article/in_race_for_congress_how_different_are_candidates_elan_carr_and_ted_lieu", "image": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/featured/com_elan-carr_080814.jpg", "site": "@jewishjournal", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "1439B350A4269424970C93B18CEAF6FB", "fb": {"app_id": 216180581861512}, "keywords": "Jewish Journal, news, jewish, israel, los angeles, Tribe Media Corp, Hollywood, Israel, jewish, judaism, world, nation", "verify-v1": "5CqSOVc2kyARWwZMAxu3QCpMoZGbB5Nu6xIPWK5MXvQ="}, "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t see how the U.S. or the international community could impose any sort of agreement [on Israel],\u201d Lieu said.\nLieu is an outspoken advocate of alternative forms of energy and views global warming as an existential threat to humanity.\nIn 2003, Carr was an anti-terrorism operative in Iraq, helping secure neighborhoods following Hussein\u2019s ouster.\nBoth oppose repealing the Affordable Care Act, the signature Democratic health care act widely known as ObamaCare (although Carr wants to significantly reform it).\nEven on immigration, a wedge issue between Democrats and Republicans, there is little air between Lieu\u2019s and Carr\u2019s stated views."}
