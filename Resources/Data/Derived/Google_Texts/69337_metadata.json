She had \u201ca lot of Jewish friends.\u201d The University of Maryland has one of the highest percentages of Jewish students in the United States.\n\nAs you might expect, Amna\u2019s family was sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. But Amna wasn\u2019t satisfied. She decided that she needed to expand her horizons on that issue.\n\nSo, she took a course about Israel in college. That was when she \u201cfell in love with Zionism\u2026Because Zionism became about taking ownership over the story of one\u2019s people. If Zionism is about owning your future, how can I not respect that?\u201d\n\nTaking ownership of your story. Owning your future. That\u2019s a pretty good working definition of Zionism, isn\u2019t it?\n\nShe then spent a semester at Hebrew University of Jerusalem\u2019s Rothberg International School.\n\nWhich is to say: She has spent more time in Israel than the overwhelming majority of American Jews.\n\nI am not a member of J Street. But, I find the selection of Ms. Farooqi intriguing.\n\nBecause, what\u2019s the message? It\u2019s not only that you don\u2019t have to be Jewish to support Israel, or to admire Zionism \u2014 which Ms. Farooqi has said she does.\n\nIt\u2019s also: Zionism and Israel contain meanings that transcend simply the Jews.\n\nWatch her speech at J Street.\n\nNo, I don\u2019t agree with everything she says. She is a little too glib in singling out the occupation as the elephant in Israel\u2019s living room.\n\nThose who eagerly support a Palestinian state that includes the hills of the West Bank must confront the possibility of militants with rockets, potentially aimed at the landing strips of Ben Gurion Airport.\n\nAnd those who oppose any territorial concessions must ask themselves whether a Jewish and democratic state can sustain itself with an exploding Palestinian demographic.\n\nAmna is a Rorschach test. As Steven Cohen, a sociologist at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, has said:\n\n\u201cFor the Right, her election symbolizes the extent to which the Left will go in abandoning ethnic loyalty and commitments.\n\n\u201cFor the Left, her service to J Street symbolizes the potential to cross boundaries and build coalitions for peace. As with much in life, good or bad is in the eyes of the beholder.\u201d\n\nZionism has never been a \u201cJews only\u201d club. Need I remind you of the centuries-old tradition of Christian Zionism? Without the support of British Christian Zionists like Arthur Balfour and Lloyd George, the Jewish State could not have come into existence.\n\nThey are far from alone. Walk through Jerusalem\u2019s Germany Colony, and you will streets named for European gentile supporters of Zionism.\n\nNor has the state of Israel believed that only Jewish leaders can defend its interests. Reda Mansour, a Druze diplomat served as Atlanta\u2019s respected Israel\u2019s consul-general. Years before, an Israeli Arab held the same post.\n\nThe choice of Ms. Farooqi offers us the opportunity to re-examine the complex relationship between Muslims and Zionists.\n\nCheck out Hillel Cohen\u2019s book Army of Shadows: Palestinian Collaboration with Zionism.\n\nHe tells the stories of local Arab leaders in the early 1900s who welcomed Jewish settlement as being economically advantageous; of Muslims who protected Jews from harm, and, of Muslims who sold land to Jews, and taught them about the land.\n\nHasan Shukri, the Arab mayor of Haifa during World War I and in the years between 1927 and 1940, cabled the British government in 1921:\n\n\u201cWe do not consider the Jewish people as an enemy\u2026. We consider the Jews as a brotherly people sharing our joys and troubles and helping us in the construction of our common country. We are certain that without Jewish immigration and financial assistance there will be no future development of our country as may be judged from the fact that the towns inhabited in part by Jews such as Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa and Tiberias are making steady progress while Nablus, Acre and Nazareth where no Jews reside are steadily declining.\u201d\n\nTo put it bluntly: not all Palestinian Arab leaders were Haj Amin el-Husseini, the diabolical Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and Nazi sympathizer and collaborator.\n\nBack to Amna Tarooqi.\n\nAt the very least, she deserves our admiration.\n\nFirst, think about the the risks \u2014 of ostracism and more \u2014 that she is taking within her ethnic community. We need to remember and honor those risks.\n\nSecond, imagine a kind of success that this young woman could have. She has the potential to positively influence other Muslim and Third World college students \u2014 and win them over to at least a partial appreciation of Zionism and Israel.\n\nGood luck, Amna Farooqi.\n\nYou \u2014 and all of us who care about Israel and Zionism \u2014 need it.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Culture, Ethics, Institutions, Opinion, Army of Shadows, Catholic, Christian, Cohen, Evangelical", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "A young Muslim Pakistani-American as a pro-Israel leader?
