If, as Marc Andreessen once noted, \u201cSoftware is eating the world,\u201d knowing how to code will help you eat rather than be eaten. Understanding how to design, write and maintain a computer program is important even if you never plan to write one in business. If you don\u2019t know anything about coding, you won\u2019t be able to function effectively in the world today.\n\nYou will inevitably work with people who program for a living, and you need to be able to communicate effectively with them. You will work with computers as a part of your job, and you need to understand how they think and operate. You will buy software at home and work, and you need to know why it works well or doesn\u2019t. You will procure much of your information from the Internet, and you need to know what went wrong when you get \u201c404 not found\u201d or a \u201c500 internal server error\u201d messages.\n\nOf course, being able to code is also extremely helpful in getting and keeping a job. \u201cSoftware developers\u201d is one of the job categories expected to grow the most over the next decade.\n\nBut in addition to many thousands of software professionals, we need far more software amateurs. McKinsey & Co. argued a few years ago that we need more than 1.5 million \u201cdata-savvy managers\u201d in the U.S. alone if we\u2019re going to succeed with big data, and it\u2019s hard to be data-savvy without understanding how software works.\n\nEven if you\u2019ve left school, it\u2019s not too late. There are many resources available to help you learn how to code at a basic level. The language doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nLearn to code, and learn to live in the 21st century.\n\nTom Davenport (@tdav) is a Distinguished Professor at Babson College, a research fellow at the Center for Digital Business, director of research at the International Institute for Analytics, and a senior adviser to Deloitte Analytics.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The most important technological skill for all employees is being able to code.
