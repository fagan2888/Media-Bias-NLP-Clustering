The 2010 U.S. health reform law known as Obamacare has spurred deals by introducing rules that push insurers to look for savings, and by creating millions of new customers.\n\nIn response, drugmakers will need to show they\u2019re providing innovative therapies that will save insurers money by keeping patients out of the hospital, Jimenez said.\n\nNovartis this month won U.S. approval for Entresto, a heart-failure medicine that the company says will become its biggest seller with revenue in excess of $5 billion. While the drug\u2019s price, at about $4,500 a year, is higher than some analysts predicted, the company hasn\u2019t had pushback from payers because it can prevent hospital stays that cost an average of $11,000, Jimenez said.\n\nNo Barrier\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think price is going to be a barrier for rapid uptake of Entresto,\u201d Jimenez said.\n\nNovartis has proposed a pay-for-performance system in which insurers would initially pay a lower price for Entresto, followed by an additional charge if the drug succeeds in keeping patients out of the hospital. While Express Scripts Holding Co., the largest manager of drug insurance benefits in the U.S., has expressed skepticism, other payers have shown interest, Jimenez said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a number who\u2019ve had interest, but it\u2019s quite small as a percentage of the total payer universe,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is just keep at it. Someday this is going to be the way that pharmaceutical companies and health-care companies are compensated, so we might as well get started now.\u201d\n\nJimenez spoke after Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis reported second-quarter earnings that missed analysts\u2019 estimates and unexpectedly cut the sales forecast for its Alcon eye-care unit. Pharmaceutical division sales fell 4 percent in the quarter to $7.8 billion in U.S. dollar terms, and rose 6 percent excluding currency fluctuations.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Simeon Bennett", "twitter": {"description": "Novartis AG Chief Executive Officer Joe Jimenez said the consolidation spree among U.S. health insurers is making it harder for drugmakers to increase prices in a market that has for years been a primary driver of growth for the pharmaceutical industry.", "title": "Novartis CEO Says U.S. Insurance M&A to Crimp Drug Prices", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-21/novartis-ceo-says-u-s-health-insurer-m-a-to-crimp-drug-prices", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipnqlyT34mNE/v3/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Simeon Bennett", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health,Joe Jimenez,Novartis AG", "news_keywords": "Health,Joe Jimenez,Novartis AG", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-21/novartis-ceo-says-u-s-health-insurer-m-a-to-crimp-drug-prices", "parsely-title": "Novartis CEO Says U.S. Insurance M&A to Crimp Drug Prices", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-07-21T11:22:32.189Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Novartis AG Chief Executive Officer Joe Jimenez said the consolidation spree among U.S. health insurers is making it harder for drugmakers to increase prices in a market that has for years been a primary driver of growth for the pharmaceutical industry.", "parsely-tags": "Health,Joe Jimenez,Novartis AG,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-07-21T11:22:32.189Z", "parsely-section": "personal-finance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Novartis AG Chief Executive Officer Joe Jimenez said the consolidation spree among U.S. health insurers is making it harder for drugmakers to increase prices in a market that has for years been a primary driver of growth for the pharmaceutical industry.", "title": "Novartis CEO Says U.S. Insurance M&A to Crimp Drug Prices", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-21/novartis-ceo-says-u-s-health-insurer-m-a-to-crimp-drug-prices", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipnqlyT34mNE/v3/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Novartis AG Chief Executive Officer Joe Jimenez said the consolidation spree among U.S. health insurers is making it harder for drugmakers to increase prices in a market that has for years been a primary driver of growth for the pharmaceutical industry."}, "parsely-post-id": "NRU3FN6JIJUO01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipnqlyT34mNE/v3/-1x-1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "No Barrier\u201cI don\u2019t think price is going to be a barrier for rapid uptake of Entresto,\u201d Jimenez said.\nIn response, drugmakers will need to show they\u2019re providing innovative therapies that will save insurers money by keeping patients out of the hospital, Jimenez said.\nPharmaceutical division sales fell 4 percent in the quarter to $7.8 billion in U.S. dollar terms, and rose 6 percent excluding currency fluctuations.\nWhile Express Scripts Holding Co., the largest manager of drug insurance benefits in the U.S., has expressed skepticism, other payers have shown interest, Jimenez said.\n\u201cAcross the board in the U.S., the pricing environment is more difficult,\u201d Jimenez said in a phone interview Tuesday."}
