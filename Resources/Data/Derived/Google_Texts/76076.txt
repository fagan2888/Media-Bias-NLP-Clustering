BALTIMORE (AP) â€” About 2,000 women who claim a Maryland gynecologist secretly recorded them during pelvic exams have been told to provide more information to participate in a $190 million lawsuit settlement.

The women are among nearly 9,600 who said they were victimized by Dr. Nikita Levy at a Johns Hopkins-affiliated clinic in Baltimore. A judge approved a class-action lawsuit against Hopkins in 2014.

The Baltimore Sun reports (http://bsun.md/1NHDx1m ) that attorneys who spent months poring over medical records sent letters to more than one-fifth of the claimants, saying they found no documentation that they were Levy's patients. The letter asks the women to fill out and return a form. It also requests proof, such as test results or insurance claims.

Levy killed himself in 2013 after the allegations emerged.
