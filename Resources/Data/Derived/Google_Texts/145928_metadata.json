This big swing toward Democrats wasn\u2019t just the product of young people always leaning more liberal but reflected a more monumental shift toward generational fault-lines in politics that would favor the left in the future.\n\nThe Pew Research Center has rolled out a major new report on the Millennial generation, confirming the continuation of a number of big trends: Millennials are less likely to be married, less likely to be religious, and less likely to be Republican. These three trends all seem to spell major long-term problems for conservatism.\n\nThis has, of course, been viewed as great news for the left-of-center. \u201cI, for one, welcome our new liberal overlords,\u201d said New York Magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait. There\u2019s quite a bit of data that has long suggested the Democratic Party has had a serious upper-hand in courting the youth vote in the last few elections.\n\nYet the conventional wisdom that the Republican Party is doomed and that Millennials\u2019 major problem with the GOP is \u201cthe social issues\u201d clumsily lumps together a variety of unrelated or loosely connected cultural issues, while also missing the fact that young voters are skeptical of pieces of the economic agendas of both parties.\n\nThe most obvious signs of the GOP\u2019s struggle come from looking at the basics: only 17 percent of Millennials actually identify as Republican. While the late 1990\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s saw few generation gaps around Republican identification, the Millennials debuted significantly less Republican and have stayed that way ever since. Millennials are also the only generation where self-identified liberals outnumber self-identified conservatives.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the source of the \u201csocial issues\u201d problem. Even Pew makes the mistake of lumping \u201cthe social issues\u201d into one basket, with a question finding 57 percent of Millennials saying their \u201csocial views\u201d have become \u201cmore liberal\u201d over the course of their lives, compared to all other generations who declare they\u2019ve become more conservative. On some issues, like same-sex marriage and legalization of marijuana, it\u2019s certainly the case, and by huge margins. (Even six out of ten young Republicans support legalizing same-sex marriage.) However, Millennials are not the most \u201cliberal\u201d generation on either abortion or gun control.\n\nWhile the Pew study lends much support to the story that the GOP is struggling with Millennials, far more interesting is the new revelation at just how much the Democrats have struggled with this generation in the last year or two. While Democrats have the edge over the GOP in terms of the number of Millennials identifying with their party, it is actually the Democrats who have seen a larger drop-off among the young in just the last few years. Obama's approval ratings, which at one point were sky-high with Millennials, have come back down to earth since the start of his second term. A majority of Millennials think the government should ensure everyone is covered by health insurance but 54 percent also disapprove of the Affordable Care Act, a result that is exactly in line with other generations\u2019 views. Only three out of ten Millennials think there\u2019s a \u201cgreat deal of difference\u201d between the parties, and half now consider themselves political independents.\n\nWhere the most important battle for the Millennial political soul will be fought is not over party labels or the big basket of \u201csocial issues\u201d but rather over the generation\u2019s view of the appropriate role of government. For years, there have been signs that the right was failing to make the case for limited government and free markets to the younger generation.\n\nThe Pew report finds that Millennials are the only generation that prefers that \u201cbig government and more services\u201d to \u201csmall government and fewer services.\u201d However, previous research has shown that many Millennials don\u2019t get what the concept of \u201cbig government\u201d is really referring to in the first place. This makes the question then sound a bit like an AT&T kindergarten focus group ad. (\u201cWhich pool would you rather go to, a really big, really fun pool, or a much smaller, less fun pool?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s better: more services or fewer services?\u201d) The right has its work cut out for it in selling its message of markets and limited government to a new generation, and railing against \u201cbig government\u201d in and of itself as an abstract concept isn\u2019t a winning message, but it\u2019d be wrong to view these poll results as a Millennial love letter to federal bureaucracy.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201403111700, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Republicans can\u2019t win over the generation that\u2019s liberal on most social and economic issues, but Democrats can\u2019t seem to win them back.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Millennials Unfriend Democrats", "tags": "topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Millennials Unfriend Democrats\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/11/millennials-unfriend-democrats.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/11/millennials-unfriend-democrats/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46485245.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/11/millennials-unfriend-democrats\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-11T17:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Kristen Soltis Anderson\",\"tags\":[\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Kristen Soltis Anderson", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-03-11T17:00:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/kristen-soltis-andersonhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/11/millennials-unfriend-democrats", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Republicans can\u2019t win over the generation that\u2019s liberal on most social and economic issues, but Democrats can\u2019t seem to win them back.", "title": "Millennials Unfriend Democrats", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/11/millennials-unfriend-democrats.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/11/millennials-unfriend-democrats/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1394557374483.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/k/kristen-soltis-anderson", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "However, Millennials are not the most \u201cliberal\u201d generation on either abortion or gun control.\nPox on Both HousesRepublicans can\u2019t win over the generation that\u2019s liberal on most social and economic issues, but Democrats can\u2019t seem to win them back.\nWhile Democrats have the edge over the GOP in terms of the number of Millennials identifying with their party, it is actually the Democrats who have seen a larger drop-off among the young in just the last few years.\nThen, there\u2019s the source of the \u201csocial issues\u201d problem.\nThe most obvious signs of the GOP\u2019s struggle come from looking at the basics: only 17 percent of Millennials actually identify as Republican."}
