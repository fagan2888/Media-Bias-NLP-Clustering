Or don\u2019t worry at all, which, he says can be a bigger problem.\n\nWe don\u2019t even know it, but big government and big business are controlling our lives through American media propaganda. Does Lakoff mean the \u201cB\u201d word? Brainwashed?\n\n\u201cBasically, what you\u2019ve got are monopolies running your life in any dimension and it\u2019s not mentioned,\u201d Lakoff said to RawStory.com. \u201cIt\u2019s not discussed. It\u2019s not a topic of conversation. It\u2019s not a topic of legislation. It isn\u2019t something that\u2019s out there.\n\n\u201cCorporations run your life all the time. Look at the corporate ads on TV. Corporation ads are innocent. They have nice little sounds. Think of the music in oil company ads and the people in them. It\u2019s like, \u2018We\u2019re pleasant. We\u2019re progressive. We\u2019re making progress. We\u2019re cute,\u2019 etc., when they\u2019re actually running your life.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Lakoff is saying we are being hit over the head constantly with messages that are misleading, deceitful and evoke fear. And it\u2019s all intentional.\n\nWhy? According to Lakoff, to influence our politics and policies. Republicans shout that Obamacare is not good for the country loud and often enough, and people believe it\u2014even the people whom it would help. Fear-mongering.\n\nIn December 2013, the Gallup poll found that nearly three out of four people feared \u201cbig government\u201d more than \u201cbig business\u201d or \u201cbig labor.\u201d After President Obama took office in 2009, 55 percent feared Big Brother. By late 2013, the last time Gallup asked, the government-fearing figure was 72 percent, the highest in 50 years.\n\nOnly 21 percent of Americans said that big business was a bigger threat, which means the other 79 percent of the population does not get it or chooses to ignore that most big businesses, especially those online, breach our privacy daily, peek into our personal space, profile us, and resell that information.\n\nBanks, insurers. . . they have access to our personal information and with it are able to shape our lives. And no one seems to care enough, Lakoff said.\n\nRawstory pointed out that \u201cmany small problems get undue attention while widespread problems go unacknowledged and unanswered.\u201d\n\nIt used this example: taxpayers spend millions on Amber alerts, which usually end up being the missing child with an angry family member. In contrast, Americans continuously overlook the millions of children nationally who lack health insurance, who are malnourished and have rising illiteracy rates. Nobody needs to be reminded which of these two issues is likely to be on the evening news.\n\n\u201cWhenever one group uses fear to manipulate another, someone benefits and someone pays,\u201d wrote sociologist Barry Glassner in the 10th anniversary edition of The Culture of Fear: Why Americans Are Afraid of the Wrong Things, where that example originated. As he noted, \u201cThreats to the U.S. financial system, obscured from public view in part by endless attention to the \u2018war on terror,\u2019 undermined America\u2019s national security more than Osama bin Laden and his organization ever did.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, Gallup found Americans fear big government much more than big business. Gallup didn\u2019t cite more tangible reasons why many Americans fear government. It didn\u2019t mention the racism Black people endure: abusive policing, being arrested for victimless crimes, being followed or harassed by white law enforcement, or targeted by overzealous prosecutors. It cited a right-wing obsession, Obamacare, and Eric Snowden\u2019s revelations about cyber stealing.\n\n\u201cOur self image is a nation of self individualists,\u201d Glassner said to Rawstory. \u201cYou make it on your own and success comes from your own hard work. That doesn\u2019t mesh well with any kind of collective or community notion.\u201d\n\nSaid Lakoff: \u201cYou have all of these progressives out there who went to [liberal arts] school and did well thinking that all you have to do is tell people something once, give them the facts, they\u2019re all reasons to the right conclusion,\u201d he said. They think \u201cthat\u2019s all you can do, or should do, when that\u2019s utterly false\u2026 That\u2019s not how the brain works.\n\n\u201cFor conservatives, democracy is about the liberty to do what you want to do to anybody and meet no public responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cWith progressives, people care about each other and work through the government to provide public resources so that private life can function and private business can function\u2026The whole idea of public resources for well being and freedom isn\u2019t there for conservatives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Black Star", "description": "In the eyes of\u00a0George Lakoff, a linguist and author who analyzes how language and media form liberal and conservative doctrine, we worry about the wrong stuff.
