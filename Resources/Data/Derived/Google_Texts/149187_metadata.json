Ted Cruz says he\u2019s the only presidential candidate who can block Donald Trump from winning the Republican nomination.\n\nDuring a rally at Johnson County Community College in Overland Park on Wednesday evening, Cruz lambasted Obamacare and business regulations, characterizing them as huge drains on the economy.\n\n\u201cWhen we repeal Obamacare, when we pass a flat tax, when we abolish the IRS, we\u2019re going to see small business exploding,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see millions upon millions of high paying jobs, of wages through the roof, of young people coming out of school getting, two, three, four, five job offers.\"\n\nCruz warned that, with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court is potentially one justice away from a liberal majority, which he said would effectively erase the Second Amendment and promote civil rights at the expense of conservative Christian religious beliefs.\n\nCruz lambasted Donald Trump, the clear front-runner in the Republican primary. Cruz accused Trump of hiring foreigners to help staff his hotels and funding Democratic candidates. In fact, the sitting senator warned voters of choosing a \u201cWashington deal maker\u201d in Trump. Cruz maintained he\u2019s the only viable alternative.\n\n\u201cThere is only one campaign that has beaten Donald Trump over and over again and that can and will beat Donald Trump,\u201d said Cruz.\n\nCruz noted that Sen. Lindsey Graham, a fellow Republican who recently joked fellow senators would turn a blind eye if someone were to murder Cruz, now says the party should unite around the senator from Texas.\n\n\u201cLindsey and I had disagreements on some policy issues, on some tactics. But I do think Lindsey is acknowledging the simple reality of this race,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to beat Donald Trump, the field can\u2019t remain fractured.\u201d\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio agrees with the general sentiment but says the GOP should unite around him. Rubio is scheduled to campaign in Wichita, Topeka, and Overland Park, on Friday. Kansans caucus Saturday.\n\nFrank Morris is a national correspondent and senior editor at KCUR 89.3.
