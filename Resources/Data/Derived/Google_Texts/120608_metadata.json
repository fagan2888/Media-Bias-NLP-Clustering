But the heat is turned down to low when it comes to Oregon\u2019s efforts at improving health care for low-income people and its costs for taxpayers.\n\nAt a luncheon for the Medford-based Community Health Center last week, Dr. Bruce Goldberg, director of the Oregon Health Authority, detailed Oregon\u2019s developing success story and urged people to have patience as new systems are put in place.\n\nWhile the line could hardly be drawn more distinctly between the pro and con sides of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Oregon pioneering efforts have drawn support from both sides of the aisle and have perhaps laid a foundation that the nation can build on.\n\nThere\u2019s no question health care in this country has to change. The United States has the most expensive health care system in the world and one of the least effective when it comes to creating a healthy populace. Sure, we can treat the symptoms, and probably better than anyone else. But the health care system is more like an auto repair shop \u2014 we keep fixing the car after it crashes into the ditch over and over, rather than trying to address what\u2019s causing those crashes.\n\nWe can keep our car on the road, but the cost is enormous and with every crash, the vehicle\u2019s long-term prospects are diminished.\n\nOregon has taken a different approach and done so with bipartisan support, which is a bit amazing considering the animosity generated by national health care reform. It has created coordinated care organizations to manage the Oregon Health Plan, this state\u2019s version of Medicaid, treating the whole patient and getting to the root of medical issues rather than just fixing the human vehicle over and over again.\n\nWant an eye-opener on health care costs in this country? Goldberg has one: If, over the past 80 years, the cost of food had risen at the same rate as the cost of health care, a dozen eggs would cost $80 and a dozen oranges would cost $100. We are not heading toward an unsustainable future: We have arrived at an unsustainable present.\n\nOregon\u2019s plan takes positive steps to end that financial crisis, creating teams of physicians, mental health counselors and others to treat OHP patients, focusing especially on the 20 percent of those patients who are running up 80 percent of the bills.\n\nGoldberg told the story of a mentally ill man who was admitted 40 times in one year for breathing problems related to anxiety. After being assigned to coordinated care, the man\u2019s hospital visits dropped the next year \u2014 to zero.\n\nThere are other positive indicators: emergency room visits have dropped by 9 percent among OHP patients, while primary care visits have climbed by 18 percent. Those patients are getting help in dealing with the cause of their problems rather than just the symptoms.\n\nThe goal of Oregon\u2019s plan is to cut annual health care cost increases to 3.4 percent. If the program stays on track, it will save Oregon and the feds $4.8 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nOrganizations like the Community Health Center are on the front lines of the effort to provide care for all who need it, while keeping costs under control. They are part of a network of health care providers who truly have created a network that can move us away from our unsustainable present.\n\nIn the midst of all the hue and cry over health care reform, it\u2019s a success story that deserves to be told.\n\nEugene Register-Guard, Nov. 10, on ranking the University of Oregon\n\nA new set of comparisons ranks the University of Oregon against the other 33 public members of the Association of American Universities according to 22 benchmarks. Most of the benchmarks show that the state of Oregon has tried to maintain a first-rate university on the cheap. The rest of them show that the state has succeeded in important respects \u2014 given what the state puts into the UO, what comes out is pretty good.\n\nThat type of success can become a trap: A university that successfully adapts to privation is rewarded with more of it. If the state can withdraw nearly all public funding from higher education, and the UO responds with increased enrollment and high faculty productivity, legislators conclude that they can safely pinch the budget still further.\n\nThe most telling of the benchmarks, which were prepared by the UO\u2019s provost, compares total expenditures per full-time student. The UO ranks last in this category, spending $29,532 per student in 2010-11. No. 1 is the University of California-Los Angeles, with expenditures of $120,636. The average for all public AAU universities is $60,575. The gap is widening: The UO\u2019s per-student spending rose by 7 percent from 2006-07 through 2010-11, while the average AAU increase was 10 percent.\n\nLow per-student spending is reflected in many of the other benchmarks. In 2010-11, the UO had the highest ratio of students per tenured or tenure-track faculty member \u2014 35 to 1. The average at other AAU public universities was 23 to 1.\n\nFive years earlier, the UO\u2019s ratio of tenure-related faculty to students was 32 to 1. The university saw a 20 percent surge in student enrollment during that period, and almost managed to keep pace with a 19 percent increase in the total number of faculty. Nearly all of the increase, however, was among lower-ranked faculty with smaller paychecks and less job security. The UO kept professors in front of its students by watering the soup.\n\nThis conclusion is buttressed by an analysis presented in March by Howard Bunsis, a professor of accounting at Eastern Michigan University and chairman of the American Association of University Professors\u2019 Collective Bargaining Congress. Bunsis found that from 2005 through 2012, the number of part-time faculty at the UO rose 38 percent, while full-time faculty increased by 1 percent. Bunsis also found that among nine AAU public universities, faculty salaries at the UO ranked last \u2014 except for instructors, the lowest rank examined, whose salaries ranked fifth.\n\nLow spending is also implicated in benchmarks of students\u2019 success in college. The UO\u2019s six-year graduation rate in 2010-11 was 66 percent, compared to an AAU average of 78 percent. The UO retained 86 percent of its freshmen into the second year, while the average AAU public university\u2019s rate was 91 percent. These statistics are evidence of relatively weak advising, a high student-faculty ratio and a lack of other services to help students get their college careers off to a good start and keep them on track toward graduation.\n\nBut other benchmarks tell a different story. By some measures, the UO is highly productive. The UO awards 41 percent more bachelor\u2019s degrees per tenure-related faculty member than the average AAU school. The UO\u2019s tenure-related faculty publish 30 percent more books per capita than their AAU peers. To some degree these benchmarks reflect the shift to non-tenured faculty. But efficiency-minded legislators might rationally conclude that the UO is managing to do more with less, and get into the habit of expecting the university to keep it up.\n\nThe same conclusion might be drawn from the UO\u2019s success in fundraising. The UO\u2019s endowment of $437 million ranks 25th among the public AAU universities, and annual income from donations ranks 29th. But compared to its total expenditures, the UO\u2019s fundraising is 55 percent above average and its endowment has been above average in most recent years. In these figures legislators will see evidence that the UO has found donors to fill the gap left by reductions in state funding.\n\nIn a recent interview, UO President Michael Gottfredson focused on the benchmarks that highlight the university\u2019s successes, noted that the 2013 Legislature had approved a budget increase for higher education for the first time in years and predicted that an independent board would give the UO more flexibility in self-management. But at the root of a half-dozen challenges facing the UO, ranging from student access and high tuition to student-faculty ratios and faculty retention, Gottfredson identified a common denominator: finances.\n\nThe benchmarks show a university that has fallen behind its AAU peers by many important measures, but has still managed to keep up or excel in other respects. The lagging indicators are no surprise in a state where higher education spending per student has declined by half since 1987, and is now 50 percent below the national average. The UO has done well in its efforts to mask the effects of that decline, but the state\u2019s political leaders should not imagine that access and quality can be maintained indefinitely without a public investment comparable to other states\u2019. In the end, Oregon will get what it pays for.\n\nThe Oregonian, Nov. 7, on modernizing liquor sales\n\nOregon\u2019s liquor-sale system is clunky and outdated, but it has a couple of things going for it. First, it raises a lot of money. The state general fund alone received more than $115 million during the 2012-2013 fiscal year. Second, many of the system\u2019s peculiarities exist outside of the view of the consumer.\n\nTo most Oregonians, the most meaningful manifestation of the system\u2019s strangeness is the retail segregation of hard liquor. A lot of people may roll their eyes at the absurdity of a legal structure devoted to the proposition that the alcohol contained in one kind of beverage should be treated differently than the alcohol contained in another. But the thing that affects consumers directly is the extra stop required to buy vodka or whiskey. So why not eliminate that extra stop \u2014 say, by allowing grocery stores to stock state liquor?\n\nThis idea, reported by The Oregonian\u2019s Harry Esteve, is one of several a state task force will consider in the coming weeks. The Oregon Liquor Control Commission is under intense pressure to reform, thanks to the threat of a privatization measure contemplated by grocers. Getting the state out of the liquor-selling business entirely, as Washington did last year, may be the cleanest and most sensible way to reform the system, depending of course upon the details. But Oregonians would be almost as well served by more subtle changes that allow the current system to behave \u2014 at least at the consumer end \u2014 more like a modern system.\n\nOLCC Chair Rob Patridge describes what he calls a hybrid system. The state would continue to control the supply of hard liquor through its warehouse, but grocery stores would be allowed to put it on shelves and sell it, just as they do wine and beer. Such an arrangement would improve consumer convenience without blowing up the existing system entirely. It also would provide some protection to the state\u2019s craft distillers. \u201cDistributors don\u2019t want to mess with little distillers in states like Washington,\u201d says Patridge. But under a hybrid system, he says, their products would continue to be stocked in the state warehouse for easy distribution.\n\nBut will grocers go for it? Maybe, maybe not. \u201cWe\u2019re open to anything that makes sense,\u201d says Joe Gilliam, president of the Northwest Grocery Association. But don\u2019t get your hopes up, booze buyers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to modernize the system and keep all the old parts in place,\u201d says Gilliam, noting that \u201cwe\u2019re not interested in window dressing.\u201d\n\nFor supermarkets, which already have their own supply chains, involving the state\u2019s warehouse could be a problem. \u201cTheir operation doesn\u2019t give us any efficiencies or opportunities to cut costs,\u201d says Gilliam, and if the new system doesn\u2019t work efficiently, grocers won\u2019t support it. \u201cYou\u2019d have to increase prices, and then the consumer would lose,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd if the system served consumers well, we\u2019d add, they\u2019d be less likely to support the grocers\u2019 privatization initiative, which Gilliam\u2019s organization is \u201cvery close\u201d to unveiling. The grocers intend to keep plugging away regardless of what the liquor task force produces, Gilliam says, as significant changes would embark upon an uncertain journey in the Legislature.\n\nAll of this bickering and posturing should be encouraging to consumers, who are badly served by the status quo. The grocers\u2019 promised pursuit of an initiative is forcing the state to consider reforms that serve liquor buyers better. It\u2019s impossible to know how interested grocers are in the hybrid model Patridge describes. Then again, it\u2019s impossible to know how interested voters might be in their initiative. Such a measure would have to impose a tax high enough to keep the state whole without producing a Washington-style price shock. Washington\u2019s experience alone might scare off many voters no matter how well constructed the grocers\u2019 proposal might be.\n\nGiven such uncertainty, perhaps it\u2019s not unreasonable to hope grocers will seriously consider a hybrid system that places booze on their shelves. Time will tell. As backup plans go, meanwhile, a privatization initiative has a lot to recommend it.\n\nThe (Pendleton) East Oregonian, Nov. 6, on the next generation of farm families\n\nMore and more, woman are returning to the farm \u2014 and taking charge. This is part of the generational shift agricultural economists talk about.\n\nMolly Pearmine McCarger returned to the family farm after a stint teaching.\n\nMarie Bowers returned to her family\u2019s farm after working in agricultural finance.\n\nSo did Macey Wessels, who managed a blueberry farm and processing plant.\n\nMore and more, women are returning to the family farm and taking charge.\n\nThis is part of the generational shift that agricultural economists talk about. As America\u2019s farmers grow older \u2014 the average age is 57 \u2014 the younger generation must pick up the mantle. As the older generation considers passing along the family farm, all options must be considered.\n\nThese days, daughters can be as likely to take over the farm as the sons.\n\nThat\u2019s as it should be. Farms are businesses that require knowledge of agriculture, finance, mechanics and many other fields. Whether that person is male or female is beside the point. Farming is an equal-opportunity profession.\n\nOne of the most difficult problems facing any farm family can be summed up in a single word: succession. That\u2019s when a farmer approaching retirement age faces the question of what to do with the farm. Sometimes the farm has been built from scratch. Other times, it is a multi-generational operation. Either way, the farmer, along with the family, need to come up with a plan for the next generation.\n\nIn some families, the custom called for the oldest son to take over the farm. In others, the son \u2014 or daughter \u2014 with the most interest was designated. In some others, each child received an equal share of the farm.\n\nThese and many other alternatives emerge during a discussion of succession plans. Almost all of them can have pitfalls if all the aspects are not considered.\n\nFor example, a farmer may give an equal share to each child with the provision that one of them will buy out the others. But if the plan is not properly drawn up, the child still on the farm may have to take out a loan or sell part of the farm to do that. In some cases that can put the farm in a precarious financial position.\n\nIn still other cases, there\u2019s no plan at all, and family members, under the worst of circumstances, must figure out what to do.\n\nBut just as no two families are the same, no two succession plans are the same.\n\nWhether a daughter or a son ends up on the farm, all family members must be on board and treated fairly.\n\nThe Albany Democrat-Herald, Nov.12 , on mental illness and prisons\n\nHere\u2019s news that won\u2019t surprise anyone who\u2019s worked in a jail or a prison: According to numbers from the Oregon Department of Corrections, one of every three inmates in state prisons has a mental health issue.\n\nIn fact, the number of inmates with some kind of mental health problem is on the rise.\n\nAccording to the state\u2019s monthly inmate profile, as of Nov. 1, 4,672 Oregon inmates need some sort of mental health treatment. That\u2019s up 17 percent from five years ago, when the count was 3,991. (The Oregonian recently published a story about the Nov. 1 inmate profile.)\n\nThe fact of the matter is that our jails and prisons have become, almost by default, the place where we treat thousands of people suffering from some sort of mental illness.\n\nAnd the primary method of dealing with mental illness inside our prisons \u2014 and, again, this almost is by default \u2014 is through medication. That\u2019s according to a dissertation by Joseph Galanek, who found that \u201cpsychiatric medications are a primary form of treatment\u201d at the State Penitentiary in Salem, for both serious and minor mental illnesses.\n\nAlthough this news isn\u2019t particularly surprising \u2014the link between mental illness and criminal behavior is depressingly common \u2014 it does lead to a couple of more general observations.\n\nFirst, it suggests that one of the priorities as the state tries to emphasize community-based corrections as an alternative to building more prisons will be to bolster the mental health services those inmates will require.\n\nYou saw an example of that last week, when Linn County accepted a $606,000 grant from the state to help pay for community corrections programs. It\u2019s no coincidence that many of the services the grant is intended to pay for are connected, either directly or indirectly, to mental health issues. There\u2019s no point in shortchanging those essential services \u2014 not if we\u2019re serious, as we should be, about pursuing community corrections as a more effective and less expensive alternative to building new prisons.\n\nBut a bigger issue lurks just underneath the surface: Is this part of the price we pay as a society for paying insufficient attention to mental health issues in the first place? If so, wouldn\u2019t it be a better investment to develop \u2014 and properly fund \u2014 early-intervention programs to treat those issues before they blossom into something bigger?\n\nThat might not be just the most humane thing to do. It might also be the most cost-effective thing.\n\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
