Secretary General's Envoy for Health Finance and for Malaria, and Rajesh Panjabi, CEO of Last Mile Health, wrote in the article. National efforts also will need to include leadership from the health ministries and engage communities in how to design health programs.\n\nSuccessful financing programs should combine international donations and other funding sources with domestic resources, the report contends. It outlines a four-step process for developing financing: determining the required program scale, costing the plan year-by-year, setting financing targets for each year by funding source, and identifying specific financing mechanisms to meet targets.\n\n\"This panel believes high-performing CHW programs can be financially self-sustaining in the long term by sharing the financing burden among the program beneficiaries (which include private employers and private healthcare providers) and by capturing gains that result from economic growth,\" according to the report's executive summary.\n\nThe report's findings echo in many ways similar recommendations for U.S.-based CHW programs in a recent opinion article published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Among the recommendations in that article were integrating CHWs into formal healthcare teams and avoiding fragmented, disease-specific interventions. Research indicates CHWs can be particularly effective in helping patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes, as well as those with multiple chronic illnesses, patients in high-poverty areas and patients without insurance.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n-download the report (pdf)\n\n-here's the blog post\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n5 ways community health worker programs can improve post-ACA\n\nCommunity health workers reach patients doctors can't\n\nU.S. looks to boost community health workers", "article_metadata": {"description": "Developing a large cadre of highly trained community health workers in sub-Saharan Africa is key to stemming future outbreaks of deadly diseases like Ebola as well as achieving universal healthcare, according to a new report by international healthcare experts and African leaders.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Developing a large cadre of highly trained community health workers in sub-Saharan Africa is key to stemming future outbreaks of deadly diseases like Ebola as well as achieving universal healthcare, according to a new report by international healthcare experts and African leaders.", "title": "How community health workers can prevent the next Ebola", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/how-community-health-workers-can-prevent-next-ebola/2015-07-22", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,community engagement,community health workers,Ebola,Ebola virus,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,poverty,primary care,public health,United Nations", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9866\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:-download the report (pdf)-here's the blog postRelated Articles:5 ways community health worker programs can improve post-ACACommunity health workers reach patients doctors can'tU.S. looks to boost community health workers\nIt will take at least $3 billion to add the 700,000 community healthcare workers needed to adequately address Africa's healthcare needs, according to the report, \"Strengthening Primary Health Care through Community Health Workers: Investment Case and Financing Recommendations.\"\nNational efforts also will need to include leadership from the health ministries and engage communities in how to design health programs.\nThe health workers will need to be highly trained and skilled, and integrated into teams of nurses and other health workers from clinics in each nation's primary health system, two of the report authors noted in a blog post published by the Huffington Post.\nDeveloping a large cadre of highly trained community health workers (CHWs) in sub-Saharan Africa is key to stemming future outbreaks of deadly diseases such as Ebola as well as achieving universal healthcare, according to a new report by international healthcare experts and African leaders."}
