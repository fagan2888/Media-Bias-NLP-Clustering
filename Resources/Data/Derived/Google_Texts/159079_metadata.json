But perhaps the only point that\u2019s really been clarified thus far is that, as Digiday put it, \u201cIf you ask 10 people what clickbait means, chances are you\u2019re going to get 10 different answers.\u201d\n\nThe online intelligentsia do seem to agree that tease-iness has always been an integral part of the journalistic equation, but that headlines recklessly exploiting the \u201ccuriosity gap\u201d \u2014 the oft-considerable distance between what an article promises and what it actually delivers \u2014 can be pretty damn annoying. The classic example of this phenomenon is the heavily mocked headline style that made Upworthy both popular and a punch line (think of feeling singularly un-amazed after clicking on a \u201cWhat happened next will amaze you\u201d teaser). But such brazen gimmickry could only bewitch readers for a short time before they wised up, and the expiration date on the \u201clet\u2019s trick our readers\u201d strategy thankfully arrived a few months ago.\n\nThus clickbait \u2014 or whatever you want to call it \u2014 has now, in the manner of a hemorrhagic fever, evolved. It\u2019s finished with its low-hanging-fruit phase, and has attached itself to a new form of curiosity-gap exploitation, one that\u2019s more insidious, but no less irritating. The hallmark of this subtler iteration, as far as I can tell, is the phrase \u201cThe Real Reason.\u201d To wit:\n\nJennifer Garner reveals the real reason why she wanted her and @BenAffleck's daughters to take karate http://t.co/T3DQh2Mhtl @CBBVips \u2014 People Magazine (@people) November 21, 2014\n\nThe real reason no one hugs on Downton Abbey http://t.co/i7pC68PUR8 \u2014 VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) November 11, 2014\n\nKendall Jenner reveals the REAL reason she won't let her sisters come to the shows she walks: http://t.co/li2Bc6a4iX pic.twitter.com/o46HG5IGU3 \u2014 Harper's Bazaar (@harpersbazaarus) November 22, 2014\n\nThis headline construction may not read as bait-and-switch material at first blush, but make no mistake, it\u2019s a classic of the genre; it merely takes a less obvious tack than its clumsier ancestors. Rather than presenting a heretofore-unknown tale of amazing unbelievableness (\u201cThe Message This Veteran Wrote on a Restaurant Receipt Will Make You Cry \u2014 And Think\u201d), \u201cThe Real Reason\u201d gaslights readers into believing that their experience of the news has been an inauthentic one. In other words, instead of employing the traditional strategy of luring the reader with what turns out to be a moldy carrot, these headlines convince readers that the carrot they\u2019ve already eaten was moldy, and offers them a fresh new carrot, which turns out to be \u2014 oh, the humanity \u2014 covered in mold.\n\nA cursory search reveals a wide variety of such infractions. There\u2019s the pedestrian anecdote dressed up as a stunning revelation (\u201cThe Real Reason Steven Spielberg Never Directed a Bond Movie\u201d). There\u2019s the not-very-surprising epiphany disguised as a game-changer (\u201cThe Real Reason Pop Musicians Die Young\u201d). There\u2019s geopolitical obviousness dressed as counterintuitive wisdom (\u201cWhat\u2019s Really Behind Jerusalem\u2019s Explosion Of Violence?\u201d). And there\u2019s the knowledge-dropping explanation that most people probably could have just guessed (\u201cHere\u2019s the Real Reason Beyonc\u00e9 Doesn\u2019t Tweet\u201d). There are a million of these \u2014 many of them perfectly fine, even solid, articles that simply don\u2019t need to make a claim that they\u2019re advancing a revolutionary point of view.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not just the Upworthys of the world sneakily exploiting the curiosity gap.
