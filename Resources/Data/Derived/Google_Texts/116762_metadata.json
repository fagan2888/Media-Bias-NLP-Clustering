Rickard was a 2004 high-speed car chase that started with a routine traffic stop and ended with the police firing 15 rounds into the fleeing vehicle, killing both the driver, Donald Rickard, and his passenger, Kelly Allen, both unarmed. In 2012 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit ruled against the police, declaring that because it \u201ccannot conclude that the officers\u2019 conduct was reasonable as a matter of law,\u201d qualified immunity must be denied to the them. A majority of the Supreme Court now appears poised to call that verdict into question.\n\nThe fleeing driver \u201chas already gone 100 miles an hour,\u201d observed Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and then he tried to escape again. \u201cWhy would a reasonable officer not be suspicious that more reckless driving is going to occur?\u201d\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia expressed a similar view. Even assuming the most sympathetic set of facts in favor of Rickard, Scalia maintained, \u201cwe are still left with a very dangerous man careening down the road, who is surrounded by police cars and still tries to get away to continue his careening.\u201d\n\nGary K. Smith, the Memphis lawyer representing Rickard\u2019s family, conceded that \u201cMr. Rickard\u2019s conduct was unreasonable and he has culpability,\u201d but argued that the \u201cthreshold issue is should [the police] have used deadly force in that circumstance.\u201d Smith stressed that the presence of a passenger \u201cshould have been a factor in the reasonable officer\u2019s judgment about whether or not to initiate deadly force.\u201d\n\nBut that line of argument was promptly challenged by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \u201cWhat do you say clearly establishes that?\u201d she responded. Is there any case that says the police should not use deadly force \"when there is a passenger?\" Smith admitted he could point to no such case in support of his position.\n\nSmith also failed to gain traction for his theory that the police should have employed less-than-deadly force to stop the chase. \u201cYou can disable the car with the gun,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can shoot the tires.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a \u201cvery good question, why didn\u2019t they shoot the tires out?\u201d observed Justice Stephen Breyer. But the answer, Breyer continued, is \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d which means you cannot say \u201cit was clearly established that they had to shoot the tires out.\u201d In other words, because there was no case on the books requiring such tactics in lieu of deadly force, the officers were under no obligation to do so.\n\n\n\nSuch sharp questioning for the Rickard family attorney came as little surprise. When the Supreme Court last confronted the use of deadly force by the police to end a high-speed car chase, the justices voted eight-to-one in favor of the officer who rammed his cruiser into the fleeing vehicle, causing an accident that left the suspect paralyzed. \u201cA police officer\u2019s attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment,\u201d declared the majority opinion in Scott v. Harris (2007), \u201ceven when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.\u201d\n\nJudging by yesterday\u2019s oral argument, the spirit of that past ruling, though not the same legal principle underlining it, will likely guide the outcome of the present case.\n\nA ruling in Plumhoff v. Rickard is expected by June.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/03/05/supreme-court-appears-ready-to-rule-for", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "Qualified immunity will likely be extended to officers who used deadly force.", "title": "Supreme Court Appears Ready to Rule for Police in Deadly Car Chase"}, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. Supreme Court heard \noral argument on Tuesday in a case testing the reach of\nqualified immunity, a legal\ndoctrine designed to shield government officials from civil\nlawsuits \u201cinsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly\nestablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a\nreasonable person would have known.\" By the time the proceedings\ncame to a close, it looked as if a majority of the justices were\nprepared to vote in favor of the West Memphis, Arkansas, police\nofficers whose use of deadly force lay at the", "title": "Supreme Court Appears Ready to Rule for Police in Deadly Car Chase", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@damonroot"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2014-03-05T21:31:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/damon-w-root"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Is there any case that says the police should not use deadly force \"when there is a passenger?\"\nA majority of the Supreme Court now appears poised to call that verdict into question.\nSmith also failed to gain traction for his theory that the police should have employed less-than-deadly force to stop the chase.\nWhen the Supreme Court last confronted the use of deadly force by the police to end a high-speed car chase, the justices voted eight-to-one in favor of the officer who rammed his cruiser into the fleeing vehicle, causing an accident that left the suspect paralyzed.\nThe fleeing driver \u201chas already gone 100 miles an hour,\u201d observed Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and then he tried to escape again."}
