Our floor? Which room? \u201cIt\u2019s here! It\u2019s Mr. King!\u201d I hear Nora. She\u2019s in the pod next to mine.\n\nI walk back to her, fast, and see Susie coming down the hall, fast, too, with Randy behind her. Nora has already pulled the crash cart into the room and I see, quickly, Mr. King, a patient most of us have known for over two years, lying in bed not moving with a thin stream of blood running from his mouth down his chin onto his chest.\n\nMy focus narrows to what\u2019s right in front of me: the portable defibrillator is on the bed next to Mr. King. I grab the small plastic instrument we use to measure oxygen saturation and stick his finger into it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his pulse-ox?\u201d asks Nora.\n\n\u201cWaiting.\u201d The machine registers a horizontal line as it calculates Mr. King\u2019s oxygen level. \u201cSeventy-five percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cracking the cart, getting out a non-rebreather.\u201d That\u2019s Randy.\n\nI hear Susie say, \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d as I wrap the blood pressure cuff around his arm and start the machine so we can get his pressure.\n\nNora says, \u201cI dunno. I walked in and found him like this. Here\u2014you can record.\u201d She shoves a clipboard at Susie. \u201cWrite down everything that happens on this form.\u201d\n\nSusie\u2019s eyes widen, but she takes the clipboard and clicks her pen open.\n\nSuddenly the room floods with people: an ICU doc, nurses from the ICU, a respiratory therapist, an anesthesiologist. The code team has arrived.\n\nThis intensivist, Matt, is a friend. Despite not being any older than I am he\u2019s world-weary, but also whip smart with a well of compassion hidden beneath his hard edge. He stands by the opposite side of the bed, across from me, and our eyes briefly meet. Then he raises his voice above the loud buzz in the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with this patient? Who\u2019s the nurse?\u201d\n\nNora\u2019s good in codes. She rolls the information out like she\u2019d memorized it. \u201cDay one hundred \u2013 plus of a mud transplant, patient has GVH of the lungs and a fungal pneumonia, with increasing needs for oxygen. Alert and oriented with occasional moments of confusion, bed-bound due to weakness. Walked in this morning and saw him . . . like that, non-responsive. O2 sats 75 percent, so we put him on a non-rebreather.\u201d She points to the breathing apparatus now covering Mr. King\u2019s nose and mouth.\n\n\u201cHis sats now?\u201d\n\n\u201cEighty-eight percent on twelve liters.\u201d Twelve liters is the maximum amount of oxygen that device can give and 88 percent is far below normal, which hovers between ninety-five and one hundred percent.\n\n\u201cHeart rate?\u201d\n\n\u201cFifty,\u201d someone calls out as Matt flips through Mr. King\u2019s chart.\n\n\u201cPressure?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne hundred over eighty,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get some blood gases,\u201d he tells the respiratory therapist.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his pressure? And what\u2019s his platelet count?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne hundred over eighty,\u201d I say again, louder this time, but I\u2019m not sure Matt hears me over the ICU nurse calling out, \u201cWe have a bed! He can go to A222.\u201d\n\nNora also calls out at the same time, \u201cPlatelets are ten\u2014he\u2019s refractory. No HLAs available.\u201d With a platelet count of ten, people can bleed spontaneously, and although we\u2019ve been transfusing him regularly, his platelet count barely rises each time. (HLAs are platelets matched to Mr. King\u2019s blood, but we don\u2019t have any on hand. They can be hard to get.)\n\n\u201cDo I get to hear a blood pressure or not?\u201d Matt demands.\n\nI look at him and raise my voice. \u201cIt\u2019s one hundred over eighty,\u201d I say very loudly and he nods to himself. \u201cOK, we\u2019ll take that bed. Pack him up and move him out. He\u2019s stable enough to transfer\u2014we\u2019ll intubate him downstairs if we need to.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The emergency is over in 45 minutes, but this patient has taken a piece of my heart with him", "title": "\u201cIf you really like him, then wish for the family to put him on hospice\u201d: The first hard truth of this 12-hour shift", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The emergency is over in 45 minutes, but this patient has taken a piece of my heart with him", "title": "\u201cIf you really like him, then wish for the family to put him on hospice\u201d: The first hard truth of this 12-hour shift", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/20/if_you_really_like_him_then_wish_for_the_family_to_put_him_on_hospice_the_first_hard_truth_of_this_12_hour_shift/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/theresa_brown.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The emergency is over in 45 minutes, but this patient has taken a piece of my heart with him", "title": "\u201cIf you really like him, then wish for the family to put him on hospice\u201d: The first hard truth of this 12-hour shift", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/theresa_brown.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Theresa Brown", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, hospital, nursing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce15e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWaiting.\u201d The machine registers a horizontal line as it calculates Mr. King\u2019s oxygen level.\n(HLAs are platelets matched to Mr. King\u2019s blood, but we don\u2019t have any on hand.\nO2 sats 75 percent, so we put him on a non-rebreather.\u201d She points to the breathing apparatus now covering Mr. King\u2019s nose and mouth.\n\u201cHeart rate?\u201d\u201cFifty,\u201d someone calls out as Matt flips through Mr. King\u2019s chart.\nMy focus narrows to what\u2019s right in front of me: the portable defibrillator is on the bed next to Mr. King."}
