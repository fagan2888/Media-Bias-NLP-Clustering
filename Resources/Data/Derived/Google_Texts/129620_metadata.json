We think that voters just need to be reminded. In the 3\u00bd years since then, they haven\u2019t grown to trust this governor.\u201d\n\nThe party held the conference call to announce a new web ad intended to remind voters that Columbia/HCA, the hospital chain built by Scott into the nation\u2019s largest, pleaded guilty to widespread Medicare fraud in 2000 and ultimately paid fines totaling $1.7 billion \u2014 at the time, the largest fine for health care fraud in U.S. history.\n\nCrist has made the Medicare fraud charges a feature of his stump speeches, calling Scott \u201ca fraud\u201d and saying fraud characterizes Scott\u2019s business and political dealings.\n\nThe ad is based largely on a Scott deposition in 2000 in which he repeatedly cited his Fifth Amendment constitutional rights against self-incrimination in refusing to answer questions in a civil case linked to the Medicare fraud case.\n\n\u201cSeventy-five,\u201d says the ad. \u201cThat\u2019s now many times Rick Scott took the Fifth to avoid incriminating himself while his company was under investigation by the FBI.\n\n\u201cScott\u2019s company pled guilty, fined nearly $2 billion for Medicare fraud. Taxpayers got cheated, while he walked away with millions.\u201d\n\nScott was forced to resign as CEO of the company in 1997 but told reporters he got a severance package of $10 million, a consulting contract worth $5 million and $300 million worth of stock.\n\nAmong the findings of the investigation into the case were that HCA hospitals \u201cupcoded\u201d treatments, meaning they billed for similar but more costly procedures than those actually performed; shifted costs including salaries and administrative expenses from other areas onto Medicaid and Medicare treatments to inflate its billings; paid kickbacks to doctors for patient referrals; billed the government for costs including sports tickets, meals and country club dues, and billed for treatments and drugs that weren\u2019t covered.\n\nScott said during the 2010 campaign that he wanted to fight the charges in court but that the company forced him to resign and settled with the government.\n\n\u201cMistakes were made at the company, and as CEO I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes, and I do,\u201d he said in 2010. He attributed those mistakes to subordinates and said he should have had more auditors and closer oversight.\n\nIn response to the Democrats\u2019 new ad, the state Republican Party referred to a new web ad faulting Crist on a variety of issues.\n\nThe GOP ad criticizes Crist over college tuition, his support of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and increases in auto registration and other fees.\n\nAfter a 2010 campaign in which the fraud case was the Democrats\u2019 biggest single issue against Scott, Scott won narrowly over Democrat Alex Sink, with a margin of 1.2 percentage points.\n\nAsked after a recent appearance in St. Petersburg why he thinks the issue will have a different effect than in 2010, Crist said, \u201cI\u2019m going to talk about it more.\u201d\n\nHe also said not everyone knows about the case. Some \u201cvery intelligent voters\u201d are unaware of Scott\u2019s use of the Fifth Amendment, he said.\n\nArceneaux said this election will be different because, \u201cThe tea party bubble has long since burst and we are seeing that all over the country, not just in Florida. Second, Democratic grassroots are fired up and energized to beat Rick Scott in a way they just weren\u2019t in 2010.\u201d\n\nScott \u201cis not the unknown tea party outsider any longer. He has to actually run on his record and who he really is,\u201d Arce\u00adneaux said.\n\nSink said the party should use the issue again, calling it \u201cvery appropriate to remind voters of his record.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe ad is correct in saying Scott pleaded the Fifth Amendment 75 times in a deposition \u201cwhile his company was under investigation\u201d in 2000, but doesn\u2019t mention that the deposition wasn\u2019t about the fraud investigation that eventually led to the big fines. It was in a civil case with a company accusing Columbia/HCA of breach of contract, although lawyers for that company alleged the breach was related to the fraud.\n\nScott pleaded the Fifth Amendment 75 times because his lawyer had advised him not to answer any questions at all while the federal investigation was proceeding. He even refused to say whether he worked for Columbia/HCA.\n\nSome questions did relate to the fraud investigation, as when the opposing lawyer asked Scott whether the company\u2019s actions were \u201cdesigned to cover up or obfuscate Columbia\u2019s improper billing practices.\u201d\n\nIn a televised debate during the 2010 campaign, Scott said he pleaded the Fifth Amendment because the opposing lawyers were on \u201ca fishing expedition.\u201d\n\nBut critics said even that would be illegal because the Fifth Amendment is legally intended to be used only by those with an actual fear of self-incrimination.\n\nwmarch@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7761", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Mon, 09 Jun 2014 23:19:57 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 The Florida Democratic Party and likely Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist are seeking to revive the Medicare fraud case against the hospital chain once run by Rick Scott as", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 The Florida Democratic Party and likely Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist are seeking to revive the Medicare fraud case against the hospital chain once run by Rick Scott as", "title": "Dems may revive HCA fraud case against Scott", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/dems-may-revive-hca-fraud-case-against-scott-20140609/", "image": {"width": 2634, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140609/ARTICLE/140609235/AR/0/AR-140609235.jpg", "height": 1482}, "updated_time": "2014-06-09T23:19:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 The Florida Democratic Party and likely Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist are seeking to revive the Medicare fraud case against the hospital chain once run by Rick Scott", "title": "Dems may revive HCA fraud case against Scott", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140609/ARTICLE/140609235/AR/0/AR-140609235.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-06-09T23:19:57Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-06-09T23:19:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Charlie Crist,Medicare fraud,Rick Scott"}, "article_summary": "Crist has made the Medicare fraud charges a feature of his stump speeches, calling Scott \u201ca fraud\u201d and saying fraud characterizes Scott\u2019s business and political dealings.\nAfter a 2010 campaign in which the fraud case was the Democrats\u2019 biggest single issue against Scott, Scott won narrowly over Democrat Alex Sink, with a margin of 1.2 percentage points.\nThe Florida Democratic Party and likely Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist are seeking to revive the Medicare fraud case against the hospital chain once run by Rick Scott as an issue in the 2014 governor\u2019s race.\nThe ad is based largely on a Scott deposition in 2000 in which he repeatedly cited his Fifth Amendment constitutional rights against self-incrimination in refusing to answer questions in a civil case linked to the Medicare fraud case.\nSome \u201cvery intelligent voters\u201d are unaware of Scott\u2019s use of the Fifth Amendment, he said."}
