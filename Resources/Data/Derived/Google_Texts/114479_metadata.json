Yup.\n\nAnd who is making this rather outlandish claim? A bunch of blogs that you almost certainly have never heard of.\n\nThe original claim, as PolitiFact discovered, came from the site Freedom Outpost, which was triggered by a discovery in the ICD health codes. See, one section of the code goes through a list of \u201clegal execution,\u201d including capital punishment, hanging, shooting, and \u201cbeheading, decapitation (by guillotine).\u201d The issue here is not that Obamacare created it, but that the World Health Organization created it and Obamacare just embraces it in the U.S.\n\nSo PolitiFact decided to fact-check this claim, and obviously gave it a Pants on Fire rating, because again, this was around long before Obamacare. Another issue they found is that the beheading line is only \u201cfor the purposes of compiling death statistics\u201d across multiple countries, some of which have beheadings, some of which don\u2019t.\n\nWhich brings us to point number three: beheadings aren\u2019t legal in the U.S. anyway and there\u2019s no way it\u2019s happening anytime soon.\n\nNo state uses beheading. More importantly, as this summary makes clear, each state chooses its own method of execution, making the decision of what method to use beyond the reach for the federal government. The reason beheading is in the code at all is because it is a common method of execution in Saudi Arabia and some other countries, and is practiced by some militant and terrorist groups. So for an international coding system, beheading, for better or for worse, is needed.\n\n[photo via Shutterstock]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "PolitiFact, the oft-maligned fact-checking website, named President Obama's promise of getting to keep your health care if you like it as the biggest lie of", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Screen-Shot-2014-01-04-at-11.10.36-AM-650x440.png", "title": "PolitiFact Actually Fact-Checks Whether or Not Obamacare Will Lead to\u2026 Beheadings"}, "twitter": {"description": "PolitiFact, the oft-maligned fact-checking website, named President Obama's promise of getting to keep your health care if you like it as the biggest lie of 2013, but they're still debunking claims made by the other side about the bill, including, for some reason, a nutty conspiracy theory that Obamacare is actually going to lead to beheadings.
