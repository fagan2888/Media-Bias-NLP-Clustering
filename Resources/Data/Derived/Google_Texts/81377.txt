A Lenexa man has admitted he stabbed two men to death during a burglary at their home.

Alex Brune pleaded guilty Friday to two counts of first-degree murder in the July 2014 deaths of 47-year-old Brian Baskind and his stepfather, 79-year-old Clifford Preston at the men's home in Lenexa. Brune was scheduled to go to trial on Monday.

The Kansas City Star reports each count carries a sentence of life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. Prosecutors said they will ask that the sentences run consecutively when Brune is sentenced May 18.

One of the victims shot Brune during the altercation. Brune told police he had been kidnapped by a stranger and driven to the house, where he stabbed the men while trying to escape.
