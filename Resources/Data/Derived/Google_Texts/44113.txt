Alcorn State will face North Carolina A&T in the inaugural Celebration Bowl.

The Celebration Bowl pits the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference champion against the Southwestern Athletic Conference winner. The game takes place Dec. 19 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.

Alcorn State clinched its invite by winning the SWAC championship Saturday, 49-21 over Grambling State.

North Carolina A&T shared the MEAC title with Bethune-Cookman and North Carolina Central. North Carolina A&T got the bowl spot because of a higher Sagarin rating.
