However, they found an association between higher CEO pay and other aspects of hospitals, as well, with median compensation higher at bigger, more prominent providers. They also found that after adjusting for hospital class, CEOs of independent providers made about 19 percent more than those of health systems.\n\nHowever, the researchers also found an association between higher CEO compensation and lower performance on adjusted inpatient expenses and inpatient care complications. This seeming contradiction, the authors write, may indicate hospitals are improving their documentation or alternately, inconsistently reporting \"present on admission\" conditions.\n\nMoreover, the authors wrote, hospitals with higher-paid CEOs performed better on the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Value-Based Purchasing, suggesting the program has prompted hospital boards to incorporate individual clinical measures into CEO pay.\n\n\"Further study of the contradictory association between higher compensation and higher expense is required to identify the cause,\" the report states. \"Heavy investment in computerized patient record systems, physical plant renovation, purchase of physician practices and investments to address the requirements of the Affordable Care Act between the years 2011 and 2013 have had an impact on hospital expense and may be driving these results.\"\n\nHealthcare executive pay ranked third in growth last year across eight industries, FierceHealthcare previously reported, as well as overall compensation. Over the last year, their compensation bucked an overall trend of sluggish growth in chief executive officer and chief financial officer pay across other publicly-traded companies.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the report (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHealthcare comes in third in executive pay growth\n\nDespite slow growth for other industries, healthcare leader pay continues to climb\n\nHow healthcare CEO salaries hurt consumers\n\nSecrets to achieving consumer-centric care\n\nTop health insurance CEO pay exceeds $10 million in 2014\n\nIt may be time to revamp how insurers pay their CEOs\n\nAverage pay for insurer CEOs jumped to $14M\n\nHospital CEOs--not doctors--among medicine's top earners", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nonprofit hospitals with highly-paid CEOs score better on performance measures overall, but have higher rates of inpatient care complications and inpatient expenses,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new report.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthFinance", "description": "Nonprofit hospitals with highly-paid CEOs score better on performance measures overall, but have higher rates of inpatient care complications and inpatient expenses,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new report.", "title": "Nonprofit hospital CEOs earn more--but don't always deliver better outcomes", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthfinance.com/story/compare-nonprofit-hospital-ceo-salary-and-patient-outcomes/2016-01-29", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthfinance.jpg", "type": "website"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "CEO compensation,HR & Workforce Management,independent hospitals,nonprofit hospitals,Operations & Business Management,Truven Health Analytics,Value-Based Purchasing Program", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "\"Further study of the contradictory association between higher compensation and higher expense is required to identify the cause,\" the report states.\nHowever, the researchers also found an association between higher CEO compensation and lower performance on adjusted inpatient expenses and inpatient care complications.\nHowever, they found an association between higher CEO pay and other aspects of hospitals, as well, with median compensation higher at bigger, more prominent providers.\nThey also found that after adjusting for hospital class, CEOs of independent providers made about 19 percent more than those of health systems.\nMoreover, the authors wrote, hospitals with higher-paid CEOs performed better on the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Value-Based Purchasing, suggesting the program has prompted hospital boards to incorporate individual clinical measures into CEO pay."}
