Scalia, 79, was the court\u2019s conservative leader and his death means it is now more likely that key EPA rules that aim to curb climate pollution from the power industry will be upheld.\n\nHere\u2019s how the sudden shakeup of the court could affect global efforts to combat climate change.\n\nAntonin Scalia.\n\nCredit: Shawn/Flickr\n\nWhat Does the Supreme Court Have to do with the U.N.?\n\nFollowing decades of failed efforts to meaningfully regulate greenhouse gas pollution through the U.N., a new approach to tackling climate change was agreed to by international negotiators during December\u2019s landmark meetings in Paris.\n\nThe cornerstone of the Obama administration\u2019s pledge in Paris was the Clean Power Plan, designed to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. Importantly, the sweeping set of rules that the EPA finalized last year bypassed Congress, which is opposed to passing laws regulating greenhouse gas pollution.\n\nBut coal companies and some two dozen states have sued, arguing that the plan violates federal law. Their legal challenge is expected to eventually reach the Supreme Court.\n\nThe outcome of the lawsuit could affect the entire planet. The U.S. (along with China) is one of the two biggest greenhouse gas polluters, and American and Chinese commitments in Paris to reduce climate pollution in the years ahead \u2014 largely by reducing the use of heavily polluting coal \u2014 were critical to convincing other nations to do likewise.\n\nThe Paris agreement was struck during the hottest year on record. Rising levels of climate pollution have pushed temperatures up by about 1\u00b0C (nearly 2\u00b0F) on average and raised sea levels 8 inches since the 1800s.\n\nPres.

He was expected to rule against the new EPA rules. But Scalia couldn\u2019t do that singlehandedly \u2014 he was just one of nine justices.\n\nLast week, Scalia and four other justices ruled to \u201cstay\u201d the Clean Power Plan while litigation moves forward. The 5-4 ruling effectively put a freeze on the new EPA rules while the lawsuit is heard by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.\n\nThat appeals court is a liberal one, and it\u2019s expected (but not guaranteed) to uphold the new EPA rules, before routine appeals send the case to the Supreme Court.\n\nLast week\u2019s ruling suggested to many onlookers that the Supreme Court might make a similar ruling on the Clean Power Plan case, striking down the rules. If that happens, the U.S. would be left without a credible plan for fulfilling its pledge to reduce its climate pollution by a little more than a quarter in 2025 compared with 2005 levels.\n\nThe Paris Agreement is based heavily on trust. It relies on voluntary measures by governments working together to strive to reforest lands, reduce agricultural pollution and, most importantly, to replace energy from fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives. Because of that cooperative new approach to climate action, the effects of last week\u2019s ruling were felt around the world.\n\nGambia environment minister Pa Ousman Jarju told ClimateWire that last week\u2019s ruling was \"a big setback\u201d for the Paris agreement. Navroz Dubash, a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research in India, told the New York Times that a Supreme Court ruling against the Clean Power Plan \u201ccould be the proverbial string which causes Paris to unravel.\u201d\n\nBecause of its direct effects on America\u2019s polluting electricity sector, and its indirect effects on other nations, the Clean Power Plan case could possibly shape the future of the planet, its weather and its shorelines.\n\nThe court is now down to eight justices. If the rulings from those justices on the legality of the Clean Power Plan match their rulings from last week, the outcome would be a 4-4 verdict. Such a scenario would uphold the looming ruling from the federal appeals court.\n\nMight a New Justice Rule Against Clean Power Plan?\n\nThe Paris Agreement was designed to encourage the adoption of solar power and other types of clean energy.\n\nCredit: Mexican presidency/Flickr\n\nTechnically, yes. Realistically, that\u2019s very unlikely.\n\nIt\u2019s the president\u2019s job to nominate Supreme Court justices for any vacancies, and it\u2019s the Senate\u2019s job to vet and approve them. High-stakes wrangling over the appointment of the next justice will be a major focus of Obama\u2019s final year as president.\n\nWhatever the outcome, it\u2019s unlikely that Obama would nominate a justice who would oppose his landmark climate rules.\n\n\u201cIn the environmental realm, as in many others, a number of key Supreme Court decisions over the past decade or more have been 5-4 decisions,\u201d said Robert Stavins, an expert on international climate diplomacy at Harvard University.\n\nUnless approval of a new justice and a Supreme Court ruling on the Clean Power Plan are both delayed until a Republican becomes president, it seems unlikely that the nation\u2019s new climate rules will be struck down.\n\n\u201cIf the late Justice Scalia is replaced by an Obama appointee this year, or a Clinton or Sanders appointee after January 20th, the implications will be profound,\u201d Stavins said. \u201cAn obvious example is the litigation regarding the Clean Power Plan.\u201d\n\nIt won\u2019t be clear for many years yet what effect the Paris Agreement will have on global warming.\n\nBut Scalia\u2019s passing means the pact seems safer now than was the case just several days ago.\n\nYou May Also Like:\n\nMild Winter Keeps Great Lakes Ice Cover Low\n\nCO2 Emissions Are Causing Earth to \u2018Hyperventilate\u2019\n\nStudy: Downpours Over Land Have Slowed Sea Level Rise", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scalia's passing makes it unlikely new climate rules will be struck down, protecting Paris climate pact.", "og": {"image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://assets.climatecentral.org/images/made/2_14_16_upton_scalia_600_315_s_c1_c_c.jpg", "height": 315}, "title": "What Scalia\u2019s Death Means For Climate Change"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scalia's passing makes it unlikely new climate rules will be struck down, protecting Paris climate pact.", "title": "What Scalia\u2019s Death Means For Climate Change", "image": "http://assets.climatecentral.org/images/made/2_14_16_upton_scalia_600_315_s_c1_c_c.jpg", "creator": "@johnupton", "site": "@climatecentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "RepostUsAPIKey": "5fecfdbc7abba92a63dd2fe9faddcd49", "date": "2016-02-14", "keywords": "climate change, global warming, climate scientist, global warming facts, causes of global warming, effects of global warming, global climate change, agw, anthropogenic global warming, climate change facts, recent climate change", "news_keywords": "climate change, global warming, climate scientist, global warming facts, causes of global warming, effects of global warming, global climate change, agw, anthropogenic global warming, climate change facts, recent climate change"}, "article_summary": "What Scalia\u2019s Death Means For Climate ChangePublished: February 14th, 2016Just days after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling clouded the future of a new United Nations climate pact, the passing of one of its justices has boosted the pact's chances of succeeding.\nCredit: Rick Bajornas, UN/FlickrHow Could a Judge\u2019s Death Affect Clean Power Plan Ruling?\nWhatever the outcome, it\u2019s unlikely that Obama would nominate a justice who would oppose his landmark climate rules.\nLast week, Scalia and four other justices ruled to \u201cstay\u201d the Clean Power Plan while litigation moves forward.\nRising levels of climate pollution have pushed temperatures up by about 1\u00b0C (nearly 2\u00b0F) on average and raised sea levels 8 inches since the 1800s."}
