The program recently touted its ability to slash rates of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections, which the hospitals accomplished by isolating infected patients, requiring healthcare workers to treat them using personal protective equipment, and bathing them in a specialized antiseptic.\n\nFor the Hospital Microbiome Project, scientists began by collecting DNA data while the hospital's new Center for Care and Discovery was under construction, then documented how the building's microscopic life changed once it opened. They then focused on 10 patient rooms spanning two floors, using sensors to measure bacterial growth.\n\nThough the scientists are still analyzing the data, they already have discovered a whole host of factors that affect the kinds of bacteria patients encounter in hospitals--including ventilation, humidity levels, the type of material countertops and other surfaces are made of, and even the presence of windows and cellphones.\n\nWith this data, the researchers hope they can eventually alter patient rooms to lessen exposure to dangerous pathogens and heighten exposure to protective bacteria. \"We could make the hospital itself into a treatment for the patient,\" Emily Landon, an infection-control epidemiologist from the University of Chicago, told the newspaper.\n\nThe CDC hopes to replicate the four Chicago hospitals' CRE-control success at other U.S. hospitals in its effort to slash CRE infection rates by 50 percent, part of a larger, White House-driven initiative to aggressively curb the threat of such superbugs. All types of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are an ever-present issue in the healthcare industry, particularly as federal financial incentives encourage organizations to reduce preventable harms and cut down on readmissions. A 2013 report also served as a major call to action, as it found that medical errors--including HAIs--are the third-leading cause of death in the United States.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCDC looks to Chicago hospitals' example in battle against superbugs\n\nHospital medical errors now the third leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\nMany hospitals will face steep hospital-acquired infection penalties\n\nWhite House plan calls for aggressive measures against superbugs\n\nCDC urges hospital action to stop deadly bacteria\n\nAntibiotic stewardship can curb rise of deadly superbugs\n\nHospital-acquired conditions more likely for patients admitted on weekends", "article_metadata": {"description": "The University of Chicago's new Center for Care and Discovery plays host to the Hospital Microbiome Project, a three-year program in which scientists study how facility design and environmental factors affect patient-threatening bacteria.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The University of Chicago's new Center for Care and Discovery plays host to the Hospital Microbiome Project, a three-year program in which scientists study how facility design and environmental factors affect patient-threatening bacteria.", "title": "Can facility design cut down on hospital-acquired infections?", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/can-facility-design-cut-down-hospital-acquired-infections/2015-04-29", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "antibiotic-resistant bacteria,antibiotic-resistant infections,Care Delivery,hospital-acquired infections (HAIs),Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,preventable infections,University of Chicago", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "When it comes to the fight against hospital-acquired infections, the Windy City appears to be squarely on the front lines.\nAll types of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are an ever-present issue in the healthcare industry, particularly as federal financial incentives encourage organizations to reduce preventable harms and cut down on readmissions.\nTo learn more:- read the articleRelated Articles:CDC looks to Chicago hospitals' example in battle against superbugsHospital medical errors now the third leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\"We could make the hospital itself into a treatment for the patient,\" Emily Landon, an infection-control epidemiologist from the University of Chicago, told the newspaper.\nThe University of Chicago's new Center for Care and Discovery plays host to the Hospital Microbiome Project, a three-year program in which scientists study how facility design and environmental factors affect patient-threatening bacteria, according to the Wall Street Journal."}
