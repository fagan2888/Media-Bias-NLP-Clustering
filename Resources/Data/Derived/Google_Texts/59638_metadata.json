There is actually research backing this up, and now insurers and advocacy groups are targeting mothers in an attempt to get more young people enrolled in health insurance plans.\n\nThe New York Times investigated the trend, and found that insurers are desperate to enroll young, healthy people to offset the costs of the sick. And with Obama's proposal that may extend existing health plans for adults, the young and healthy are more valuable than ever.\n\nHere's what some of the insurers and advocacy groups are doing:\n\nThe AARP made a series of e-cards that offer a compromise on motherly nagging in exchange for getting an insurance plan:\n\nObama's election campaign team, now called Organizing for Action, made this spot to get parents to have a talk with their kids about getting insured. The ad's main character is relieved to find out \"the talk\" is just about health insurance and not a revelation that his parents are in a cult, or got matching tattoos, etc.:\n\nThe Thanks Obamacare campaign from a couple of Colorado nonprofits (responsible for the infamous \"Brosurance\" ad) also released this gem. A bro is thankful his mom got him to sign up for health insurance after his buddy somehow managed to accidentally bash his skull in with a golf club:\n\nIt's not the first time moms have been the target of an insurance campaign for young adults. In 2007, the Massachusetts government mailed out greeting cards around Mother's Day promoting the state health care plan.\n\nThese Obamacare ads will be in circulation throughout the holiday season, banking on the Obama campaign's promise to clean up the mess from the Affordable Care Act's disastrous launch that has kept most Americans from using the federal insurance marketplace.\n\nRead the full Times piece here.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Richard Feloni", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Insurers and advocacy groups are targeting moms this holiday season in hopes they'll make their young adult children sign up for health insurance.", "creator": "RichFeloni", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/obamacare-advocacy-groups-target-moms-2013-11", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5294c3376bb3f7c30edca209-506-253/insurers-are-targeting-moms-to-nag-you-into-signing-up-for-obamacare.jpg", "title": "Insurers Are Targeting Moms To Nag You Into Signing Up For Obamacare", "site": "BI_Advertising", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "advertising,politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Health Insurance, Advertising, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Advocacy, Richard Feloni", "description": "Insurers and advocacy groups are targeting moms this holiday season in hopes they'll make their young adult children sign up for health insurance.", "author": "Richard Feloni", "sailthru.date": "2013-11-26", "sailthru.title": "Insurers Are Targeting Moms To Nag You Into Signing Up For Obamacare", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5294c325eab8ea0757daa651-50-50/insurers-are-targeting-moms-to-nag-you-into-signing-up-for-obamacare.jpg", "news_keywords": "Health Insurance, Advertising, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Advocacy, Richard Feloni", "tbi-image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5294c325eab8ea0757daa651/insurers-are-targeting-moms-to-nag-you-into-signing-up-for-obamacare.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2013-11-26", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/richard-feloni"}, "sailthru.description": "Insurers and advocacy groups are targeting moms this holiday season in hopes they'll make their young adult children sign up for health insurance.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Insurers and advocacy groups are targeting moms this holiday season in hopes they'll make their young adult children sign up for health insurance.", "title": "Insurers Are Targeting Moms To Nag You Into Signing Up For Obamacare", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/obamacare-advocacy-groups-target-moms-2013-11", "image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5294c3376bb3f7c30edca209-1190-625/insurers-are-targeting-moms-to-nag-you-into-signing-up-for-obamacare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Insurers Are Targeting Moms To Nag You Into Signing Up For Obamacare", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5294c325eab8ea0757daa651/insurers-are-targeting-moms-to-nag-you-into-signing-up-for-obamacare.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "advertising"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdccec\"", "article_summary": ":The Thanks Obamacare campaign from a couple of Colorado nonprofits (responsible for the infamous \"Brosurance\" ad) also released this gem.\nThere is actually research backing this up, and now insurers and advocacy groups are targeting mothers in an attempt to get more young people enrolled in health insurance plans.\nNo matter how old people get, they still turn to their moms for advice when they're stuck in a difficult situation.\nA bro is thankful his mom got him to sign up for health insurance after his buddy somehow managed to accidentally bash his skull in with a golf club:It's not the first time moms have been the target of an insurance campaign for young adults.\nAnd with Obama's proposal that may extend existing health plans for adults, the young and healthy are more valuable than ever."}
