But if she couldn\u2019t have beaten that forlorn bunch she should have suspended her campaign immediately.\n\n\n\nOn stage were five candidates with a median age of 65, and the only current office holder isn\u2019t even a Democrat, but rather an independent socialist who called for \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d \u2013 and was seconded!\n\n\n\nHere was Clinton facing an even weaker field than Mitt Romney in 2012 \u2013 which is saying something \u2013 with the added advantage that her supposed rivals spent as much time praising her as they did offering oblique, usually embarrassed, criticisms.\n\n\n\nWhile Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 fans no doubt liked what they heard about redistributing the stuffing out of Wall Street and moving toward a Scandinavian-style system (seriously), his biggest moment of the night came when he absolved Clinton of her current scandal surrounding secret servers, hidden emails and classified information \u2013 rendering it dead and buried as a consideration for her primary rivals.\n\n\n\nBut they may not even be rivals anymore, if they ever were.\n\n\n\nThe former senators, Lincoln \u201cThe Block\u201d Chafee and Jim \u201cFather Time\u201d Webb, were at the wrong debate. Webb was talking about the benefits of coal, gun rights and battlefield valor in Vietnam and Chafee playing up spending controls and tax cuts \u2013 they might as well have been speaking Mandarin.\n\n\n\nMartin O\u2019Malley tried to confront Clinton, but appeared instead to be running for America\u2019s assistant principal, exuding his disappointment in a condescending tone. Depending on what O\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign costs to run and what he can raise, he can presumably hang in until the Iowa caucuses hoping for the weather to change. But we were not looking at the man who was going to break the Clinton machine.\n\n\n\nUnless Vice President Joe Biden gets into the race \u2013 which looks less likely after the thumping Clinton delivered to her foes and her recent uptick in the polls \u2013 Clinton is getting back on the coronation track.\n\nBut how she\u2019s going about it matters.\n\n\n\nClinton\u2019s central talking point of the night was her own gender. Americans want an outsider not an insider? She\u2019s outside the male gender, amirite sisters? Her difference from Obama: XX chromosome, y\u2019all! Why was she late getting back from the potty? Lady stuff, Anderson. You wouldn\u2019t understand\u2026\n\n\n\nSo that\u2019s not going to cut it.\n\n\n\nLike Romney in 2012, she lacks the trust or passion of her party\u2019s base. So like him, she has to shackle herself to unpopular or electorally dangerous stances on issues in a bid to secure a win.\n\n\n\nThere was plenty of loose talk about topics \u2013 gun control, global warming, crime and bank regulations, to name four \u2013 that would be fine fodder for general election attack ads and talking points.\n\n\n\nAnd most of all, Clinton embraced the idea of running for a third Obama term. That helps keep Biden on the sidelines, but will be a drag with persuadable voters next year.\n\n\n\nIf things are coming to a quick conclusion, she still has time to un-flip some of the flops, or at least scale them back. But if Biden burns more time on the clock and Sanders and his army keep the pressure on \u2013 and one can expect they will \u2013 she will have to wait awhile.\n\n\n\nAnd the longer she has to wait to pivot, the more ungainly it will be.\n\n\n\nBernie rakes in $1.3 million post-debate - WaPo: \u201cThe presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said it raised $1.3 million Tuesday in the four hours after the Democratic debate began. Sanders appears to have successfully parlayed his most-talked about moment during the debate \u2014 telling Hillary Rodham Clinton that \u2018the American people are sick and tired of talking about your damn e-mail\u2019 \u2014 into a sharp uptick in donations.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Watch Fox: New Fox News poll numbers release on President Obama\u2019s job rating during \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d 6 p.m. ET]\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026\n\nHear, hear! New Yorker: \u201cLike many canonized works, [Henry David Thoreau\u2019s \u2018Walden\u2019] is more revered than read, so it exists for most people only as a dim impression retained from adolescence or as the source of a few famous lines: \u2018I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately.\u2019 \u2018If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.\u2019 \u2018Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity!\u2019 Extracted from their contexts, such declarations read like the text on inspirational posters or quote-a-day calendars \u2013 purposes to which they are routinely put. Together with the bare facts of the retreat at Walden, those lines have become the ones by which we adumbrate Thoreau, so that our image of the man has also become simplified and inspirational. In that image, Thoreau is our national conscience: the voice in the American wilderness, urging us to be true to ourselves and to live in harmony with nature. This vision cannot survive any serious reading of \u2018Walden.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

As New Analytics predicted in Friday\u2019s edition of The Edge, press and public interest in Fiorina had plummeted as the glow of her debate victory faded.\n\n\n\nBut Fiorina ranks in the top five candidates of those people would \u201cdefinitely vote for\u201d at 30 percent, with 22 percent saying they need more information about her before deciding. She also hits a high mark of people who \u201cmight vote for\u201d her at 35 percent. Fiorina still has room to grow, and voters like her.\n\n\n\nAnd with the campaign announcing they raked in $6.8 million, outpacing Sen. Marco Rubio, she will have the funds to do it. Fiorina lands in third place for fundraising totals among totals released so far. And her campaign is spending carefully. She even flies coach.\n\n\n\nFiorina ends her hot streak with more money, better poll position and stronger organization than she began it. If she gets another good run in this month\u2019s debate, she could really be ready to capitalize. And best of all for her, her boom was not followed by a bust as is so often for candidates in the early going.\n\n\n\nJeb gets top N.H. Republican - WMUR: \u201cOne of the state\u2019s highest ranking Republican elected officials will endorse Jeb Bush for president on Wednesday, WMUR.com has learned. State Senate President Chuck Morse, R-Salem, will formally reveal his presidential choice when he introduces the former Florida governor at a town hall\u2026 Morse is known as a fiscal hawk, but at the same time a pragmatic lawmaker who is open to compromise.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Act now and they will throw in a set of steak knives - WSJ: \u201cIn a sign of the fierce competition for new donors in the Republican presidential race, a major party fundraiser backing Jeb Bush is inviting potential supporters to meet the candidate at a reception at a private country club in Greenwich, Conn. \u2013 for free. \u2018Come meet Jeb Bush as my guest,\u2019 reads the e-mail from Leora Levy, who serves on the finance committees of the Republican National Committee and the party\u2019s Senate and House fundraising arms.]\n\n\n\nWHITHER OBAMACARE?\n\nDavid Drucker wonders:\u201cHave Republicans given up on getting rid of Obamacare? It\u2019s a poignant question when Donald Trump, the GOP presidential front-runner, supports the concept of nationalized, government-administered health care. Meanwhile, candidates with detailed plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have gained little traction for their effort. One, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, remains a long shot in the race; another, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, dropped out for lack of support soon after unveiling his proposal. \u2018I would put Obamacare at the top of a list of issues that are simmering below the surface,\u2019 Jindal campaign pollster Wes Anderson said Tuesday. \u2018It\u2019s going to be an issue.\u2019 That appears to be the consensus of Republicans working in the trenches \u2014 that GOP primary voters will eventually get around to prioritizing where the 2016 contenders stand on President Obama\u2019s landmark overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system.\u201d\n\n\n\nPOWER PLAY: RYAN, HOUSE GOP BALK AT SHOTGUN WEDDING\n\nAs Rep. Paul Ryan mulls a movement to draft him as speaker of the House, will Republicans unite or is more tribal bloodshed about to be spilled? Chris Stirewalt has the details, in just 60 seconds. WATCH HERE\n\n\n\nPEAK FLORIDA: GATOR BITE DUCT TAPED\n\nWKMG: \u201cSEVILLE, Fla. - A hunter who fell off his boat was bitten by a 12-foot alligator in Volusia County, officials say. \u2026 The incident occurred Sunday morning on Lake George in Seville. Volusia County fire officials said Kemp Galleneau suffered a bite to his leg around 9:45 a.m. near the 1600 block of Lake George Road. According to officials, Galleneau had a legal tag for the gator and had it next to his boat when he fell overboard. Galleneau was bitten on the left calf by the gator, which was at least 12 feet long. Dusty McDevitt and his son, Corey Beckington, 13, \u2026 were hunting for alligators on a different boat than Galleneau. The father and son then rushed over to help. They said they duct taped the man\u2019s leg and brought over the now dead gator to the shore.\u201d\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
