“Tom and Jerry” cartoons for Amazon Prime Instant Video subscribers are now reportedly carrying a warning that they may depict scenes of “ethnic and racial prejudice.”

Amazon’s streaming subscription service includes the cartoons, some made more than 70 years ago, in its comedy collection, BBC News reported.

But “Tom and Jerry: The Complete Second Volume” is accompanied by the caution: “Tom and Jerry shorts may depict some ethnic and racial prejudices that were once commonplace in American society. Such depictions were wrong then and are wrong today.”

The Hanna-Barbera cartoon featuring a hungry cat and a wily mouse was first produced by the MGM film studio in 1940 with a series of 114 shorts that ran until 1957.

The cartoon’s depiction of a black maid was a point of concern, as well as its representation of women, glamorization of smoking, racial stereotypes and even cannibalism, the Daily Mail reported. When the original versions were shown on U.S. television in the 1960s some scenes were edited, BBC reported.

“Tom and Jerry” fans took to Twitter to express their confusion over the warning.

“Watched Tom and Jerry since the 60s this is the 1st time I’ve ever heard the R word in relation to it. PC madness!” one user tweeted, the Daily Mail reported.

“Old Tom and Jerry cartoons to carry warnings of ‘racial prejudice’. Give me strength. I am a foreigner in a culture I no longer understand,” another said.
