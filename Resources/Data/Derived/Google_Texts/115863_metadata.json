(Photo: USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nWelcome to One Nation, Reno.\n\nIt\u2019s your chance to be heard nationally on issues that matter in the 2016 presidential election. RGJ Media has partnered with the USA TODAY NETWORK to bring one of 10 live discussions about the issues to Reno on Feb. 11.\n\nYour $10 ticket will get you free beer and a discussion about health care that includes national experts on insurance, technology and health care and medical marijuana.\n\nOur goal is to help you cut through the noise of this year\u2019s election, be smarter about the topics we know you care about and engage with democracy. Rock the Vote will be on site to help you register to vote \u2013 if you haven\u2019t already.\n\nThe event, which began at 6 p.m. at Cargo in Whitney Peak, is sponsored locally by Renown and St. Mary\u2019s.\n\nSee what people are saying about the event on Twitter:\n\nWhile we\u2019re talking health care here in Nevada, other cities will delve into different topics. For example, experts will talk climate change in Palm Springs, Calif.; the economy and jobs in Detroit and immigration in Phoenix.\n\nOur discussion here will include the Affordable Care Act, but it also will look to the future. And that includes millennials, a generation that could significantly affect health care policies in the years to come.\n\nDon\u2019t let this election cycle pass you by. Democracy depends on it.\n\nShow up, engage. It\u2019s our chance to be part of the national #OneNation conversation.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rgj.com/1WSI5HP", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "It\u2019s your chance to be heard nationally on issues that matter in the 2016 presidential election.", "og": {"site_name": "Reno Gazette Journal", "description": "It\u2019s your chance to be heard nationally on issues that matter in the 2016 presidential election.", "title": "One Nation: Tonight, it's your turn to be heard on health care", "url": "http://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/29/one-nation-come-talk-health-care-and-why-matters-election/79543104/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/rgj.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s your chance to be heard nationally on issues that matter in the 2016 presidential election.", "title": "One Nation: Tonight, it's your turn to be heard on health care", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/52ba954c8fd0a86c5a94a8438328d15a9f2cc0a2/c=91-0-691-600&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/29/RenoGroup/RGJ/635896921170675216-One-Nation.jpg", "creator": "@rgj", "site": "@rgj", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=805729789", "fb": {"app_id": 178959168788968}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3270\"", "article_summary": "Your $10 ticket will get you free beer and a discussion about health care that includes national experts on insurance, technology and health care and medical marijuana.\nAnd that includes millennials, a generation that could significantly affect health care policies in the years to come.\nSee what people are saying about the event on Twitter:While we\u2019re talking health care here in Nevada, other cities will delve into different topics.\nRGJ Media has partnered with the USA TODAY NETWORK to bring one of 10 live discussions about the issues to Reno on Feb. 11.\n(Photo: USA TODAY NETWORK)Welcome to One Nation, Reno."}
