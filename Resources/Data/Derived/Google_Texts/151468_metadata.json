Matthew Levitt, Washington Institute Counterterrorism program director, joins Simon Constable to discuss. Photo: AP\n\nTHE Abbott government is set to introduce new anti-terror laws that could finally see political parties like Hizb ut-Tahrir banned in Australia.\n\nThe laws would be introduced in the next fortnight. The changes would broaden the definition of terrorism to supporting or advocating terrorism generally, as opposed to a specific act or incident.\n\nThe move is in response to the growing threat the Abbott government believes Australia faces from homegrown jihadists who are travelling to Syria and Iraq and may return to engage in acts of terrorism.\n\nThis is likely to lead to authorities banning Hizb ut-Tahrir, a party that supports the resumption of the \u201cIslamic way of life in the world\u2019\u2019 in Australia.\n\nUthman Badar, a spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir in Australia, said yesterday successive governments had threatened to shut down the organisation but none had proved successful to date.\n\nAustralian Khaled Sharrouf posing with an AK-47 in front of a sports car from an undisclosed location within Iraq. Picture: Twitter\n\nMr Badar said the definition of terrorism was \u201ccomplex\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe working definition turns on this idea of violence for political, religious ends. That applies equally to the Australian government\u2019s war in Afghanistan,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBy that definition the entire invasion was an act of terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe crackdown by the government comes as terrorist Khaled Sharrouf has again used social media to urge Australians to join the fight in Syria and Iraq, declaring \u201cwe live better than we lived in our country\u2019\u2019.\n\nPosing in front of a white sports car, holding an AK-47 and wearing military clothes, Sharrouf, a member of the terrorist group Islamic State, has encouraged Australian Muslims to join the fight.\n\n\u201cMy provisions are beneath the shade of my sword. We live better than we lived in our country,\u2019\u2019 Sharrouf wrote.\n\n\u201cCome and be a part of what we have dreamt for decades.\u201d\n\nThe notorious terrorist\u2019s call to arms follows threats against Australian soldiers and calls to \u201ccrucify\u2019\u2019 an Australian jihadist from a rival group.\n\nSharrouf, who recently posted a horrific image of himself smiling while crouching over an executed Iraqi, also retweeted another user, who stated: \u201cI hope the real mujahideen ... capture some yahoodis and behead them. That would be some start to Ramadan.\u2019\u2019", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "THE Abbott government is set to introduce new anti-terror laws that could finally see political parties like Hizb ut-Tahrir banned in Australia.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/new-terror-laws-to-ban-jihadist-parties-such-as-hizb-uttahrir/news-story/617c93f0de519f8d785425778c5f7568", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f1f5e5e06733a2e3b76d0b2dd9e4790a", "type": "article", "description": "THE Abbott government is set to introduce new anti-terror laws that could finally see political parties like Hizb ut-Tahrir banned in Australia.", "title": "New laws to ban Jihadist parties"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dailytelegraph", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f1f5e5e06733a2e3b76d0b2dd9e4790a", "description": "THE Abbott government is set to introduce new anti-terror laws that could finally see political parties like Hizb ut-Tahrir banned in Australia.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "New laws to ban Jihadist parties"}, "robots": "noarchive", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/617c93f0de519f8d785425778c5f7568?domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"}, "articleid": "617c93f0de519f8d785425778c5f7568", "keywords": "Political Editor, Australian government, sports car, Australian jihadist, terrorist group, notorious terrorist, terrorist organisation, Australian soldiers, Convicted terrorist, rival group, growing threat, social media, wearing military clothes, successive governments, religious ends, working definition, horrific image, real mujahideen, Islamic way, executed Iraqi, anti-terror laws, white sports car, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Australia, Israel, Matthew Levitt, Uthman Badar", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-05T12:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-07-05T10:26:11.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Photo: APTHE Abbott government is set to introduce new anti-terror laws that could finally see political parties like Hizb ut-Tahrir banned in Australia.\nThis is likely to lead to authorities banning Hizb ut-Tahrir, a party that supports the resumption of the \u201cIslamic way of life in the world\u2019\u2019 in Australia.\nUthman Badar, a spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir in Australia, said yesterday successive governments had threatened to shut down the organisation but none had proved successful to date.\nThe changes would broaden the definition of terrorism to supporting or advocating terrorism generally, as opposed to a specific act or incident.\nAustralian Khaled Sharrouf posing with an AK-47 in front of a sports car from an undisclosed location within Iraq."}
