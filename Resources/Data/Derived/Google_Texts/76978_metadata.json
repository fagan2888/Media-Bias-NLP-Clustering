Experts say that preterm births, described as the delivery of infants more than three weeks earlier than their expected due date, results in the majority of infant deaths. Babies that survive premature births face a higher risk of respiratory problems, cerebral palsy, and hearing loss later in life.\n\nWhile the United States\u2019 health care system surpasses that of most developing countries, the infant mortality rate stands at six deaths for every 1,000 births; rates that eclipse that of Finland, Japan, Portugal, Sweden, the Czech Republic, and Norway. National maternal death rates in the U.S. \u2014 along with that of seven other countries \u2014 have also increased within a decade, despite significant spending on maternal healthcare services.\n\nA closer look at national statistics reveals racial and social disparities in healthcare that negatively impact women of color, particularly those in African American and Native American communities. The rate of maternal deaths among African American women triples that of their white counterparts. In recent years, research has shown linkages between the poor health of newborns and unresolved chronic health issues \u2014 including heart disease, stroke, depression, diabetes, and smoking.\n\nA recent U.S. government study also showed that hospitals in communities of color fall short in encouraging breastfeeding to women in their maternity clinics. Up to a year of nursing after childbirth ensures that babies gain long-term health benefits and stave off a host of illnesses \u2014 including juvenile diabetes, sclerosis, heart disease, and cancer, ailments that affect people of color disproportionately.\n\nDr. Deborah Campbell, director of neonatology at Children\u2019s Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City told MedicineNet.com that these disparities in prenatal care often set families back for at least four generations.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. lags behind other developed countries because there remain significant gaps in access to and utilization of prenatal and preconception care,\u201d said Campbell. \u201cThere is a well-delineated history of racial and ethnic disparities in maternal and infant outcomes in the U.S., with black women and their infants being at greatest risk and having the highest rates of poor outcomes.\u201d\n\nSome mothers of color could find a solution in the maternity and preventative care services available to them under the Affordable Care Act. Before the passage of what\u2019s known as Obamacare, less than five percent of insurance carriers included maternal health services. Now women can receive prenatal care \u2014 which includes checkups and prenatal testing \u2014 without incurring any out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhile there\u2019s cause for celebration, some public health experts like Elizabeth Dawes Gay say that Obamacare may not go far enough in relieving the stress of life as a black woman in the United States.\n\nIn a 2013 piece published at RH Reality Check, Gay suggests that effectively addressing maternal health disparities among women of color requires addressing less conspicuous causes of social and economic inequality that perpetuate structural inequality. These factors, designated as \u201csocial detriments\u201d by the World Health Organization, include \u201cconditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsurance coverage of health-care services is only a small part of a larger and more complex equation that\u2026includes the built environment, community context, economic stability, and education,\u201d Gay wrote. \u201c[D]isparities in adverse outcomes such as low infant birth weight have increased, and disparities in maternal death remain the same, despite advances in medical technology and an improved health-care infrastructure.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\u201cThe U.S. lags behind other developed countries because there remain significant gaps in access to and utilization of prenatal and preconception care,\" experts warn.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\u201cThe U.S. lags behind other developed countries because there remain significant gaps in access to and utilization of prenatal and preconception care,\" experts warn.", "title": "The Infant Mortality Rate In The U.S. Is Too High", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/09/26/3572712/us-prenatal-care-infant-mortality/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_111643082.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cThe U.S. lags behind other developed countries because there remain significant gaps in access to and utilization of prenatal and preconception care,\" experts warn.", "title": "The Infant Mortality Rate In The U.S. Is Too High", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_111643082-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_111643082.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_111643082.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-26T11:26:42+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf82a\"", "article_summary": "Health The Infant Mortality Rate In The U.S. Is Too High CREDIT: ShutterstockPremature births and deaths of babies before their first birthday have driven up the United States\u2019 infant mortality rate, which now surpasses that of 25 European and developed nations, according to a newly released U.S. government report.\nBefore the passage of what\u2019s known as Obamacare, less than five percent of insurance carriers included maternal health services.\nWhile the United States\u2019 health care system surpasses that of most developing countries, the infant mortality rate stands at six deaths for every 1,000 births; rates that eclipse that of Finland, Japan, Portugal, Sweden, the Czech Republic, and Norway.\nNow women can receive prenatal care \u2014 which includes checkups and prenatal testing \u2014 without incurring any out-of-pocket costs.\nNational maternal death rates in the U.S. \u2014 along with that of seven other countries \u2014 have also increased within a decade, despite significant spending on maternal healthcare services."}
