In the contest over specifics, the Ohio governor and former House Budget Committee chairman, is a distant third.\n\nYesterday, GOP presidential hopeful John Kasich told The Washington Post editorial board that he should be elected because he is the candidate of ideas. \u201cSee, I am a fundamental believer in ideas. If you don\u2019t have ideas, you got nothing. \u201d\n\nAt least when it comes to taxes, GOP rivals Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have got far more than Kasich. In the contest over specifics, the Ohio governor and former House Budget Committee chairman, is a distant third. And what we do know about his plan suggests that it too would add trillions of dollars to the national debt, despite his claims to being a fiscal conservative.\n\nAt the Post session, columnist Catherine Rampell complained that it was impossible to measure the budgetary effects of his tax proposals because he\u2019s disclosed so few specifics.\n\nRecommended: Presidential candidates and the economy: What are their views?\n\nKasich countered that he\u2019d put out sufficient detail:\n\n\u201c[The individual income tax rates are] 28, 25, 10 with an earned income tax credit and fewer deductions. Deductions for state and local taxes and charity. That\u2019s what the plan is. Okay? It\u2019s not \u2013 I mean, what more do you need? I can tell you what the rates are. I mean, what\u2019s so difficult about this? That\u2019s the outline of it. What else do we need?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m so glad you asked, governor. Besides tax rates, voters also need to know what income would be taxed (the base) and the income levels at which the different rates take effect. If the tax base is close to current taxable income, it\u2019s a sure bet that Governor Kasich\u2019s plan would lose trillions of dollars, since he\u2019d cut the current top rate from 39.6 percent to 28 percent.\n\nYet Kasich\u2019s two-page description of his plan leaves a lot unspecified. It says he\u2019d keep the mortgage interest and charitable deductions. In his meeting with the Post, he added the state and local tax deduction to his list of untouchables. He says he\u2019d otherwise \u201csimplify\u201d the Tax Code. But what does that mean when he\u2019d preserve three of the biggest deductions?\n\nHe\u2019s been silent on other big individual tax preferences such as the exclusions for contributions to health insurance and retirement accounts. He\u2019d cut the top long-term capital gains tax rate from 20 percent to 15 percent. But what about dividends?\n\nWhat about the Alternative Minimum Tax or the income tax surtaxes that partially finance the Affordable Care Act. What about other complexities in the tax code like the limitation on itemized deductions and the personal exemption phaseout? Would he increase the standard deduction as Cruz and Trump would?\n\nAfter determining the tax base and rates, we also need to know what credits he would allow. Like Cruz, Kasich would increase the Earned Income Tax Credit (albeit by half as much). What, if anything, would he do with other tax credits for children, child care, adoption, energy conservation, and so on?\n\nGiven what we know so far, there\u2019s no reason to think that Kasich\u2019s plan is any more fiscally responsible than his opponents\u2019 (notwithstanding his frequent chiding of them on this score).\n\nFor instance, not only would he cut rates on ordinary income and capital gains and preserve big tax deductions, he\u2019d also repeal the estate tax. On the business side, he\u2019d cut rates, allow businesses to immediately deduct the costs of new investment, double the credit for research and experimentation, and exempt new foreign profits of multinationals from U.S. tax. It\u2019s worthwhile discussing the advantages and disadvantages of these proposals, but they\u2019d all reduce tax revenues.\n\nIn a campaign filled with name-calling, Kasich has laudably avoided personal attacks. Great! Now he says he wants to be the candidate of ideas. He should start with a detailed tax plan.\n\nThis article first appeared in TaxVox.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "89f1adfec12ca741b4bfcfdca1870eda", "sailthru.author": "Leonard Burman", "description": "At least when it comes to taxes, GOP rivals Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have far more ideas than Kasich.
