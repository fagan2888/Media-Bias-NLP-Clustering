The association is calling on the Administration to take a further step and support restoring over-the-counter (OTC) medicines\u2019 eligibility under tax-preferred accounts including FSAs and health savings accounts (HSAs). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) included a provision that removed OTC medicine eligibility under FSAs and HSAs unless the non-prescription medicine is purchased with a doctor\u2019s prescription.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the Administration for its efforts to revisit options that serve in the best interest of consumers meeting their healthcare needs,\u201d CHPA President and CEO Scott Melville said. \u201cWhile the recent announcement allowing consumers to roll over as much $500 in their flexible spending arrangements is a step in the right direction, more must be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are calling on Congress and the Administration to lift the restrictions on consumers\u2019 ability to use tax-preferred accounts to purchase OTC medicines that millions rely on for their healthcare needs,\u201d continued Melville. \u201cReversing this restriction and restoring eligibility of OTC medicines under FSAs and HSAs is a straightforward step that will assist American families in securing affordable healthcare.\u201d\n\nCHPA strongly supports the bipartisan, bicameral Restoring Access to Medication Act (S. 1647/H.R. 2835) introduced by Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) in the Senate and Reps. Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.) and John Barrow (D-Ga.) in the House of Representatives. The association\u2019s letter urged the Administration to support this measure that would provide flexibility for American families to again utilize these medications in the most cost-effective, tax-efficient way and to work with Congress to restore this important consumer benefit.\n\nCHPA is the 132-year-old trade association representing U.S. manufacturers and distributors of over-the-counter medicines and dietary supplements.\n\nchpa.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "The makers of over-the-counter medicines are calling on the Administration to support a fix to the Affordable Care Act's &quot;Medicine Cabinet Tax.&q", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "http://www.businesswire.com/images/BWLogo_750.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "twitter": {"description": "The makers of over-the-counter medicines are calling on the Administration to support a fix to the Affordable Care Act's &quot;Medicine Cabinet Tax.&q", "title": "CHPA Calls for Repeal of ACA&rsquo;s &lsquo;Medicine Cabinet Tax&rsquo;", "image": {"src": "http://mms.businesswire.com/media/20131115005600/en/392441/5/Infographic_Four_Final_013112.jpg"}, "site": "@businesswire", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-15", "p": {"domain_verify": "95725e0359a14c2e1ccbd936e10d20d6"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb3e\"", "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act (ACA) included a provision that removed OTC medicine eligibility under FSAs and HSAs unless the non-prescription medicine is purchased with a doctor\u2019s prescription.\nThe association is calling on the Administration to take a further step and support restoring over-the-counter (OTC) medicines\u2019 eligibility under tax-preferred accounts including FSAs and health savings accounts (HSAs).\nCHPA is the 132-year-old trade association representing U.S. manufacturers and distributors of over-the-counter medicines and dietary supplements.\n\u201cWe applaud the Administration for its efforts to revisit options that serve in the best interest of consumers meeting their healthcare needs,\u201d CHPA President and CEO Scott Melville said.\nand Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) in the Senate and Reps.
