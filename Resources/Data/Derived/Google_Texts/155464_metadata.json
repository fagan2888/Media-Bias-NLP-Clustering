Bush\u2019s language waging war on \u201cevil doers,\u201d and that\u2019s a development that should trouble us all. Yes, Obama avoided the word \u2018war,\u2019 but the rest of his team soon embraced it, and the logic of his address made that move virtually inevitable, whatever he may personally and privately have wished.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t erase every trace of evil from the world, and small groups of killers have the capacity to do great harm,\u201d Obama said \u2014 a typical, and laudable, example of his nuance and restraint. But unfortunately, its main purpose was anything but nuanced: to firmly establish the black-and-white evil enemy frame: \u201cISIL is a terrorist organization, pure and simple,\u201d Obama continued. \u201cAnd it has no vision other than the slaughter of all who stand in its way.\u201d\n\nNo one can doubt that ISIS is murderous \u2014 just like Syria\u2019s President Bashar al-Assad, last year\u2019s No. 1 candidate for America\u2019s wrath. But it\u2019s simply untrue that ISIS has \u201cno other vision\u201d than slaughter. Their vision of an Islamic state \u2014 a new Caliphate \u2014 may be many things: delusional, presumptuous, contrary to true Islamic values and obviously cruel. But it certainly is a vision of sorts, and it has some appeal, if only to a tiny, disaffected fragment of the world\u2019s Islamic community.\n\nIf we don\u2019t understand that vision \u2014 and what people find attractive in it \u2014 then we really have very little chance of effectively fighting against it, even though ISIS now commands only a few thousand fighters. We may win lots of battles, but not the war. Even if we defeat ISIS itself, but don\u2019t understand its appeal, it will only a reappear in another, potentially even more deadly form, just as ISIS now appears more malignant than al-Qaida. This is particularly true if we ignore the multilayered network of historical grievances which ISIS seeks to exploit.\n\nOn the other hand \u2014 and this is crucial \u2014 if we do take the time to try to understand \u201cpure evil,\u201d we will inevitably discover things about it, which can ultimately help us defeat it.\n\nThis is not, as some might would suggest, a namby-pamby liberal view of the world. It comes directly out of Sun Tzu\u2019s \u201cArt of War\u201c: \u201cIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\u201d\n\nNeocons have always relentlessly mocked those who questioned their knee-jerk resort to mindless violence. Predictably, the most toxic form this accusation took was at the hands of Karl Rove, back in 2005, when he said, \u201cConservatives saw the savagery of 9/11 in the attacks and prepared for war. Liberals saw the savagery on 9/11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers.\u201d As is usual with Rove, there are multiple threads of lies and misdirections contained in this statement. What\u2019s tragic about Obama\u2019s most recent actions is how deeply they reflect Rove\u2019s wildly dishonest worldview, even though he would surely reject it consciously.\n\nPerhaps the easiest lie to point out is that conservatives were preparing for war before 9/11 \u2014 not against bin Laden, but against Saddam Hussein, as revealed in the planning agenda of Dick Cheney\u2019s energy task force, which Rachel Maddow highlighted in her documentary, \u201cWhy We Did It.\u201d As for 9/11 itself, it presented nothing like a classic case for war: we were not attacked by a military, or by anyone with a military. Simply put, there was no state for us to attack, except by threatening Afghanistan for not turning over the criminals who attacked us. The situation now remains unchanged: ISIS is not a state, despite its claims, and adopting the framework of war only plays into its deluded fantasy. It helps strengthen, legitimate and perpetuate the evil we face, not defeat it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The way to battle ISIS long-term is to understand its appeal and retain our humanity.
