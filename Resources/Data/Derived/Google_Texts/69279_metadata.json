This will be the final budget request of his presidency, and is expected to adhere to the discretionary spending levels put in place by the two-year budget deal (PL 114-74) agreed to last fall.\n\nThe President\u2019s budget will echo many of the elements he will highlight in his final State of the Union (SOTU) Address this week, which the White House has said will be focused on big-picture items rather than simply a list of policy priorities. Both the SOTU and the budget request are expected to address the President\u2019s recent efforts on gun control and Syrian refugees, and may include a push for additional actions on the environment. While the President\u2019s budget will be dead-on-arrival on Capitol Hill, given Republican control of both Houses of Congress, it will set a roadmap for Administration priorities leading into the election year.\n\nThe release of the President\u2019s budget will kick off the FY 2017 appropriations process, which is expected to begin soon in the House. House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price (R-GA) intends to mark up a budget resolution this spring, as Republicans look to get the appropriations process back on track. House and Senate Republicans passed a concurrent budget resolution last year, but the appropriations process stalled as Senate Democrats blocked any individual appropriations bills from coming to the floor. Despite already having top-line discretionary spending numbers for FY 2017, how that spending is allocated among the appropriations bills will be at issue.\n\nAdditionally, Congressional Republicans are expected to again use the budget reconciliation process, which is not subject to a 60-vote threshold in the Senate, to send Republican priorities to the President\u2019s desk. President Obama vetoed the FY 2016 budget reconciliation bill last week, which would have repealed large parts of the Affordable Care Act and restricted Planned Parenthood funding for one year.\n\nThis Week\u2019s Hearings:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d6f837a0-a8b5-43d4-aa55-c3471b399a5e", "image": "http://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-facebook.png", "description": "The White House recently announced they will release the President\u2019s budget request for FY 2017 on February 9.
