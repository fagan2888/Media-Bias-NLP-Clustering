Vermillion, SD

A group of Vermillion students have been hired to help move every piece of classroom furniture from Vermillion High School into another building as workers forge ahead with an improvement project in the 50-year-old school.



The Equalizer reports the school board in Vermillion has hired 10 students at the rate of $8.50 an hour to empty the high school building after the last day of classes scheduled for May 20. The students will carry the furniture and other materials to the new Career and Technical Education building, where they'll remain for the summer.



The high school building is undergoing a $4.9 million renovation that includes upgrades to its heating, ventilation, air conditioning and water systems. The renovation began in mid-April with asbestos abatement in the school's tunnels.
