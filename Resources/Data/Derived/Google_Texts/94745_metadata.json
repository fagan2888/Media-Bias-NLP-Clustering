Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have been at odds over the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal that would include the U.S. and 11 other nations.\n\nWarren, other Democrats and unions have slammed the deal as being secretive, helping wealthy corporations and hurting U.S. workers, reported CNN.\n\nWarren also opposes giving the TPP \"fast track\" status, which would not allow Congress to make any changes before voting on it, noted USA Today.\n\nHowever, President Obama went on the offensive on MSNBC on Tuesday night (video below):\n\nI love Elizabeth. We\u2019re allies on a whole host of issues, but she\u2019s wrong on this. Chris, think about it. I\u2019ve spent the last six and half years yanking this economy out of the worst recession since the great depression. Every single thing I\u2019ve done from the Affordable Care Act to pushing to raise the minimum wage to making sure that young people are able to go to college and get good job training to what we\u2019re pushing now in terms of sick paid leave. Everything I do has been focused on how do we make sure the middle class is getting a fair deal. Now I would not be doing this trade deal if I did not think it was good for the middle class. And when you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is, when you dig into the facts, they are wrong.\n\nWarren fired back on Wednesday and challenged President Obama to reveal those facts to the American public.\n\nWarren tweeted, \"The Obama Admin says I'm wrong - we shouldn't worry about TPP. So why can\u2019t the American people read the deal?\"\n\nWarren also wrote on her blog:\n\nThe Administration says I\u2019m wrong \u2013 that there\u2019s nothing to worry about. They say the deal is nearly done, and they are making a lot of promises about how the deal will affect workers, the environment, and human rights. Promises \u2013 but people like you can\u2019t see the actual deal.\n\n\n\nFor more than two years now, giant corporations have had an enormous amount of access to see the parts of the deal that might affect them and to give their views as negotiations progressed. But the doors stayed locked for the regular people whose jobs are on the line.\n\n\n\nIf most of the trade deal is good for the American economy, but there\u2019s a provision hidden in the fine print that could help multinational corporations ship American jobs overseas or allow for watering down of environmental or labor rules, fast track would mean that Congress couldn\u2019t write an amendment to fix it. It\u2019s all or nothing.\n\n\n\nBefore we sign on to rush through a deal like that \u2013 no amendments, no delays, no ability to block a bad bill \u2013 the American people should get to see what\u2019s in it.\n\nSources: USA Today, MSNBC, Twitter, ElizabethWarren.com, CNN\n\nImage Credit: Tim Pierce", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "description": "President Obama and Democrat Sen.
