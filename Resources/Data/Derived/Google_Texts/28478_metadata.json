And it's customers couldn't be more happy.\n\n\"My bus benches have been a great part of our advertising program,\" said Diane Freeman, a State Farm agent.\n\n\"Waverly does a quality job.\" Dr. Joe Battaglia, of Battaglia Chiropractic Health Centre, said his patients comment on his bench signs all the time, adding, \"It sells.\"\n\nAnd Pat Snead of Pat's Riverfront Cafe, added, \"Bench Advertising really helps people find our business\"\n\nEagle Eye Dental in Edgewater and Fox Mattress in Holly Hill are just a couple of examples of diverse local companies advertising on the hundreds of park benches throughout Volusia County with Port Orange-based Waverly Media.\n\nAnd while the cost of large outdoor billboards and TV advertising is prohibitive for many small business owners is prohibitive, and with print newspapers continuing to see rapid declines in readership and line ads, more and more of these small business owners are finding ways to market their businesses and products where the price is right and an audience is paying attention: Park benches and internet news.\n\nRamara Garrett, an owner of Waverly Media, answered without hesitation: \"People driving in their cars see the benches -- the eye-catching ads. And a lot of people are turning to the internet and HeadlineSurfer.com headlines and images are very much eye catchers. I love the hard-hitting news that Headline Surfer\u00ae is not afraid to report on greater Daytona Beach and throughout Central Florida.\"\n\nRamara Garrett, an owner of Waverly Media, answered without hesitation: \"People driving in their cars see the benches -- the eye-catching ads.

People drive and they surf the web.\"\n\n\"I'll probably run again for something and when I do, I know my advertising dollars will be best spent with the park benches and internet news,\" Kennedy said, \"because these are what the public is looking at while going about their daily routines.
