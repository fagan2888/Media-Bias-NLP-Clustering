The prospect of more Mideast casualties was assured when Israeli launched a ground offensive in the Gaza Strip after efforts to arrange a cease-fire between the Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nYet there was a ray of hope elsewhere at week\u2019s end with the announcement that the U.S. and its negotiating partners had agreed to extend nuclear negotiations with Iran for four months rather than allowing the talks to collapse as a Sunday deadline neared.\n\nStill, there\u2019s no guarantee of overcoming stubborn differences with Iran and reaching a final agreement. Obama also will have to find a way to stave off pressure from members of Congress, including some fellow Democrats, who see the extension as a stalling tactic by Iran and are anxious to further penalize Tehran.\n\n\u201cIncreased economic pressure would strengthen our hand, but the administration opposes it,\u201d said Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cIt should welcome congressional efforts to ratchet up the economic pressure on Iran.\u201d\n\nThe cascade of overseas developments comes as the American public\u2019s views about Obama\u2019s foreign policy have soured, turning what was once seen as his strength into a potential liability. For a second-term president already hamstrung on the domestic front, the world stage hardly looks like the refuge it sometimes has offered leaders in their final White House years.\n\nObama has said repeatedly that a world in turmoil demands American leadership, but this burst of new challenges is showing the limits of that leadership.\n\nFresh American economic sanctions on Russia couldn\u2019t stop the missile attack on the Malaysian Airlines plane, which U.S. officials believe was carried out by pro-Kremlin separatists aided by Moscow. Obama was also unable to persuade the European Union to join him in penalties aimed at Russia\u2019s most powerful economic sectors, settling instead for more tepid EU actions that strained efforts to portray a united Western front against Vladimir Putin\u2019s government.\n\nIn the Middle East, Israel began its assault in Gaza despite objections by the U.S. and the prospect of mounting civilian casualties.\n\nThe urgent international issues add to the pile of foreign policy challenges already causing headaches for the White House: Syria\u2019s persistent civil war, the rise of Sunni extremists in Iraq, China\u2019s increased aggression in territorial disputes in Asia.\n\nThe White House insists the U.S. is better off under Obama\u2019s foreign policy leadership, citing as one example his commitment to ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that he inherited from President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cI think that there have been a number of situations in which you\u2019ve seen this administration intervene in a meaningful way that has substantially furthered American interests and substantially improved the tranquility of the global community,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.\n\nObama and his advisers have tried to project a measured approach to dealing with the deepening instability. Obama stuck to plans to hold fundraisers in New York and a transportation event in Delaware on Thursday, after the plane was downed and Israel began military operations. Obama also carried on with plans to spend the weekend at Camp David, the presidential retreat in the Maryland mountains.\n\nThe strategy reflects the view of the White House that there is a danger in presidents believing they are presiding over circumstances or events that dwarf the challenges faced by their predecessors. Such thinking, Obama\u2019s aides say, can lead to overreach as presidents think that extraordinary measures are required and that their decisions can bypass the normal checks and balances.\n\nTo Obama\u2019s critics, that approach smacks of timidity and restraint that have left both foes and friends more willing to dismiss his warnings as empty threats.\n\nFor a brief moment over the past few days, it appeared the White House was on offensive, not just reacting to world events.\n\nObama\u2019s remarks Wednesday on the world\u2019s complexity and challenges came as he announced the most stringent American economic sanctions yet against Russia for its threatening moves in Ukraine. The package of penalties took aim at some of Russia\u2019s most powerful banks, energy entities and defense companies, and received grudging praise from Republicans.\n\nBut within 24 hours, the landscape shifted on Obama again, as reports of the downed plane surfaced.\n\nThere is some hope among Obama aides that if a Russian role in the tragedy is proved, it may push European leaders to take the tough action against Moscow they have resisted. But presidential advisers also know that the questions of additional costs and consequences will be pointed back at Obama as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The cascade of international crises this week comes as the American public's views about President Obama's foreign policy have soured, turning what was once seen as his strength into a potential liability.
