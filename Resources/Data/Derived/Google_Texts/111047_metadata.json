As noted, the DSMB plans to conduct \"a full analysis of safety and treatment benefit-risk ratio of all patients enrolled to date (3,234) with a focus on serious adverse events related to allergic reactions.\"\n\nNow what: There's obviously a lot of promise behind REG1 as it targets a wide audience of acute coronary syndrome patients and could give physicians the ability to up- and down-regulate anticoagulation properties to avoid potential bleeding incidents in patients while also protecting them from potentially deadly blood clots.\n\nHowever, beyond REG1 Regado's pipeline is fairly thin. It has REG2, a venous thrombosis-fighting therapy that just began phase 1 studies and REG3, a preclinical anti-platelet candidate. Therefore, if there are concerns about REG1's safety this early on in its extensive phase 3 study then Regado's valuation, should REG1 not succeed or be proven too dangerous relative to its benefits profile, may likely take a major hit \u2013 perhaps even bigger than today's drop. With no partner on this project, and now plenty of questions raised regarding REG1's safety, I believe you have all the makings of a stock you should keep your distance from.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "12:57", "description": "Regado delivers", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_single-control_50", "author": "Sean Williams", "promo": "Regado delivers \"heart-stopping\" news to investors regarding its lead anti-thrombotic drug REG1.", "twitter": {"title": "Why Regado Biosciences Inc.
