The President\u2019s action, both unilateral and unconstitutional, was an affront to everyone pursuing the life of freedom and opportunity in America the right way.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, in a statement on February 17 about the court ruling.\n\n\u201cThe government claims sole authority to govern in the area of immigration, and has exercised that authority by promulgating a complex statutory scheme and prohibiting any meaningful involvement by the states\u2026.However, the government has decided that it will not enforce these immigration laws as they apply to well over five million people, plus those who had their applications [to enter the program] denied. If one had to formulate from scratch a fact pattern that exemplified the existence of [a state\u2019s right to sue] due to federal abdication, one could not have crafted a better scenario.\u201d\n\n\u2013 U.S. District Judge Andrew S. Hanen, in his 123-page decision on February 16, explaining his ruling to temporarily block the new federal government\u2019s policy of deferring deportation of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. for a period of years.\n\nWE CHECKED THE CONSTITUTION, AND\u2026\n\nTo the Founders who wrote the American Constitution, the concept of \u201cabdication\u201d was more familiar to them as what sometimes happened when an English king or queen gave up the crown, under pressure or to hand it on to a favored successor. But the Founders were familiar with the idea of dereliction of duty, and they wrote into the basic document an obligation that would be binding on every president who would thereafter serve.\n\nThat duty is spelled out in Article II, Section 3, declaring that the president \u201cshall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d Execution of the laws, they understood, was different from enactment of them; legislating was the duty of Congress. But, over time, \u201cexecution\u201d has come to be understood as leaving the president with some discretion \u2013 perhaps a lot of discretion \u2014 about how to enforce the laws passed by Congress. Indeed, in modern times, presidents have actually signed some legislative bills into law, and simultaneously announced that they would interpret them in ways that did not infringe upon presidential powers. (Right now, for example, the Supreme Court is weighing what to make, constitutionally, of a decision by President George W. Bush in refusing to carry out a law passed by Congress to allow American citizens who were born in Jerusalem to list Israel on their passports as their place of birth \u2013 even though Congress had explicitly mandated that.)\n\nWhen the state of Texas and 25 other states sued President Obama to challenge his announced new policy of refusing to deport between four and five million individuals living illegally in this country, the states\u2019 strongest claim was that the President had, in fact, failed to \u201cfaithfully execute\u201d the nation\u2019s immigration laws \u2013 laws which, in fact, demanded that every one of those individuals be deported to their home countries. That was the basis of their argument that Obama had violated the Constitution.\n\nIf the federal judge in Brownsville, Texas, who was assigned to decide that case had accepted that argument, it would, indeed, mean that Obama had adopted an unconstitutional policy. The judge explicitly chose, in order to avoid an unnecessary decision on a basic constitutional question, not to rule on that point. Even so, Judge Hanen found a way to get at the \u201cabdication\u201d theory that lay behind the states\u2019 constitutional argument.\n\nHe declared that, if the federal government owes a duty to protect the citizens of the United States from the harmful effects of illegal immigration (and he ruled that it did have such a duty, assigned by Congress), the states could bring a lawsuit to seek to compel the national government to perform that duty. In other words, they could get into court with their challenge, but not necessarily win on their constitutional argument.\n\nAlong the way, Judge Hanen used language that indicated his clear sympathy with the abdication argument, even as he refrained from finding the President\u2019s policy to be unconstitutional. Instead, taking a legally very narrow approach, the judge decided that \u2013 at this point \u2013 it seemed clear that the states were likely to win their case ultimately on a theory that the new immigration policy was not put into place by the proper procedural route. That was not a constitutional decision, and, moreover, it was not a sign that the President had abdicated his duty as the chief enforcer of the nation\u2019s laws. The conclusion, though, was sufficient to lead the judge to impose a temporary ban on enforcement of much of the new policy, while the states\u2019 lawsuit moves on to a full trial.\n\nThe Obama Administration has already signaled that it will appeal the judge\u2019s order. And, while the states surely will resist that appeal, they will not be in a position during that process to press again their claim of unconstitutional \u201cabdication\u201d by the President. Appeals courts are confined to reviewing the conclusions of what trial courts actually decided, not the arguments that parties made but were left unresolved.\n\nEven so, as this legal struggle moves forward, to whatever end, Americans should be prepared to hear more of the challengers\u2019 argument that the President has acted in a way that actually violated the Constitution \u2013 as both the Texas governor and the state\u2019s attorney general did in their statements in praise of Judge Hanen\u2019s ruling. Americans should recognize that as a political argument, not a constitutional one \u2013 at least in the context of this lawsuit.\n\nRecent Stories On Constitution Daily\n\nConstitution Check: Is the President\u2019s new immigration policy already a constitutional dead letter?\n\n50 interesting facts about Abraham Lincoln\u2019s life\n\nA controversial order leads to internment camps\n\nJefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln: Dueling inaugural addresses\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "Lyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center's constitutional literacy adviser, explains why the debate over a federal judge's ruling against President Obama's immigration policy is more of a p...", "title": "Constitution Check: Is the President\u2019s new immigration policy already a constitutional dead letter?", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2015/02/constitution-check-is-the-presidents-new-immigration-policy-already-a-constitutional-dead-letter/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/obamadrones.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/obamadrones.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-19T11:05:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-19T11:27:48+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/lyle-denniston/"}, "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd335a\"", "article_summary": "Recent Stories On Constitution DailyConstitution Check: Is the President\u2019s new immigration policy already a constitutional dead letter?\nShare:EmailLyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center\u2019s constitutional literacy adviser, explains why the debate over a federal judge\u2019s ruling against President Obama\u2019s immigration policy is more of a political argument, and not a constitutional one.\nEven so, Judge Hanen found a way to get at the \u201cabdication\u201d theory that lay behind the states\u2019 constitutional argument.\nAmericans should recognize that as a political argument, not a constitutional one \u2013 at least in the context of this lawsuit.\nThe judge explicitly chose, in order to avoid an unnecessary decision on a basic constitutional question, not to rule on that point."}
