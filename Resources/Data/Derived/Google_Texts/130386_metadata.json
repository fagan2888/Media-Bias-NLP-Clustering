Most of those people accessed their new coverage by either signing up for Medicaid or purchasing a private plan on Obamacare\u2019s new marketplace, the two major policies involved in the health reform law\u2019s coverage expansion. Now, a full 95 percent of the state population is insured.\n\n\u201cA change in the uninsurance rate like this is pretty much unprecedented in Minnesota,\u201d Julie Sonier, a researcher at the University of Minnesota\u2019s State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC) and a co-author of the new report, told the Star Tribune.\n\nThe only state that now has a lower uninsurance rate than Minnesota is Massachusetts, which enacted its own state-level health reform in 2007. Massachusetts\u2019 law served as somewhat of a model for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt really confirms the wisdom of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton (D) said in response to the news. \u201cPeople who have been knocking this the whole time really now need to look at the facts. This has been tremendously successful and it\u2019s going to get better.\u201d\n\nThe new report on Minnesota\u2019s uninsurance rate is the first state-level data of its kind to attempt to assess the immediate impact of the Affordable Care Act. The results fall in line with previous national surveys that have attempted to extrapolate the potential impact of health reform; last month, Gallup found that the national uninsurance rate plunged to a record low after Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment period.\n\nIn Minnesota, about two-thirds of uninsured residents qualified for public health programs but hadn\u2019t signed up. Getting the word out about Obamacare during its highly publicized enrollment period helped educate more people about their health care options.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the uninsurance rate is falling the fastest in states like Minnesota that have embraced the tenets of health care reform \u2014 including setting up their own state-run marketplaces and expanding their Medicaid programs. Meanwhile, the GOP-controlled states that have refused to do anything to work toward implementation have left their residents confused about how the law could actually benefit them. And the Republican leaders that continue to resist Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion are leaving millions of impoverished Americans without any access to affordable insurance whatsoever.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The number of uninsured people in Minnesota has plunged to the lowest level in state history.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The number of uninsured people in Minnesota has plunged to the lowest level in state history.", "title": "Thanks To Obamacare, Minnesota\u2019s Uninsurance Rate Has Dropped 40 Percent", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/06/12/3448100/obamacare-minnesota-uninsurance/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/get-ready-to-get-covered.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The number of uninsured people in Minnesota has plunged to the lowest level in state history.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/get-ready-to-get-covered-321x214.jpg", "title": "Thanks To Obamacare, Minnesota\u2019s Uninsurance Rate Has Dropped 40 Percent", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/get-ready-to-get-covered.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/get-ready-to-get-covered.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-12T09:10:10+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Getting the word out about Obamacare during its highly publicized enrollment period helped educate more people about their health care options.\nThe only state that now has a lower uninsurance rate than Minnesota is Massachusetts, which enacted its own state-level health reform in 2007.\nThis has been tremendously successful and it\u2019s going to get better.\u201dThe new report on Minnesota\u2019s uninsurance rate is the first state-level data of its kind to attempt to assess the immediate impact of the Affordable Care Act.\nUnsurprisingly, the uninsurance rate is falling the fastest in states like Minnesota that have embraced the tenets of health care reform \u2014 including setting up their own state-run marketplaces and expanding their Medicaid programs.\n\u201cA change in the uninsurance rate like this is pretty much unprecedented in Minnesota,\u201d Julie Sonier, a researcher at the University of Minnesota\u2019s State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC) and a co-author of the new report, told the Star Tribune."}
