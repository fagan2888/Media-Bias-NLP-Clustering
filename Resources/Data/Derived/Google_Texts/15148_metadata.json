With that guiding philosophy in mind, retired biotech entrepreneur Bonnie Baskin is out to inspire the next generation of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) leaders through her Hill Country Science Mill. The hands-on science museum in Johnson City, Texas, is geared specifically toward middle-schoolers with an eye on sparking student interest in exploring STEM-based careers.\n\nBaskin\u2019s successful foray into the biotech business world began in 1981, when the single mom who held a Ph.D. in microbiology found herself unable to meet the time demands of family and a university lab job. Not willing to sacrifice family time, she quit her job and eventually founded ViroMed. This mobile virus testing service quickly became one of the country\u2019s leading clinical labs. She sold it 20 years later for $40 million. Not quite finished with the entrepreneurial world, Baskin went on to form AppTec, a testing and medical manufacturing company. She sold that business just six years later for $163 million.\n\nNow retired and living in Johnson City with her husband, Robert P. Elde, a neuroscientist, Baskin has turned her attention toward inspiring the next generation of STEM leaders. To that end, she transformed an abandoned mill into a high-tech laboratory for kids. While other science museums exist, Baskins\u2019 Hill Country Science Mill is cutting edge and designed specifically to target middle-schoolers.\n\nYou Might Also Enjoy: Surprising Cities with Major Markets for STEM Career Opportunities\n\nSince it opened in February 2015, the mill has welcomed more than 23,000 guests. With its use of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics) rather than simply STEM, visitors are dazzled with displays like the \u201cFractalarium,\u201d which features crystals patterned like Romanesco broccoli to illustrate the Fibonacci growth sequence.\n\nWhile kids can get hands-on at the museum, exploring STEM topics and making the \u201cinvisible visible,\u201d the lessons don\u2019t stop after they leave either. Baskin wants to keep visitors engaged in learning by offering teacher support, live chats, follow-up information and summer camps.\n\nThere\u2019s a method to the madness to be sure. Baskin is an outspoken supporter of STEM education. She also has a special place in her heart for aspiring young female entrepreneurs. She\u2019s been quoted in the past as saying a woman has \u201cthe resources and capabilities that almost genetically make her superior to be a CEO.\u201d She also supports women in business by sitting on numerous boards of women-owned or women-run companies.\n\nGet Free Updates!
